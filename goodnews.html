          <p>England winger Jack Grealish has completed a season-long loan move from Manchester City to Everton, becoming the club's sixth summer signing. The 29-year-old cited conversations with manager David Moyes and support from Everton fans as key factors in his decision to move to Hill Dickinson Stadium. Grealish, who fell out of favor at City, hopes the move will help him rejuvenate his career and regain his spot in the England national squad. He will wear the number 18 shirt, inspired by former Everton players Wayne Rooney and Paul Gascoigne.</p>

          <p>For investors seeking stability amid stock market volatility, a $100,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) can offer significant and predictable returns in the current interest rate environment. Depending on the term length, which can range from three months to five years, savers could earn from over one thousand to more than twenty-two thousand dollars in interest. While CD rates are lower than their recent peaks, they remain elevated, providing a secure, fixed-rate investment vehicle.

          <p>AI search startup Perplexity AI has reportedly made an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a figure higher than its own valuation. The company claims to have backing from several investors for the potential deal. This move comes after a U.S. court ruled Google holds an illegal monopoly in internet search, with the Department of Justice proposing the divestment of Chrome as a remedy. Acquiring Chrome would give Perplexity a massive user base and a critical entry point to the internet, intensifying competition in the AI and search market.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key measure of inflation, increased by 2.7% in July compared to the previous year, a rate slightly cooler than the 2.8% forecasted by economists. On a monthly basis, the index rose 0.2%. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose by 3.1% annually, its highest level in five months. Food prices continued to be a source of pressure for consumers, rising 2.9% over the past year. Despite inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe a September interest rate cut is still possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden has won a significant victory in his lawsuit against the NFL and Commissioner Roger Goodell. The Nevada Supreme Court ruled 5-2 that Gruden is not required to enter into the NFL's internal arbitration process, which would have been overseen by Goodell, a defendant in the case. The court determined that the arbitration clause does not apply to Gruden as a former employee. This decision allows his lawsuit, which alleges the NFL orchestrated a campaign to leak his offensive emails and destroy his career, to proceed in state court.</p>

          <p>This article advocates for a management approach centered on employee well-being as a durable strategy for improving business performance, contrasting it with fleeting management fads. Citing research from firms like Irrational Capital, it shows that companies scoring high on employee happiness metrics consistently outperform their peers in stock price. The piece identifies six key drivers of satisfaction, including valuing innovation, clear communication, and fostering friendships among colleagues. It argues that leaders should focus on these human-centric factors rather than treating employees like machines, a practice that ultimately alienates workers and hinders productivity.</p>

          <p>With the interest rate environment potentially shifting, savers are evaluating the best place for their money between money market accounts (MMAs) and high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Both offer higher-than-average, variable interest rates, but MMAs often include check-writing and debit card access. Experts note that while rates can be comparable, MMAs may require higher minimum balances to earn the top APY. HYSAs are often recommended for building emergency funds due to their simplicity and potentially lower entry barriers, while MMAs can be useful for managing large cash reserves with some transactional flexibility.

          <p>Retirees who are required to take minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts but do not need the cash for living expenses have several strategic options. Financial experts suggest that instead of just letting the money sit, it can be put to work to meet other goals. One option is to reinvest the funds in a tax-efficient manner using exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a brokerage account. Another popular strategy is to make a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which satisfies the RMD requirement while avoiding an income tax bill on the withdrawal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United's Swedish striker, Alexander Isak, is reportedly still determined to leave the club and secure a transfer to Liverpool before the summer window closes. This development follows Newcastle's rejection of a £110 million bid from Liverpool for the 25-year-old player earlier in the month. While Liverpool had indicated they might walk away, Isak's continued ambition to join the Premier League champions keeps the possibility of a deal alive. Newcastle's manager has stated that Isak is not currently involved in his plans, suggesting a departure is likely if an agreement can be reached.</p>
