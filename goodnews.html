          <p>China has initiated the construction of the world's first space-based supercomputer by launching twelve satellites equipped with intelligent computing systems and inter-satellite communication links. This "Three-Body Computing Constellation," developed by Zhejiang Lab, aims to provide real-time data processing in orbit, potentially rivaling ground-based supercomputers. Experts suggest that such orbital data centers could leverage solar power and space's heat-radiating properties, reducing energy consumption. This launch signifies a crucial step in testing the networking capabilities required for cloud computing in space.</p>

A study reveals that these women have a significantly lower heart rate during simulated dives compared to their non-diving peers. Genetic analysis indicates that the entire population of Jeju Island may have been genetically shaped by generations of divers. Two genes stood out: one related to cold tolerance and the other associated with blood pressure, potentially protecting them from hypothermia and pregnancy complications.</p>

          <p>Robert Macfarlane's new book, 'Is a River Alive?', explores the question of whether rivers are living beings with memory and intention. Macfarlane takes readers to three countries, each home to threatened rivers, and considers the relationship between humans and these waterways. The book delves into rights of nature discussions and the idea of shifting our thinking to see rivers as "who" rather than "it." Macfarlane's writing is beautiful and thought-provoking, prompting readers to reconsider their relationship with nature.</p>
