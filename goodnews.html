        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's new chancellor, Friedrich Merz, is working to balance relations with a more assertive Russia and pressure from the U.S. for increased NATO contributions. Merz recently activated a German tank brigade in Lithuania as a deterrent against potential Russian aggression, while also advocating for Germany to take a more prominent leadership role within NATO. To modernize its military, Germany is increasing military spending by decoupling it from borrowing limits, aiming to become the strongest conventional military force in Europe. However, the German army faces challenges including dilapidated infrastructure, staff shortages, and insufficient equipment, requiring significant reform and investment. The country is trying to find its footing in a world with growing threats and pressure to increase its military spending, but is taking the initiative in bolstering its own defenses. Optimism is tempered by the challenges and the need for significant reforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kim Jong-un's decision to skip Russia's Victory Day parade indicates a strategic move to balance relations with China and Russia. His absence spared him an awkward alignment with Xi Jinping, who was the "main guest" at the event, and avoided further straining ties with China, which is uneasy about Pyongyang's military alignment with Moscow. Instead, Kim visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, expressing his close friendship with Putin and hailing the alliance between North Korea and Russia. This decision reflects a calculated approach to navigate complex geopolitical relationships.</p>

          <p>A women's golf tournament in Japan was abruptly ended due to a bear sighting on the course, marking the second time in recent weeks that wildlife interfered with a professional golf event. Reina Maeda, leading after the second round, was declared the winner of the Twinfields Ladies tournament. This incident highlights the increasing human-bear encounters in Japan, attributed to climate change affecting food sources and depopulation causing bears to venture into towns. The Japanese government has approved a bill allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas, reflecting growing concerns over human-wildlife conflict.</p>

          <h2>Examining the Unique Value of Manufacturing Jobs in the US Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why politicians prioritize boosting manufacturing in the U.S. economy, questioning whether these jobs are truly special compared to others. It analyzes the "manufacturing premium," the higher wages paid to manufacturing workers, particularly those without a college education. The article cites research indicating that manufacturing jobs offer a 35% pay bump compared to restaurant work, though this varies by subsector. It also discusses factors contributing to the premium, such as unionization, safety risks, and the need for skilled workers to operate expensive machinery. Ultimately, the article suggests that while manufacturing jobs can be valuable, policymakers should also focus on creating good jobs in the service sector.</p>

          <h2>China's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Decline Amid Clean Energy Expansion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 06:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, China's greenhouse gas emissions have decreased even as energy demand increased, largely due to the country's rapid expansion of clean energy sources. China's overall greenhouse gas emissions dropped by 1 percent over the past year, while its energy use and economic activity grew. This shift is a significant development for global climate change efforts, as China is the world's largest single greenhouse gas emitter. The decline in emissions is attributed to increased wind, solar, and nuclear power deployment, and a drop in coal and gas electricity production. However, the article also notes that emissions could rise again if China's economy grows even faster.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring ways to delay or eliminate menopause, prompting discussions about the implications of extending ovarian function and potentially reducing the risk of age-related diseases. While some experts see the potential for improving women's health, others express concerns about the societal pressure to remain young and fertile. Hormone therapy already exists to treat menopausal symptoms, but newer treatments aim to slow down ovarian aging. The article considers the benefits and drawbacks of these approaches, balancing medical advancements with societal attitudes towards aging and women's health.</p>

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans amid trade tensions between the U.S. and China. Simultaneously, iPhone shipments from China to the U.S. fell 76%. While these numbers reflect Apple's adaptability, experts predict this growth will plateau due to manufacturing limitations in India. Furthermore, Washington and Beijing could introduce protectionist measures that curb India's ability to expand iPhone capacity. (not investment advice)</p>
