        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee stated that recent inflation data has introduced a "note of unease," causing him to hesitate on lowering interest rates. While the consumer price index was largely in line with expectations, a surprisingly high producer price index has raised concerns about where inflation is headed, particularly in the services sector. Goolsbee, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, indicated he needs to see more convincing data before the September meeting to feel confident that the economy is still on a "golden path" of moderating inflation and a strong labor market.

The health insurer's stock had been down nearly 50% for the year amid a Justice Department investigation and public backlash over rising healthcare costs. The investment from Buffett, along with sizable stakes revealed by investors Michael Burry and David Tepper, is seen as a major vote of confidence. This news provided a significant boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Average and may signal a turning point for the embattled managed care sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in Intel, a tech analyst has called the potential government intervention "essential" for U.S. national security. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson argued that such a move is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign manufacturers like Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor. The news caused Intel's stock to climb over 4%. The potential deal highlights growing concerns about domestic technological sovereignty, especially with the rise of superintelligent AI, which some leaders have compared to nuclear proliferation in terms of strategic importance.

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," numerous major corporations have launched marketing campaigns centered on the color orange. Swift's recent use of the color and discussion of it on a podcast with Travis Kelce prompted brands from United Airlines to Shake Shack to post orange-themed memes and content on social media. This rapid brand alignment highlights the immense economic and cultural influence Swift commands, with companies eager to associate themselves with her success. The phenomenon demonstrates a powerful example of real-time marketing as businesses tap into the cultural zeitgeist created by the pop superstar.</p>

          <p>Two years after a catastrophic wildfire killed over 100 people and destroyed much of Lahaina, the Maui community is still on a long road to recovery. While the debris has been cleared, only about 50 homes have been rebuilt, and large areas of the historic town remain empty. Mayor Richard Bissen, who faced criticism for the initial emergency response, is now focused on expediting permits and supporting residents through the rebuilding process. Cultural cornerstones like the Old Lahaina Luau have reopened, symbolizing a step toward normalcy and providing crucial employment for staff, many of whom lost everything in the disaster.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has agreed to purchase its rival Hovis in a deal that would create the UK's largest bread producer. Both brands are currently loss-making, and ABF plans to implement significant cost synergies and efficiencies to return the combined business to profitability. The merger, valued at an estimated £75 million, requires approval from the Competition and Markets Authority. The deal comes as traditional pre-packaged bread sales have declined due to changing consumer tastes and a shift towards speciality breads and lower-carbohydrate diets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard and felt across parts of the East and South East of England, including London, Essex, and Cambridgeshire. The Royal Air Force confirmed that three Typhoon fighter jets were launched from RAF Coningsby to intercept a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control. Communications were successfully re-established, and the plane was safely escorted to Stansted Airport. A sonic boom occurs when an aircraft exceeds the speed of sound, creating shockwaves that result in an explosive noise, which in this case startled residents and shook houses across the region.</p>

          <p>At 21 years old, all-rounder Jacob Bethell is set to become the youngest man to captain England in international cricket, leading an understrength T20 side against Ireland in September. With many senior players being rested, the leadership role has been given to Bethell in what is seen as a significant show of faith from England's selectors. This decision comes despite Bethell having limited playing time this summer and no prior senior captaincy experience. The move aims to develop his leadership skills on the international stage, while also giving him match time to regain form ahead of the winter Ashes series.</p>

          <p>The U.S. jewelry market continues to show strong consumer demand, contrasting with weaker sales in Europe and China. Danish jewelry brand Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales, highlighting the American consumer's continued willingness to spend on discretionary items. This trend is occurring despite challenges like potential tariffs, a weakening dollar, and rising silver prices. Other luxury brands like Cartier owner Richemont have also seen a jump in American sales. The sustained spending in the U.S. provides a bright spot for the global jewelry industry amid broader economic uncertainty in other key markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CD) face decisions about their next steps. Financial experts advise against letting the funds automatically roll over into a new CD at a potentially lower rate. Instead, savers should proactively shop around at different banks, especially online institutions, which may offer more competitive rates. It is also a good time to re-evaluate one's budget to determine if a larger amount can be invested in a new, long-term CD to lock in the current, still-elevated rates before they decline further.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Tianjin University in China have developed a new lithium battery with an energy density of over 600 watt-hours per kilogram, more than double that of Tesla's advanced 4680 cells. The team has established a pilot production line for the battery, which, if successfully scaled, could dramatically increase the range of electric vehicles and eliminate "range anxiety" for consumers. According to a paper published in the journal Nature, the new battery has also demonstrated superior thermal and mechanical stability in tests. This breakthrough surpasses Beijing's own goals under its "Made in China 2025" industrial plan.</p>
