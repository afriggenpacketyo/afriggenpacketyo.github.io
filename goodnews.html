        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook expressed concerns about the potential impact of tariffs on inflation, suggesting that recent progress in lowering inflation could be reversed as tariffs take effect. Cook also noted that President Trump's trade policies might negatively affect the labor market, though she acknowledged the economy's current stability. While refraining from commenting on the administration's policies directly, Cook emphasized studying the economic implications, which she believes increase the likelihood of higher inflation and a cooling labor market. She did not specify when the Fed might ease monetary policy, but emphasized the importance of remaining adaptable to economic threats. Optimism is tempered by the uncertainty surrounding trade policy and its potential effects on the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi authorities are implementing advanced technologies, including drones, AI, and facial recognition, to enhance safety and manage crowds during this year's Hajj pilgrimage. The Nusuk website and mobile app will register attendees, while smart wristbands will track pilgrims' health and location. While these measures aim to prevent overcrowding and tragic accidents, concerns are rising about data privacy, state surveillance, and potential cybercrime. Critics argue that mandatory technology, coupled with Saudi Arabia's data protection laws, raises questions about the safety and privacy of pilgrims' personal information. The increasing reliance on technology also raises concerns about whether the spiritual essence of the Hajj is being overshadowed by a "cyber experience."</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering moving Greenland from the jurisdiction of U.S. European Command to U.S. Northern Command. This move is seen as a symbolic gesture, suggesting that the U.S. views Greenland as more integral to its own defense rather than Europe's. Top Trump officials, including Vice President JD Vance, have reportedly encouraged Greenland to separate from Denmark and align with the U.S. for security purposes. President Trump has also expressed interest in acquiring Greenland due to its strategic location and rare earth minerals. However, most Greenlanders reportedly do not support joining the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional idea of a midlife crisis, involving drastic changes like buying a sports car or leaving family, doesn't resonate with many millennials entering their 40s. Millennials, often facing financial instability and valuing mental health, are experiencing midlife as a progress report rather than a sudden implosion. For many, it's about seeking opportunities for personal growth, such as fitness journeys or career changes, rather than abandoning their existing lives. This generation is redefining midlife, focusing on self-discovery and adapting to the unique challenges they face, including economic uncertainties and societal shifts. The emphasis is on acknowledging where they are in life and proactively planning for the future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this "Dear James" advice column, a middle-aged reader laments not feeling "punk rock" despite harboring nihilistic views about the world. James Parker responds by asserting that the reader's cynicism is, in fact, a form of punk rock and encourages them to use their "world-withering vision" as a stimulant rather than a philosophical dead end. He advises the reader to channel their disgust into refining their language and engaging with the world in a meaningful way. Parker recommends the band Godflesh as a fitting musical accompaniment to this worldview.</p>

          <p>Following public concern and backlash, the National Weather Service is hiring over 100 employees to stabilize operations at its field offices after cuts ordered by the Trump administration earlier this year. The new hires will fill critical positions such as meteorologists, hydrologists, and electronic technicians, with the latter being essential for maintaining weather radar installations. Some field offices had previously reduced hours and weather balloon launches due to staff shortages. The announcement is seen as an acknowledgment that the previous job cuts went too far, particularly during severe weather and hurricane seasons.</p>

The third myth is that it will be easy to make friends, but one may struggle to connect in rural areas and it is important to build a support network.

          <p>Chin Chin, a celebrity haunt known for its Chinese chicken salad, is closing its first location in West Hollywood's Sunset Plaza this summer after nearly a half-century of operation. The restaurant's lease was not renewed by the building's landlord, prompting the closure of the Sunset Strip location. Other Chin Chin locations in Studio City, Brentwood, and Las Vegas will remain open. The restaurant, which helped popularize Chinese American cuisine in Los Angeles, has amassed a legion of notable fans over the years.</p>

          <p>Antonio McDowell has been exonerated after serving 28 years in prison for a wrongful conviction linked to disgraced former Chicago Police Detective Reynaldo Guevara. McDowell was sentenced to 103 years in prison after being framed for murder by Guevara. McDowell's lawyers stated that he was wrongfully convicted after refusing to falsely identify Guevara's chosen suspect in a shooting. The decision marks the 51st exoneration in a case investigated by Guevara, who has been accused of coercing false confessions.</p>
