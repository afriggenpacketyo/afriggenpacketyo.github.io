          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, concluding a 24-year career in the nation's space program. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, deployed a government satellite for monitoring greenhouse gases before its retirement. This series, which had a 98% success rate, is being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. The new H3 is intended to make Japan more competitive in the global satellite-launch market, which is currently dominated by companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered faint, ancient radio signals originating from a distant galaxy cluster known as SpARCS1049, which took 10 billion years to reach Earth. The signals emanate from a "mini-halo," a vast cloud of high-energy particles and magnetic fields, which has never been observed at such a great distance before. This finding suggests that the energetic processes shaping the universe, such as supermassive black holes or cosmic particle collisions, were active much earlier than previously thought. The discovery opens a new window into the evolution of galaxy clusters in the early universe.</p>

However, he highlighted the success of Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors using far fewer resources.

This prevented concerns about rising inflation and a slowdown in corporate earnings or consumer spending. Additionally, growing investor expectation of three Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year further bolstered market sentiment and drove the major indices to new heights.

          <p>The recently concluded Supreme Court term was marked by a series of significant, though not blockbuster, victories for conservative states and President Trump's claims of executive power. The court's 6-3 conservative majority sided with Republican-led states on issues like restricting transgender medical treatments and denying Medicaid funds to Planned Parenthood. Concurrently, the court reined in the power of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions, a procedural win for the Trump administration. This term reflects a states-rights style of conservatism and a judiciary increasingly deferential to presidential authority.</p>

          <p>New genetic research from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by women over 9,000 years ago. By analyzing DNA from more than 130 skeletons, researchers found that family connections within households were primarily traced through the female line. The evidence indicates that husbands likely relocated to their wife's household after marriage and that grave goods were offered preferentially to females. This discovery challenges the common Western assumption of patrilineal societal structures and points to a system where identity and rights were passed through the mother.</p>
