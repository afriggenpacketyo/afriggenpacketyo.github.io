          <p>An opinion piece discusses China's efforts to attract international visitors after a sharp drop in tourism following the COVID-19 pandemic. China has implemented measures such as a 30-day visa-free entry scheme for citizens of several European countries and streamlined visa applications for US and UK citizens. The author recounts their experience traveling to China, noting minimal questioning upon arrival and a change in the overall atmosphere. The author sought to experience this new "opening up" firsthand amid reports of increasing authoritarianism. The author's experience shows a potential for positive change, thus the optimism.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert identifies "You should step it up" as the number one phrase dads hate hearing on Father's Day. The expert, Charles C. Daniels Jr., emphasizes the importance of acknowledging fathers, especially those facing challenges like divorce, incarceration, or mental health issues. He suggests offering support and understanding instead of judgment. Daniels highlights that no father dreams of being away from their child and that parenting is a team sport, emphasizing the need for support systems. The article promotes empathy and support for fathers, which is generally optimistic.</p>

          <p>The German government has increased protection for Jewish and Israeli institutions across the country in response to escalating tensions in the Middle East. Chancellor Friedrich Merz spoke with Israel's Prime Minister and convened Germany's security cabinet. Berlin reaffirmed Israel's right to self-defense but urged both sides to avoid escalation. Simultaneously, economic indicators suggest Germany's economy is showing tentative signs of recovery. The security measures show solidarity.</p>

          <p>A group of Nobel laureates, scientists, writers, and artists issued an open letter warning of the resurgence of fascism in various forms globally. They highlight attacks on democratic norms, rising nationalism, and assaults on human rights. The letter calls for the defense of democratic institutions, collective action against abuses, and the upholding of facts and evidence. The authors urge resistance against authoritarianism and a renewed commitment to democratic principles. The letter shows some potential for humanism.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Doubt Iran Will Block Strait of Hormuz Despite Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 07:55:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait is a vital oil artery, but disrupting it would likely trigger further retaliation and harm Iran's largest oil customer, China. Some analysts argue that physically closing the strait is impossible, and any disruption could be more detrimental than beneficial for Tehran. While attacks on tankers or mining the strait are possible, a full-scale blockade is considered unlikely. The economic implications are generally positive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Canada for the G7 summit presents an opportunity to reset strained ties, and he was invited by his Canadian counterpart, Mark Carney, to attend the Group of Seven (G7) leaders' summit, from June 15 to 17, in Kananaskis, Alberta. Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since Canada accused agents linked to the Indian government of carrying out the assassination of 45-year-old naturalized Canadian citizen Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Despite the unsolved investigation and concerns about Sikh activism, both sides appear to be making efforts to repair ties, focusing on economic cooperation and shared priorities. The potential for improved relations is optimistic.</p>

          <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland's first black professor, has died at the age of 85, and he became known as both an academic and a human rights advocate. Sir Geoff moved to the UK from Jamaica as a teenager and became known as both an academic and a human rights advocate. Sir Geoff's academic work saw him invent the barley abrasion process - which involves deliberately damaging the protective husk of grains to speed up the process of malting. His efforts won him the American Society of Brewing Chemists Award of Distinction. His legacy of human rights promotion is notable.</p>
