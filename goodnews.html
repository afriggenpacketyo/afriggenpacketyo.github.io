          <p>Tesla's board is asking shareholders to approve a new, decade-long compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, contingent on the company achieving exceptionally ambitious market capitalization and operational goals. The proposed package involves over 423 million additional shares and would significantly increase Musk's voting power, a condition he has publicly sought. This move comes after a Delaware court invalidated his previous 2018 pay plan, a decision currently under appeal by the company. Investors will also vote on a proposal for Tesla to invest in Musk's artificial intelligence venture, xAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A French couple who illegally kept a black panther named Louise in their apartment has been handed suspended jail sentences and fines. The case gained notoriety in 2019 when the young feline escaped onto the rooftops of their building in Armentieres, prompting a large-scale police and rescue operation. The owners claimed they viewed the animal as a "big, affectionate baby," having purchased her from a traveling community. Despite their affection, the court found them guilty of illegally keeping a wild animal, with the man also barred from owning animals for five years. The panther now resides safely in a big cat sanctuary.</p>

          <p>Retail sales volumes in the United Kingdom experienced a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing analyst expectations, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The boost in consumer spending was largely attributed to sunny weather and the excitement surrounding the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 football tournament. Online retailers, along with clothing and footwear stores, reported particularly strong sales growth during the month. The release of this data was delayed due to concerns over statistical quality, for which the ONS issued an apology and has since revised its figures for the past year to correct for errors.</p>

          <p>The Dearborn Heights Police Department in Michigan has introduced a new, optional uniform patch that features the words "POLICE" and "DEARBORN HEIGHTS" in both English and Arabic. According to the department, the patch was designed by an officer to honor the community's diversity, particularly its large population of Arabic descent. The announcement described the patch as a symbol of unity, respect, and a shared commitment to service. The move drew some criticism online, including from a Florida state representative who suggested it was a step toward Sharia law, a comment made without acknowledging the patch's optional nature.</p>

          <p>Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, a close associate of President Vladimir Putin, has asserted that China's vision of a multipolar world order is contingent on the rapid development of a yuan-based international payment and debt system. Speaking in Beijing, Deripaska suggested that Moscow is frustrated by the caution of Chinese banks, which he described as being overly dependent on dollar assets and hesitant to take risks. He argued that for the yuan to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar, China must accelerate efforts to expand its 'panda bond' market into a truly global debt market to support its international trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new, rigorous study has found that a single dose of LSD can provide significant and lasting relief from anxiety and depression for several months. The research involved 198 adults with generalized anxiety disorder, where participants receiving higher doses of 100 or 200 micrograms showed rapid and sustained improvement compared to a placebo group. The study, which tested a proprietary form of LSD called MM120, has been granted "breakthrough therapy" status by the FDA to expedite its evaluation. While some scientists note the study's safety and tolerability, they also question the lack of detail on non-drug factors like therapeutic environment.</p>

          <p>A new remote-controlled vehicle known as the 'BurnBot' is being demonstrated in Southern California as a high-tech weapon against wildfires. The machine, which resembles a large tank, functions like a 'Roomba for the forest' by using contained fire to incinerate flammable brush with high precision, leaving behind a charred firebreak. This method allows for controlled burns even on hot, dry days near homes and highways without the risks or disruptions of traditional prescribed burns. Wildfire officials are observing the technology as a potential solution to reduce human-caused ignitions and create strategic fuel breaks in fire-prone areas.</p>

          <p>Despite over 60 percent of eligible U.S. adults being registered organ donors, a significant shortage persists, with over 100,000 people on transplant waiting lists. A key bottleneck for after-death donations is medical, as only about three in 1,000 people die in circumstances that keep organs viable for transplant. For living donations, psychological and practical barriers are significant; while many support the idea, few donate to strangers due to the abstract nature of the need and practical costs like lost wages. The article suggests that overcoming these hurdles requires addressing medical mistrust, simplifying the process, and potentially offering financial incentives.</p>

          <p>The world's largest iceberg, known as A23a, is rapidly disintegrating as it drifts into the warmer waters of the South Atlantic Ocean. Scientists report that the nearly 40-year-old iceberg, which originally broke off from Antarctica in 1986, is breaking into very large chunks and will soon be too small to track via satellite. After being grounded on the seafloor for decades, A23a began its final journey in late 2023. Its demise is considered part of a normal iceberg life cycle and not directly linked to climate change, providing scientists a valuable opportunity to study its environmental impact.</p>
