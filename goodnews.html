The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed. The move follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough and calls from MPs to ban bottom trawling in Marine Protected Areas, aligning with global efforts to protect ocean ecosystems.</p>

          <p>A new Boeing 737 MAX has landed back in China, signaling a potential resumption of deliveries to Chinese customers as the trade war between Beijing and Washington eases. Boeing had halted deliveries of new planes to China in April due to escalating tariffs. The plane, painted in Xiamen Airlines livery, landed at Boeing's Zhoushan completion center after a journey from Seattle. The resumption of deliveries suggests a thawing of trade tensions between the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>
