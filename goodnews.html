          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty and will pay $511 million for conspiring to help wealthy American taxpayers hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts. The Department of Justice stated that Credit Suisse AG Singapore held undeclared accounts for U.S. persons with over $2 billion in assets between 2014 and 2023. This criminal conspiracy allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations from 2010 through 2021, breaching a 2014 plea agreement where Credit Suisse paid $2.6 billion for similar offenses. The firm falsified bank records to conceal U.S. ownership and control of accounts, processing fictitious paperwork and maintaining accounts for undeclared clients.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration announced it would cut off all new federal research grants to Harvard University, citing what it views as the school's "systemic pattern of violating federal law." Education Secretary Linda McMahon accused Harvard of ignoring antisemitism, engaging in discrimination, abandoning academic rigor, and disastrous mismanagement. The letter informs Harvard that it should no longer seek grants from the federal government, since none will be provided. This action does not affect federal student loan funding and Pell Grants. Harvard filed a lawsuit last month after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts.</p>

While cardinals are officially banned from commenting, reporters are trying to uncover potential successors. The process aims to be guided by the Holy Spirit, but the election's outcome will have global implications, influencing everything from conflict resolution to sexual politics.

          <p>The Trump administration is offering a $1,000 cash stipend and a flight home to undocumented immigrants who willingly leave the United States as part of an effort to increase deportations. The policy aims to persuade immigrants to deport themselves, helping the president meet immigration promises. The money will be paid after migrants confirm their travel home through a government app. Officials claim the program will save money by avoiding the costs of arrest, detention, and government-chartered flights. The administration announced it had deported around 140,000 migrants since January.</p>

The lawsuit seeks to reverse regulatory changes made by the FDA that expanded access to mifepristone, including telemedicine prescriptions and mail delivery.

          <p>OpenAI, the parent of ChatGPT, has announced a new governance plan to remain under the control of its non-profit board, while becoming a public benefit corporation. The move comes after scrutiny of the startup's mission to create technology for the benefit of humanity. CEO Sam Altman said the non-profit will receive a stake in OpenAI's business arm, providing funds for its goals. The new plan will allow the organization to stop operating under its current complex governance structure, which had capped its profits.</p>
