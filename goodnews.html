          <p>Indiana Fever coach Stephanie White stated that Caitlin Clark's participation in the upcoming WNBA All-Star Game is uncertain following a groin injury. The team is prioritizing her long-term health and taking a cautious, day-to-day approach to her recovery. This injury is the latest in a series of physical issues for Clark, and the team has been slow in her return to play to ensure she is fully ready. The decision on her availability for the All-Star events, which she is slated to captain, has not yet been made, as the focus remains on her overall well-being.</p>

          <h2>Tsunami Advisory Canceled in Alaska Following 7.2 Magnitude Earthquake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 19:31:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A tsunami advisory for southern Alaska was canceled after a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck off the coast, initially prompting a more severe tsunami warning. The quake, which occurred about 50 miles south of Sand Point, led to precautionary evacuations in coastal towns like Seward. Officials later downgraded the alert, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected because the event happened in shallow water. The region, located along the seismically active "Ring of Fire," experienced several aftershocks but no major damage or inundation was reported, and the threat to populated areas like Anchorage was nonexistent.</p>

          <p>Fox News Media has signed a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast "Ruthless," signaling a broader trend of traditional media outlets partnering with digital creators to engage online audiences. This move aims to expand Fox's digital footprint, particularly among younger male demographics who are less engaged with traditional television. The deal allows "Ruthless" to maintain editorial control while gaining exposure on Fox's platforms, with its hosts also becoming network contributors. This strategy mirrors similar moves by companies like ESPN and reflects a recognition of the growing influence of podcasters and YouTubers in the media landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Coca-Cola has agreed to switch from high-fructose corn syrup to cane sugar for its products sold in the United States, a move he personally advocated for. However, the company has not officially confirmed this change. In a statement, Coca-Cola acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and promised more details on new offerings soon, but stopped short of verifying the recipe tweak. A potential switch could be a blow to American corn farmers but would align U.S. Coke with versions sold in other countries, which many consumers prefer.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry walked through a de-mined area in Angola, continuing the advocacy work of his late mother, Princess Diana, who famously visited a minefield there in 1997. Working with the HALO Trust, the same organization Diana supported, the Duke of Sussex highlighted the ongoing danger of landmines left from Angola's 27-year civil war. He spoke with local families and emphasized that the remnants of war still threaten lives daily, particularly children. This visit marks another step in his commitment to the cause, which his mother helped bring to global attention, leading to an international ban treaty on landmines.</p>

          <p>Germany has agreed to pass new legislation by the end of the year to crack down on gangs smuggling migrants across the English Channel to the United Kingdom. The commitment is part of a new UK-Germany agreement on migration and defense. The new law will make it illegal in Germany to facilitate illegal migration to a non-EU country like the UK, which is not currently a crime. This change will empower German authorities to target warehouses and storage facilities used by smugglers to hide small boats, addressing a key link in the cross-Channel smuggling supply chain.</p>

          <p>United Airlines beat second-quarter earnings estimates and reinstated its full-year profit forecast, with CEO Scott Kirby stating that the "world is less uncertain" and travel demand is strengthening. After a weaker-than-expected start to the year, the airline now projects adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share for 2025. While domestic unit revenue fell, premium cabin sales remained strong, up 5.6% from last year, indicating customers are still willing to pay for comfort. The optimistic outlook suggests a stabilizing travel market, though the airline noted operational constraints at its Newark hub impacted margins. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A landmark British study has demonstrated that creating embryos with DNA from three people can successfully prevent rare and devastating mitochondrial diseases. Researchers at Newcastle University used the technique, known as mitochondrial donation, to help families have eight healthy children who are now free from the incurable genetic disorders that plagued their families for generations. The method involves transferring the nuclear DNA from the parents' fertilized egg into a donor egg with healthy mitochondria. While the results are hailed as a major breakthrough, the technique remains controversial, with critics raising ethical concerns about genetic manipulation and "designer babies."</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump stated that China is making significant progress in its efforts to control the flow of illicit fentanyl into the United States. This positive assessment marks a sharp contrast to his previous rhetoric, where he has frequently used the fentanyl crisis as a justification for imposing tariffs on Chinese imports. Trump's comments were made as he signed the HALT Fentanyl Act into law, which permanently classifies fentanyl-related substances as Schedule I drugs. The shift in tone comes amid ongoing high-level trade negotiations between the two countries, suggesting a potential area of cooperation amidst broader economic disputes.</p>
