          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's pursuit of AI talent continues with plans to hire Daniel Gross, CEO of Safe Superintelligence, and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, after an unsuccessful attempt to acquire Sutskever's $32 billion AI startup. Gross and Friedman will join Meta, contributing to AI product development under Alexandr Wang, while Meta gains a stake in NFDG, their venture capital firm. Zuckerberg's aggressive recruitment tactics highlight the intense competition for AI expertise among major tech companies like Meta, Google, and OpenAI, all vying to develop advanced language models and achieve artificial general intelligence. This move follows Meta's $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI to secure Wang and other top engineers, escalating the AI talent war and underscoring the strategic importance of AI development in the tech industry. The company aims to bolster its AI capabilities with these strategic hires.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erick, initially a Category 3 hurricane, weakened to a tropical storm after making landfall in Mexico's southern state of Oaxaca. Despite the downgrade, officials warned of continued dangers from intense rains, predicting life-threatening flooding and mudslides, particularly in areas with steep terrain. President Claudia Sheinbaum reported that while there were no immediate reports of deaths, some damage occurred, including flooded streets and damaged boats and buildings in Oaxaca. The state-owned utility company CFE reported power outages affecting over 123,000 users in Oaxaca, with service partially restored by late morning, while Oaxaca Governor Salomon Jara noted significant damage to roads and highways. Residents have begun cleaning up debris, and authorities remain vigilant about the risk of further flooding.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate rose to 3.7% in May, the highest since January 2023, increasing pressure on the Bank of Japan (BOJ) to raise rates. This figure exceeded economists' expectations and surpassed April's reading of 3.5%, marking the 38th consecutive month that inflation has exceeded the BOJ's 2% target. The BOJ held rates at 0.5% after its recent monetary policy meeting but indicated that wage increases are being passed on to selling prices, supporting core inflation. While Governor Kazuo Ueda suggested further rate hikes once there is more confidence in underlying inflation approaching 2%, the bank forecasts a potential weakening of inflation due to an economic slowdown.

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, potentially triggered by the rupture of a high-pressure nitrogen tank. The explosion occurred during the final stages of a countdown for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines, resulting in a large fireball and debris. SpaceX is investigating the incident, with preliminary data suggesting a failure in a nitrogen COPV below its proof pressure, a design that has not previously failed. Despite the setback, NASA continues to support SpaceX, stating that testing is critical and expressing confidence in the company's ability to fix the issue and deliver the Starship Human Landing System for the Artemis 3 mission.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from requiring 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The judge granted an injunction, stating the states were likely to succeed on their claims that the policy was unlawful. The states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding appropriated by Congress. This ruling is the latest in a series of legal challenges to the Trump administration's efforts to withhold federal funds from sanctuary jurisdictions that limit cooperation with immigration enforcement.</p>
