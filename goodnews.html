          <p>Hull KR achieved a landmark victory by defeating the Wigan Warriors 24-6 in the Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford, becoming only the fifth team to win the title. This triumph completed a historic treble for the Robins, who had already secured the Challenge Cup and the League Leaders' Shield in the 2025 season. A decisive moment came when Wigan's Brad O'Neill received a yellow card, allowing Hull KR to score two crucial tries while their opponents were a player down. The win marks Hull KR's first league championship since 1984, capping a remarkable season under coach Willie Peters.</p>

Moorish-Gallagher, whom Gallagher first met in 2018, announced the news on Instagram with photos of her newborn. She was raised by her mother, singer Lisa Moorish, and her partner is professional footballer Nathaniel Phillips. This personal milestone for the 53-year-old musician comes as his recently reunited band, Oasis, has been playing a series of sold-out shows on their Live '25 tour, which has seen massive global demand for tickets.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team maintained their undefeated streak in the World Cup with a decisive 89-run victory over Sri Lanka in Colombo. Captain Nat Sciver-Brunt was instrumental, scoring a brilliant 117 runs after being dropped early in her innings, guiding England to a total of 253-9. In response, Sri Lanka's batting lineup struggled against a formidable English bowling attack, particularly Sophie Ecclestone, who took four wickets for just 17 runs. The win places England at the top of the tournament table as they prepare for their next match against Pakistan.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five British army horses that bolted and ran through central London last year, has been officially retired due to his injuries. The 15-year-old horse suffered a broken bone and significant bleeding after being spooked by construction noise during a morning exercise in April 2024. The incident drew widespread attention as the frightened animals, some visibly bleeding, galloped for miles through city streets. The Ministry of Defense confirmed that Quaker was unable to return to his ceremonial duties and will now live at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire.</p>

          <p>A'ja Wilson has concluded a historic season by leading the Las Vegas Aces to their third WNBA championship in four years, solidifying her case as one of the greatest players in the league's history. The 29-year-old achieved an unprecedented quadrafecta, winning the scoring title, Most Valuable Player, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP all in the same season. The Aces' journey to the title was challenging, overcoming a mid-season slump with a 14-14 record before a pivotal team meeting sparked a 16-game winning streak. Wilson's leadership and dominant performance on both ends of the court were the driving force behind the team's remarkable turnaround.</p>

          <p>Members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) have officially backed First Minister John Swinney's strategy to seek a mandate for a second independence referendum if the party secures a majority of seats in the 2026 Holyrood election. During the party's conference in Aberdeen, Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path forward, based on the precedent that led to the 2014 referendum. An alternative proposal to treat the election as a de-facto referendum was rejected in favor of Swinney's plan. The strategy still faces a significant hurdle, as UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he would not approve another referendum.</p>

          <p>A growing number of younger consumers, particularly from Gen Z, are consciously turning away from "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced items not built to last—in favor of secondhand and antique pieces. This trend is driven by an increased awareness of the environmental impact of disposable goods, as well as a desire for unique items with history and character. The article highlights that millions of tons of furniture end up in landfills annually, often because they are difficult to recycle. By seeking out used items, these consumers are pushing back against a culture of disposability and finding personal value in repairing and preserving older furnishings.</p>

As the mayor of Foumban and leader of the Democratic Union for Cameroon (UDC) party, Ndam Njoya is campaigning on a platform of "Freedom. Justice. Progress." to lead the nation into a new era. Despite facing a divided opposition and a deeply entrenched incumbent, she has gained the endorsement of a dozen former presidential candidates.

          <p>Former U.S. President Joe Biden, who will turn 83 next month, is currently undergoing radiation and hormone therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. A spokesperson confirmed the treatment plan on Saturday, following a diagnosis in May that revealed the cancer had metastasized to the bone. In September, Biden had a separate procedure to successfully remove cancerous cells from his skin, which did not require further treatment. His office had previously stated that the prostate cancer appears to be hormone-sensitive, which generally allows for more effective management and response to therapy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recently brokered peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which could end the war in Gaza, is being largely attributed to the influence of U.S. President Donald Trump. According to panelists on "Washington Week With The Atlantic," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has built his career on understanding American politics, recognized his fundamental need for U.S. support. As American public opinion on the conflict has shifted, pressure from President Trump was a critical factor in bringing the Israeli government to the negotiating table. The analysis suggests that Trump's direct involvement was the key turning point that made the potential breakthrough possible.</p>
