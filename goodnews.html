          <p>Despite leading all players in fan voting for the WNBA All-Star Game, Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was ranked only ninth-best among guards by her fellow players. The voting process combines input from fans (50%), media, and players, with Clark's high fan support securing her a spot as a team captain. The lower ranking from her peers may be influenced by her having missed several games this season due to injury and recent struggles with her shooting performance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article from The Motley Fool posits that Nvidia, not Tesla or Alphabet, is currently the best stock for investing in the autonomous vehicle market. The argument centers on Nvidia's end-to-end AI platform, which provides essential technology for training self-driving models and powering in-vehicle computers. Unlike many competitors still in the development phase, Nvidia is already profiting from this sector, as nearly every automaker developing autonomous technology reportedly uses its systems, giving it a significant market lead.

Cramer believes the market is currently dominated by the power of individual company stories and "animal spirits," rather than a focus on Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>
