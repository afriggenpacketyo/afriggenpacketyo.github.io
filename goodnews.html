          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its Granite City, Illinois, plant, which would have affected nearly 800 workers. This marks the first use of the "golden share" rights secured by the White House as a condition of Nippon Steel's $14.1 billion takeover of the company. These rights grant the government veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the CEO against the closure, U.S. Steel reversed its decision, ensuring the facility will remain operational and continue production.

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after a highly unusual qualifying session that was interrupted by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, was marked by numerous crashes, including from McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final segment. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, with Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in a surprising third place. The chaotic conditions and light rain shuffled the grid, with championship contender Lando Norris starting ninth and Lewis Hamilton failing to advance to the top-10 shootout.</p>

          <p>Despite Warren Buffett's well-known skepticism of Bitcoin, one of his self-proclaimed adherents is leading a significant push into the cryptocurrency space. Mark Casey, a portfolio manager at the 94-year-old mutual fund giant Capital Group, has guided the firm's investment of roughly $1 billion into Bitcoin-related stocks like MicroStrategy and miner MARA Holdings. Casey and his colleagues reportedly believe Bitcoin has the potential to overtake gold as a primary store of value. Their strategy involves gaining exposure to the digital asset through publicly traded companies that hold large amounts of Bitcoin on their balance sheets. (not investment advice)</p>

John Saunby, whose property was damaged in the storm, has been salvaging materials from the widespread debris to construct a new, unique home for himself and his partner. Instead of letting items like porch posts and floorboards go to a landfill, he has repurposed them into his dream house, which features Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports. The project showcases a creative and sustainable approach to rebuilding in the wake of a natural disaster.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses have secured their spot in a seventh consecutive Women's Rugby World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries upon her return from a concussion. While England established an early lead, a determined French side kept the contest close, trailing by only two points at halftime. However, England's forward dominance, particularly their powerful driving maul, proved decisive in the second half, allowing them to pull away and set up a final showdown against Canada at a sold-out Twickenham's Allianz Stadium.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old from Atlanta, has found a starkly different cost of living after moving to the Chiba Prefecture in Japan to teach English. She rents a one-bedroom apartment with a balcony for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 per month, a fraction of what comparable housing would cost in a U.S. city. Dissatisfied with the school system and salary in Georgia, she sought a change and has embraced life in the Japanese countryside. Her story, which she documents on social media, highlights the appeal of living abroad for young Americans seeking cultural experiences and financial relief.</p>

          <h2>New Three-Drum Washing Machines Aim to Revolutionize Laundry Day</h2>

          <p>Several appliance brands, including Haier, Hisense, and Xiaomi, are introducing a new washing machine design featuring three separate drums to address the chore of running multiple laundry cycles. The design typically includes one large central drum and two smaller drums above it, allowing users to wash a main load while simultaneously running smaller, separate cycles for items like delicates or baby clothes. While this innovation promises greater convenience and efficiency, these machines are not yet widely available. Consumers can find a similar, though less expansive, feature in dual-drum models currently offered by brands like LG and Samsung.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market saw a strong week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq hitting multiple all-time highs. The rally was primarily driven by the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point, with signals that more cuts could come in 2025. In other market news, Nvidia announced a major partnership with Intel, which includes a $5 billion stock purchase, to collaborate on AI systems for data centers. Meanwhile, Apple launched its new iPhone 17 models, including the new iPhone Air, to strong initial demand and a price target increase from JPMorgan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have safely returned to the United Kingdom after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived and run a charitable training program in the country for almost two decades. They were released following negotiations brokered by Qatar and were reunited with their daughter in Doha before flying to London. The Taliban claimed the couple had broken Afghan laws but never publicly disclosed the specific reason for their detention, which their family said occurred under harrowing conditions.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being the center of a 1990s political scandal to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that after realizing she could not escape her past, she decided to become a "poster child for having survived shame" to help others. Lewinsky noted the cultural shift since the '90s, with younger generations and the #MeToo movement bringing a new perspective and language to issues of power abuse. She now focuses on helping others tell their stories through projects like her podcast, emphasizing that one can insist on a different ending to their story.</p>

          <p>A nearly two-hour phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has been described by both sides as productive and constructive, raising hopes for increased stability in bilateral relations. During the call, they discussed trade issues and a deal regarding TikTok. President Trump announced plans for the two leaders to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea and for him to visit China early next year. Despite the positive tone, analysts caution that significant friction points remain, including tensions in the Taiwan Strait and potential U.S. tariffs over China's trade with Russia.</p>
