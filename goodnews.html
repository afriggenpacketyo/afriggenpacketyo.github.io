          <p>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) refuted President Trump's executive order to cease direct funding to NPR and PBS, asserting that Congress, not the president, controls its funding. CPB President Patricia Harrison emphasized the corporation's independence from the federal government, as mandated by Congress. PBS President Paula Kerger warned that defunding would disproportionately affect rural communities reliant on public broadcasting for essential services, including children's programming and emergency alerts. The executive order claims NPR and PBS promote partisanship and left-wing propaganda.</p>

          <p>China has enacted the Private Economy Promotion Law to strengthen its private sector, effective May 20. This law aims to provide legal recourse for private firms, particularly against local governments, and protect them from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers are closely watching its implementation to assess its effectiveness, especially in curbing administrative powers and ensuring fair adjudication of cases. The law forbids administrative intervention in economic disputes and aims to revitalize the non-state economy.</p>
