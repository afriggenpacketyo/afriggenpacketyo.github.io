          <p>The Tokyo government has initiated a project to redevelop a two-kilometer expressway encircling the Ginza shopping district into an elevated greenway for pedestrians by the 2040s. Known as the Tokyo Sky Corridor, the walkway will replace the Tokyo Expressway, or "KK Line," and is modeled after New York City's High Line. The project aims to create a tourist attraction with trees, flowers, benches, public bathrooms, rest areas, and event spaces, with cafes and food trucks planned. However, challenges remain, including addressing summer heat and ensuring the structure can support the weight of soil and plant life, with costs expected to reach 14 billion yen ($97 million).</p>

          <p>Senator Ruben Gallego of Arizona encouraged the Democratic party to return to its roots as the "big tent" party, at a town hall in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. Gallego cited podcast host Joe Rogan as an example of someone who was "kicked out" of the tent because his message did not completely align with the party's. He emphasized the need for alliances with people they may not agree with 100% of the time, drawing on his own success in Arizona, where there are more registered Republicans than Democrats. Gallego also highlighted the importance of empathizing with voters and addressing their concerns about the economy.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced caution regarding a consumption tax cut as a measure to combat inflation, citing concerns about its potential impact on state finances. He suggested exploring alternative methods to support those in need. This statement comes amidst debate between government officials and members of the Liberal Democratic Party and Komeito party, some of whom support a consumption tax cut ahead of the upcoming House of Councillors election. Ishiba also addressed tariff negotiations with the United States, stating his government will continue to pursue the complete elimination of additional duties on Japanese exports.</p>

          <p>As China seeks to diversify its food import sources amid global uncertainties, its Southeast Asian neighbors are becoming increasingly viable suppliers, with Yunnan province playing a crucial role in regional agricultural cooperation. The province's involvement dates back to the "alternative crop cultivation programme," which aimed to reduce opium production in the region by sharing agricultural technology and promoting sustainable economic alternatives. Experts say that overseas agricultural investment and cooperation could serve as an effective way to support China's food security by utilizing the land resources of neighboring countries, as living standards have risen and Chinese food consumption patterns have changed significantly.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are experiencing renewed growth in China by focusing on expanding into lower-tier cities, as coffee chains in China grapple with sluggish consumption and intense competition. Starbucks' China operations saw flat same-store sales but a 4% increase in transactions, while adding hundreds of new stores in China. This expansion strategy reflects a shift towards reaching a broader customer base beyond wealthier urban centers. According to Canyan.com, a food and beverage data provider, a significant portion of new coffee shop openings in China are concentrated in second and ‚Äúnew first-tier cities‚Äù.</p>

          <p>Despite Japan's gradual shift towards a cashless society, app-based digital salary payments are failing to gain popularity, with only a small percentage of workers opting for this method. While over 100 companies now offer PayPay as a salary payment option, only 2.8% of surveyed individuals use such apps. Experts suggest that the lack of perceived benefits and limited availability to part-time workers are hindering adoption.

Self-empowering songs in a minor key tend to resonate with audiences, though some acts are attempting to buck this trend. Staging should be memorable without being overly complex, and should embrace the LGBT community.

          <p>After being released from federal custody, Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, expressed joy and gratitude while maintaining her faith in American democracy. Ozturk, who was detained for six weeks, had her visa canceled after writing an opinion piece criticizing the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. She thanked her supporters and expressed concern for other immigrants still in detention. Supporters and former professors were elated at her release, with Representative Ayanna Pressley vowing to continue fighting for her full exoneration and restoration of her visa.</p>

          <p>Five fishermen, three Peruvians and two Colombians, arrived in the Galapagos Islands after surviving 55 days adrift at sea. The fishermen were rescued by an Ecuadorian tuna boat after their boat's alternator malfunctioned, disabling their communication and navigation tools. To survive, they drank rain and seawater, and parboiled passing fish. They are reported to be in stable condition and are coordinating with local and foreign authorities for their return home.</p>

          <h2>Trump Claims 'Total Reset' in Tariff Talks with China, but Details Remain Scarce</h2>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials met in Switzerland for trade talks aimed at de-escalating tensions, with President Trump claiming "great progress" and a "total reset" was negotiated. While the specifics of the talks remain unclear, Trump suggested a willingness to "open up China to American business." However, initial discussions were likely focused on de-escalation rather than a comprehensive trade deal. The talks come after months of escalating tariffs between the two countries, which have disrupted global trade.</p>
