Harris believes artistic expression can shape conversations about society's current state and future direction. She wore an Off-White gown designed by IB Kamara, embracing the gala's theme, "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style."

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to aid the entertainment industry after President Trump called for tariffs on movies filmed overseas. This initiative aims to counter the loss of film and television production to states and nations offering tax incentives and cheaper labor. Senator Adam Schiff is also working on a federal film incentive proposal. The proposal follows Trump's suggestion of a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the U.S., causing confusion and concern in Hollywood.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. Judge Jamal Whitehead dismissed the government's interpretation of a federal appeals court ruling, stating that the administration must continue processing refugees who had already been approved for travel to the U.S. The ruling emphasizes the due process rights of refugees who relied on promises made by the federal government. The Justice Department had argued it should only have to process 160 refugees.</p>
