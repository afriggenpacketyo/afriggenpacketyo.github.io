          <p>The Bank of England has invited the public to suggest themes for the next generation of UK banknotes, moving beyond the traditional use of historical figures. Thousands of suggestions have been submitted, ranging from celebrating maritime heritage and famous landmarks to featuring classic TV characters and vintage trains. While some citizens prefer to continue honoring historical figures, others question the necessity of a redesign in an increasingly cashless society. The public consultation reflects a broader conversation about modern British identity and what the nation chooses to celebrate on its currency.</p>

          <p>Heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath are set to perform a final concert in their original lineup in their hometown of Birmingham. The event marks a significant return for frontman Ozzy Osbourne, whose life has been marked by immense success, personal struggles with addiction, and recent health issues, including Parkinson's disease. Osbourne, who was famously fired from the band in 1979 before launching a successful solo career, views the concert as a way to give back to his origins. The show, titled "Back to the Beginning," is a celebrated reunion for fans and a poignant farewell for the iconic band.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is set to be a major beneficiary of the Trump administration's new tax and spending package, potentially receiving a 30% funding increase to nearly $40 billion by 2026. A significant portion of these funds, around $25 billion, is allocated for the "Golden Dome" missile defense system, an initiative focused on space-based interceptors and advanced sensors. This investment aims to achieve "space superiority," particularly in response to China's growing military capabilities in space. The funding provides a boost for defense and space contractors amid budget cuts at NASA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese toy giant Pop Mart, known for its popular Labubu dolls sold in "blind boxes," is facing potential headwinds after state media warned against the addictive nature of such products for children. Despite the criticism, which caused a temporary dip in its stock, analysts believe the company will remain resilient as its primary demographic consists of young adults, not minors. Pop Mart's significant growth is increasingly driven by overseas sales, which could cushion it from domestic regulatory impacts. The company's success highlights the "dopamine economy," where consumers seek affordable exclusivity and the excitement of surprise.</p>

          <p>A small meteor that created a bright streak across the UK sky is believed to have scattered fragments on and around Ben Nevis, Scotland's highest mountain. The UK Meteor Network tracked the object, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and calculated its likely landing area. Dozens of local residents reported seeing an orange glow and hearing a loud bang, with one witness describing their house shaking from the impact. Experts have appealed to hillwalkers to look for the meteorites, though finding them in the vast, mountainous terrain will be challenging.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that he has developed a "good personal relationship" with U.S. President Donald Trump, based on a shared understanding of family values. In a BBC interview, Starmer revealed that Trump had called to offer condolences after the death of his brother, creating a point of personal connection despite their different political backgrounds. The prime minister believes this rapport was instrumental in securing a crucial deal to exempt UK industries from some U.S. tariffs. He emphasized the importance of forging such international relationships as being in the UK's national interest.</p>

          <p>The Australian hearing technology company Cochlear has introduced its new smart implant system in China, making it one of the first markets globally to receive the device. The launch is taking place through Hainan province and Hong Kong. Unlike traditional hearing aids, Cochlear's implant works by bypassing damaged parts of the inner ear to directly stimulate the auditory nerve with electrical signals. According to the company's chief technology officer, the device is designed to help users with severe to profound hearing loss for whom conventional aids are no longer effective.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has renewed its commitment to tackling overcapacity and "disorderly low-price competition" within its massive solar photovoltaic (PV) industry. At a meeting with industry leaders, the Minister of Industry and Information Technology emphasized the need to govern the sector according to regulations and phase out outdated production capacity. This directive follows a top-level economic meeting where President Xi Jinping also called for an end to such competitive practices. The move aims to ensure the healthy and sustainable development of an industry where China holds a dominant global position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is scheduled for a two-day tour of rural South Carolina, a visit that is fueling speculation about a potential 2028 presidential campaign. Newsom will visit eight of the state's most economically and environmentally challenged counties, a move his advisors claim is to support Democrats and highlight how rural communities are being left behind by the Trump administration. However, the choice of South Carolina, an influential early primary state, is widely seen as a strategic step to build a national profile. The tour will take him through several deeply Republican counties.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully cultivated a heart structure containing human cells within a pig embryo, reporting that it continued to beat for 21 days. Researchers from the Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedicine and Health achieved this by genetically modifying human stem cells to improve their survival before implanting them into pig embryos. This development in chimera research, where cells from two different species are combined, represents a significant step forward in the field of organ generation. The same team had previously grown humanized kidneys in pig embryos for up to 28 days.</p>
