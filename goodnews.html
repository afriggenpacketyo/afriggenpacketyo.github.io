          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position for the Italian Grand Prix with the fastest lap ever recorded in Formula 1 history, narrowly beating McLaren's Lando Norris. Verstappen's record-breaking lap at Monza, with an average speed of over 164 mph, edged out Norris by just 0.077 seconds. McLaren had a strong showing with Oscar Piastri qualifying third, followed by the Ferraris. This marks Verstappen's first pole position since the British Grand Prix, setting up an exciting race against the historically strong McLarens.</p>

The project aims to create a space for history, learning, and civic engagement, honoring the state that launched Biden's extensive political career.

          <p>A rare 1962 Aston Martin DB4 has been discovered in a New York barn after being hidden for 30 years and is now for sale with a valuation over $324,000. The classic car, which still has its original matching-numbers engine, was gifted to its previous owner in the 1970s as a thank you for helping with a repair. He intended to restore the vehicle but never got around to it, leaving it untouched for three decades. This model was historically significant as one of the first production cars to achieve 0-100-0 mph in under 30 seconds.</p>

          <p>A long-standing conflict at California's Point Reyes National Seashore is entering a new phase as 12 organic dairy and cattle operations have accepted a multi-million dollar buyout to leave the land. This deal, mediated by The Nature Conservancy, opens over 16,000 acres for a massive five-year restoration effort aimed at reviving native ecosystems. The plan controversially includes using new herds of cattle for targeted grazing to control invasive plants. While conservationists are hopeful, the transition is painful for the local community, raising concerns about the loss of multigenerational ranches and the region's organic dairy supply.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of LGBTQ+ Catholics participated in a Holy Year pilgrimage to Rome, marking a significant moment of increased acceptance within the Catholic Church. An Italian bishop celebrated a Mass for the pilgrims, emphasizing that the Jubilee is a time to restore dignity to all, especially those who have been marginalized. Many attendees credited the late Pope Francis for fostering a more welcoming tone, which they hope will be continued by his successor, Pope Leo. The event, officially listed in the Vatican's Holy Year calendar, stands in stark contrast to 25 years ago when a similar group was detained.</p>

          <p>Schools across the United States are adopting locked magnetic pouches, such as those from the company Yondr, to enforce new statewide bans on cellphone use in classrooms. The system requires students to place their phones in a pouch that they carry but can only be unlocked with magnets at school entrances. While some students and educators praise the initiative for reducing distractions and increasing social interaction, others are skeptical, citing student attempts to bypass the system. The implementation has also sparked debate over the cost, with districts spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on the technology.</p>

          <p>Zach Yadegari, an 18-year-old entrepreneur, is the co-founder and CEO of Cal AI, a calorie-tracking mobile app that reportedly generates $1.4 million in gross profit per month. Yadegari, who began coding at age seven, developed the app with friends to simplify food logging by using AI to estimate calories from a photo. Launched in May 2024, the app's success has led Yadegari to consider leaving his business studies at the University of Miami to focus on the company full-time. The startup has 30 employees and is spending heavily on marketing to compete with established apps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An analyst suggests that while China's intensified anti-corruption campaign within its financial sector may not provide an immediate boost to confidence due to current uncertainties, it could be beneficial in the long run. The crackdown, which has recently extended from banking into the stock market, is seen as a move toward cleaner governance. This effort to align with international standards could eventually help attract more overseas investment by creating a more transparent and predictable business environment for foreign institutions and corporations.

          <p>Archaeologists in Camden, South Carolina, have discovered the remains of 14 soldiers from the 1780 Battle of Camden, a brutal clash during the American Revolution. The hastily buried remains include Continental soldiers, a British Highlander, and a Native American fighter. To identify these forgotten soldiers, a team is now using forensic genealogy, treating it as the "ultimate cold case." They have successfully built genetic profiles for two individuals and are asking potential descendants to submit DNA samples to help restore the names of these first American soldiers.</p>

          <p>The UK government will conduct its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system for mobile phones on Sunday, September 7, around 3:00 PM BST. The system is designed to warn the public about life-threatening events like extreme weather or terror attacks. During the test, compatible phones will emit a siren sound and vibrate for about 10 seconds. While the government recommends keeping the alerts enabled, users can opt out through their phone's settings. This test follows a previous one in 2023 that experienced some technical issues which officials say have been addressed.</p>

          <p>Thousands of viewers were given a rare glimpse into the depths of Lake Tahoe, one of the deepest lakes in the U.S., via a live-streamed dive by a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). The event, sponsored by environmental non-profits, aimed to showcase the lake's unique underwater ecosystem and raise awareness for its protection. The ROV, named Emmy, traveled over 1,500 feet below the surface, dispelling myths about mob bodies but highlighting the lake's ancient geological history. Experts used the opportunity to discuss the importance of the lakebed's health and ongoing efforts to remove trash and invasive species.</p>

          <p>A new book is highlighting the largely unseen jazz photography of Lisette Model, a Viennese émigré best known for her street photography. In the early 1950s, Model embarked on a project to document the American jazz scene, capturing the inward emotions of musicians like Duke Ellington and Miles Davis, but the project was derailed due to McCarthy-era political suspicion. The collection of over 1,800 negatives reveals her unique ability to photograph the complex reality of jazz luminaries who, despite being cultural ambassadors for the U.S., faced racism and persecution at home.</p>
