          <p>The BBC postponed a documentary about Ozzy Osbourne's final years out of respect for his family's wishes following his recent death at 76. The film, "Ozzy Osbourne: Coming Home," was originally scheduled to air less than a month after he passed away. It was adapted from a planned series and covers the last three years of his life, including his return to the UK and his farewell concert. The broadcast has been rescheduled, with a new date to be announced soon.</p>

          <p>The United States Director of National Intelligence announced that the UK has rescinded its demand for Apple to create a "back door" into its encrypted services. The UK government had previously issued a formal notice under the Investigatory Powers Act, which would have required Apple to provide access to global user data. In response, Apple had withdrawn its Advanced Data Protection feature from the UK market and initiated a legal challenge. Privacy advocates have cautiously welcomed the development, though Apple has not yet received formal confirmation of the policy reversal.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing acquiring a 10% stake in Intel, which would make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. The plan involves potentially converting some or all of Intel's $10.9 billion in CHIPS and Science Act grants into equity in the company. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and bolster national security, as Intel has fallen behind global competitors. While the discussions are ongoing, it highlights the administration's interest in creating government-backed national champions in strategic sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Helsinki has become one of the largest European cities to record zero traffic-related deaths in a year, a significant achievement in urban safety. The Finnish capital's success is attributed to a comprehensive strategy that includes lowering speed limits to 30 km/h on most city streets, particularly around schools. The city also utilizes extensive data collection to identify and redesign dangerous intersections, improves infrastructure for cyclists and pedestrians, and enhances public transport. This approach is part of the EU's "Vision Zero" program, which aims to eliminate road fatalities by 2050.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, the leader of Canada's Conservative Party, is projected to win a crucial by-election in the Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot, securing his return to the House of Commons. Poilievre lost his long-held Ottawa-area seat in the general election four months prior. The special election was called after the sitting Conservative MP stepped aside to allow him to run in the safe conservative stronghold. His victory solidifies his position ahead of a mandatory party leadership review scheduled for January.</p>

          <h2>Formula 1 Expert Discusses Wet Races, Car Aesthetics, and Technical Regulations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses several fan questions about Formula 1, exploring topics from race regulations to car design. It dismisses the idea of artificially wet races, citing the sport's preference for maintaining "purity" over gimmicks, despite the existence of aids like DRS. On aesthetics, the 1990 Ferrari 641 is highlighted as a work of art, having been displayed in New York's Museum of Modern Art. The piece also explains that a car's performance differs between qualifying and a race due to how peak tire grip can mask underlying flaws, which become apparent over a long stint as tires degrade.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his Indian counterpart S. Jaishankar in Delhi, urging that the two nations should be "partners" rather than "adversaries." The meeting marks a continued, albeit cautious, improvement in relations, which hit a low point after a deadly 2020 border clash. The discussions covered a range of issues, including trade and border stability, with both sides emphasizing mutual respect. This rapprochement occurs as India's relationship with the U.S. has become more strained, potentially creating new geopolitical alignments in Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This personal essay explores the complex challenge of being advised to diet for health reasons after years spent recovering from anorexia. The author describes how her recovery involved embracing food without restriction, which eventually led to a diagnosis of very high cholesterol. She critiques a culture that conflates weight with health, noting that medical advice often defaults to weight loss without considering a patient's history with disordered eating. The experience forced her to confront how society's contradictory health messages can inadvertently trigger past disorders, even when the goal is physical well-being.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a three-year prison sentence set a new precedent for pay-per-view spectacles. His fight against Peter McNeeley, while lasting only 89 seconds and ending in a farcical disqualification, shattered revenue records and drew a massive celebrity audience. The event demonstrated that a superstar's drawing power could transcend the competitiveness of the actual match. This focus on spectacle over sport paved the way for modern crossover events, such as those involving YouTubers and MMA fighters, proving that a compelling narrative can be more lucrative than a well-matched contest.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram are fundamentally altering the way we speak, driven by engagement-focused algorithms and viral trends. Author Adam Aleksic discusses this phenomenon, explaining that a new lexicon, often termed "algospeak," has emerged and is being adopted by millions of users online. This transformation of language is happening at an unprecedented speed, as memes and platform metrics rewire how communication evolves. The article highlights how these digital forces are creating a distinct and rapidly changing linguistic landscape for a new generation.</p>

          <p>In the Swedish city of Kiruna, a massive 113-year-old wooden church is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The complex, two-day operation is necessary because decades of iron ore mining have caused ground subsidence, threatening the old city center. The 672-ton structure was lifted onto remote-controlled transporters and is being moved at a speed of half a kilometer per hour. This event is the most symbolic part of a larger project to relocate the Arctic town, which is being funded by the state-owned mining company LKAB.</p>
