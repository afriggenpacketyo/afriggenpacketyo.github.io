          <h2>Leicester Salon Owner Continues Trademark Battle with L'Oréal</h2>

          <p>A salon owner in Leicester is preparing for a crucial hearing in her trademark dispute with the global cosmetics company L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell is fighting to re-register the name of her business, "nkd," which L'Oréal opposes, citing potential confusion with its "Naked" product line. Having already spent over £30,000 on legal fees, she expresses renewed determination to fight the corporate giant. The case highlights the challenges small businesses face against large corporations and delays within the UK's Intellectual Property Office, partly due to post-Brexit caseloads.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a significant increase in certain insect populations, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions have been ideal for these species, leading to a bumper year for sightings and honey production. However, experts warn that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year as wetland habitats dry up. This short-term boom contrasts with the long-term trend of declining flying insect populations across the UK.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city policies. The lawsuit argued that the city's laws, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally obstruct federal immigration enforcement. Judge Lindsay Jenkins granted the city's motion for dismissal, a decision praised by Chicago's mayor and the Illinois governor. This ruling marks a significant legal victory for sanctuary cities amid a series of similar lawsuits targeting municipalities across the country.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in the late 1940s. The exhibit focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence, which led to the imprisonment and blacklisting of the "Hollywood Ten." It showcases how figures like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo were forced to work under pseudonyms and how the anti-Communist fervor extended beyond Hollywood, affecting many ordinary Americans until its power faded in the 1960s.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in five years due to disease. The rescue mission involved capturing and airlifting dozens of sheep from the last remaining disease-free herd to an isolated, new mountain habitat. A recent check on the relocated herd brought promising news, as biologists found a group of nine sheep that included several newborn lambs. The success of the project offers hope for the species' recovery in the state.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release approximately $6.8 billion in federal education funds to states after previously freezing the money. The decision followed a lawsuit from over 20 Democratic attorneys general and pressure from bipartisan governors who argued the freeze created chaos for school districts. Education Secretary Linda McMahon confirmed the release at a National Governors Association meeting, stating the Office of Management and Budget had completed its review of the funding programs. The move was praised by governors from both parties.</p>

          <p>This article explores the science and practicality behind common daily health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water, sleeping seven to nine hours, and exercising 150 minutes per week. Health experts suggest that while these numbers serve as useful guidelines, they shouldn't be treated as rigid rules. Individual needs can vary greatly, and factors like age, activity level, and overall health play a significant role. The consensus is that a flexible, consistent approach to a healthy lifestyle is more beneficial than stressing over hitting exact numerical targets.</p>

          <p>A scientific revolution is transforming women's sports, moving beyond the old model of treating female athletes like "mini-men." New research is providing critical insights into uniquely female aspects of performance and health. This includes studying how breast biomechanics and proper sports bra support can impact running efficiency, the nuanced effects of the menstrual cycle on performance, and the reasons behind the higher incidence of injuries like ACL tears in women. This knowledge is leading to better, more tailored support and training protocols for female athletes.</p>

Such an event would be a spectacular sight but could also create a massive crater and send debris hurtling toward Earth-orbiting satellites. This scenario is prompting the planetary defense community to expand its focus to include threats to the moon.</p>

          <p>A quarter-century after its debut, reality TV is being re-evaluated by some sociologists and psychologists who argue it can have a positive societal impact. The genre, often dismissed as superficial, can provide a platform for greater social understanding by showcasing diverse demographics and raw, unfiltered human interactions. By bringing private dramas into the public sphere, shows can spark national conversations on complex topics like coercive control, disability, and mental health, potentially making viewers feel less isolated and more aware of different perspectives.</p>
