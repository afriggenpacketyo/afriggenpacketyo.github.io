          <p>At the Labour party conference, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has continued his critique of Keir Starmer's leadership, warning that the party is in "peril" and must not underestimate the threat posed by Reform UK. Burnham called for an open debate about the party's direction and strategy to connect more effectively with voters ahead of next year's local elections. His comments have created friction within the party, with some MPs viewing them as a precursor to a future leadership challenge.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been ruled out of his Sunday singles match against the USA's Harris English due to a neck injury. According to Ryder Cup rules, the match has been declared a half, with each team being awarded half a point. This development moves Team Europe, which already held a commanding lead, even closer to retaining the trophy, as they now need fewer points from the remaining matches to secure victory.</p>

          <p>In a surprisingly close referendum, Swiss voters approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system with 50.4% of the vote. The proposal succeeded after a previous version was rejected in 2021 due to privacy concerns; this revised plan keeps the system in government hands and stores data decentrally on users' smartphones. Supporters argue the digital ID will simplify many online transactions and bureaucratic processes, while opponents remain wary of potential data privacy risks.</p>

          <p>Voters in Zurich, Switzerland, have passed a referendum to impose strict limitations on the use of leaf blowers, citing concerns about noise and air pollution. The new regulations will completely ban gasoline-powered leaf blowers and will permit the use of electric models only during a three-month period from October to December. Proponents of the measure argued that the devices are harmful to the environment and microorganisms, while opponents criticized it as an example of an excessive and impractical prohibition.</p>

          <p>In the week ahead, investors will be intensely focused on key labor market data, culminating in Friday's nonfarm payrolls report, to predict the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. Signs of continued weakness in the job market could strengthen the case for more rate cuts this year, while robust data might lead the central bank to pause its easing cycle. Additionally, the recent increase in long-term Treasury bond yields remains a critical factor, influencing borrowing costs across the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The ongoing failure of national chain stores is leading to rising vacancy rates in shopping centers, creating a unique opportunity for small and local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate. With demand softening, landlords are becoming more willing to offer flexible lease terms and more affordable rents for spaces that were previously out of reach. This trend is enabling independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based entrepreneurs to establish a physical presence in desirable locations, potentially revitalizing local economies.</p>
