          <p>Japan's core inflation rate increased to 3.5% in April, marking the highest level in over two years, driven by rising rice prices and staying above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for more than three years. The Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda has signaled his intention to raise rates given price trends, while also citing the need to monitor closely the effects of U.S. tariffs. Masato Koike, economist at Sompo Institute Plus, expects core inflation to ease in the coming months due to lower crude oil prices and the yen's appreciation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is resuming horse-drawn caisson funerals at Arlington National Cemetery after suspending them in May 2023 due to horse deaths and injuries. Following an investigation, the Army implemented changes, including consulting with equestrian experts, reducing the workload for horses, using lighter caissons, and providing extensive training for personnel. Starting in June, two squads of 11 horses will perform two services a day, totaling about 10 funerals per week, with improved rest schedules for the animals. The Army is focused on ensuring the welfare of the animals and honoring service members and their families with the solemn tradition.</p>

          <p>Beef prices in the U.S. have reached record highs, with ground beef costing an average of $5.80 per pound in April, nearly a 50% increase from five years ago. Ranchers are struggling with rising costs for feed, land, and financing, leading to U.S. cattle herds falling to their lowest numbers in over 70 years. The U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts that beef prices will continue to rise throughout 2025 due to tightening supplies. Ranchers are weighing the costs of maintaining their herds against market prices, leading some to sell non-pregnant cows to cut expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, upheld President Trump's authority to fire two independent agency officials, Gwynne Wilcox and Cathy Harris, who had fixed terms set by Congress. The court stated that the President has the power to remove executive officers who exercise power on his behalf. The decision does not affect the Federal Reserve Board. Justice Elena Kagan dissented, arguing the decision favored the President over established precedent. The ruling raises questions about the balance of power between the President and Congress in setting the structure of the federal government.</p>

The proposal sought to codify that structure within Amazon "like the majority of S&P 500 companies."</p>
