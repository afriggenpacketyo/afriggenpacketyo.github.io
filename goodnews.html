          <p>The Chinese city of Suzhou is making a concerted effort to establish itself as a world-class biopharmaceutical hub, with the ambitious goal of rivaling Boston. Already home to 3,800 biotech companies, the city is offering substantial subsidies to attract more top-tier international and domestic firms to set up regional headquarters. By 2030, Suzhou's strategic plan aims to host over 10,000 companies and generate an output value exceeding one trillion yuan. This initiative is supported by academic partnerships, such as a new pharmacy academy co-founded by a local university.</p>

          <p>NASA has announced the discovery of a new, small moon orbiting the planet Uranus, provisionally named S/2025 U1. The satellite, which is only about six miles in diameter, was identified using data from the James Webb Space Telescope. This discovery brings the total number of known moons orbiting the ice giant to 29. Researchers believe its small size is why it eluded previous observations, including those by the Voyager 2 spacecraft nearly 40 years ago. The new moon will eventually be named after a character from the works of Shakespeare or Alexander Pope.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's commemoration of its victory in the War of Resistance against Japanese Aggression is not an exercise in inciting hatred, but a necessary reflection on historical truth. The author contends that remembering the brutality of the war and the sacrifices made is distinct from fostering animosity towards contemporary Japan and its people. The article suggests that it is possible for Chinese citizens, particularly younger generations who grew up with Japanese pop culture, to condemn historical aggression while simultaneously embracing modern Japanese culture and friendship.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Shenghua Wen, has been sentenced to eight years in a U.S. prison for illegally exporting firearms and other military equipment to North Korea. According to the Justice Department, Wen, who remained in the U.S. illegally after his student visa expired, was directed by North Korean officials to procure the items. He purchased many of the weapons in Texas and shipped them from California, disguising at least one shipment as a refrigerator. In return for his efforts, he received approximately $2 million in payments from Pyongyang.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, with orchestrating large-scale cyberattacks using a sophisticated botnet known as "Rapper Bot." Prosecutors allege that since 2021, Foltz developed and leased out the botnet, a network of malware-infected devices, to conduct distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against targets in over 80 countries. The network, which reportedly controlled up to 95,000 devices, was dismantled by law enforcement on August 6. Foltz faces a charge of aiding and abetting computer intrusions, which carries a potential 10-year prison sentence.</p>

          <p>In the revamped US Open mixed doubles competition, the highly anticipated partnership of Emma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz was short-lived, as they were defeated 4-2, 4-2 by Jack Draper and Jessica Pegula. Despite being a fan favorite, the Raducanu-Alcaraz pairing was outmatched by the more aggressive and experienced play of Draper and top-ranked doubles player Pegula. The new tournament format, featuring shortened sets and high-profile singles stars, has generated buzz but also criticism from doubles specialists. Draper and Pegula advanced to the semi-finals after their victory.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock saw a 3% increase after the retailer maintained its full-year outlook, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for earnings and revenue. The company still anticipates 2.8% growth in total sales for the year, signaling confidence in its performance amid ongoing economic uncertainty. Executives noted that while homeowners still show a "deferral mindset" for large projects, there were encouraging signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000. The results reflect a slow but steady home improvement market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that President Trump's recent diplomatic engagements with Ukrainian and European leaders have significantly improved the prospects for ending the war with Russia. The author suggests that despite ongoing Russian aggression, Trump's willingness to discuss U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine and facilitate a potential trilateral summit is a positive step. To maintain momentum, the article advises Trump to amplify his commitment to Ukraine's security, use strategic ambiguity to pressure Moscow, and signal support for further military assistance if a peace deal is not reached.</p>
