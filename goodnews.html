          <h2>Nvidia's Strong Results Trigger Global Semiconductor Stock Rally</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 08:02:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia shares surged after the company reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, despite challenges from U.S. semiconductor export restrictions to China. This positive performance sparked a rally in global semiconductor stocks, with companies like Tokyo Electron and SK Hynix experiencing significant gains. Nvidia wrote off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory due to export curbs, the article notes, but the company's financial results still exceeded market expectations, alleviating concerns about dwindling demand for its graphics processing units, which are essential for training AI models. The semiconductor industry has faced headwinds from tariff policy uncertainty and chip export restrictions.</p>

          <p>Stock market futures experienced a surge after a federal court froze most of the tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on U.S. trading partners. The U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that President Trump exceeded his legal authority in assessing tariffs, blocking levies on China, Mexico, and Canada. This decision led to gains in overseas markets as well, as investors reacted positively to the prospect of reduced trade tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the conclusion of his official role in government, thanking President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending. Since joining the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency, Musk has worked to streamline the federal government. As a special government employee, Musk's tenure was limited to 130 days in a calendar year, concluding at the end of May. Musk expressed that the DOGE mission will only strengthen over time as it becomes a way of life throughout the government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration will fly a migrant back to the U.S. after a judge ruled that his deportation "ignored" due process. U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ordered the return of O.C.G., a Guatemalan man, finding that necessary due process steps were bypassed. O.C.G.'s attorneys argued that he sought asylum after violent attacks in Guatemala and had no criminal history. The Justice Department admitted that there was no witness to verify the government's account of O.C.G.'s removal, and the declaration was made in error.</p>

One child wants to be a teacher to help others grow, while another dreams of taxidermying a lamprey eel. The children also express a desire for positive changes in the world, such as preserving democracy and promoting social justice.

          <p>United Airlines plans to return to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport through a new partnership with JetBlue Airways. The partnership, called Blue Sky, will allow the airlines to sell seats on each other's sites and offer reciprocal loyalty benefits. This agreement stops short of the flight coordination that JetBlue had in its former alliance with American Airlines, which was struck down on antitrust grounds. JetBlue's leaders have long said they need a partnership to better compete against larger airlines like United and Delta.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the idea that it can be beneficial for adults to correct children's behavior, even if they are not the child's parent. The author recalls an experience in Prague where a woman gently corrected her daughter's behavior on the metro, highlighting the communal approach to child-rearing. While acknowledging the potential drawbacks, the author argues that such interventions can reinforce lessons and acquaint children with societal conventions. In an era of waning social trust, reviving collective child-rearing norms may seem far-fetched, but such involvement can be welcome.</p>
