          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Hold Steady on Interest Rates Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain its current interest rate levels, remaining between 4.25 percent and 4.5 percent, due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs could trigger inflation while simultaneously hindering economic growth. Fed officials are closely monitoring economic data for signs of rising consumer prices or a weakening labor market. The central bank is in a wait-and-see mode, seeking clarity on the economic implications of Trump's policies, including tariffs, spending cuts, and deportations. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is expected to address questions about the Fed's approach to managing inflation and avoiding policy errors given these uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a decline after Apple's services chief, Eddy Cue, suggested that AI search engines could eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. Cue indicated Apple's interest in integrating AI services from companies like OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into its Safari browser. His comments were made during testimony in the Justice Department's lawsuit against Alphabet, which alleges Google's illegal dominance in ad-tech markets. The lawsuit also impacts Apple, as Google pays the iPhone maker billions annually to be the default search engine on iPhones.</p>

          <p>The long-postponed Real ID enforcement began at airports, with many fliers arriving early or bringing passports, leading to a smooth rollout. Travelers are now required to show a federally compliant Real ID, passport, or other approved identification to board domestic flights. Those without Real IDs received warnings and underwent additional screening. Despite warnings and postponed deadlines, many travelers remain unaware of the requirements. Several travelers said they were more concerned over the news that the air traffic controllers who coordinate planes at Newark had briefly lost contact with planes last week, prompting some of the controllers to take trauma leave from work.</p>

In North Carolina's Copper Penny Grille, owner Shelly Gref has transformed thousands of pennies into bar tops and artwork, giving Lincoln's likeness new purpose. But economic realities have prompted bipartisan legislation in Congress that could end penny production, an idea President Trump has also supported. At the Penny Depot, the Kilcoyne family creates custom collectible pennies with pressing machines. They worry about their business if the coin is discontinued.</p>
