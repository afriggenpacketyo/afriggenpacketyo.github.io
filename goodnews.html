        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A massive 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami alerts across the Pacific. In Hawaii, an initial warning was downgraded to an advisory after relatively small waves, measuring up to 4.9 feet, came ashore. While some coastal flooding was reported and residents were urged to move inland, no substantial damage occurred. The event prompted evacuations and transportation disruptions in Japan and along the US West Coast, but the most severe outcomes were ultimately averted.</p>

          <p>The euro zone's economy grew by a slight 0.1% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a flatline and surpassing economists' predictions. This growth occurred despite Germany's economy, a key driver for the region, shrinking by 0.1% during the same period. The data reflects a complex economic environment influenced by factors like US trade tariffs, with increased consumer and government spending helping to offset a decline in machinery and construction investment.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:01:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent public pressure from President Trump on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates has highlighted the critical importance of the central bank's independence. Experts explain that the Fed's ability to make monetary policy decisions free from political influence is essential for maintaining economic stability and public credibility. Historically, presidents like Richard Nixon have pressured the Fed, sometimes leading to negative long-term outcomes like high inflation. The institution's structure, with long, staggered terms for its governors, is designed to insulate it from short-term political goals and allow it to make unpopular but necessary economic decisions.</p>

          <p>Despite persistent claims from former President Trump and other Republicans about widespread illegal voting, a new report confirms that voting by non-U.S. citizens is extremely rare. Research from the Center for Election Innovation & Research, which reviewed state data, found only minuscule numbers of such cases, with no evidence of any coordinated efforts. For example, a comprehensive audit in Michigan found just over a dozen illegal votes out of millions cast. The report concludes that allegations of noncitizen voting largely stem from misunderstandings or mischaracterizations of voter data, not from actual widespread fraud.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Maintain Current Interest Rates Despite Political Pressure</h2>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting, maintaining the current benchmark rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. This decision comes despite ongoing and intense criticism from President Trump, who has repeatedly called for rate cuts to stimulate the economy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has insisted that policymakers are focused on their mandate of managing inflation and employment, not political attacks. While some Fed officials have argued for a rate cut, the consensus remains to wait for more economic data, particularly concerning the impact of new tariffs.</p>

          <h2>The Surprising Century-Long History of the Word 'Dude'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "dude," often associated with 1980s surfer culture, actually originated in New York City a century earlier. Linguists trace its first use to the 1880s as a term for young, fashion-obsessed men who emulated a flashy, Anglophile style, likely as a reference to "Yankee Doodle Dandy." The term later evolved to describe East Coast tourists visiting "dude ranches" out West. In the mid-20th century, it was adopted by African American and Mexican American communities as a marker of solidarity before being popularized by California subcultures and Hollywood, eventually becoming a widely used, gender-neutral term of familiarity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on the Great Tit, a European songbird, reveals that some avian couples effectively "divorce" after a breeding season. By tracking individual birds with radio tags, scientists at the University of Oxford observed that while many pairs remained together through the winter, others began to drift apart. These "divorcing" birds associated with each other less and less, suggesting they were severing social bonds before the next mating season. The study highlights the complex and significant role that social behaviors and relationships play in the lives of animals, not just humans.</p>

          <p>Colombian winger Luis Diaz has officially transferred from Liverpool to German champions Bayern Munich in a deal valued at £65.5 million. The 28-year-old signed a four-year contract, ending his successful three-and-a-half-year tenure at Anfield where he won four major trophies, including the Premier League. In a farewell message, Diaz stated he was leaving with a sense of "duty fulfilled" and that his departure would have been a "perfect goodbye" if not for the recent tragic death of teammate Diogo Jota. The sale contributes to Liverpool's significant summer transfer revenue.</p>

          <p>After days of border clashes that killed at least 41 people, Thailand and Cambodia have reaffirmed their commitment to a ceasefire. The agreement was reinforced during an informal meeting in Shanghai mediated by China, which is taking a diplomatic role in de-escalating the conflict. The initial ceasefire, brokered with pressure from the U.S. and Malaysia, was tested by reports of gunfire from both sides. However, the situation along the border has now calmed, allowing some of the more than 260,000 displaced people to begin returning to their homes.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation rate dropped to 2.1% in the second quarter, its lowest level since March 2021 and falling within the Reserve Bank of Australia's target range. The slowdown was more significant than economists had anticipated, reinforcing expectations that the RBA may cut its policy interest rate at its next meeting. While the RBA has held rates steady recently to confirm the downward trend, analysts believe the weak inflation data, coupled with a rising unemployment rate and softer-than-expected GDP growth, provides sufficient evidence for a rate reduction to support the economy.
