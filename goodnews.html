          <p>President Donald Trump announced he would not proceed with a plan to send the National Guard into San Francisco to address crime, citing progress made by the city and calls from prominent tech leaders. In a social media post, Trump mentioned that he was swayed by conversations with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, among others, who expressed optimism about the city's future. He also acknowledged that Democratic Mayor Daniel Lurie was making "substantial progress" on the issue. The decision is being viewed as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie and the city's leadership.</p>

The strong performance was driven by a significant rebound in its aerospace segment and robust order growth, leading to a record backlog of $39.1 billion. In response to the positive results, the company raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings. This news comes as Honeywell prepares to spin off its Solstice Advanced Materials business, the first step in a planned split into three separate, more focused companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted claims that the government is negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies in exchange for federal funding. The denial followed a Wall Street Journal report suggesting the Trump administration was in talks with firms like IonQ, Rigetti Computing, and D-Wave Quantum. While the administration has recently taken stakes in industries deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals, the spokesperson clarified that no such discussions are currently underway with quantum firms. The quantum computing sector is seen as strategically important due to its potential military and technological applications.</p>

          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, a bill designed to make IRS notices for simple tax return mistakes clearer and more helpful for taxpayers. The legislation, which now heads to the president's desk, addresses complaints that the current "math error" notices are often confusing and do not adequately explain the reason for a tax adjustment or the consequences of not responding within the 60-day window. While the act won't reduce the number of errors, proponents like Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bill Cassidy argue it will empower taxpayers to correct mistakes without needing to hire expensive legal help.</p>

          <h2>Kering Stock Surges as Improved Gucci Sales Boost Investor Confidence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-23 12:04:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares in the French luxury group Kering rose sharply, closing up 8.7%, after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter sales and a narrower decline at its flagship brand, Gucci. While overall sales were down 5% compared to the previous year, this marked a significant improvement from the 15% drop in the second quarter. Sales at Gucci fell 14%, but this was also a "sharp sequential improvement" from its 25% plunge in the prior quarter. The results suggest that CEO Luca de Meo's turnaround strategy, which includes focusing on core fashion businesses, is beginning to show positive results and rebuild investor optimism.
