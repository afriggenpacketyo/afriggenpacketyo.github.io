          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle continued to strengthen, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, and is forecast to reach hurricane status by Sunday. The storm is expected to pass east of Bermuda on Monday, bringing dangerous surf, large swells, and life-threatening rip currents, though no direct watches or warnings are currently in effect for the island. While the Atlantic hurricane season was predicted to be busier, activity has been notably quieter than anticipated, with only one prior named storm making U.S. landfall. Forecasters are also closely monitoring a weak tropical wave off the west coast of Africa for potential development and its uncertain path.</p>

          <p>A Chinese research team from multiple universities has discovered 41 new landslides on the moon since 2009, which they attribute to moonquakes. Published in the National Science Review, these findings challenge the long-held conventional wisdom that the moon's internal geological activity had essentially ceased. The discovery, made by meticulously comparing before-and-after images of the moon's least stable areas, highlights previously unexplored geological hazards. This groundbreaking research offers crucial insights for assessing the stability of future permanent infrastructures and deep-space outposts on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>Evelyn Palla is reportedly set to become the first female CEO of Germany's national rail operator, Deutsche Bahn, with an official announcement anticipated on Monday. Palla, who joined the company in 2019 and previously led its regional subsidiary, will replace Richard Lutz, who was dismissed last month. This appointment comes as Deutsche Bahn undergoes significant restructuring to address widespread delays and cancellations, which resulted in €197 million in compensation payouts in 2024. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged to modernize Germany's transport infrastructure and reform the state-owned firm.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi, a ship's cook, recounts her unexpected 188-day ordeal stranded at sea on a 100-year-old schooner during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. What began as a three-month voyage to Mexico turned into an extended confinement as global lockdowns closed ports and canceled flights, preventing the crew from disembarking. Despite challenges like rationing food and gas, and rescuing migrants at sea, the crew found comfort in ocean wonders and forged strong bonds. The experience profoundly changed Giulia, who, five years later, continues her life working at sea.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourism to Japan is experiencing a significant surge, with over 6.7 million visits recorded in the first eight months of 2025, largely driven by a weaker yen.

The trend highlights a shift towards unique insights and quality experiences among affluent travelers. This influx is boosting Japan's tourism sector, contributing positively to the economy and signaling a strong return of Chinese visitors to the country.</p>

          <p>Dodgers catcher Will Smith has sustained a hairline fracture in his right hand, making his return before the regular season's end doubtful and his playoff availability uncertain. The injury, initially missed on scans, was confirmed after lingering pain and swelling. Despite Smith's absence, the team has performed capably, largely due to the emergence of fill-in catcher Ben Rortvedt, who has impressed with his performance and leadership behind the plate. The Dodgers remain optimistic for Smith's quick healing but acknowledge they are at the mercy of the recovery process for their key player.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk predicts that by 2030, AI and robots will replace nearly all human jobs, leading to a future of "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance" where everyone enjoys top-tier medical care, food, and housing. He envisions intelligent humanoid robots far outnumbering humans, with each person having personal robots and many more in industry. While Musk offers an optimistic vision of a society where machines handle labor, critics question the feasibility of funding such a system given current economic challenges and political roadblocks, with few details provided on the economic restructuring required.

          <p>Ava Pickett's contemporary adaptation of Jane Austen's "Emma" reimagines the classic novel in a 21st-century Essex setting, with the protagonist navigating online dating and modern social dynamics after failing university. The play, staged at London's Rose Theatre, maintains Emma Woodhouse's meddling yet well-intentioned nature, now applied to friends' dating profiles rather than society balls. Pickett, drawing from her own experiences, highlights the "toxic" aspects of dating apps and the complexities of modern friendships. This fresh take on Austen's work explores universal themes of love, jealousy, and self-worth, making it relevant to contemporary audiences.</p>

          <p>Creatine, a widely popular muscle-boosting supplement, is being explored for its potential to alleviate brain fog and improve cognitive functions like memory and focus. While extensively researched for athletic performance, recent studies are now considering its impact on female biology, particularly during perimenopause. Experts suggest creatine might help the brain produce more energy, potentially mitigating effects similar to sleep deprivation. However, research is still limited, and dieticians caution about potential side effects and the need for more controlled studies, emphasizing it's not a "wonder drug."</p>
