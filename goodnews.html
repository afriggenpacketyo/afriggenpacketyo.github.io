          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. Although he displayed no symptoms, doctors will continue to monitor his condition carefully. Akihito was admitted to the hospital following an earlier checkup that indicated potential heart issues. He had previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022 and abdicated the throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for over five decades and is now making its way back to Earth. Experts predict that parts of the 1,050-pound spacecraft, originally designed with a heat shield to withstand Venus's atmosphere, could survive re-entry. While the exact location of impact is unknown, the spacecraft's orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude. The article notes that if any pieces are recovered, they legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple, Buseoksa Temple, returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to Kannonji, its rightful Japanese owner. The statue was stolen from Kannonji on Japan's Tsushima Island in 2012 by South Korean thieves. Buseoksa Temple had claimed ownership, alleging it was looted by Japanese pirates centuries ago. The statue was displayed to visitors for 100 days before its return. After conflicting court rulings, South Korea's Supreme Court ultimately upheld the decision to return the statue to Kannonji, resolving a historical dispute between the temples.</p>

          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, is demanding an apology from the Football Association (FA) after she was banned for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a friendly match. Vaughan was initially sanctioned for improper conduct but an FA appeal board later found the hearing "unfair," quashing the original ruling and ordering a new process. The case was eventually dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan claims the incident has significantly impacted her life, causing stress and disruption. The FA confirmed the case's closure, citing the complainant's withdrawal, and stated no further action would be taken.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google for changing the label of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, aligning with a U.S. presidential order. President Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed after previous warnings to Google. The dispute arose after President Trump signed an order to rename the northern part of the gulf to the Gulf of America. Mexico argues that the Gulf of America label should only apply to the part over the U.S. continental shelf, as Mexico controls about 49% of the gulf, while the U.S. controls about 46%.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is preparing to unveil new plans to reduce UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The proposed measures include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, likely targeting the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions may be imposed on nationalities with a higher likelihood of overstaying, such as those from Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka. Migrants may also face longer waiting periods before applying for permanent residency, potentially extending to 10 years. Tougher English language requirements for immigrants are also being considered, along with stricter rules for recruiting international care workers.</p>
