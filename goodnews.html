          <p>An opinion article from the South China Morning Post asserts that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant economic and social revival, marked by the return of tourists and major international business events. The author points to a booming IPO market and unique events like a Bitcoin conference as signs of the city's distinct capitalist identity within China. To secure its future, the piece argues that Beijing should encourage more international engagement and support Hong Kong's role as a global financial hub, leveraging its unique status amidst US-China tensions.

          <p>Germany's national football team recovered from a recent loss to secure a 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying match in Cologne. After an early goal, Germany's performance faltered, allowing Northern Ireland to equalize before halftime. However, key substitutions by coach Julian Nagelsmann, particularly the introduction of Nadiem Amiri, changed the game's tempo and led to the win. A standout free-kick goal from Florian Wirtz sealed the victory, providing a crucial three points as the team continues its challenging campaign to qualify for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Sky-gazers across the globe have been treated to the astronomical spectacle of a total lunar eclipse, popularly known as a "Blood Moon." The phenomenon occurs when the Moon passes directly through the Earth's shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a distinct reddish hue. This striking visual effect is the result of sunlight being filtered and refracted through Earth's atmosphere. The full eclipse was visible in its totality from numerous countries, captivating viewers and photographers who shared images of the celestial event.</p>

          <h2>Cricketer Jacob Bethell's First Professional Century Sparks Debate on England's Ashes Selection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 16:43:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At 21 years old, English cricketer Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international match against South Africa, a milestone that has intensified discussions about his role in the upcoming Ashes series. Despite being highly rated and already having played for England, the lack of a century was a notable gap in his burgeoning career. While some pundits believe his aggressive, white-ball style is well-suited for Australian pitches, others argue he needs more experience in long-form, red-ball cricket to be a guaranteed success in the Test format. The performance puts pressure on England's selectors.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers snapped a five-game losing streak with a crucial 5-2 victory over the Baltimore Orioles, powered by a stellar performance from Shohei Ohtani. Ohtani hit two home runs, including a leadoff blast that tied a franchise record, quickly giving his team a lead they would not relinquish. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw also delivered a strong outing, striking out eight batters over 5 ⅔ innings. The win provided much-needed relief for the slumping team after a particularly painful walk-off loss the previous night had trimmed their division lead to just one game.</p>

          <p>England's manager, Thomas Tuchel, has expressed his desire for the team to utilize long throw-ins and long-ball tactics more frequently, particularly in preparation for the upcoming World Cup. Despite England's successful qualifying campaign so far, Tuchel noted that such set-piece strategies are crucial in major tournaments and will be a point of discussion with his coaching staff. He acknowledged that with limited training time during international breaks, implementing every tactical nuance is challenging.

Hassett, who is reportedly on the shortlist to be the next Fed chair, warned that historical examples show that when political leaders control central banks, it often leads to inflation and economic hardship. His comments come amid ongoing pressure from the president on the current Fed Chair, Jerome Powell, to cut interest rates, raising concerns about the institution's autonomy.
