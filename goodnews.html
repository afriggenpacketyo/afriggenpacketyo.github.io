        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AI data center provider CoreWeave saw its stock climb over 5% following the announcement of a planned $1.5 billion bond sale. The capital raised from the notes, which are due in 2031, is intended for general corporate purposes, including debt repayment. This move follows a successful $2 billion debt offering in May and a recent announcement of a $6 billion AI data center in Pennsylvania, reflecting strong investor confidence. The company's shares have more than tripled since its Nasdaq debut, though some investors remain concerned about its debt levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 14:32:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the maximum amounts students can borrow through federal student loans, highlighting the increasing gap between these limits and the actual cost of college. It breaks down the annual and lifetime borrowing caps for dependent, independent, and graduate students, noting that federal aid often falls short of total expenses. For example, a dependent first-year undergraduate can borrow up to $5,500, while average annual college costs can exceed $38,000. The article suggests private student loans as a way to cover the remaining costs but advises borrowers to proceed cautiously. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Domino's Pizza is positioning itself to gain market share by attracting frugal consumers amid industry-wide economic pressures. The company reported a 3.4% rise in U.S. same-store sales, exceeding estimates, driven by its new stuffed crust pizza and value-focused promotions. CEO Russell Weiner stated that while other restaurants struggle, the current economic headwinds are "tailwinds" for Domino's, as it successfully attracts customers across all income levels. The strategy contrasts with competitors by offering deals on popular items rather than secondary choices, aiming to win over diners who might otherwise eat at home.</p>

          <p>In a significant political development, Minneapolis Democrats have endorsed state senator and democratic socialist Omar Fateh for mayor over the incumbent, Jacob Frey. Fateh, the first Somali American and Muslim in the state senate, won the party's endorsement after a contentious convention process. Frey's campaign has contested the results, citing issues with the electronic voting system, and plans to appeal. Although losing the party endorsement is a setback, it is not definitive, as Frey previously won elections without it in the city's ranked-choice voting system.</p>

          <p>An NPR story shares the experience of Alek Hermon, whose father was in a coma following a traumatic brain injury. During his early morning vigils at the hospital, he was often attended by a nurse named Ray. After making the difficult decision to take his father off life support, Hermon felt numb and alone in the hospital hallway. Ray, who had been an assistant in the operating room, ran down the hall, embraced him, and wept with him, providing a moment of profound human connection and compassion in his deepest moment of grief.</p>

          <p>Joseph Lee's new book, "Nothing More of This Land," delves into the indigenous history of Martha's Vineyard, an island primarily known as an affluent tourist destination. Lee, a member of the Aquinnah Wampanoag tribe, explores the island's identity as Noepe, the name his people have used for centuries. The book contrasts the island's image as a luxury playground with its reality as a sacred homeland for a community of over 1,000 tribal members. Lee discusses the challenges of preserving indigenous identity and land in a place where tourism both sustains and threatens their existence.</p>

          <p>Musician Tyler, the Creator has released a new album titled “Don’t Tap the Glass,” his second full-length project in less than nine months. The 10-track album, which features no guest appearances, follows his October LP “Chromakopia.” Tyler stated the new record was inspired by conversations about why people fear dancing in public, attributing it to the "fear of being a meme." He described the album's funky, club-oriented sound as being made for movement and not for "sitting still."</p>

          <p>This article provides a glimpse into the daily operations of the underground capsules that control America's intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). It dispels the myth of a single red button, explaining that launching a missile requires a complex, multi-step process involving encrypted orders and simultaneous actions by multiple officers in separate locations. These redundant protocols are designed to prevent any single individual or crew from initiating a launch or preventing a legitimate one. The system ensures that the immense power of the nuclear arsenal is governed by a strict and deliberate chain of command.</p>

          <p>New evidence suggests that GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could be effective in treating polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder in women. Patients report improvements in symptoms such as irregular periods, hair loss, and weight management difficulties. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps regulate hormone levels, including testosterone. While there is no standard treatment for PCOS, these drugs could represent a significant breakthrough, though more extensive research and challenges with insurance coverage remain.</p>

This crucial division oversees the approval of most new drugs. The appointment comes amid significant upheaval at the FDA under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Tidmarsh's extensive industry background is seen as a potential reassurance to the pharmaceutical sector, and his past comments suggest he may take a stricter stance on certain regulatory pathways, such as the controversial accelerated approval process.</p>

          <p>A new company, The Ether Machine, is set to trade on the Nasdaq, aiming to become the largest public vehicle for institutional investment in ether. Unlike simple buy-and-hold strategies similar to MicroStrategy's for bitcoin, this firm will focus on generating yield through staking. Staking involves using the ether holdings to help secure and operate the Ethereum network in exchange for rewards. Backed by several crypto investment firms, the company argues this makes ether a more "productive" asset than bitcoin, offering investors exposure to both price and a form of dividend.
