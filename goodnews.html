        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British ministers are weighing the possibility of eliminating the two-child benefit cap, a policy that restricts most families from claiming means-tested benefits for third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledged that while removing the cap could alleviate poverty, it would entail substantial costs. Phillipson and Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall are spearheading the Child Poverty Taskforce to develop a child poverty strategy, expected to be released in the autumn. The taskforce is considering all options, with Phillipson emphasizing that a Labour government would not have implemented the cap, given their different priorities.</p>

          <p>Merseyside Police swiftly released details about the Liverpool crash suspect, including his age, nationality, and ethnicity, in an attempt to counteract inaccurate speculation on social media. This decision reflects lessons learned from previous incidents, such as the Southport attacks, where a lack of information led to unchecked disinformation and subsequent unrest. The police's proactive communication aims to provide a true narrative and prevent the spread of false or harmful information. However, this new approach raises questions about how police forces will handle future cases with unclear suspect information or sensitive circumstances involving migrants or individuals with Muslim names.</p>

          <p>Kim Jong-un's absence from Russia's Victory Day parade, despite strengthening ties with Moscow and supplying troops and weapons to support Russia in Ukraine, signals a message of restraint, retreat, and defiance. His decision spared him an awkward appearance alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping, given Beijing's unease about Pyongyang's alignment with Moscow. Instead, Kim visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, calling Putin his closest friend and hailing the alliance with Russia, while avoiding further straining ties with China. This move highlights the complex diplomatic balancing act North Korea navigates amid geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>China, the world's largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall greenhouse gas emissions for the first time, even as energy demand and economic activity increased. This drop is largely due to the country's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, outpacing electricity demand growth. The shift puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, with a commitment to peaking emissions before 2030. However, the report also notes that this decline could be reversed if economic growth accelerates, and that China needs to address other greenhouse gases like HFC-23.</p>
