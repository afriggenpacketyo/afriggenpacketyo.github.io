        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Databricks, a data analytics startup, has announced its acquisition of Neon, a cloud-based database software vendor, for around $1 billion, marking another significant deal for Databricks, following its purchases of MosaicML and Tabular. Neon, founded in 2021, boasts over 18,000 customers, including OpenAI and Adobe, and is known for its open-source platform that rivals Amazon Web Services' Aurora Postgres. Databricks' CEO, Ali Ghodsi, praised Neon's architecture, which separates computing work from data storage for cost-effectiveness. The acquisition's implications for Neon CEO Nikita Shamgunov's role are yet to be determined, but Databricks intends to integrate Neon's technology to enhance its data processing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have secured a $96 billion agreement to provide Qatar Airways with up to 210 aircraft, including 787 Dreamliners and 777X planes powered by GE engines. According to the White House, this is Boeing's largest-ever widebody order and largest-ever 787 order, and was formalized during President Trump's state visit with the emir of Qatar. The White House estimates that the deal will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over 1 million domestic jobs during the production and delivery of the aircraft. The deal could provide a financial boost for Boeing, which has faced safety concerns, manufacturing defects, and trade disruptions, while also nearly doubling Qatar Airways' fleet.</p>

          <p>Senator Amy Klobuchar is set to deliver a speech criticizing President Trump's use of executive power, arguing that he is attempting to make the executive office immune from accountability. Klobuchar, a potential 2028 presidential candidate, will contend that Trump disregards the rule of law and views the judiciary as a hindrance. She also plans to highlight the impact of tariffs on small businesses, farmers, and consumers. Klobuchar's remarks come amid ongoing debate within the Democratic party regarding its leadership and strategy following recent electoral setbacks.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump administration's decision to cut $450 million in grants to Harvard University, President Alan Garber has announced a voluntary 25% pay cut for the upcoming fiscal year. This action follows pledges from dozens of tenured professors to donate 10% of their salaries in protest of the funding cuts. Harvard filed a lawsuit in April after the Trump administration froze $2.2 billion in federal funding, citing concerns over race discrimination and anti-Semitic harassment on campus. The university has rejected the administration's conditions for resuming funding, which include changes to leadership and halting diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.</p>

          <p>U.S. overdose deaths fell by 27% in 2024, marking the largest one-year decline ever recorded, with approximately 80,000 deaths compared to 110,000 in 2023. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that all but two states experienced declines, attributing the reduction to increased availability of naloxone, expanded addiction treatment, and shifts in drug use patterns. Despite this significant drop, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, underscoring the need for continued efforts and funding to address the crisis. Experts also worry that the Trump administration may focus more on law enforcement than on public health.</p>

          <p>A $250,000 annuity could generate monthly payments ranging from $1,200 to over $2,600, influenced by factors like age, gender, and contract structure, (not investment advice). For example, a 65-year-old man could receive about $1,675 per month, while a woman of the same age might get around $1,550. Strategies to maximize annuity investments include shopping for the best rates, considering a laddering strategy, assessing health and family history, balancing guaranteed income with flexibility, and understanding tax implications. Annuities provide stable income, but it is important to carefully consider contract terms and compare options from multiple providers. (not investment advice)</p>
