        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Atlanta has blocked President Trump's executive order aimed at overhauling elections in the U.S. The judge sided with Democratic state attorneys general who argued the order was unconstitutional. Trump's order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The attorneys general argued that the directive usurped the states' constitutional power and sought to amend election law by fiat. The White House defended the order as promoting free, fair, and honest elections.</p>

          <p>Left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone has been recalled to England's squad for their five-match T20 series against India. Ecclestone had been taking a break from domestic cricket to prioritize her wellbeing and recover from a quad injury. She missed England's T20 and ODI series wins over West Indies due to a knee injury sustained at the Women's Premier League in India. The India series will be Ecclestone's first time representing England since January's Ashes defeat in Australia. She replaces leg-spinner Sarah Glenn in the 14-player squad, with the series being England's last before the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chipotle CEO Scott Boatwright says that the company's use of artificial intelligence in its hiring process has reduced hiring time by 75%. The AI platform, named Ava Cado, handles tasks such as chatting with candidates, answering questions about Chipotle, scheduling interviews, and sending offers. Boatwright believes this efficiency not only helps keep restaurants staffed but also ensures the company has the best talent available. This hiring speed could help Chipotle open more than 300 locations this year, which is nearly one every 24 hours. While the practice may come with downsides such as potential cybersecurity risks, Chipotle aims to remove waste and enhance the team member experience.</p>

The piece suggests that China's post-pandemic "opening up" offers a positive alternative to the political climate in the United States, where the author found people to be friendlier than they expected.</p>

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for an end to the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and advocated for issuing new licenses for drilling in the North Sea. Speaking at the Scottish Conservative party conference in Edinburgh, Badenoch argued that the Energy Profits Levy should be scrapped before its current 2030 expiration. She criticized the previous Conservative UK government for introducing the tax, claiming that there has been no windfall to tax for months. Badenoch emphasized the importance of energy security and natural resources, stating that Labour's extension of the tax is "killing the oil and gas industry." Opposition politicians have criticized Badenoch's comments as "out of touch."</p>

Meanwhile, an economic institute indicates tentative signs of recovery for Germany's economy.
