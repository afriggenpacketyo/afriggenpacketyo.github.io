          <p>This article discusses the film *Warfare*, which recreates a traumatic experience from the Iraq War for a platoon of Navy SEALs.  The film's director, Ray Mendoza, a former Navy SEAL himself, sought to create an authentic depiction of combat, focusing on the mundane and emotional aspects rather than typical Hollywood action sequences. The film serves as a form of catharsis for the soldiers involved and explores the lasting impact of war.</p>
