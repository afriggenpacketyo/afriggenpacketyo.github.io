          <p>AI company Anthropic announced it will provide its Claude for Enterprise and Claude for Government services to all three branches of the U.S. government for just $1 per agency for one year. This move mirrors a similar offer from competitor OpenAI and highlights the intense competition among AI firms to secure government contracts and deepen ties with policymakers. The U.S. General Services Administration will facilitate the partnership, which includes technical support for implementation. This follows other major government AI initiatives, including a $200 million Department of Defense contract awarded to Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and xAI to advance national security capabilities.</p>

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is establishing a new team culture centered on inclusivity, hard work, and meticulous tactical detail ahead of the new season. In a notable early move, he convened a meeting with all club staff, from players to cleaners, to emphasize that everyone is part of the collective journey. Frank's hands-on coaching style, a departure from his predecessor, involves leading most training sessions himself and demanding open communication. He has already demonstrated a no-nonsense approach by disciplining a key player for lateness, signaling his commitment to a culture rooted in honesty and equal treatment for all team members.</p>

          <p>Policy experts are forecasting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026, based on the latest government inflation data. This potential increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment provided in 2025. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration based on the average inflation for July, August, and September, as measured by the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The final figure will be announced in October and could be influenced by economic factors like new tariffs over the next two months. (not investment advice)</p>

The man, who had an above-average understanding of survival skills, built a shelter from moss and sticks and drank pond water to stay alive. He also carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud to attract attention from search teams. He was eventually spotted by a rescue helicopter, severely dehydrated and with a leg injury, and was taken to a hospital for treatment. Rescuers noted that despite his skills, he was lucky to be found when he was.</p>

          <p>Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has revealed he is consciously trying to move away from his well-known "party guy" reputation as he enters his 13th NFL season. In a recent interview, the 35-year-old athlete explained that he wants to be more strategic about his public portrayal and focus on being respected by those he works with. Kelce credited his girlfriend, Taylor Swift, as an influence, noting her calm and relatable stage presence has shown him a different side of entertainment beyond high energy. He stated a desire to leave his profession better than he found it, a value he says he shares with Swift.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, saw its shares rise after its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. The firm announced a 53% year-over-year revenue increase to $658.1 million, fueled by a 90% growth in USDC circulation. Despite posting a net loss due to non-cash charges related to its IPO, the strong revenue growth reflects increasing institutional interest in stablecoins, bolstered by more supportive crypto legislation. CEO Jeremy Allaire noted a surge in engagement from major financial institutions since the company went public and new stablecoin regulations were passed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paraguayan officials are proposing a new law to allow local companies to assemble electronic and digital goods using imported parts, primarily from China. The plan, presented to the Senate, aims to create jobs and cut costs by shifting from importing fully assembled products to local manufacturing, with items branded as "Made in Paraguay." This initiative comes as Paraguay debates its diplomatic ties with Taiwan versus China and seeks to capitalize on global trade frictions, such as U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Officials believe the policy could make Paraguay an attractive hub for assembly services, similar to its successful domestic motorcycle assembly industry.</p>

          <p>During a family holiday in the Cotswolds, U.S. Vice President JD Vance held a private meeting with Conservative shadow secretaries Robert Jenrick and Chris Philp. The meeting was reportedly initiated by Vance's team, though a planned meeting with Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch did not occur due to scheduling conflicts. Vance's visit, which has included official engagements and cultural tours, has drawn some attention, with his presence prompting road closures and a heavy security detail in the area.
