          <p>Zia Yusuf, who recently resigned as Reform UK chairman, is returning to the party in a new capacity leading the "Doge team," modeled after Donald Trump's efficiency department. Yusuf cited exhaustion after 11 months of volunteering to build the party as the reason for his initial departure. Party leader Nigel Farage stated that Yusuf regretted his actions and will now take on a more public-facing role. This reversal follows Yusuf's criticism of a party member's controversial remarks, showcasing internal disagreements within Reform UK.

          <p>More than 100 dogs were rescued from a suspected puppy mill in North Carolina, where they were found living in poor conditions. The SPCA of Wake County removed the dogs, which were kept in cramped cages surrounded by waste, and are now providing medical care for various health issues, including skin and dental problems. The homeowner surrendered 21 chickens in addition to the dogs, and the rescued animals are being medically evaluated before being placed in foster homes and eventually made available for adoption. The shelter is seeking community support to aid in the rehabilitation and rehoming of these animals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst ongoing parliamentary deadlock in France, politicians have turned to addressing historical injustices through symbolic initiatives. Recent actions include posthumously promoting Alfred Dreyfus, recognizing returnees from Indochina, and addressing Haiti's "double debt." While these measures offer symbolic recognition and potential reparations, they do not address the structural reforms needed in areas such as pensions and education. Some view these initiatives as a sign of social maturity, while others see them as easier to pass than substantive policy changes, highlighting the challenges of governing in a politically divided legislature.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough spoke with Prince William about the severe damage inflicted on the oceans by destructive fishing methods, particularly bottom trawling, ahead of the UN Oceans Conference. He emphasized the urgent need for action to protect marine life and the ocean's ability to sequester carbon. The UN aims to galvanize support for the High Seas Treaty, which seeks to protect 30% of the world's oceans by 2030, but challenges remain in balancing conservation with the needs of fishing communities. Scientists and environmental groups are advocating for stricter regulations, including banning bottom trawling in Marine Protected Areas, to ensure the long-term health of marine ecosystems.</p>
