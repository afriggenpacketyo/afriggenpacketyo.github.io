          <p>Kavan Markwood, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan who fell 21 feet at PNC Park, is recovering faster than expected from skull, brain, spine, rib, and lung injuries. According to Allegheny General Hospital, he is now off the breathing machine and out of intensive care, preparing for physical therapy. Markwood can talk, walk, and perform simple tasks, although he is still in pain, and his sister and aunt expressed gratitude for the support he has received. While the cause of the fall is under investigation, a Pirates spokesperson stated that Markwood showed no signs of intoxication, although he had consumed two beers, and friends and coaches describe his recovery as a miracle.</p>

          <p>British marathon runner Holly Archer responded to critics who questioned her choice of attire during the London Marathon, where she wore running briefs. Some social media users claimed she looked 'uncomfortable,' while others likened her outfit to a swimsuit.

          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. defended the independence of the judiciary and denounced attempts to impeach judges over disagreements with their rulings during public remarks in Buffalo. Roberts emphasized that impeachment is not the appropriate response to judicial decisions, highlighting the role of the judiciary in checking the excesses of Congress or the executive. His comments follow similar remarks by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who criticized attacks on judges and the undermining of the Constitution and the rule of law. The remarks come at a time of intense pressure on the justices as they navigate emergency applications arising from court challenges to Trump administration policies.</p>
