          <p>A study published in the journal *Science* details a breakthrough by Chinese researchers who successfully regenerated damaged ear tissue in mice by activating a specific "genetic switch." This mechanism controls the production of retinoic acid, a vital compound for tissue development and repair. The findings offer a potential new pathway for future research into human organ regeneration, providing hope for future medical applications. The scientists plan to continue their research to understand the evolutionary context of this regenerative ability.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured a 2-1 victory over Palmeiras, advancing to the Club World Cup semi-finals where they will face Fluminense. A highlight of the match was a goal from 18-year-old Estevao Willian for Palmeiras, who is set to join Chelsea in a high-value transfer, giving Blues fans a glimpse of his talent. Despite his goal, a late own goal from Palmeiras sealed the win for the English club in what was a competitive quarter-final match.</p>

          <p>The Hamas terrorist group has issued what it calls a "positive response" to the most recent U.S.-mediated ceasefire proposal for the conflict in Gaza. In a public statement, the group indicated its readiness to immediately begin negotiations on the mechanisms for implementing the proposed framework. This development has been met with cautious optimism, with President Trump suggesting a deal could potentially be reached within the next week, marking a significant potential step toward de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's President Lai Ching-te is facing criticism over his administration's approach to the island's World War II history, creating a political dilemma. Critics argue that his government is selectively celebrating the Republic of China's (ROC) wartime victory while intentionally downplaying its historical roots on the Chinese mainland before 1949. This approach is seen as part of a broader political strategy to emphasize a distinct Taiwanese identity, separate from the ROC's legacy.</p>

This approach allows the Dodgers to avoid making a rushed trade while awaiting the return of one of their key offensive players before the playoffs.</p>

          <p>Contrary to some claims, the new tax and spending bill does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits, but it does introduce a new form of relief. The legislation creates a temporary "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older, subject to income limitations. Policy experts clarify this deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just their benefits, and primarily helps middle-to-higher income recipients rather than fundamentally changing how Social Security is taxed.

          <p>New research has revealed that tiny, often-overlooked zooplankton are "unsung heroes" in the fight against climate change due to their significant role in storing carbon. These creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton near the surface of the Southern Ocean and then migrate deep below, where they effectively lock away as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars. This natural process, which had been underestimated, highlights a crucial component of the ocean's ability to regulate the global climate.</p>
