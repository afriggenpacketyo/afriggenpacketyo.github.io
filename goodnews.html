          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its "retention scheme" that would have awarded substantial bonuses to senior executives, following public and governmental criticism. The company had been accused of circumventing rules against water company bonuses by disguising them as retention payments linked to securing a ¬£3bn rescue loan. Downing Street and ministers expressed disapproval, stating that rewarding executives for mismanagement was unacceptable. Thames Water will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with public expectations, as the company faces scrutiny over sewage discharges and financial stability.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks 4-3 in a dramatic 10-inning game after Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched seven shutout innings. Despite Yamamoto's strong performance, the Dodgers nearly lost the lead due to a blown save and a late-inning rally by the Diamondbacks. However, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the 10th with key hits and walks, culminating in a walk-off sacrifice fly by Max Muncy. This victory helps the Dodgers maintain their lead in the National League West and avoid a five-game losing streak. (optimism_score: 75)</p>

The blood test detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's, and offers a quicker, less expensive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests. This innovation is expected to improve access to diagnosis and treatment for the nearly 7 million Americans affected by Alzheimer's. (optimism_score: 90)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans for a "Golden Dome" missile defense shield, promising to complete the project by the end of his term. The system, intended to protect against foreign threats, is modeled after Israel's Iron Dome and will cost an estimated $175 billion, though the Congressional Budget Office projects a higher cost. Trump claims the Golden Dome will intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. Experts have raised concerns about logistical and financial challenges, given the United States' larger size compared to Israel. (optimism_score: 60)</p>

          <p>An analysis in The Guardian argues that media focus on young men supposedly voting for the far right is misplaced, and that the more significant trend is young women increasingly turning to the left. While gender gaps exist in support for far-right parties, the primary driver is a leftward shift among young women. This shift presents a political opportunity for centre-left parties to focus on the priorities and values of female voters, such as climate action and strengthening the welfare state, rather than chasing an outdated interpretation of the "working-class" voter.
