          <p>Elon Musk has concluded his efforts to revamp government efficiency in Washington, leaving behind a mix of disruption and apprehension. Despite his departure, Musk's companies are poised to benefit from reduced oversight, raising questions about the long-term impact of his involvement. His initiatives, while controversial, have reshaped certain aspects of governmental operations, ensuring that his presence will continue to be felt in the capital. The shift raises concerns about potential regulatory gaps and the future trajectory of government interactions with private sector innovators, particularly in sectors where Musk's companies operate. The long-term implications of Musk's presence are yet to be fully understood.</p>

          <p>Japanese boxer Ginjiro Shigeoka is in stable condition following a craniotomy after his recent IBF minimumweight title match, according to his gym. The 25-year-old former world champion underwent the procedure after losing a split decision to Pedro Taduran and suffering a subdural hematoma. Despite not being knocked down during the bout, Shigeoka lost consciousness after the final bell and was rushed to the hospital. Due to Japan Boxing Commission rules, Shigeoka will likely have to retire, and his gym has received supportive messages from around the country.</p>

          <p>France is set to ban smoking in various outdoor public spaces starting July 1, including beaches, parks, bus stops, and near schools. The new regulations aim to protect children from secondhand smoke, with violators facing fines up to $153. However, outdoor caf√© seating areas will be exempt from the ban, allowing smokers to enjoy cigarettes with their coffee. This move expands existing anti-smoking laws in France, where smoking has been banned in indoor public places since 2008, and reflects growing support for smoke-free public areas amid concerns over tobacco-related deaths.</p>
