        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and China have reported making substantial progress in recent trade talks held in Geneva, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war between the two economic giants. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng noted the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." These meetings, the first since significant tariff hikes were imposed earlier in the year, have raised hopes for a reduction in trade barriers and a stabilization of the global economy. Full details from the talks are expected to be released soon, with speculation of potential tariff cuts, though some experts remain cautious about the extent of the agreement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order mandating the U.S. pay the same price for certain drugs as the nation with the lowest price globally, attempting to revive a previously unsuccessful initiative. The order directs the Department of Health and Human Services to align Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices with the lowest prices paid by other countries. This "most favored nation's policy" aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans, but faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it will stifle innovation. Similar attempts by Trump during his first term were blocked by court orders.</p>

          <p>Remember Monday, the UK's Eurovision act, is heading to Basel, Switzerland, with high hopes of achieving a strong result after years of dedication to their music. The country-pop trio, formed in school, have juggled their musical aspirations with full-time jobs, including teaching and West End performances, before committing to the band full-time. They are promoting their song, What The Hell Just Happened, all over Europe, and are hoping to avoid the dreaded "nul points" with a theatrical performance. The band members cite musical theatre and pop influences in their song, and emphasize the importance of friendship in their journey.</p>

          <p>Stocks in Asia experienced gains following indications of progress in trade negotiations between the United States and China, boosting investor confidence. Meetings in Geneva between US and Chinese officials concluded with both sides reporting "substantial progress" in easing trade tensions. The talks were the first since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures from China, which had left financial markets uneasy. Analysts anticipate that an initial agreement will involve reduced tariff levels, although economists have warned that trade barriers have increased the possibility of an economic downturn.</p>

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang discusses the current state of the US-China trade war, noting a growing recognition in the US that the trade war is unsustainable due to economic consequences. Yao believes the likelihood of a deal is high, with a potential rollback to the original 34% tariff level. The US may also demand China buy more American goods, such as farm products and Boeing planes. Yao emphasizes that both sides realize the path hurts everyone, leading to serious negotiations and an eventual return to the table, which may include the demand to buy more American goods.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay, revisiting an idea that was blocked in court during his first term. The proposal is a "most favored nation" pricing model, where the United States would pay the lowest price among its peer countries. The plan will likely face legal challenges and opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it would cut into profits and reduce research spending. Democrats have proposed similar ideas, and experts note the populist appeal of addressing high drug prices.</p>

          <p>High-protein versions of snacks and food staples are increasingly prevalent in supermarkets, with celebrities endorsing protein-rich products. Sales of these items are rising, with protein claims being added to both naturally high-protein foods and unexpected products like desserts and pizzas. While high-protein diets are necessary for building muscle, some experts believe the convenience and positive perception of protein have led to manufacturers using it as a marketing tool. Nutritionists caution that many of these products are ultra-processed and may not be as healthy as advertised, while excess protein consumption can lead to weight gain.</p>
