        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Virtual chronic care company Omada Health has filed for an IPO, joining other digital health companies signaling their intent to go public despite economic uncertainty. The company offers virtual care programs for chronic conditions like prediabetes, diabetes, and hypertension. Omada's revenue increased by 57% in the first quarter to $55 million, with a net loss narrowing to $9.4 million. The IPO market has been largely dormant, but Omada is not the first digital health company to file this year, as Hinge Health filed its prospectus in March, signaling to investors that it's looking to forge ahead.</p>

          <p>Pep Guardiola confirmed that Erling Haaland is "ready and fit" to return from injury. Guardiola has led City to six Premier League titles since joining the club in 2016, while he also won both La Liga and the Bundesliga three times apiece with Barcelona and Bayern Munich respectively. Guardiola has had to contend with a lengthy injury list, contributing to City relinquishing their four-year hold on the top-flight trophy, and they were also knocked out of the Champions League at the play-off phase. City can end a disappointing season on a high by finishing in the top five, as well as having an FA Cup final to play for against Crystal Palace on Saturday 16 May.</p>

          <p>Actor Liev Schreiber shared that his 16-year-old daughter Kai came out as transgender with a simple request to change her pronouns. Schreiber praised Kai, a model who recently made her professional debut in Valentino‚Äôs Fall Winter ‚Äô25 campaign, for being feisty and outspoken. He emphasized the importance of her visibility as a trans individual. Schreiber, who shares Kai and son Sasha with Naomi Watts, did not specify when Kai came out, but noted it "didn't feel like that big of a deal" because she had been so feminine for so long.</p>
