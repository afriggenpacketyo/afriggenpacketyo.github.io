          <p>The White House announced that a trade deal has been reached with China following two days of negotiations in Switzerland; however, China has only stated that the talks achieved "substantial progress and reached important consensus." U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer expressed confidence that the agreement would help resolve the national emergency, while Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was more reserved, noting only "substantial progress." The announcement follows President Trump's earlier announcement of a trade deal with the United Kingdom. China has indicated that a joint statement will be released soon with more details regarding the agreement.</p>

          <p>Marta Carsteanu-Dombi, paralyzed after a 2018 bike accident, has regained the ability to walk short distances through an innovative "digital bridge" technology developed by Swiss neuroscientists Dr. Jocelyne Bloch and Gregoire Courtine. The technology wirelessly connects an implant on top of her brain to a spinal cord stimulator, allowing her to move her legs with her thoughts. The digital bridge is a small titanium device implanted in the patient's skull directly over their motor cortex, the area of the brain responsible for controlling movement. After training, Carsteanu-Dombi took her first steps, marking a significant advancement in restoring mobility for paralyzed patients.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to sign an executive order to reduce prescription drug prices by 30% to 80%. He criticized pharmaceutical companies for charging significantly higher prices in the United States compared to other countries, attributing it to research and development costs borne solely by American consumers. Trump plans to institute a "Most Favored Nation's Policy," ensuring the United States pays the same price as the nation with the lowest drug prices worldwide. The president asserted this policy would bring fairness to America and save trillions of dollars.</p>

Overall, the year-to-date box office revenue has increased by approximately 16% compared to last year, thanks to the strong performance of these films and others.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced plans to overhaul the UK's immigration system, focusing on stricter English tests for visa applicants and their adult dependents. The proposed changes would also extend the waiting period for migrants to apply for settled status from five to ten years. Labour aims to create a system that is "controlled, selective, and fair", with a "fast-track" settlement for skilled workers. Critics warn that the new rules may split families and make it harder for migrants to settle in the UK.</p>
