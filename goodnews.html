          <p>Disneyland is celebrating its 70th anniversary, marking seven decades since it revolutionized the amusement park industry. The Southern California theme park, which opened on July 17, 1955, is hosting summer-long festivities, including the debut of a new show featuring a lifelike animatronic of Walt Disney. Despite a famously disastrous opening day, the park has grown into the world's second-most visited, drawing over 17 million people in 2023. The celebration highlights the park's enduring legacy and its continuous evolution, including recent expansions and technological updates to maintain its appeal.</p>

          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will begin selling their blockbuster blood-thinning drug, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount. This direct-to-consumer model, operating through their Eliquis 360 support program, allows the companies to bypass pharmacy benefit managers. Analysts believe this move will not negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated, and it may curry favor with the Trump administration amid concerns over drug prices. The move is seen as a strategic response to impending generic competition for the medication in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber has announced a major partnership with electric vehicle manufacturer Lucid and autonomous driving startup Nuro to deploy over 20,000 robotaxis within the next six years. As part of the deal, Uber will invest $300 million in Lucid, which will supply the vehicles, while Nuro will provide the Level 4 self-driving technology. The collaboration, set to launch in a major U.S. city next year, aims to scale a commercially viable autonomous ride-hailing service. The news caused Lucid's stock to surge significantly, marking a strategic expansion for all three companies into the growing driverless car market.</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition, after he experienced mild swelling in his legs. Press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that a comprehensive examination, including vascular studies, was conducted out of an abundance of caution. The tests ruled out more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease, and an echocardiogram confirmed normal heart function. The physician's report concluded that the 79-year-old president remains in excellent overall health, attributing minor bruising on his hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned six key leaders and affiliates of Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang with expanding influence across the Western Hemisphere. The sanctions target the gang's head, Hector "Niño Guerrero" Rusthenford Flores, and five other high-ranking members involved in crimes such as murder, human trafficking, and sexual assault. This action blocks their assets and prohibits transactions with U.S. individuals and entities, aiming to dismantle the group's operations. The move is part of the Trump administration's broader effort to combat transnational criminal organizations, which it has labeled as foreign terrorist groups.</p>

          <p>Representatives for resident doctors in the UK have engaged in "constructive discussions" with Health Secretary Wes Streeting in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike over pay. The doctors' union, the BMA, is seeking to negotiate a better deal than the government's current 5.4% pay increase offer, arguing that real-term pay has significantly declined. While the government insists it cannot increase the pay offer, it is reportedly exploring "creative solutions" and improvements to working conditions. Both sides will continue talks, creating a "window of opportunity" to find a resolution and avoid further disruption to the NHS.</p>

          <h2>Lawmakers Propose Classifying Extreme Heat as a Major Disaster to Unlock Federal Aid</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, with some Republican support, has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act. This change would allow states and local governments to access federal FEMA funding for relief and preparation efforts, such as cooling centers and heat adaptation projects. The proposal follows a deadly June heat dome and highlights that extreme heat, the leading cause of weather-related deaths, is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster. While some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue existing rules could cover heat waves, the bill aims to formalize the process for providing aid.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, a move intended to boost democratic engagement among young people. The proposal has ignited a debate over its potential political ramifications, with critics claiming it is designed to benefit the Labour Party, which polls strongly with younger demographics. However, polling data for 16- and 17-year-olds is limited, and their overall impact on election outcomes is projected to be small due to their relatively small population size and historically lower turnout rates. The fracturing political landscape could also see their votes split among various parties.</p>

          <p>The six largest U.S. banks reported a collective $39 billion in second-quarter profits, exceeding expectations and indicating surprising economic strength. Despite initial market shocks from President Trump's tariff announcements, a boom in trading, investment banking, and strong consumer spending have created a highly profitable environment. Bank executives noted that the corporate community has adapted to the uncertainty, and barometers for U.S. economic risk have cooled, pointing toward a "soft landing." The robust performance suggests that, for now, the financial sector sees the economy as resilient and benefiting from current policies. (not investment advice)</p>
