        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK party is set to announce its commitment to reinstating the winter fuel payment for pensioners and abolishing the two-child benefit cap, policies aimed at addressing cost-of-living pressures. The party intends to fund these initiatives by cutting net-zero projects and reducing spending on hotels for asylum seekers. This announcement follows increasing pressure on Prime Minister Starmer to alter his stance on both policies, highlighting internal divisions within the Labour party. The winter fuel payment provides up to ¬£300 annually to pensioner households, while the two-child benefit cap, introduced in 2017, affects approximately 1.5 million families. </p>

          <p>The World Exposition in Osaka is facing a significant challenge due to swarms of midges, causing distress to visitors and raising concerns about potential health issues. These small flies have infested the Grand Ring and various pavilions, forcing people to actively avoid swallowing them. While the midges don't bite, their dead bodies can trigger asthma and allergic reactions if inhaled, leading health experts to recommend wearing face masks. Organizers are responding by spraying insecticide, using growth inhibitors in areas with accumulated rainwater, and installing insect repellent lights to mitigate the problem, with cooperation from insecticide maker Earth Corp. </p>

          <p>New York City's beaches have opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, an increase from the previous year but still short of the required staffing levels. The city is actively working to address the lifeguard shortage through recruitment incentives, such as increased hourly wages and signing bonuses, as well as improvements to lifeguard stations. Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue expects staffing to increase as students finish classes and more lifeguards complete training. Despite the shortage, beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards on duty, with some adjusting their behavior to ensure greater safety. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Brownmiller, a feminist author and activist, has died at the age of 90; her influential book ‚ÄúAgainst Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault‚Äù reshaped modern views on sexual assault by framing it as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Published in 1975, the book provided a comprehensive history of sexual assault and challenged prevailing myths, leading to legal reforms and the establishment of rape-crisis centers. Brownmiller's work sparked both praise and controversy, with some critics accusing her of anti-male bias and others disagreeing with her views on pornography and victim responsibility. Despite the debates, her contributions significantly impacted the understanding and prosecution of sexual assault. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney of Canada has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian Parliament, a move seen as a strong affirmation of Canada's sovereignty and independence amid threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. This marks a significant shift in Canada's relationship with the Crown, with the last British monarch delivering a throne speech in 1977. While much of Canada's population is indifferent to the monarchy, the invitation underscores Canada's distinct identity and traditions. The move is also a response to Trump's undermining of Canada's sovereignty, and the tariffs that have threatened its economic stability. </p>

          <p>New government rules may allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to meet construction timelines. Housebuilders will be required to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports, with potential penalties for non-compliance. The government aims to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, addressing the housing crisis. The proposals have been welcomed by housing charities, who accuse developers of delaying construction to maximize profits. </p>
