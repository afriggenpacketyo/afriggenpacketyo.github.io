          <p>Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications has requested that major social media operators take action against disinformation and defamatory content targeting candidates in the upcoming parliamentary election. The government asked nine platforms, including X and Line, to clarify their removal processes and criteria for harmful posts. This move comes as both ruling and opposition parties express concern over the potential for malicious content to disrupt the election, which is critical for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's administration amid public discontent over inflation.</p>

          <p>New Zealand pop star Lorde kicked off the 2025 Glastonbury Festival with a surprise early-morning set on the Woodsies stage, drawing a massive crowd. Her appearance, which coincided with the release of her new album "Virgin," was so popular that festival organizers had to temporarily close the area due to overcrowding. During the performance, Lorde played her new album in its entirety, telling the audience about the raw and challenging process of creating it. The set marks a significant return for the artist, who has recently spoken about using therapy to overcome severe stage fright.</p>

          <p>After a difficult start following his record-breaking transfer, Argentine midfielder Enzo Fern√°ndez is now flourishing at Chelsea.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Coldwell Banker indicates a growing split in the luxury real estate market, driven by economic uncertainty. Ultra-wealthy buyers, with a net worth over $30 million, continue to make large, all-cash purchases, seeing property as a stable asset. In contrast, less wealthy but still affluent buyers are more cautious and sensitive to high interest rates, leading to a slowdown in some segments of the market. This divergence highlights how different tiers of wealth are navigating the current economic climate, with cash-rich investors leveraging their position while others pull back.

          <p>Bruce Springsteen has released "Tracks II: The Lost Albums," a massive 83-song box set of previously unreleased material spanning his 50-year career. Unlike his first "Tracks" collection, this sequel organizes the songs into seven distinct albums that were considered for release but ultimately shelved. The project aims to reshape the narrative around Springsteen's career, suggesting he was more ambivalent about stardom in the 1980s and more experimentally prolific in the 1990s than previously understood. This act of archival lore-building adds new depth and context to the story of the iconic songwriter.</p>

The author posits that this policy is a pragmatic, Jacksonian realism that is skeptical of foreign intervention but willing to use force to defend core national interests. The piece asserts that the action, which devastated Iran's nuclear program without American casualties, was a decisive act of statesmanship supported by the vast majority of Trump's base, who see preventing a hostile regime from acquiring nuclear weapons as paramount.</p>

          <p>Charlie English's new book, "The CIA Book Club," chronicles how the CIA funded a program to smuggle forbidden literature into Poland to combat Soviet domination during the Cold War. The review praises the book as a gripping thriller that documents the oral history of the Polish resistance, whose members used books and underground newspapers as potent weapons against communist propaganda. While the book focuses almost entirely on Poland, it powerfully illustrates how literature‚Äîfrom political satires to fashion magazines‚Äîcan serve as a vital tool for preserving culture and freedom in the face of authoritarianism.</p>
