          <p>Retail traders, largely coordinating on Reddit's WallStreetBets forum, have targeted GoPro and Krispy Kreme, causing significant surges in their stock prices. This speculative activity focuses on heavily shorted and low-priced stocks, echoing the 2021 GameStop mania. The renewed "junk rally" coincides with a broader market upswing, fueled by relief over tariff news and expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Analysts note that this speculative behavior is driven by the removal of perceived downside risks to the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Vladimir Lenin's mausoleum in Moscow's Red Square is experiencing a surge in visitors ahead of its scheduled closure for repairs until 2027. The tomb, which has preserved the body of the Soviet Union's founder since his death in 1924, was a major pilgrimage site during the Soviet era but saw interest wane afterward. The renewed lines are seen less as Soviet nostalgia and more as a final opportunity to see the historical curiosity, amid ongoing discussions about whether Lenin should eventually be buried. The article reflects on the site as a place where time seems to stand still.</p>

          <p>A South Korean court has reopened the case of Choi Mal-ja, who was convicted of grievous bodily harm in 1964 for biting off part of her attacker's tongue while defending herself from sexual violence. At 19, Choi was given a suspended prison sentence, while her aggressor received a lighter sentence for trespassing. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now 80, successfully petitioned for a retrial after decades of living with a criminal record. In a remarkable turn, prosecutors have apologized for the past injustice and asked the court to acquit her, marking a significant moment for victims' rights in the country.</p>

          <p>Republican Representative Mike Lawler has announced he will run for re-election in his competitive Hudson Valley House district, ending speculation that he would challenge Governor Kathy Hochul in 2026. Lawler stated that while he considers Hochul the "worst governor in America," his focus is on maintaining the narrow Republican majority in the U.S. House. His decision clears a potential path for Representative Elise Stefanik, who is also considering a gubernatorial run and has received encouragement from President Trump. Lawler's district is a key battleground that Democrats are targeting to regain control of the House.</p>

          <p>A haunting 1975 photograph by Stanley Forman, which captured a young woman and a child falling from a collapsed fire escape in Boston, led to significant safety reforms. The Pulitzer Prize-winning image depicted 19-year-old Diana Bryant, who died in the fall, and her 2-year-old goddaughter, Tiare Jones, who survived. The shocking photo prompted the city of Boston to implement new regulations requiring fire escapes to be certified as safe every five years, a rule that did not exist at the time. The image had a ripple effect across the country, raising public awareness and improving fire escape safety standards nationwide.</p>

          <p>The UK's Supreme Court has quashed the convictions of former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interest rate benchmarks. The court ruled that the jury directions in their original trials were incorrect, rendering the convictions unsafe. Hayes and Palombo had argued that their actions were common practice and known to their superiors, and that they were made scapegoats for a wider industry issue. This landmark decision concludes a decade-long legal battle and could open the door for other traders convicted in the scandal to challenge their own verdicts.</p>

This problem traditionally limits the number of variables that can be optimized simultaneously without overwhelming computational resources. The researchers demonstrated their system by creating an improved design for a stealth drone similar to the U.S. Navy's canceled X-47B program. Their software managed 740 variables to enhance stealth, aerodynamics, and propulsion, a feat previously considered impossible that could significantly advance aviation design.</p>

While New Hampshire ranked poorly for weather, it was number one for safety and in the top ten for healthcare and tax-friendliness. Notably, no Sun Belt states like Florida or Arizona made the top ten, as factors like public safety and healthcare access outweighed the appeal of sunny weather and low taxes for many.</p>
