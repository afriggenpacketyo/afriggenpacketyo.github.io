          <h2>Singapore's July Inflation Rate Drops to 0.6%, Lowest Since January 2021</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 02:53:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, reaching its lowest point since January 2021. Core inflation, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, also dipped to 0.5%, signaling a broader trend of price moderation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributes this decline to factors such as falling retail, electricity, and gas prices, along with an easing of global crude oil prices and contained food commodity price increases. This significant economic cooling strengthens the argument for the MAS to potentially loosen its monetary policy at the upcoming October meeting, aiming to provide a crucial buffer against the anticipated moderation in economic growth for the latter half of the year. Furthermore, the central bank expects core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025, down from 2.8% in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is forecast to experience temperatures up to 30C on the upcoming bank holiday Monday, with regions like the Midlands and North-West expecting the highest heat. This could lead to record-breaking late August temperatures in parts of Wales and Northern Ireland, with warm weather also anticipated for events like the Notting Hill Carnival. However, this brief warm spell will quickly end as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are expected to bring blustery winds and rain across most of the UK by Monday night. This transition signals a return to more changeable, cooler, and wetter conditions for the remainder of the week, offering welcome relief to areas that have endured a particularly dry summer.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-25 02:28:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper announced its intention to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in a transaction valued at approximately $18 billion. This significant deal, initially reported by the Wall Street Journal, involves Keurig Dr Pepper paying JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros per share, which represents a substantial 33% premium over the Dutch firm's 90-day volume-weighted average stock price. A key strategic element of this acquisition is Keurig Dr Pepper's plan to subsequently split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, U.S.-listed companies. This move effectively unwinds the 2018 merger that formed the third-largest beverage company in North America, signaling a strategic re-evaluation of its business structure.

          <p>Asian stock markets, particularly in China and Hong Kong, experienced significant gains on Monday, with the Hang Seng Index surging over 2% and approaching a four-year high. This robust rally was largely fueled by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at Jackson Hole, which signaled potential interest rate cuts as early as next month. The tech sector, featuring companies like Nio and ASMPT, alongside Chinese property stocks such as China Vanke, recorded strong increases. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining this momentum, while a potential capital rotation from the US to China following Fed rate cuts is also identified as a key factor driving recent equity market gains.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global labor markets are undergoing a significant transformation, moving from the "Great Resignation" of the pandemic era to what economists now term the "Great Stay." This new phase is characterized by fewer employees voluntarily leaving their jobs and a cautious "no-hire, no-fire" approach from employers. Economic insecurity and uncertainty are compelling workers to remain in their current positions, especially in sectors like IT, while companies defer hiring decisions without necessarily reducing headcount. This trend is observable in both the US, with decelerating nonfarm payroll growth, and the UK, where job vacancies have decreased across most industries. Businesses are awaiting clearer economic signals before committing to new hiring, reflecting a widespread cautious sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite a reported nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries for the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed significantly by 33%, indicating a strong shift towards the burgeoning EV market within the company's portfolio.

          <p>China’s central bank set the yuan’s daily reference rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, directly following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks at the Jackson Hole conference. Powell's signal of a potential interest rate cut in September has significantly increased market expectations for easing monetary policy, which caused the US dollar index to fall to a four-week low. Consequently, the People’s Bank of China made its largest upward adjustment to the yuan’s midpoint rate since January. The offshore yuan also climbed considerably, with economists now viewing a September Fed rate cut as almost certain, shifting focus to the scale and pace of future easing. (not investment advice)</p>
