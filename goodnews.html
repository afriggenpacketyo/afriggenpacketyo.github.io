          <p>Shares of identity management software company CyberArk jumped as much as 18% following a report that it is in acquisition talks with cybersecurity leader Palo Alto Networks. The potential deal, valued at over $20 billion, would be Palo Alto Networks' largest acquisition to date, reflecting a broader trend of consolidation in the cybersecurity industry amid growing AI-related threats. The move highlights the increasing importance of cloud and identity security for enterprise technology. Palo Alto Networks' stock saw a slight dip following the news.</p>

          <p>The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," recently signed into law, is set to provide a significant financial windfall for major technology firms like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. The legislation permanently restores key tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including immediate expensing for domestic R&D and 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures. Analysts predict these changes will unlock billions in free cash flow for these companies, providing them with more flexibility to invest heavily in AI infrastructure and data centers.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 13:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has introduced "study mode," a new feature within ChatGPT designed to assist students with learning rather than simply giving them answers. The tool aims to address educators' concerns about cheating by prompting students with guiding questions and asking them to work through problems step-by-step. The company, which says one in three college-age people already use ChatGPT, developed the feature in collaboration with educators and students. Study mode is being rolled out to all users and will be available in ChatGPT Edu, the version designed for universities, in the coming weeks.</p>

          <p>In his "Dear James" advice column, writer James Parker addresses a reader who worries they are missing a core human experience by not dwelling on the past. The reader notes they don't reminisce or fixate on past failures but do worry excessively about the future. Parker responds by humorously contrasting this with his own tendency to nurse old grievances. He ultimately advises the reader to view their forward-looking nature as a "superpower" and to use this gift to help others who are bogged down by regret, telling them they are free.</p>

          <p>Paul Wesley, who plays a younger version of James T. Kirk in "Star Trek: Strange New Worlds," explained his decision not to imitate William Shatner's iconic performance. Wesley stated that he rewatched the original series but ultimately chose to develop his own interpretation of the character, reasoning that this is Kirk before he becomes the legendary captain. The actor shared that he received Shatner's blessing for the role, who tweeted him to "take care of my crew and my ship." Wesley described the show as an optimistic and imaginative world filled with hope and positivity.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has completed a four-day visit to Scotland, which included opening a new golf course at his Aberdeenshire resort and holding talks with First Minister John Swinney. During their meetings, Swinney urged the US president to exempt Scotch whisky from a 10% tariff and to use his influence to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Trump, who also discussed North Sea oil taxation, described Swinney as a "terrific guy." The visit combined business interests with political discussions, including a meeting with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at his Turnberry resort.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to take over the Apple Card business from Goldman Sachs. This move would see the nation's largest credit card issuer absorb the high-profile portfolio, further solidifying its dominance in the market. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the business would mark an end to its troubled foray into consumer credit cards, which faced high growth costs and regulatory scrutiny. The deal would provide Apple with a more stable and experienced partner after its partnership with Goldman, which had been signed through 2029, proved challenging for the investment bank.</p>

          <p>Manor House Wildlife Park in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has announced the birth of four rare Sumatran tiger cubs, the largest litter born in the UK. The birth is a significant event for the critically endangered species, of which fewer than 400 are estimated to remain in the wild. The cubs were born six weeks ago to their 11-year-old mother, Terima, as part of a European-wide breeding program designed to maintain a healthy and genetically diverse population. Once mature, the cubs will be moved to other zoos around the world to continue the conservation effort.</p>

          <p>A recently passed tax and spending bill is making affordable housing development more attractive to investors and developers. The legislation expands and enhances the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), the primary tool for financing such projects, which is expected to help produce over a million additional affordable rental homes by 2035. Despite challenges like high interest rates and construction costs, developers see a growing opportunity in the sector. However, the industry faces potential headwinds from proposed cuts to federal rental assistance programs and persistent local opposition ("NIMBYism") to new developments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Royal Collection Trust received an insurance payment of more than £3 million following the theft of two historic snuff boxes from a Paris museum last year. The richly decorated 18th-century items were on loan to the Cognacq-Jay Museum when they were stolen in a daylight raid by masked robbers. The payout figure was revealed in the trust's annual report, which states the money will be used to enhance the collection. The report also showed record visitor numbers to Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle, with income from tourism reaching nearly £90 million.</p>

          <p>A painting bought for £150 at a Cambridge house clearance has been authenticated as an original work by Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí and is now expected to sell for up to £30,000. The mixed-media piece, titled "Vecchio Sultano," was part of a series illustrating "The Arabian Nights" that Dalí was commissioned to create in the 1960s. The anonymous art dealer who purchased it discovered it had been previously attributed and sold in the 1990s but had since lost its attribution. The rediscovery is considered significant for Dalí scholars.</p>
