          <h2>UK Government and Labour Party Propose Stricter Immigration Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 00:16:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several UK newspapers report on the government's and Labour party's new, stricter immigration policies. The government plans to require spouses, siblings, parents, and adult children of foreign workers to pass an English language test and will prevent care homes from recruiting staff from abroad. Labour also plans to tighten legislation that allows courts to grant asylum to foreign criminals under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). The papers analyze these policies as an attempt to seize the narrative from the Reform UK party, with Conservatives accusing the government of merely pretending to be tough on the issue.</p>

This investment aims to address infrastructure problems, attract workers, and revitalize the town center, with BAE Systems expanding its operations.

          <h2>US Halts Cattle Imports from Mexico Over Flesh-Eating Maggot Fears</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has halted cattle imports from Mexico due to concerns about the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins cited the northward spread of the parasite as a national security issue. The decision aims to protect animals and the food supply. The U.S. and Mexico previously eradicated the screwworm in the 1960s and '70s, but cases have resurged in parts of Central America and Mexico.</p>

          <h2>Trump Announces Executive Order to Lower U.S. Drug Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 20:47:30 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at lowering some drug prices in the United States by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay. The proposal, known as a "most favored nation" pricing model, aims to ensure the U.S. pays the lowest price among its peer countries. The plan will likely face legal challenges and strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry has long opposed the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it as discussions of the policy have regained steam in Washington in recent weeks.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has discovered 80 boxes of Nazi materials in its basement, confiscated during World War II. The boxes, sent from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941, contain propaganda and artifacts. They drew the attention of authorities who feared its contents could affect Argentina's neutrality in the war. The court has transferred the boxes to a secure room and invited the Holocaust Museum in Buenos Aires to assist in their preservation.</p>
