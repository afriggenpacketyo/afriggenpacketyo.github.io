          <p>During President Trump's visit to Riyadh, he and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman publicly expressed their close friendship at the U.S.-Saudi Investment Forum, which was attended by prominent CEOs like Elon Musk and Larry Fink. The event, held at the Ritz Carlton Riyadh, saw attendees waiting for three hours before the leaders arrived, leading to some executives sitting on the floor due to a lack of seating. Tarik Solomon, head of the American-Saudi business chamber, humorously noted the "strategic patience" required for diplomacy. The forum underscored the strengthening ties between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Mexico has significantly rolled back its controversial tourism tax on cruise ship passengers following strong criticism from the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association (FCCA). Initially set at $42 per passenger, the Non-Resident Duty was reduced to $5 and will be implemented on July 1, 2025. The fee will gradually increase, reaching $21 by August 1, 2028. The FCCA thanked the Mexican government for the agreement, emphasizing that it safeguards cruise tourism and benefits local communities. Cruise industry expert Stewart Chiron anticipated an amicable solution, noting that passengers might skip Mexico if faced with additional fees. (Fox News)</p>

Strategies include exploring online banks for higher interest rates, considering short-term CDs, and laddering CDs to take advantage of the inverted yield curve. Online banks often offer more competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and short-term CDs may currently provide better returns than longer-term options. A certificate of deposit (CD) can help, because today's leading accounts come with higher returns than the current inflation rate. (not investment advice)</p>
