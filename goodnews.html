          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has stated that the Tories must offer hope and focus on fixing problems rather than becoming a "repository of disenchantment." In an interview, she acknowledged the rising threat from Reform UK but expressed confidence in her leadership, citing Argentine President Javier Milei as a "template" for her approach to governance. Badenoch emphasized the need for the party to be resilient and to utilize its "heavy hitters" to regain public trust and electoral ground.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations despite challenges from a strengthening euro and mixed results in its investment banking division. The bank affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, citing disciplined cost management and business momentum. While fixed income and currency trading saw an 11% revenue increase, the origination and advisory unit declined by 29% due to market uncertainty and postponed transactions.

          <p>China is launching a program to provide monthly electronic subsidy coupons to its senior citizens, a rare move towards direct fiscal support for households. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden of elderly care and stimulate consumption in the sector, targeting seniors assessed as physically disabled. The allowances, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan per month, are part of a broader strategy to address demographic pressures from an aging population and strengthen the social safety net.

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, former traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed by the UK Supreme Court. The ruling raises significant questions about the prosecutions led by the Serious Fraud Office and could pave the way for other convicted traders to appeal. The case has led to calls for a public inquiry into the broader scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and the practice of allowing banks to conduct their own internal investigations.</p>

The 2-1 decision marks the first time an appeals court has weighed in on the matter, keeping the policy from being implemented and moving the issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. This finding presents a more achievable goal for many people than the commonly cited but less evidence-based target of 10,000 steps. Researchers believe that promoting a 7,000-step goal could encourage more people to track their activity and make practical improvements to their health, with benefits leveling off for most conditions beyond this number.</p>
