          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on the brink of striking due to stalled negotiations over pay raises, potentially impacting over 300,000 commuters. The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) says its members haven't received a raise in five years. NJ Transit CEO Kris Kolluri asserts he wants a fair wage agreement but must also consider costs to fare riders and taxpayers. Governor Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if the strike proceeds, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate a small percentage of daily riders. This article is a reflection of the stability of the economy, but there is potential instability.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is negotiating major deals to sell advanced AI chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, leading to internal divisions within the government. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies, others are concerned about potential risks, including the possibility of the technology benefiting China. Concerns have also been raised that the deals could lead to the world's largest data centers being located in the Middle East, rather than the United States.

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene epoch, when a land bridge connected the two continents. The study of fossils, including those of Dalianensis horses from northeastern China, shows genetic exchanges between the horse populations of North America and Eurasia. These migrations occurred between 50,000 and 13,000 years ago, with the Dalianensis horses living approximately 17,000 years ago.

          <p>In rural Japan, where severe depopulation has left many train stations unstaffed, transport operators and local communities are working together to repurpose these quiet outposts into hubs of activity. Unstaffed train stations and vacant homes are being transformed into places for tourists to stay, injecting new life into surrounding areas. This creative approach is proving successful in revitalizing rural areas. This article is a reflection of the stability of the economy and the creativity of the Japanese people.</p>

          <p>Come this fall, only older Americans and those with chronic health problems may be urged to get the Covid shot ‚Äî assuming the vaccine is available at all. For years now, scientific advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been debating whether to continue to recommend that Americans 6 months of age and older be immunized, or to switch to a so-called risk-based strategy targeting only the most vulnerable, as is the practice now in most other countries. The advisers are expected to decide on a way forward at a meeting in June. But the debate may have become irrelevant. New requirements for clinical testing of vaccines, announced earlier this month, may delay the availability of shots that had formerly been updated annually without complicated trials.
