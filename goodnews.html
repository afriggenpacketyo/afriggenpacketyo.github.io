          <p>Over two years after filing for bankruptcy, Bed Bath & Beyond is being revived with a new store format called Bed Bath & Beyond Home, opening its first location in Nashville. The relaunch is managed by The Brand House Collective, which plans to test a more focused inventory of home decor, bedroom, and bath products. To attract former customers, the company announced it will honor the iconic blue and white legacy coupons, a well-known hallmark of the original brand. While this marks a significant step, experts note the company's underlying financials remain challenged, posing an uphill battle for the brand's successful resurrection.</p>

          <p>Four astronauts from the Crew-10 mission have successfully undocked from the International Space Station, beginning their 17.5-hour journey back to Earth. The SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, carrying commander Anne McClain and her crewmates, is scheduled for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Southern California. This landing marks a change from previous missions, which typically landed in the Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico, a move made to ensure debris falls in a less populated area. Before departing, the crew handed over command of the ISS to the newly arrived Crew-11 astronauts, concluding a 148-day mission.</p>

          <p>An unexpected political friendship has developed between U.S. Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy, despite their starkly different political ideologies. Vance is currently on a holiday in the UK, which began with a family visit to Lammy's official country residence. The two have bonded over shared experiences, including challenging childhoods and their Christian faith, meeting several times since Lammy was in opposition. This personal relationship is seen as potentially significant for U.S.-UK relations, particularly under an administration that has often personalized foreign policy, even as both men have previously made critical comments about Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Shaman," directed by Colombian-born Antonio Negret, offers a unique take on demonic possession by grounding its story in the remote mountains of Ecuador. The movie follows two missionaries whose son appears to be possessed, forcing them to confront local spiritual traditions. Negret, who has a multicultural background, aimed to create a film with an "Ecuadorian soul," shooting on location and collaborating with the local Indigenous community. The film features dialogue in English, Spanish, and the local Kichwa language, and explores the Andean demon known as the Supay, providing a fresh perspective on the exorcism genre.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood established a four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis before severe weather suspended the second round of play. After an opening round of 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par and positioning him strongly for a potential first PGA Tour win. At the time of the suspension, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were tied for second place at nine under. Play was stopped due to lightning, with 21 players, including Justin Rose, still on the course and yet to complete their rounds.</p>

          <h2>Orlando International Airport Introduces Dedicated TSA Lanes for Families</h2>

          <p>Orlando International Airport (MCO) has launched dedicated TSA security lanes specifically for families traveling with children aged 12 and under. The initiative aims to streamline the screening process for passengers with strollers and other child-related items, which can often slow down standard security lines. Officials believe this will not only ease stress for families but also improve efficiency for all travelers by decongesting the other lanes. MCO, which processes a high volume of families, is one of a few airports in a new TSA program that also offers discounted PreCheck for families and is exploring other modernizations.</p>

          <p>The city of Seoul has launched an innovative program to combat loneliness by opening "warm-hearted convenience stores," which serve as welcoming spaces for isolated individuals. These centers offer free food, like ramen, and a cafe-like atmosphere where visitors can chat with social workers and each other, providing an escape from solitude. The initiative was prompted by a rise in "lonely deaths" and the growing number of single-person households, including many young people who feel disconnected. The program has been surprisingly popular, attracting thousands more visitors than anticipated and highlighting a deep societal need for connection.</p>

          <h2>Documentary 'It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley' Offers an Intimate Portrait of the Late Musician</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary, "It’s Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides a spirited and honest look at the life of the influential musician who died in 1997. The film moves beyond the typical doom-laden narrative, instead focusing on Buckley's rich and turbulent interior life through interviews with his mother, former partners, and bandmates. It explores his creative blossoming in New York, his complex feelings about his sudden fame, and his relationship with his estranged father, folk icon Tim Buckley. The article thoughtfully handles his death, presenting it as a tragic accident rather than a suicide, ultimately offering a dimensionalized portrait of the one-album wonder.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace deal at the White House, aimed at ending nearly four decades of conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev praised President Trump for his role in brokering the agreement, which they said opens a new chapter of peace. A key component of the deal is the establishment of a trade and transit corridor through the South Caucasus, connecting Azerbaijan to its Nakhchivan exclave. The U.S.-led agreement is seen as a significant geopolitical development, potentially diminishing Russia's long-standing influence in the region.</p>

          <p>With the recent passing of Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell, only five astronauts who journeyed to the Moon during the Apollo missions of the 1960s and 70s remain. This article reflects on the legacies of these pioneers: Buzz Aldrin, Charles Duke, Fred Haise, Harrison Schmitt, and David Scott. As NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the lunar surface, the stories of these remaining explorers serve as a powerful link to the dawn of space exploration. The piece highlights their historic achievements, from the first steps on the Moon to their lives after leaving NASA, underscoring the dwindling number of living connections to that era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, joining allies like the European Union and the United Kingdom. This coordinated action is designed to further restrict Russia's revenues and increase economic pressure on Moscow over its ongoing war in Ukraine. Canada's Finance Minister stated that the measure aims to limit a crucial source of funding for Russia's illegal war. The price cap policy allows non-G7 countries to continue buying Russian oil but only if the price is at or below the set limit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple's stock value increased by 13% this week, marking its largest weekly gain since July 2020 and adding over $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House appearance where CEO Tim Cook and President Trump announced Apple's plan to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. Trump stated that this commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt Apple from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating a major concern for investors. The positive market reaction was also bolstered by Apple's strong quarterly earnings report from the previous week. (not investment advice)</p>
