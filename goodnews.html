          <p>Boeing and GE Aerospace have finalized a monumental $96 billion agreement to supply Qatar Airways with up to 210 aircraft, marking Boeing's largest-ever widebody and 787 order. The deal, formalized during President Donald Trump's visit with the Emir of Qatar, involves the 787 Dreamliner and 777X aircraft. According to the White House, this agreement will support 154,000 U.S. jobs annually and over one million domestic jobs throughout production and delivery. This significant order could provide a much-needed boost for Boeing, which has faced financial challenges and safety concerns in recent years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's recent executive order aims to lower prescription drug prices by aligning U.S. costs with lower international prices, reigniting the debate over high drug costs for American patients. A 2024 RAND Corporation report revealed that U.S. drug prices are almost three times higher than in 33 other high-income countries, primarily due to a complex reimbursement system and the absence of national price controls. While the U.S. typically pays more for branded drugs, it also boasts a highly efficient generic drug market, accounting for 90% of prescription volumes, often at lower costs than other nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent blind taste test involving nearly 2,700 participants evaluated 122 plant-based meat products across 14 categories, revealing that some products rival or surpass their animal-based counterparts in taste. Twenty plant-based products received Nectar's "Tasty award," indicating that at least half of the participants rated them as good as or better than the animal-based benchmark. Impossible Foods stood out, securing six of the 20 awards. The study suggests that consumer preference for animal meat may be partly psychological, as taste differences become less significant when plant-based meats are incorporated into prepared dishes.</p>

          <p>New research indicates that men are twice as likely to die from Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, commonly known as "broken heart syndrome," compared to women. The condition, triggered by severe emotional distress or stressful events, leads to symptoms like chest discomfort and arrhythmia. The study, analyzing data from nearly 200,000 U.S. adults, found a death rate of 11.2% among men versus 5.5% for women. Researchers suggest the mortality discrepancy could stem from hormonal differences or physical stress being a more common trigger for men.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card balances have decreased slightly after reaching a historic peak, but remain high for many Americans. Strategies to reduce high-rate credit card debt include debt settlement, debt consolidation through personal loans or balance transfer credit cards, and credit counseling. Debt settlement involves negotiating a lower payoff amount with creditors, while debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan with a lower interest rate. Balance transfer credit cards offer introductory 0% APR periods to pay down debt interest-free. Credit counseling can help manage debt through a structured repayment plan and negotiated interest rates.</p>
