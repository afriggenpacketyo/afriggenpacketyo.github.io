          <p>Brian Wilson, who passed away at 82, is remembered as a visionary musician whose work with the Beach Boys defined the sound and spirit of Southern California. His ability to blend complex musical elements into seemingly effortless songs placed him among the greats like Phil Spector and George Martin. Wilson's genius lay in his control of emotion, articulating feelings of affection, fear, and disappointment through his music. Despite battling mental illness, Wilson continued to create, leaving behind a legacy of timeless classics and a profound influence on popular music.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration can no longer detain Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian activist, based on claims that he poses a threat to U.S. foreign policy. Judge Michael E Farbiarz stated that Khalil's career and reputation were being damaged by the detention, which was prompted by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Khalil, who has been held in a detention facility in Louisiana since March, missed the birth of his first child due to his detainment. Despite this ruling, Khalil can still remain in custody based on separate claims that he inaccurately completed his green card application.</p>
