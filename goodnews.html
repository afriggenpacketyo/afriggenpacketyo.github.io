          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, driven by a 73% increase in data center sales, reflecting strong demand for its AI chips.

CEO Jensen Huang noted that the Chinese market for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry. Despite these challenges, Nvidia's overall growth remains robust, fueled by the demand for AI infrastructure and chips used in applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. (not investment advice)</p>
