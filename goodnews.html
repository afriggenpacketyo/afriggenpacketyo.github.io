          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a narrow victory in a parliamentary special election, signaling a potential shift in British politics towards a more polarized, multiparty system. Sarah Pochin of Reform won by a mere six votes in Runcorn and Helsby, a traditionally Labour-held seat, highlighting voter frustration with both the Labour and Conservative parties. The victory was attributed to anti-incumbent sentiment fueled by economic dissatisfaction and immigration concerns, particularly regarding a local hotel housing migrants. The article also notes Reform's strong performance in municipal elections, potentially winning hundreds of seats, which could further disrupt the established political landscape. </p>
