          <p>Historians Jill Lepore and Jeffrey Rosen explore the history of the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing its design as an evolving framework rather than a static text. The article notes that the founders anticipated frequent revisions, with the Bill of Rights itself emerging from over 200 state-proposed amendments. It delves into the document's historical compromises, particularly regarding slavery, and the "second founding" through post-Civil War amendments. Rosen expresses concern that the modern political system, with an inactive Congress and an overly powerful Supreme Court, is not functioning as the founders intended, undermining the principles of deliberation and checks-and-balances.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy has revealed that the European Ryder Cup team is using a novel training method to prepare for the hostile environment expected at Bethpage in New York. Captain Luke Donald has provided players with virtual reality headsets that simulate the sights, sounds, and abusive comments they might face from the American crowd. McIlroy explained that the goal is to desensitize the team as much as possible before the tournament, noting that players can have the VR simulation "go as close to the bone as you like." This unique approach underscores the team's detailed preparations for their first win on U.S. soil since 2012.</p>

          <p>With the 2025 WNBA playoffs set to begin, sports analysts are weighing in on major questions, from top contenders to potential upsets. A key discussion is whether the postseason is better off without the intense rivalry between Angel Reese and Caitlin Clark, whose teams did not qualify. Experts are also identifying high seeds at risk, with the Phoenix Mercury and Las Vegas Aces mentioned as teams facing tough matchups. While the expansion Golden State Valkyries are considered a long shot, the Minnesota Lynx emerge as a popular pick to win the championship, driven by a "revenge tour" narrative after narrowly losing the previous year.</p>

          <p>Top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending three technology stocks—Broadcom, Zscaler, and Oracle—as strong long-term investments, largely due to their alignment with the artificial intelligence boom. Broadcom's stock is favored due to accelerating AI-related demand and a new $10 billion customer believed to be OpenAI. Cybersecurity firm Zscaler is recognized for strong growth driven by its Zero Trust and AI security solutions. Oracle has seen its stock rise after reporting massive growth in its contracted cloud revenue, signaling high demand for its AI infrastructure, which has significantly boosted investor confidence.

The meeting aims to address the escalating trade disagreements that have intensified since the U.S. renewed its tariff war earlier in the year. The talks represent an ongoing effort by both economic powers to find common ground and de-escalate tensions. The discussions are taking place at the Spanish foreign ministry as both sides work to resolve their mounting economic disputes under the leadership of their respective representatives.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores What the UK Labour Party Could Learn from a Progressive New York Politician's Success</h2>

          <p>Amidst a rapid decline in popularity for the UK's Labour government, this analysis looks to the success of New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani for potential lessons. Mamdani's campaign has resonated with voters through a sharp focus on affordability, offering clear, compelling policies like free bus transport and a rent freeze, funded by taxes on the wealthy. Observers note that Mamdani has crafted a strong, overarching narrative that clearly identifies who he is fighting for, a quality critics say is lacking in Keir Starmer's government. His savvy use of social media to connect with voters also provides a stark contrast.</p>

          <p>A team of doctors at the Kyiv Heart Institute performed a successful heart transplant on a 12-year-old girl, Kira Skliarova, during one of the most severe Russian missile and drone attacks on the city. The donor heart came from a 4-year-old who had died in an accident. The surgical team, led by Dr. Borys Todurov, risked their lives, driving through the bombarded city to retrieve the organ and conducting the delicate surgery as explosions shook the hospital. Kira, whose own heart was severely weakened by illness, is now recovering and has met the donor's mother in an emotional encounter.</p>

          <p>A proposal by Florida's Surgeon General, Joseph Ladapo, to eliminate all vaccine mandates in the state has faltered following criticism from public health experts and prominent Republicans, including Donald Trump. Ladapo initially announced his department would work to end every mandate, but the plan was quickly met with resistance. Trump defended the efficacy of traditional childhood vaccines for diseases like measles and polio, calling them uncontroversial. In response, the Florida Department of Health has scaled back the plan, now proposing to remove only mandates for vaccines not required for school entry, such as for chickenpox and hepatitis B.</p>

          <p>This article provides advice on handling potentially fraudulent door-to-door salespeople, prompted by a reader's unsettling encounter with an aggressive lawn-mowing offer.

Scammers often target older adults and may offer services like home repair or security system upgrades. To stay safe, the article recommends not opening the door to strangers, verifying credentials independently, getting all agreements in writing, and never paying the full amount before work is completed.</p>

          <h2>Advice Column Suggests Embracing Imperfection Over Paralyzing Quest for Moral Purity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-14 07:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this advice column, a reader struggling with moral scrupulosity—a constant and paralyzing worry about being a good person—asks for guidance ahead of Yom Kippur. The author advises moving away from an "optimizing" mindset, which seeks to do "The Most Possible Good," arguing it's an unrealistic standard for imperfect humans. Instead, the column suggests adopting self-compassion and reframing moral shortfalls as "missing the mark" rather than "sinning," a perspective rooted in rabbinic teachings. This approach, supported by psychological research, can lead to greater personal accountability and action rather than the paralysis caused by fear of not being perfect.</p>
