        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coinbase has emerged as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its inclusion in the index, positive regulatory news, and new product launches. Analysts point to the passage of the GENIUS Act, which establishes a federal framework for stablecoins, as a key catalyst that has negated previous negative narratives surrounding the company. The stock's strong performance is also linked to its close revenue-sharing relationship with Circle Internet Group, which has itself seen massive gains since its recent IPO. Despite concerns over declining trading volumes, the overall outlook remains optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has ruled to limit the use of universal injunctions, which are court orders from a single judge that can block a government policy nationwide. The decision, stemming from a challenge to a Trump administration executive order on birthright citizenship, found that such broad injunctions likely exceed the authority given to federal courts by Congress. This ruling is a significant victory for the executive branch, as it curtails a legal tool frequently used to halt presidential policies and will likely shift future legal challenges toward class-action lawsuits.</p>

In the article, she discusses her hands-on, DIY approach to her art, her identity as a Honduran immigrant, and how her complex artistic persona serves as a projection of her inner world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite earlier concerns, President Trump's recent tariffs have not yet triggered a significant rise in U.S. inflation, according to economic analysis. Companies have employed several short-term tactics to mitigate the impact, including pre-ordering goods to build inventory, absorbing costs to avoid price hikes, and using trade mechanisms like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. Economists caution, however, that these buffers may not last, and that consumers could still see higher prices in the latter half of the year.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential earnings from depositing $10,000 in either a high-yield savings account or a money market account. In the current rate environment, the top rates offered by both types of accounts are nearly identical, at approximately 4.3%. As a result, the difference in interest earned over one year is minimal, just a few dollars, making both options vastly superior to traditional savings accounts. The choice between them therefore depends more on other account features than on the potential for higher returns.</p>
