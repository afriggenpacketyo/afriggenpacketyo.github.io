          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a 27-year-old woman from Georgia, was found alive after being missing for three weeks while hiking in California's Sierra Nevada mountains. Slaton was discovered inside a rental cabin by the owner of Vermilion Valley Resort, who had accessed his property after snow plows cleared Kaiser Pass. She had taken refuge in the cabin after encountering a blizzard, surviving on leeks and the unlocked cabin which the owner had left open for emergencies. Despite a full-scale search operation covering nearly 600 square miles, the snowpack had prevented access to the area where she was found, and she was reported to be dehydrated but in good health.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has discovered that a tattered copy of the Magna Carta, purchased in 1946 for $27.50, is actually a rare 1300 version issued by King Edward I, potentially worth millions. David Carpenter, a medieval history professor, identified the document while searching Harvard's Law School Library website, and its authenticity was confirmed through comparisons with other copies and advanced imaging techniques. The document's journey to Harvard was traced back to a British auction house and a World War I flying ace. The article notes the Magna Carta's enduring relevance, especially during times when institutions like Harvard face challenges to their autonomy.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border. Judge Gregory Wormuth ruled that the immigrants were not aware they were entering a military zone and could not be charged with trespassing. The New Mexico national defense area was established in April along 180 miles of the border, authorizing US army troops to detain immigrants entering the area from Mexico. The judge contested the charges after defense attorneys argued that warning signs were inadequate to inform immigrants they were committing a crime.</p>

          <p>Cava reported better-than-expected sales and double-digit same-store sales growth, defying the slowdown experienced by the broader restaurant industry. Same-store sales grew 10.8% in the three months that ended April 20, driven by traffic growth of 7.5%. The company said diners have been trading up from fast food and down from casual-dining restaurants into Cava's bowls and pitas, a trend the company has seen for several quarters. The company raised some of its projections for the fiscal year, anticipating adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $152 million to $159 million.</p>

          <p>Tiffany Slaton, a US camper who had been missing for weeks during a solo camping trip in the California wilderness, was found safe after taking refuge in an empty lakeside cabin. Slaton became trapped in a blizzard and survived by taking shelter in the unlocked cabin, which the owner had left open as a precaution. The owner of Vermilion Valley Resort discovered her while checking on his property and recognized her as the missing hiker. After medical examination, she was determined to be in good condition, though dehydrated, and was transported to a hospital for further treatment.</p>
