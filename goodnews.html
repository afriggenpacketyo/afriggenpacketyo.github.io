        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Broadcom reported strong fiscal third-quarter results, driven by a significant 63% increase in revenue from its artificial intelligence products, which reached $5.2 billion. The company's overall revenue and earnings per share surpassed Wall Street estimates, and it provided an optimistic forecast for the current quarter. The growth is largely attributed to demand for its custom AI accelerators and networking components from major cloud companies. Broadcom's performance highlights its strengthening position in the competitive AI chip market, with investors seeing it as a potential challenger to Nvidia's dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of asset manager T. Rowe Price surged over 5% following the announcement of a strategic partnership with Goldman Sachs. As part of the deal, Goldman Sachs will invest up to $1 billion in T. Rowe Price stock and collaborate on offering private market investment products to retail investors and retirement plans. The move is seen as a way for T. Rowe Price, which has struggled with the shift away from active management, to innovate and expand its offerings. The partnership aligns with a recent executive order from President Trump aimed at increasing investor access to alternative assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Daniel Levy, the Premier League's longest-serving chairman, is ending his nearly 25-year tenure at the helm of Tottenham Hotspur. During his time, Levy oversaw the club's transformation, including the construction of a new £1 billion stadium and consistent European competition, culminating in a Europa League trophy last season. However, his leadership was also met with frequent protests from fans frustrated by a perceived lack of on-field success relative to the club's financial growth. The club's ownership reportedly decided a change was needed to achieve greater sporting success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial guideline known as the "$1,000 a month rule" helps individuals estimate the savings needed to generate a steady retirement income. Based on the 4% withdrawal rule, it suggests that a person needs between $240,000 and $300,000 saved to safely produce $1,000 in monthly income for 30 years without depleting the principal. This rule provides a tangible way to set savings goals by breaking down a large retirement target into smaller, more manageable monthly income amounts. The article emphasizes that while this is a useful benchmark, it should be supplemented with other strategies like annuities or delaying Social Security. (not investment advice)</p>

The event was part of the administration's ongoing efforts to cultivate relationships with Silicon Valley leaders. Notably absent was Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who was invited but could not attend, sending a representative instead. The dinner follows a public falling out between Trump and Musk earlier in the year, though the president recently predicted Musk would eventually return to supporting the Republican Party.</p>

          <p>A 13-year-old from New Hampshire, Jackson Denio, caught a massive 177-pound Atlantic halibut during a deep-sea fishing trip in the Gulf of Maine. The fish outweighed the teenager by nearly 60 pounds, and the catch could potentially set a new world record. Denio battled the giant fish for approximately 30 minutes before successfully reeling it in with the help of the boat's crew. The impressive catch occurred on Cashes Ledge, an area known for its rich marine biodiversity, about 100 miles off the coast.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation is abandoning a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to offer cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations within the carrier's control. The rule, introduced under the Biden administration, faced strong opposition from airlines, who argued it would increase ticket prices. Airline industry groups praised the decision, viewing it as a move away from unnecessary and burdensome regulations. The department is also reviewing other consumer protection rules, including those related to fee transparency and refund eligibility.</p>

          <p>In his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon and CNN correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the complex nature of pain and its treatment. He discusses how the brain processes pain signals, sometimes making mistakes like phantom limb pain, and how it can be trained to minimize discomfort through techniques like meditation and distraction. Gupta also examines the body's natural opioid system, which can be activated by actively savoring pleasurable experiences. The book aims to provide a comprehensive guide to understanding and managing pain, from its biological origins to non-medicinal coping strategies.</p>

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, raising its valuation to approximately $10 billion. This successful capital raise, which included investment from Nvidia's venture arm, is seen as a crucial step toward a planned initial public offering in 2027. An IPO would allow Honeywell to unlock significant value from its long-term investment in the nascent technology. Quantum computing holds the promise of solving complex problems far beyond the capabilities of traditional computers, attracting major interest from tech and financial industries.

          <p>The U.S. government will make a significant investment to distribute lenacapavir, a new long-acting injectable drug for HIV prevention, to as many as two million people by 2028. Hailed as a breakthrough by the medical community, the twice-yearly shot has been shown to be highly effective in preventing HIV transmission. The initiative, in partnership with the Global Fund and manufacturer Gilead Sciences, aims to roll out the drug in low- and middle-income countries with high HIV rates. This move signals a renewed U.S. commitment to global HIV prevention after recent foreign aid cuts impacted similar programs.</p>
