          <h2>Egg Freezing Popularity Increasing Among Young Women to Preserve Their Fertility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 19:04:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More American women are freezing their eggs to preserve their fertility, driven by declining birth rates and societal pressures to delay motherhood. Egg freezing for non-medical reasons became accepted 12 years ago, and demand has skyrocketed. Doctors state it is revolutionary, like the pill, giving women the option to delay fertility. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. Critics caution it is not a guarantee, with success rates declining with age and the number of eggs frozen, and that costs are high.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among American women, allowing them to preserve their fertility. The procedure involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, costing between $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, with additional storage and fertilization costs. Many companies now offer egg freezing as a benefit, but some critics worry about the emphasis on profits and the lack of access for lower-income women. The optimal age for egg freezing is in a woman's 20s, as egg quality declines with age. The biological clock is a reality every woman faces.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing has become an increasingly popular option for women who want to delay motherhood, offering them the chance to preserve their fertility. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage, but it does not guarantee a successful pregnancy. Success rates depend on the age at which the eggs are frozen and the number of eggs available. While some companies offer egg freezing as a benefit, critics caution that it can be expensive and is not accessible to all women. Experts recommend that gynecologists discuss egg freezing with their patients at a young age.</p>
