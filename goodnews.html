          <p>In an interview, President Trump addressed concerns about whether he needs to uphold the Constitution by stating that he relies on his lawyers to follow Supreme Court rulings. He also reiterated his desire for Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates, claiming Powell's reluctance stems from personal dislike. Trump clarified that he does not plan to remove Powell before his term ends in 2026, as he will soon have the opportunity to replace him anyway. The president emphasized the need for lower interest rates to boost the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a $1 billion school choice bill into law, enabling taxpayer funds to assist qualifying students with private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students $2,000 a year. Supporters of the bill, including President Trump, hail it as a victory for students and parents, while Democrats argue it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private education. Democrats believe the legislation hurts public schools.</p>
