        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a new law prohibiting smoking on all beaches, in public parks, and near schools and other public areas. The regulations, which took effect Sunday, are part of a national strategy to create a "tobacco-free generation" by 2032 and aim to reduce the impact of passive smoking. Violators could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700, although there will be an initial grace period. The ban does not extend to e-cigarettes or the terraces of bars and restaurants, a point of difference with upcoming rules in neighboring Spain.</p>

          <p>Mexico secured its place in the Gold Cup semifinals with a 2-0 victory over Saudi Arabia, continuing its title defense. Alexis Vega scored the opening goal in the second half, and an own goal by Abdullah Madu later sealed the win for the Mexican team. This marks the tenth consecutive time Mexico has reached the tournament's final four, where they are set to face Honduras. The match was a rematch of their 2022 World Cup group stage game, which Mexico also won, though they were eliminated from that tournament.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated significant progress in his return to pitching, throwing two scoreless innings against the Kansas City Royals. During his outing, he threw a fastball clocked at 101.7 mph, the fastest of his major league career. Despite his strong performance on the mound, Ohtani went hitless in four at-bats, and the Dodgers' five-game winning streak ended with a 9-5 loss. The start was Ohtani's third since returning from elbow surgery, showing he is steadily rebuilding his pitching stamina.</p>

          <p>Major cities across the United States, including New York and San Francisco, are holding large-scale Pride parades, marking the culmination of a month of LGBTQ+ celebrations. This year's events carry a tone of defiance, with themes like ‚ÄúRise Up: Pride in Protest,‚Äù in response to recent political and legislative challenges to LGBTQ+ rights under the Trump administration. Organizers note a more pronounced protest element compared to recent years, which is further compounded by a noticeable pullback in corporate sponsorships from major companies. The marches blend jubilant street parties with a firm stance on protecting hard-won rights.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan for major food retailers and manufacturers to voluntarily help customers make healthier choices to combat rising obesity rates. Under the partnership, businesses will decide on their own methods, which could include offering promotions on healthy items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts. While the initiative will require companies to report on healthy food sales for accountability, it does not impose specific targets. Critics note that previous voluntary industry partnerships have had mixed success and that the higher cost of healthy food remains a significant barrier for many consumers.</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to improve results for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during a domestic competition to foster team unity and build resilience to the challenges of unfamiliar Olympic environments. The initiative requires swimmers to share rooms and travel by bus to the venue, simulating Olympic conditions. Officials and athletes, including Paris silver medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, have reported that the experience has already boosted motivation and team morale.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program is being trialed in primary schools across Kent, England, to teach children as young as five about sun safety. The initiative aims to reduce future cases of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, by instilling good habits early in life. Pupils learn how to read UV indexes, apply sunscreen correctly, and understand the risks of sun exposure, as sunburn in childhood significantly increases later risk. Amid projections of rising melanoma diagnoses, the program is planned for a nationwide rollout in 2026 as part of the standard health curriculum.</p>

The H2A series, which had a 98 percent success rate, is being retired and replaced by the new, more cost-effective H3 rocket.

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a massive demonstration of solidarity and defiance against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The huge turnout was largely seen as a direct response to the government's attempts to ban the march using a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban by organizing the event himself, transforming the annual Pride celebration into a broader protest for human rights and a clear rebuke of Orban's increasingly authoritarian rule.</p>

          <p>The WE League, Japan's professional women's football league, concluded its fourth season with a record total attendance of over 337,000 spectators. This success is attributed to innovative promotional strategies, including a doubleheader event with the men's J2 League that drew over 26,000 fans to a single women's match. The league, now working in tandem with the men's J-League, has also seen individual clubs like Sanfrecce Hiroshima Regina achieve massive crowds through player-led campaigns. The growth represents a significant positive step for women's sports in the country.</p>

The 22-year-old's journey to this moment is remarkable; twelve years ago, as a nine-year-old youth player, he was a mascot for the senior England team at Wembley. After developing at Norwich City and overcoming injuries and personal challenges, Rowe's move to French club Marseille has culminated in a career-defining goal for his country.
