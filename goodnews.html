          <p>South Africa has downgraded Taiwan‚Äôs representative office, relocating it from Pretoria to Johannesburg, signaling a deepening alignment with Beijing. The office had been maintained since Nelson Mandela‚Äôs administration cut formal ties with Taipei in 1998. Meanwhile, Somalia has banned Taiwanese passport holders, seen as retaliation for Taiwan's growing ties with Somaliland. Experts note that Beijing was once very forthright and forceful about prying African recognition from Taiwan, and the deepening relationship had prompted African states to be reluctant to offend Beijing by giving Taiwan any prominence.</p>

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, plans to sell government-stockpiled rice directly to retailers to lower prices to 2,000 yen per 5 kg, aiming to alleviate consumer burden due to soaring rice prices. The reserve rice is expected to reach store shelves as early as June, with procedures for negotiated contracts likely commencing on Monday. Koizumi also discussed potential online sales with Rakuten Group Inc. The move comes as average rice prices in Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg, nearly double last year's level, due to poor harvests and increased demand.</p>

NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hailed the "pioneering new model of care", while Andy Bell of the Centre for Mental Health expressed skepticism and called for better funding of NHS mental health services.

          <p>Reform UK is preparing to govern Lancashire County Council, having secured a significant majority in recent local elections. The party aims to review the council's budget, focusing on resident-centric services and addressing legacy issues like special educational needs and adult social care. Reform UK has been criticized for a lack of clarity in its plans, with the party signaling priorities including reversing net zero initiatives and challenging diversity policies. Protests occurred outside the first full meeting of the new council, with trade unionists expressing concerns about potential service and job cuts.</p>

          <p>China has greenlit a 767-kilometer canal linking Jiangxi province to Zhejiang, aiming to lower logistical costs and integrate inland regions with wealthier coastal hubs. The Jiangxi-Zhejiang Canal is part of a mega-project connecting Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang by water. With an estimated investment of 320 billion yuan, it is expected to be the most expensive artificial canal ever built in China. Once completed, the canal would accommodate 1,000-tonne vessels and handle around 25 million tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

Trump expressed impatience with ongoing trade negotiations and indicated his plan to raise tariffs on June 1. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, emphasizing the need for negotiations.</p>
