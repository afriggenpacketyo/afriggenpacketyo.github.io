          <p>Spanish police have arrested three individuals and are investigating five others for running a "spiritual retreat" in Pedreguer that allegedly provided dangerous hallucinogenic substances to clients. For over $1,160, participants were offered multi-day stays involving the consumption of ayahuasca, San Pedro cactus, and Kambo, a toxic frog venom. The investigation began after a victim filed a complaint, revealing a company that promoted mystical experiences online to a global clientele but lacked medical safeguards. Authorities seized various substances, including 11 liters of ayahuasca, and said the group generated hundreds of thousands of euros in undeclared income.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has announced that over 100,000 people have applied for positions with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in just over two weeks. This surge follows the launch of a recruitment drive by the Trump administration aiming to hire 10,000 new agents to address what it calls "failed immigration policies." The campaign offers incentives like signing bonuses up to $50,000 and student loan forgiveness to attract candidates for roles such as deportation officer and criminal investigator. The hiring push comes amid a reported 1,000% increase in assaults on ICE agents.</p>

          <p>A nine-year-old springer spaniel named Maple is assisting Michigan State University researchers in identifying a harmful bacterial disease in honeybees. After retiring from a sheriff's office due to an injury, Maple was trained to detect American foulbrood, a deadly disease that affects honeybee larvae and can devastate entire colonies. This work is crucial for supporting bee populations, which are in decline due to various threats including disease and climate change. Wearing a custom protective bee suit, Maple's detection skills help beekeepers prevent significant financial losses and contribute to a broader effort to protect vital pollinators.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the strong American cultural condemnation of adultery, noting it's consistently rated as one of the most immoral acts in surveys, on par with human cloning. This intense view is linked to the revered status of marriage in the U.S. as a "moral pinnacle," which in turn frames infidelity as the ultimate betrayal. However, the piece highlights a contradiction, as studies show that cheating is not uncommon, and public reaction can be more forgiving toward celebrities involved in affairs. The author suggests that the simple, vilifying narrative applied to non-famous individuals serves as a way to avoid the complex realities surrounding trust.</p>

          <p>The selection of Alaska as the location for a summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin brings a unique historical context to the forefront, as the state was a Russian colony from 1799 to 1867. Russia sold the territory to the United States for $7.2 million to pay off debts from the 1853-56 Crimean War, a conflict that, like the current war in Ukraine, involved the Crimean peninsula. While the meeting's location is primarily practical, the shared history is being noted, with some in Russia pointing to the region's past. This historical backdrop adds a layer of symbolism to the talks focused on the current war.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their tariff truce for another 90 days, averting a significant escalation in their trade war just before the deadline. The extension keeps U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods at 30% and Chinese tariffs on American goods at 10%, providing more time for negotiations on a range of economic and security issues. This move is seen as a stabilizing factor for global trade and increases the likelihood of a future summit between President Trump and President Xi. Analysts believe the next steps will involve further official meetings to lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Swiss bank UBS, global investors are increasingly allocating capital to China's $25 trillion domestic bond market as they seek alternatives to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This trend is part of a broader, albeit slow, move towards de-dollarization. As of May, foreign investors held $587 billion in yuan-denominated Chinese bonds, a rebound from a low in 2023. The influx is supported by Beijing's efforts to simplify foreign investment procedures and the inclusion of Chinese bonds in major global indices like the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, attracting institutional investors such as central banks and pension funds.

          <p>President Trump has indicated he is open to a deal that would permit Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its most advanced AI chip, the Blackwell system, to China. Speaking at a press conference, Trump suggested he could approve a version with its performance reduced by "30% to 50%," and mentioned he plans to meet with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. This potential policy shift follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD will pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. The move reflects an evolving strategy on tech exports, potentially allowing U.S. firms to maintain market presence. (not investment advice)</p>

The brand now anticipates annual sales of 2.91 billion Swiss francs, despite facing new tariffs on its products imported from Vietnam, where it sources 90% of its goods. The company successfully offset the tariff costs by raising prices, primarily on its lifestyle products, without seeing a slowdown in consumer demand.

It played a significant role in bridging the "digital divide" by using existing telephone lines, making access more widespread.
