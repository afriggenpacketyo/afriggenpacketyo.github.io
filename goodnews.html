          <p>President Trump has pardoned two South Florida shark divers, Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., who were convicted of theft for freeing 19 sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's line in 2022. The divers, believing it was an illegal fishing line, freed the animals and reported the incident to state wildlife officials. Federal prosecutors later charged them with theft, claiming the line belonged to a licensed fisherman conducting research. The pardons erase the felony convictions, allowing them to vote, own firearms, and travel freely outside the U.S. The divers' attorneys expressed relief, stating that the case should never have been filed. </p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation dropped to 1.9% in May, according to Eurostat data, falling below the European Central Bank's 2% target. Core inflation, excluding energy, food, tobacco, and alcohol, decreased from 2.7% to 2.3%, while services inflation cooled from 4% to 3.2%. The ECB is expected to consider these figures when making its next interest rate decision later this week, with markets anticipating a 25-basis-point rate cut. Uncertainty remains due to President Trump's tariff plans, which could impact economic growth, although the OECD projects the euro area to expand by 1% in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

R360 is a revolutionary franchise league aiming to attract the game's biggest stars, with plans to launch next year.
