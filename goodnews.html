          <p>Shohei Ohtani's poor performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series, where he went one for 18 with nine strikeouts, has raised significant concerns for the upcoming NL Championship Series. Manager Dave Roberts attributed some of the struggles to tough left-handed pitching but emphasized that Ohtani's "at-bat quality needs to get better." Roberts stressed that the team cannot win the World Series with such a performance, calling for a "recalibration" from the superstar. The article highlights Ohtani's importance to the lineup and the need for him to adjust his approach.</p>

          <p>British heavyweight boxer David Allen faced a unanimous points defeat against Russian Arslanbek Makhmudov in a headline fight at Sheffield Arena. Despite the loss, the 33-year-old Doncaster boxer, who returned to the sport after a five-year hiatus, expressed determination to continue his career, deeply moved by the 9,000-strong home crowd. Makhmudov, with a formidable record, proved to be Allen's toughest opponent yet. Allen, known as 'White Rhino,' has faced numerous setbacks in his 13-year professional career but remains committed to rebuilding, having previously knocked out Johnny Fisher in a rematch earlier this year.</p>

          <p>The UK clocks will go back one hour on Sunday, October 26, 2025, marking the end of British Summer Time (BST) and the return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual change, occurring at 02:00 BST, grants most people an extra hour but extends night shifts. The tradition, dating back to 1916, was initially implemented to save fuel during wartime. While arguments persist for permanent BST to boost productivity and reduce accidents, concerns about dark winter mornings, especially in Scotland, remain a significant counterpoint.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's participation in Sunday's preseason game against the Golden State Warriors remains "to be determined," despite his full practice involvement. Lakers coach JJ Redick stated Doncic is expected to play in two preseason games before the regular season starts on October 21. Complicating matters, LeBron James will be sidelined for three to four weeks with a sciatica nerve issue, forcing the team to adopt a "next man up" mentality. Doncic downplayed the idea of carrying a heavier load, emphasizing his desire to simply play basketball and contribute to wins.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, with many reporting particularly nasty symptoms of common colds, flu, and Covid-19. Experts attribute this to a "perfect breeding ground" as children return to school and adults to work, increasing indoor mixing and waning immunity. While Rhinovirus is currently the most prevalent, flu and RSV are also on the rise, alongside new Covid variants. Despite the prevalence, health officials state current illness levels are not exceptionally high, and emphasize vaccination for vulnerable groups and basic hygiene for public protection.</p>

However, Hannah Read encountered incorrect information when AI suggested a non-existent ferry route to Norway. Experts advise fact-checking AI recommendations, as chatbots can be overly encouraging and sometimes provide poor advice, stressing that human research remains crucial for a smooth travel experience.</p>

          <p>As China drafts its 15th five-year plan, there is anticipation that it will redefine the country's infrastructure strategy, moving towards more tech-driven and people-focused projects. Previous plans, like the 2009 stimulus package, spurred massive public works but also contributed to local government debt. Despite these financial pressures, officials still see significant value in infrastructure investments for economic growth. The upcoming blueprint is expected to reflect high-level policy priorities and guide the evolution of spending to meet the demands of a new era. (not investment advice)</p>

While China has made strides with its underwater data center in Hainan, its global AI leadership requires looking beyond its borders for a competitive edge. The Trump administration's multi-billion-dollar deals to advance chip supplies to the UAE, including the Stargate UAE AI data center, demonstrate a strategic convergence between US investment and chip producer Nvidia. This coordinated effort in data center production and chip supply chain demands challenges China's bid for near-term dominance. (not investment advice)</p>
