          <p>A helicopter crew conducted a dramatic rescue of two hikers stranded on a secluded beach at Point Reyes National Seashore in California. The pair became trapped near a hazardous area known as Elephant Rock when the rising tide cut off their only exit route. Lacking safe access by land or sea, emergency services dispatched a helicopter to hoist the hikers to safety using a 100-foot line and a harness. No injuries were reported, and officials used the incident to remind visitors of the coastline's dangers and the importance of checking tide charts.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a landmark defense agreement valued at $6.5 billion. The deal represents the largest-ever defense industry agreement between the two nations and is Japan's first warship export since before World War II. Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles stated the decision was based on securing the best capability, emphasizing the stealthy, next-generation vessel's advanced missile systems. This move is part of Australia's broader military restructuring to counter China's expansion and aims to more than double its fleet of major warships.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) has agreed to a $1.7 million settlement to resolve a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The lawsuit claimed that UPS discarded corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials in regular trash bins, which were then sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. Officials noted that UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has since implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <p>It is currently tarantula mating season in California, leading to a higher likelihood of spotting the large, fuzzy spiders as males leave their burrows in search of mates. This period, lasting from August to December, makes the otherwise secretive creatures highly visible, especially at dusk in chaparral, desert, and mountain areas. Experts note that while their appearance can be intimidating, native U.S. tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Their primary defense involves flicking irritant hairs, which can cause a rash but pose no serious threat.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists and cave explorers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of Bronze Age cattle, inside a cave in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The survey, part of a larger heritage project, also uncovered evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. These findings provide new insights into how prehistoric communities lived and farmed in the region. The project highlights the crucial role of recreational cavers in making archaeological discoveries in hard-to-access underground locations, ensuring that such finds are officially documented.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged over 20% after President Trump praised the retailer's advertising campaign starring actress Sydney Sweeney. The ad, which plays on the words "genes" and "jeans," had drawn criticism from some online who accused it of promoting eugenics, a claim the company denies. Trump lauded the campaign on social media, calling it the "HOTTEST" ad and contrasting it with what he termed "woke" advertising by other brands. The presidential endorsement fueled a meme-driven rally for the company, which has recently faced financial headwinds and slow sales.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that a rise in colorectal cancer screenings among people aged 45-49 is leading to more diagnoses at an early, more treatable stage. Following recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45, screening rates in this demographic increased by 62% between 2019 and 2023. This corresponds with a sharp increase in the incidence of early-stage cancer detection. While researchers find the trend promising, they caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that the stock market's recent rebound is primarily driven by the strong earnings and performance of major technology companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. Despite a weak labor report and concerns over potential tariffs, the market showed significant resilience, with the Nasdaq experiencing a notable surge. Cramer highlighted that these tech giants, which he calls "nation states," possess immense cash reserves, diverse revenue streams, and tight expense controls, making them incredibly robust investments that are difficult to bet against in the current economic climate (not investment advice).</p>
