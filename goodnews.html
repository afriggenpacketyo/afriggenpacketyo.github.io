          <p>Actor Michael Richards, famous for his role as Kramer on "Seinfeld," has returned to the public stage for the first time in nearly 20 years. His career was derailed in 2006 after he was filmed making a racist outburst at a comedy club. In his new tour, Richards is candidly discussing the incident, explaining that he spent the subsequent 17 years in a self-imposed exile to reflect on his actions and find faith. During his hiatus, he turned down numerous acting offers to focus on personal growth, spending time in nature to find order within himself.</p>

          <p>As "The Rocky Horror Picture Show" marks its 50th anniversary, its legacy as a cultural phenomenon is being celebrated by dedicated fan groups worldwide. These communities, like the Michigan Rocky Horror Preservation Society, keep the film's interactive traditions alive through midnight screenings featuring shadow casts that mimic the on-screen action and audience members who shout callbacks. For many, the film and its surrounding culture have provided a safe space for self-expression, particularly for queer and neurodivergent individuals. The article highlights how this shared experience has fostered a unique and enduring community, where being an outsider is celebrated and preserved as a piece of queer history.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is championing an ambitious youth migration deal with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic outlook ahead of the autumn Budget. The proposed scheme would allow individuals aged 18-30 to live and work in the UK for a few years, which Reeves argues would be beneficial for economic growth and business. She is urging the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to incorporate the potential positive economic impact of this scheme into its official forecasts. This move could potentially reduce the need for significant spending cuts or tax increases to address a projected fiscal gap of £20-30 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent column reflects on stories from actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Benicio del Toro, who both faced pressure early in their careers to adopt less "ethnic"-sounding stage names. DiCaprio recalled an agent suggesting he change his name to "Lenny Williams" to be more marketable, while del Toro was advised to become "Benny Del." Both actors ultimately rejected the advice and went on to achieve massive success with their given names. The article uses a fictional fable about an aspiring actor who constantly changes his appearance to match others, only to be told the key to success is being himself, to illustrate the importance of authenticity in Hollywood and beyond.</p>

          <p>Premier League club West Ham has dismissed head coach Graham Potter after just eight months in charge, following a poor start to the season that left the team in 19th place. The club announced that a change was necessary to improve its position, as results had not met expectations. Potter won only six of his 25 matches with the team. Former Nottingham Forest and Tottenham manager Nuno Espirito Santo is set to be appointed as his replacement. Nuno is expected to be in place for the upcoming match against Everton, having held positive discussions with the West Ham board.</p>

          <p>The American state fair, a beloved pastime contributing $30 billion annually to the economy, has evolved significantly since its origins in the 19th century. Initially established as agricultural competitions for showcasing livestock and farming techniques, modern fairs have transformed into large-scale events resembling pop-up theme parks. While the agricultural roots remain central, with animal exhibits and craft competitions for coveted ribbons, fairs now also feature live music from major stars, amusement rides, and a vast array of fried foods. This blend of tradition and entertainment has ensured the state fair's enduring popularity as a staple of American culture from summer through fall.</p>

          <p>For the past ten years, Toledo tattoo artist Brian Finn has dedicated his days off to providing free or low-cost tattoos for people seeking to cover scars from traumatic experiences. His clients include survivors of domestic abuse, human trafficking, and self-harm, for whom the tattoos can be a powerful tool for healing and reclaiming their bodies. Finn explains that some people want to completely conceal their scars, while others choose designs that incorporate and transform them into meaningful art. After an initial NPR story in 2015 brought his work to national attention, he inspired a community of other artists worldwide to offer similar services, and he has no plans to stop.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are significantly shaping the design of a new wave of towns set to be announced by the UK government. A housing ministry official confirmed that 12 new towns will be developed with an emphasis on walkability, environmental friendliness, and "gentle density" like terraced housing rather than high-rise buildings. These concepts align closely with the King's vision, as seen in his projects like Poundbury, which prioritize traditional building styles and community-focused public spaces. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, the King's views on creating harmonious and human-scale environments are now being embraced as part of mainstream design.</p>

          <p>A 100-year-old mystery has been solved with the identification of two Scottish soldiers killed during the World War One Battle of Loos. The remains were discovered on a construction site in France in 2021, and a painstaking investigation by the UK's "war detectives" unit followed. Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson was identified through tiny tramway buttons found with his remains, which linked him to his father's job in Newcastle, a detail confirmed by a DNA match with his great-nephews. Lieutenant James Grant Allan was identified after the team traced and tested the families of 14 missing officers from his regiment, finally bringing closure to both families after a century of uncertainty.</p>

Founders describe the pain of disappointing investors, laying off employees, and losing their personal identity, which often becomes deeply intertwined with their business. After shutting down a venture, many face an identity crisis and a sense of having sacrificed everything for nothing.

          <p>Beijing is continuing to relax its visa requirements for foreign visitors in an effort to stimulate its tourism sector and attract more international travelers. The government has expanded visa-free transit policies, allowing passport holders from 55 nations to stay for up to 10 days in many parts of the country while transiting through its airports. Additionally, China has updated its bilateral agreements, recently granting Russian citizens the ability to stay for up to 30 days without a visa. These measures are part of a broader strategy to lower the bureaucratic and financial hurdles that have often made obtaining a Chinese visa a complex process for many tourists and business travelers.</p>
