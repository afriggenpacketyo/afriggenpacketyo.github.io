          <p>A Los Angeles jury has cleared Grammy-winning rapper Cardi B of assault and battery in a high-profile civil lawsuit filed by a security guard. The guard, Emani Ellis, had sought $24 million in damages, alleging that the musician spat on her and cut her cheek with a long fingernail during a heated confrontation outside a medical office in 2018. During the trial, which produced several viral moments, Cardi B testified that the guard was the aggressor, filming her and invading her privacy while she was pregnant. The jury took only about an hour to reach its verdict, finding in favor of the rapper and concluding the contentious legal dispute.</p>

          <p>Financial commentator Jim Cramer addressed Tuesday's market downturn, attributing the decline to seasonal profit-taking in September rather than fundamental issues with leading tech companies like Nvidia and Apple. He noted that investor anxiety is also being fueled by a federal court ruling against President Trump's tariffs and anticipation of the upcoming labor report. Cramer advised long-term investors to maintain their positions in strong growth stocks and not to overreact to single-day pullbacks, suggesting the current market behavior is a typical, albeit painful, part of the investment cycle that strong companies can weather.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 18:49:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zack Polanski's landslide victory as the new leader of the Green Party of England and Wales is analyzed as a significant shift towards a more brash and left-wing political style. This move positions the Greens to potentially challenge the Labour Party from the left, alongside other figures like Jeremy Corbyn, by appealing to voters disillusioned with establishment politics. However, this new direction also presents challenges, including the risk of cannibalizing support from other left-wing movements and alienating more moderate, rural voters who recently helped the party win new parliamentary seats. The change reflects a broader realignment on the British left.</p>

          <p>Defending champion Aryna Sabalenka has advanced to the US Open semifinals following the withdrawal of her opponent, Marketa Vondrousova, who pulled out just hours before their match due to a knee injury. This development sets up a highly anticipated rematch of last year's final against American player Jessica Pegula. Pegula secured her spot by decisively defeating Barbora Krejcikova 6-3, 6-3, showcasing a strong performance that continues her successful run in the tournament. Vondrousova's withdrawal is a disappointing turn for the 2023 Wimbledon champion, whose career has been frequently hampered by injuries.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot climbing to an estimated $1.3 billion, a new analysis of lottery data highlights how a winner's state of residence significantly impacts their net winnings. States with no income tax, such as Florida and Texas, offer the highest potential payouts, whereas states like New York have the lowest after-tax returns due to high state levies. The article also provides statistical insights for players by identifying the most and least frequently drawn white balls and Powerballs over the last 100 drawings. Despite these trends, the overall odds of winning the grand prize remain exceptionally low at 1 in 292.2 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Alphabet Shares Surge After Antitrust Ruling Avoids Forced Sale of Chrome Browser</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet's stock price increased by 8% in after-hours trading following a federal judge's ruling in its landmark antitrust case, as investors reacted positively to penalties that were less severe than feared. The court notably rejected the Department of Justice's most drastic demand: the forced sale of the Google Chrome browser. While Google faces other significant requirements, such as loosening its hold on search data and ending exclusive default-search-engine contracts, avoiding a structural break-up was widely seen as a major victory for the company. The ruling provides a degree of relief and clarity for the tech giant amid ongoing global regulatory scrutiny. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While China's upcoming military parade is set to showcase its modernized armed forces, some of the People's Liberation Army's most advanced and potent weapon systems will not be on display. Key assets expected to be absent include next-generation stealth fighter jets, such as the unofficially dubbed J-36 and J-50, which are still in the development and testing phases. Other critical systems, like strategic missile defense technologies, are likely considered too sensitive for public reveal at this time. Their absence indicates that the parade, while impressive, offers only a partial and carefully curated glimpse into China's full military capabilities.</p>

          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, is expanding its U.S. presence by beginning test drives in Denver and Seattle this week. The initial phase of testing in these new cities will involve human safety drivers behind the wheel to manually operate the vehicles while collecting data and mapping the areas. This expansion is part of Waymo's broader strategy to methodically roll out its fully autonomous, driverless ride-hailing service nationwide. The company already operates commercially in several major cities, including San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles, as it continues to validate its technology for future driverless operations in diverse urban environments.</p>

          <p>The government in England is planning to introduce a new law that would ban the sale of high-caffeine energy drinks to anyone under the age of 16. The proposed legislation aims to address growing concerns from parents, teachers, and health experts about the negative health impacts these drinks have on children, which can include headaches, sleep problems, and heart issues. The comprehensive ban would apply to all retail points, including shops, restaurants, cafes, and online sales. A 12-week public consultation period will now begin to gather evidence from stakeholders before the law is finalized and implemented.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust ruling, a U.S. District Judge has imposed several significant penalties on Google for monopolistic practices but stopped short of the Department of Justice's most severe demands. The judge ordered Google to end exclusive deals that make its search engine the default on devices and to share some of its valuable search data with competitors, aiming to restore competition. However, the court rejected the government's call to force a sale of the popular and lucrative Chrome browser. While a major outcome, the ruling is viewed as less disruptive than it could have been, and Google is expected to appeal.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Air Lease, a major aircraft leasing firm founded by industry pioneer Steven Udvar-Házy, has agreed to be acquired by a consortium of investors for $7.4 billion, a deal that will take the company private. The acquisition is led by Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital and is the latest sign of significant consolidation within the airplane-renting industry. The sector has benefited from a shortage of new aircraft from manufacturers, which has driven up rental rates for both new and used planes. This deal will significantly expand the scale of the acquiring companies in a market that owns over half of the world's passenger jets.</p>
