          <p>Billionaire Ken Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, has reported positive returns across all its funds for the first half of 2025, navigating a volatile market. The firm's largest multistrategy fund, Wellington, saw a 2.5% gain, while its tactical trading fund led with a 6.1% increase. These results come as the S&P 500 has shown resilience, reaching new highs despite trade conflicts and geopolitical tensions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) become a more attractive borrowing option due to falling interest rates, homeowners are advised to avoid several key mistakes. The article warns against failing to monitor the fluctuating rate climate, assuming HELOC rates will perfectly mirror Federal Reserve actions, and overborrowing due to rates being lower than alternatives like personal loans. It also cautions against using home equity for non-strategic, short-term expenses like vacations, instead suggesting it be used for value-adding home renovations or as an emergency fund.

          <p>To gain genuine insight into a company's culture, a business school professor and CEO advises job candidates to ask a specific, disarming question: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" The article suggests this query often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers than direct questions about company values, revealing the practical realities of the workplace. Examples of revealing responses include needing to be available on weekends or avoiding being "too social." This approach helps candidates assess if their personal values align with the company's actual operational values, leading to better job satisfaction and retention.</p>

The article advises against allowing CDs to automatically roll over, as the new rates will likely be less favorable. Instead, it recommends actively shopping for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, which tend to offer more competitive yields.

The researchers hypothesized that the link between dairy and bad dreams might be due to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep, which can negatively impact dreaming.
