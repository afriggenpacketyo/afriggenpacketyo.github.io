          <p>An unusually high number of "pink meanie" jellyfish are being sighted along the Texas coast, a phenomenon marine scientists say is unprecedented in their records. This species, which can weigh up to 50 pounds with tentacles stretching 70 feet, was only officially identified in 2011. Experts believe their increased presence is directly linked to a current population boom of moon jellyfish, which are the pink meanie's primary food source. Officials are cautioning beachgoers that while the jellyfish's sting is not life-threatening, it is painful and can leave red marks for several days.</p>

          <p>President Trump recently questioned the standard medical practice of vaccinating newborns against hepatitis B, suggesting parents should wait until a child is 12 years old. However, pediatricians and infectious disease specialists have strongly refuted this advice, labeling it as irresponsible and dangerous. They emphasize that infants are at the highest risk for developing chronic, life-threatening liver disease if infected, and the virus can be transmitted in non-sexual ways, such as through contact with contaminated surfaces or caregivers. Since the universal newborn vaccination program began in 1991, infection rates among young people in the U.S. have plummeted by 99 percent.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt at high levels for many Americans, financial experts are highlighting various debt relief options for those struggling with payments. The article notes that while the Federal Reserve recently lowered its benchmark rate, credit card APRs have remained stubbornly high, making it unwise to wait for rates to drop. Because interest compounds daily, carrying a balance can quickly become unmanageable. Strategies such as debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans are presented as proactive ways for borrowers to reduce costs and regain control of their finances.

          <p>President Trump is expected to approve a deal that allows TikTok to continue its U.S. operations under a new structure designed to address national security concerns. The agreement will establish a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, which will oversee security by hosting user data and reviewing the app's code. Under the deal, TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, will retain a minority stake of 19.9%. The White House believes this arrangement constitutes a "qualified divestiture" that complies with a bipartisan law requiring the Chinese company to sever ties with the app.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) is ending its 85-year practice of mailing paper checks, with nearly all payments transitioning to electronic methods by September 30. The nearly 70 million beneficiaries will now receive their funds via direct deposit or a prepaid debit card. The agency states the move will improve efficiency, enhance security, and save costs, as paper checks are more likely to be lost or stolen. While the shift was mandated by a presidential executive order, the SSA has confirmed it will continue to issue paper checks as an exception for individuals who have no other way to receive their payments.</p>

          <h2>CNBC's Jim Cramer Views Starbucks Restructuring as a Positive Move for the Company</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 13:28:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following Starbucks' announcement of store closures and corporate layoffs, CNBC's Jim Cramer described the move as a "necessary" and "bullish" step for the company. He argued that CEO Brian Niccol is strategically closing underperforming locations to reallocate resources to more successful ones, a key part of any turnaround plan aimed at improving same-store sales. The $1 billion restructuring is intended to address declining sales and restore operating margins, which have remained below pre-pandemic levels. Cramer reiterated his confidence in Niccol's ability to guide the coffee giant back to growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Rising Costs and Medicare Gaps Make Long-Term Care Insurance a Consideration for Retirees</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 13:15:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the annual cost of nursing home care exceeding $120,000 and expected to rise, planning for long-term care has become a critical issue for retirees. Many mistakenly believe Medicare will cover these expenses, but it only pays for short-term skilled care after a hospital stay, not the custodial care most seniors need for daily living. This article explains that long-term care insurance can bridge this gap, protecting retirement savings from being depleted. Securing a policy while still healthy is crucial, as premiums increase significantly with age and a decline in health can lead to being denied coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a compulsory, UK-wide digital ID scheme, which the government believes will help combat illegal working and modernize the state. The proposal will be subject to a consultation to address its practical implementation, including how it will function for individuals without smartphones or passports. The idea marks a significant shift, as a previous Labour government's attempt to introduce ID cards was blocked by a Conservative-led coalition. The announcement has already drawn criticism from opposition parties, who have raised concerns about civil liberties and government overreach.</p>

The plan also includes measures to help communities save local pubs and libraries and encourages councils to block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops.

          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement to resolve a Federal Trade Commission (FTC) lawsuit accusing the company of using deceptive practices to enroll millions of customers into its Prime membership program. The FTC alleged that Amazon used manipulative user-interface designs to trick consumers into signing up and made the cancellation process overly complicated. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion for customer refunds. As part of the agreement, Amazon must also redesign its subscription and cancellation processes to be more transparent and straightforward for consumers.</p>
