          <p>President Trump dramatically reversed his stance on the Ukraine-Russia war, suggesting Ukraine can win back all its territory. This contradicts his previous assertions that Ukraine lacks the resources to win.  The shift may be attributed to Trump's perceived humiliation by Putin or a desire to distance himself from the conflict.  However, the article notes a lack of concrete actions supporting this new position.</p>
