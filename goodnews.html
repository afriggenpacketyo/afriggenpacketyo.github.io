          <p>Sanae Takaichi has become Japan's first female prime minister after securing a parliamentary majority, a historic moment for the country. Her victory was solidified after her ruling Liberal Democratic Party formed a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party. An advocate of the "Abenomics" economic strategy, Takaichi favors loose monetary policy and fiscal spending, and has previously criticized the central bank's plans to raise interest rates. On the geopolitical front, she is known for her hardline conservative stance toward China and her support for revising Japan's pacifist constitution.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and Australia has identified two protein enzymes crucial for the growth and treatment resistance of prostate cancer cells. This discovery, published in the journal PNAS, centers on regulating the androgen receptor (AR) protein, which fuels the disease. By understanding this mechanism, the researchers hope to develop new therapeutic strategies to combat prostate cancer more effectively. The breakthrough offers a potential new avenue for treating a disease that affects many men globally, including prominent public figures.</p>

          <p>Australian scientists have discovered several new species in the deep sea off the coast of Western Australia, including a tiny, glowing lantern shark and a semi-transparent porcelain crab. The discoveries were made during a research voyage in the Gascoyne Marine Park, an area largely unexplored. The West Australian Lantern Shark is bioluminescent and grows up to 40cm, while the new porcelain crab is about the size of an almond. Researchers estimate that around 20 new species have been identified from the voyage so far.</p>

          <p>Chinese exporters at the Canton Fair are observing a growing trend of international clients requesting to settle trades in yuan, particularly from Southeast Asian and Central Asian countries. Some companies report that yuan-settled orders now constitute 10-20% of their total exports, a significant increase from last year. This shift is partly driven by Chinese suppliers building infrastructure like data centers in regions such as Singapore and Malaysia. The trend reflects a gradual increase in the international use of the Chinese currency for trade settlements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new project called "Reefline" is underway to create a seven-mile-long artificial reef and underwater art installation off the coast of Miami Beach. The structure, composed of sculptures made from marine-grade concrete, will serve as a habitat for transplanted corals, an ecotourism attraction, and a coastal protection barrier. The first phase features an installation of 22 concrete cars designed to act as "flowerpots for corals." Funded by the city and private donations, the project aims to restore the coral habitat that was lost decades ago and will be accessible to swimmers.</p>

          <p>A theory termed "winology," originating from Chinese academics, is gaining traction on social media, suggesting that the West unfairly dismisses China's technological and economic achievements due to hierarchical thinking. The concept posits that Western perspectives often rank civilizations, placing Chinese achievements in a lower tier, thereby failing to recognize them as legitimate signs of global leadership. This viewpoint is now being discussed in academic circles in China, with scholars exploring it as a framework for understanding contemporary geopolitical and cultural dynamics.</p>

After landing safely, it was determined that the knocking was from the flight crew attempting to communicate due to the malfunctioning phone system. The Federal Aviation Administration confirmed there was no security incident, and the issue was a technical problem with the aircraft's communication equipment.</p>
