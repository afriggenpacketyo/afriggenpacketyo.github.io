          <p>Senators on the Appropriations Committee are challenging the Trump administration's plan to cut federal funding for PBS, NPR, and certain foreign aid programs. Republicans and Democrats alike expressed concerns about the proposed rescissions, with some noting the importance of public broadcasting for local programming and emergency communications. The White House argues that the cuts are necessary because the targeted programs are either politically biased or not in line with American interests. The proposed cuts face an uphill battle in Congress, with several senators voicing skepticism.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's apparent victory in the New York City mayoral primary has Democrats looking to New York for answers on how to move past an older generation of leaders. Mamdani, a progressive state assemblyman, ran an energetic campaign focused on affordability and economic issues, appealing to younger voters. Republicans are eager to frame Mamdani's socialist ideas as evidence of the Democratic Party's leftward shift. However, Democrats see his win as a potential source of energy and a model for connecting with voters on economic concerns.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to formally consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals a significant shift in the U.S. housing finance system, potentially integrating digital assets into traditional lending practices. The directive instructs the housing finance giants to develop proposals that include digital assets without requiring borrowers to liquidate them into U.S. dollars. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated that this aligns with President Donald Trump's vision to establish the United States as the crypto capital of the world.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds for electric vehicle (EV) chargers to 14 states, which had sued to challenge the ongoing freeze. The funds, allocated by Congress to install high-speed chargers, were temporarily paused by the Department of Transportation. The judge granted a preliminary injunction, stating the administration was overstepping its power, but added a seven-day pause to allow for an appeal. The Department of Transportation has stated that they will assess their legal options, but the order does not stop their ongoing work to reform the program.</p>
