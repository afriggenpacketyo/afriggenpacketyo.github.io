          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, fueled by optimism surrounding ongoing trade discussions with the U.S., even as other Asian markets experienced declines due to banking sector fears and intensifying trade tensions. The Kospi's robust performance, touching an intraday high of 3,794.87, stood out as the only market in positive territory in the region, bucking wider losses on Wall Street. This article highlights a significant regional market strength amidst global economic uncertainties, contrasting with the struggles of other indices like Hong Kong's Hang Seng and Japan's Nikkei 225, which faced losses. Furthermore, specific company news, such as Chinese automaker BYD's large vehicle recall and TSMC's earnings beat, contributed to the mixed regional picture, emphasizing the diverse factors influencing market sentiment.

          <p>Former members of the UK military are now able to apply for a new digital identity card, which can be downloaded to a smartphone. This initiative, available to approximately 1.8 million veterans, aims to simplify access to various public services such as GP and mental health support, supported housing, careers advice, and reduced entry prices at museums. Ministers view this rollout as a crucial "case study" for a planned broader digital ID scheme for all British citizens and residents, expected to be mandatory for work by 2029. The article emphasizes the optional digital card's role in modernizing public services, reducing red-tape, and addressing legitimate concerns around privacy and security for the wider scheme.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is set to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington, D.C., advocating for Tomahawk missiles capable of striking deep into Russia, which have a range of 2,500 km. This meeting follows a "very productive" phone call between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, where they agreed to face-to-face talks in Hungary within two weeks. Trump expressed reservations about depleting U.S. missile stockpiles, despite Zelensky's assertion that Moscow is "rushing to resume dialogue" due to the prospect of Tomahawks. The article highlights the complex diplomatic landscape as Ukraine seeks advanced weaponry amidst ongoing peace discussions, which Putin and Trump also discussed in terms of future trade between their nations.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone Air sold out within minutes of its launch in China, both in physical stores across major cities like Beijing and Shanghai, and online, where shipments faced one to two-week delays. This rapid sell-out underscores the device's immense popularity among Chinese consumers, demonstrating strong brand loyalty and purchasing power for premium products. The article notes that this robust demand occurs despite heightened competition from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi, which are striving to expand in the higher-end market amidst a challenging economic environment in China. This success reflects a positive reception for Apple's newest and thinnest model in a crucial global market.</p>

          <p>A long-acting injectable drug, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has been approved for HIV prevention on the NHS in England and Wales, aligning with Scotland's policy. This injection, administered six times a year, offers an alternative to daily pills for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), enhancing convenience and discretion for vulnerable individuals, including those facing homelessness or domestic violence.

          <p>The article explores how discussing sweat and other bodily functions is increasingly losing its taboo status, exemplified by comedian Alan Carr openly addressing his sweating on "The Traitors." This cultural shift is driven by celebrities like Chrissy Teigen and Adele sharing their experiences, and by the beauty industry promoting a "sweaty makeup" look, termed the "Sweaty Hot Girl aesthetic." While saunas are becoming popular networking spots, symbolizing a liberation from body image concerns, the article also notes a historical context of sweat-shaming used by hygiene brands in the early 20th century.

          <p>A federal appeals court panel has denied the Trump administration's request to lift a lower court's order blocking the president from deploying National Guard troops in Illinois. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which reserves certain powers to the states. The court also found "insufficient evidence of a rebellion" against the U.S. government or that federal officers were unable to enforce immigration laws with regular forces, despite the administration's claims about Chicago crime and protests.
