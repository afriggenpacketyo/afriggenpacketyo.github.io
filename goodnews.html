          <p>Oprah Winfrey announced Wally Lamb's "The River Is Waiting" as her newest book club pick on "CBS Mornings," marking the third time she has chosen one of Lamb's novels. The book tells the story of Corby Ledbetter, a young father who causes a tragedy and journeys through prison, witnessing both brutality and kindness as he seeks forgiveness. Lamb shared that the book explores themes of guilt, redemption, and forgiveness, drawing from his experiences working with women in prison. Winfrey advised readers not to skip to the last page, and Lamb hopes the book conveys the message that addiction is a black hole one can escape through 12-step programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has denied that his government's decision to extend winter fuel payments to more pensioners was due to political pressure. Starmer argued that an improved economy allowed the government to reverse a previous decision to withdraw the payments from all but the poorest pensioners. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government claims that better-than-expected growth figures, falling interest rates, and trade deals have made the policy change possible. (not investment advice)</p>
