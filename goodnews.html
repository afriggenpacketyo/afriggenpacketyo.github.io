          <p>Tim Friede, a man who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, may hold the key to developing a universal antivenom. Friede has gradually built up immunity to multiple types of venom through these bites. Researchers studying Friede's blood hope to synthesize a treatment effective against various snake venoms. The World Health Organization estimates that venomous snake bites affect millions annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms, derived from animals injected with specific venoms, are limited in scope, making a universal solution highly desirable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer to encourage residents to use air conditioning amid increasingly extreme heat. A supplementary budget bill of 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) will be submitted to the metropolitan assembly to cover the costs. Governor Yuriko Koike emphasized the need to protect residents' lives and daily living due to declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving approximately 5,000 yen over the four months.</p>

Japan reported a trade deficit in April, though officials see no clear impact from U.S. tariffs yet. The G7 aims for stability despite U.S. tariff tensions, according to Canada. Japan will offer fast-track entry to South Koreans in June to mark the anniversary of diplomatic ties.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Habeas corpus, a fundamental principle enshrined in the Constitution, safeguards individuals from unlawful detention by ensuring they are not held without valid legal grounds. If someone believes a person is being illegally detained, they can request a court order demanding the detainee be brought to court and the detaining party prove their authority. The executive branch cannot suspend habeas corpus; only Congress can do so in cases of rebellion or invasion. The Trump administration considered suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, arguing that illegal immigration constitutes an invasion, a claim rejected by federal judges.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dramatic 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks, snapping a four-game losing streak. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with nine strikeouts. Despite Yamamoto's brilliance, closer Tanner Scott blew a one-run lead in the ninth and allowed a two-run homer in the tenth, putting the Dodgers in a difficult position. The Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the tenth, scoring three runs to secure the win. This was due to a leadoff RBI double from Tommy Edman and a bases-loaded hit by pitch from Will Smith before Max Muncy's sacrifice fly.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to aid in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease will be available in the US starting in late June, following FDA clearance. Developed by Japan's Fujirebio Holdings, the test will initially be offered at approximately 50 American research institutes and hospitals. Designed for individuals 55 and older exhibiting signs of the disease, the test detects amyloid, a protein associated with Alzheimer's. The blood test offers a quicker and less expensive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially improving access to new Alzheimer's treatments.</p>
