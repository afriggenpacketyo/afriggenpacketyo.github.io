          <p>In Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades, a preservation effort named Project Chimney is working to salvage the remaining chimneys from architecturally significant homes destroyed by recent wildfires. Led by artist Evan Hall, the non-profit initiative aims to relocate and preserve these structures, some designed by modern masters like Richard Neutra, as part of a future community memorial. The team is facing a tight deadline from the Army Corps of Engineers, which is managing the debris cleanup. Despite logistical and financial challenges, the project has successfully moved several large chimney sections, preserving what they see as profound symbols of the community's loss and memory.</p>

          <p>China's national medical products regulator has unveiled measures to support the development and medical use of brain-computer interface (BCI) technology. The agency plans to strengthen research into the standardization of new biomedical materials, including flexible electrodes essential for BCI systems. This initiative aims to accelerate research on how the technology can restore function for individuals with impairments from conditions like stroke, spinal cord injuries, and ALS. The support is part of a broader push by the agency to foster innovation in the country's medical device and pharmaceutical sectors.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to powdered hydration multipliers, but health experts advise they are not always necessary and should be used with caution. While these products can be beneficial for replenishing electrolytes lost during strenuous exercise, plain water remains the gold standard for hydration. Doctors recommend checking product labels for high levels of sugar, sodium, and caffeine, which can be problematic for some individuals. People with chronic conditions, particularly kidney or heart disease, should consult their physician before using these supplements, as they are not a replacement for water.</p>

          <p>A diverse, cross-partisan group of about 20 prominent figures, including politicians, judges, and academics, has collaborated to draft a set of fundamental principles of American constitutional democracy. Titled "We Hold These Truths," the project aims to remind citizens of the shared values that unite the country, focusing on five key areas: the rule of law, democracy, separation of powers, personal freedom, and equality. The principles, released on the Fourth of July, emphasize concepts like equal justice, the peaceful transfer of power, and protection against discrimination. The drafters hope this effort will serve as an educational tool to bridge ideological divides.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts the histories of two defunct Southern California seaside amusement parks: the long-lasting but seedy Pike in Long Beach and the short-lived, futuristic Pacific Ocean Park (POP) in Santa Monica. The Pike, which operated from 1902 to 1979, developed a reputation as a rough-and-tumble destination for sailors, known for its dive bars and sideshows. In contrast, POP, which opened in 1958, was a clean-cut, Cold War-era park with attractions like a replica atomic submarine, but it closed in less than a decade due to competition from Disneyland and high maintenance costs, leaving behind fond memories for many Angelenos.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece explores the story of David Mays, a 70-year-old man with multiple terminal illnesses who has decided to forgo life-extending dialysis treatment. Despite facing end-stage kidney failure, Mays chooses quality of life over quantity, finding peace and support in his daily coffee meetings with friends in a supermarket parking lot. The article reflects on his pragmatic and accepting attitude toward mortality, which he attributes not to bravery but to the love and community he feels from his friends and a reconnected daughter. His story offers a poignant perspective on end-of-life decisions and the profound power of human connection.</p>

          <p>A debate is intensifying in California between compost producers and the bioplastics industry over whether materials like compostable bags and cups should be allowed in the organic waste stream. A 2021 state law, AB 1201, requires products labeled "compostable" to fully break down without leaving toxic residues, aligning with strict USDA organic standards that exclude most synthetic materials. While bioplastic manufacturers argue their products are a sustainable alternative to conventional plastic, composters and farmers worry that allowing them will contaminate compost with microplastics and chemicals, rendering it unusable for agriculture and undermining soil health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that in the current climate of intense criticism from both the left and right, Americans have forgotten the core justifications for liberal democracy. It revisits the ideas of philosopher Isaiah Berlin, who championed "value pluralism"—the concept that legitimate human values are diverse and often incompatible, meaning no single utopian vision can be perfect. This inherent tension, Berlin argued, is why freedom of choice is paramount, as it allows individuals and societies to navigate these trade-offs. The essay suggests that embracing this understanding is crucial for defending democracy against totalitarian thinking and appreciating the value of differing perspectives.</p>

Felize shares her challenges, from planning logistics to dealing with the attitudes of other club-goers, but notes that Berghain is surprisingly one of the most accessible venues. Her story highlights a desire for greater empathy and visibility, advocating for a clubbing culture where people with disabilities are not seen as special cases but simply as part of the community.</p>

A key demand for Hamas is a guaranteed end to Israeli military operations after the ceasefire period. President Trump stated he expects to know within 24 hours if Hamas will accept the deal, which could pave the way for renewed formal negotiations.</p>

          <p>A circuit court judge in Missouri has once again blocked many of the state's restrictive abortion laws, including a near-total ban, a 72-hour waiting period, and stringent facility requirements. The ruling reinstates a preliminary injunction, with the judge arguing the restrictions likely violate a state constitutional right to abortion that was approved by voters last year. Planned Parenthood announced it would resume providing procedural abortions in the state following the order. However, Missouri's Attorney General has vowed to appeal the decision, continuing the prolonged legal battle over abortion access in the state.</p>

The definitions were diverse, with some equating freedom with a sense of safety from poverty, violence, and political corruption. Others defined it as the right to self-determination, including the ability to choose one's life path without government interference. A common theme was the idea that personal freedom comes with a responsibility to others and that true freedom cannot exist unless it is extended to everyone in society, regardless of their background.</p>
