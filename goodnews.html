          <p>Poland has initiated random checks at its border with Germany, impacting 52 crossings, which goes against the Schengen zone's principles. This action follows Germany's stricter border controls implemented under Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government since November 2023. Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak stated the checks aim to combat illegal immigration, assuring that EU nationals will not be hindered. The controls will focus on buses, minibuses, and cars carrying many passengers. Germany had previously announced it would turn back asylum-seekers at the Polish border, leading to claims that Berlin is overwhelming Poland with migrants.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is visiting South Carolina for two days, engaging with voters in the state that historically holds the first primary in the Democratic calendar. This visit sparks speculation about Newsom's potential presidential ambitions for 2028, as he is seen as a possible contender. Newsom's tour includes meet-and-greets across the state, aiming to connect with families and address issues overlooked by Republican officials. The South Carolina Democratic Party is using the visit to bring national Democrats to areas they feel have been neglected, while Newsom has been thought to harbor national ambitions.</p>

          <h2>Wimbledon Umpire Given 'Rest Day' After Line-Calling Controversy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The umpire involved in the electronic line-calling controversy during a Wimbledon match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova was given a "rest day," according to the All England Club's chief executive. An "operator error" caused the ball-tracking technology to malfunction, leading to a disputed point. Umpire Nico Helwerth's decision to replay the point was criticized by Pavlyuchenkova, who felt he should have overruled the call. Despite the controversy, the AELTC stated that Helwerth followed the established protocols, while Pavlyuchenkova expressed that umpires should be more attentive to close calls.</p>

The printer can punch braille text onto materials that commercial printers cannot, and is designed for easy use by BISM employees with visual impairments. The students also developed software to integrate the printer with existing braille word processors and photo design software, printing 400 labels for Checkerspot Brewing Company's "Blind Spot" beer.</p>

Altman criticizes voices that oppose billionaires, arguing that rewarding success is essential, but it must be paired with strategies to share the benefits.

          <p>Netflix continues to attract big-name directors by offering lucrative contracts, creative freedom, and a large audience, even without promising wide theatrical releases. Directors like Martin Scorsese and Greta Gerwig have chosen Netflix for its deep financial resources and creative latitude. While some studies suggest theatrical releases enhance a film's value, Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos maintains the company's focus is providing content directly to its streaming subscribers. Netflix saves on marketing costs by skipping theaters, and its success is measured by viewership rather than box-office dollars. This strategy allows Netflix to produce films that might not otherwise get made, and maintain a competitive edge in the streaming market.</p>

          <p>Parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy will be entitled to bereavement leave under a planned amendment to the Employment Rights Bill. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the change aims to provide time for grieving without the pressure of returning to work prematurely. Currently, bereavement leave is only available after 24 weeks of pregnancy. The proposed extended leave would be unpaid and last for at least one week, with further details to be determined following a consultation. This measure would apply in England, Scotland, and Wales, recognizing the emotional toll of early pregnancy loss.</p>
