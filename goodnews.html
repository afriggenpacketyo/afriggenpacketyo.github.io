          <p>Mexican business leaders and executives are praising Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan's statements emphasizing the need for a trade partnership between the U.S. and Mexico. Rowan suggested that resolving trade issues with Mexico and Canada first would strengthen the U.S.'s position in resetting global trade terms. Mexican executives believe that trade turmoil presents an opportunity for greater integration between the U.S. and Mexico, particularly as companies seek manufacturing alternatives to China. The two economies are seen as complementary, with manufacturing job creation in Mexico correlating with job creation in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The US and UK have reached an agreement to reduce tariffs on a limited number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. This agreement offers some relief to key UK industries from tariffs imposed by President Trump. While hailed by leaders as significant, analysts suggest it may not substantially alter the terms of trade between the countries. The US has agreed to reduce the import tax on cars to 10% for 100,000 cars a year and has slashed tariffs on steel and aluminum.</p>
