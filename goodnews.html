          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, aiming to create 10,000 jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed it as a landmark decision to kickstart economic growth and Energy Secretary Ed Miliband believes nuclear energy will deliver a golden age of clean energy. However, critics argue the project is a costly mistake and fear it will increase consumer bills, with Stop Sizewell C condemning the announcement. The final investment decision on the funding model is expected later this summer, while the government insists nuclear power is crucial for the UK's energy future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese electric car manufacturers are rapidly expanding into global markets, offering cheaper and more advanced vehicles, like the BYD Dolphin Surf, which is causing concern among established Western automakers. Fueled by state funding and technological advancements, brands like BYD, Nio, and Xpeng are becoming household names, prompting action from the US and EU due to concerns over fair competition and potential security risks. While consumers benefit from affordable options, experts warn about possible hacking and surveillance threats, as well as the impact on European manufacturers. Despite these concerns, Chinese electric cars are expected to remain a significant part of the global automotive landscape.</p>

          <p>Craig Bellamy, the head coach for Wales, experienced his first defeat after being undefeated in his first nine games. Wales lost to Belgium, which Bellamy knows well from his time as a coach with Anderlecht, in what he might have struggled to envisage was the sheer chaos of his first defeat. Bellamy, who had been waiting for this moment, watched on as his Wales team were cut to shreds by a Belgian side who had rediscovered their verve. Despite the loss, Bellamy's leadership is seen as promising for the future of the Welsh team.</p>

Frank, who has been described as the opposite of Postecoglou for his adaptability, would be Tottenham's fourth permanent manager since 30 June 2021. Frank has managed 152 Premier League games and is the second-longest-serving current manager in English football's top-flight behind Manchester City's Pep Guardiola. Chris Sutton notes the pressure at Tottenham is much greater than at Brentford due to higher expectations.</p>
