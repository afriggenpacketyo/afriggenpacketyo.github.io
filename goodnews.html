          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may allow companies listed in Hong Kong to seek secondary share listings in Shenzhen.

The guidelines would allow mainland companies with Hong Kong-listed shares to issue yuan-denominated shares on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange. This opportunity could diversify fundraising options for businesses within the Greater Bay Area.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba plans to urge G7 nations to collaborate on addressing North Korea's cryptocurrency thefts. This decision stems from allegations that North Korea is using illicitly obtained virtual assets to fund its weapons development. Japan is also seeking to enhance cooperation with European nations supporting Ukraine, given Pyongyang's strengthening military ties with Moscow. The G7 also intends to establish a task force to examine tax exemptions on cross-border e-commerce involving small parcels.</p>

          <p>Proxima Fusion, a German start-up, has raised $148 million in a Series A funding round to develop a commercial nuclear fusion power plant. Investors are optimistic about the potential of fusion energy to play a pivotal role in the energy transition. Nuclear fusion involves combining two hydrogen atoms to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy. If replicated at an industrial scale, the technology could provide virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy.</p>

Trump and Modi have set a target to more than double bilateral trade to $500 billion.</p>
