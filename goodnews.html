          <h2>Germany's Left Party Sees Unexpected Rise in Popularity</h2>

          <p>Germany's socialist Left Party is experiencing a surge in popularity, securing 8.8% of the vote in the recent federal election, nearly double their 2021 result. Opinion polls now place them on par with the Green Party. This rise is attributed to their focus on affordable housing and their peace stance, especially concerning the Russia-Ukraine war, advocating for diplomatic solutions and stronger sanctions. The party has almost doubled its membership and played a role in the election of the new Federal Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, demonstrating newfound influence in the Bundestag.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs, Driven by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an unexpected surge in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, even as exports to the United States sharply declined due to President Trump's tariffs. Overall exports jumped 8.1% year-on-year, while imports saw a slight decrease. This redirection of trade is seen as a signal of supply chain adjustments, with Chinese factories capitalizing on tariff pauses in Southeast Asia to fulfill orders destined for the U.S. The data offers temporary relief to Beijing amid concerns about the trade war's impact, though economists caution about potential unemployment spikes.</p>

          <p>Stuart MacGill, a former Australian cricketer, has avoided jail time after being found guilty of participating in the supply of cocaine. He received a 22-month intensive corrections order and community service. MacGill admitted to using cocaine and introducing his brother-in-law to a drug dealer, though he denied direct involvement in the drug deal itself. The charges stemmed from a police investigation that began after MacGill reported being abducted and assaulted in 2021.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis, signaling a potential shift away from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes as the U.S. has imposed tariffs on Indian exports, prompting India to re-evaluate its trade strategy. While some experts believe a trade deal could benefit certain sectors, others caution that it could harm domestic manufacturing. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, and a trade deal could significantly impact India's economic growth.</p>

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports jumped 8.1% year-on-year, while imports saw a slight decrease. The surge is partly attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. Meanwhile, exports to ASEAN countries surged, with Vietnam and Malaysia remaining key destinations.</p>
