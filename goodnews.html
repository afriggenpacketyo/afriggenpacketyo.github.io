          <p>The German government aims to simplify the process of declaring countries as 'safe countries of origin' to reduce asylum applications.  This proposed reform, part of a broader asylum turnaround, would allow declarations via statutory order, bypassing the Bundesrat.  Opposition parties and NGOs criticize the draft, claiming it contradicts German law.
