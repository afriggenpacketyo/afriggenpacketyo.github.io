          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX Starship successfully completed its 11th test flight from Texas, with the Super Heavy booster returning to the Gulf of Mexico and the upper stage splashing down in the Indian Ocean as planned. This marks a significant milestone, being the last test before SpaceX launches an upgraded Starship prototype designed for Moon and Mars missions, which NASA Administrator Sean Duffy called "another major step" toward lunar landings. Previous tests often ended in explosions, but recent missions have shown consistent success, boosting confidence in the vehicle's capabilities for future human spaceflight.</p>

          <p>Cameron McGerr, a 16-year-old from Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in schools after losing both his parents to heart conditions, believing he could have helped them if he had known life-saving skills. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already led to the introduction of CPR lessons at his own school, Clydeview Academy, and is gaining support from MSPs. Health groups emphasize that increased CPR confidence could significantly improve survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. Cameron's personal tragedy fuels his determination to make a difference for others.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The England national football team is grappling with a significant lack of depth in the striker position behind captain Harry Kane, whose prolific scoring has been essential. With Ollie Watkins sidelined due to injury, the squad's options are notably limited, a concern echoed by Under-21s manager Lee Carsley. The article highlights that only seven English players classified as out-and-out strikers have appeared in the Premier League this season, with only one under 26. This scarcity presents a selection headache for manager Thomas Tuchel as the team approaches the World Cup qualifiers.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for a targeted prostate cancer screening program, emphasizing its affordability and potential to save "countless lives." As an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, he supports a program focusing on men aged 45-69 with a family history of the disease and black men, a group comprising 1.3 million individuals. The charity estimates an annual cost of £25 million, comparable to other cancer screenings. While some medical experts express skepticism about over-treatment risks, Sunak argues improved MRI scan reliability makes targeted screening deliverable and timely.</p>

          <p>A new UK campaign will encourage driving license applicants to register as blood donors, aiming to significantly boost donor numbers, especially among younger demographics. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) and NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) are collaborating on this initiative, which will include a registration link in emails following license applications. This partnership seeks to replicate the success of the organ donor register prompt, which has enrolled 70% of its members through this method. Hospitals require 5,000 daily donations, and the NHS has previously warned of "critical" shortages, particularly for O negative blood.</p>

Manufacturing was a drag, while global AI investment, infrastructure spending, and accommodative financial conditions are expected to support other sectors. The MAS anticipates core inflation to ease in the near term before gradually rising (not investment advice).</p>
