          <p>The debate over women serving in combat roles continues, with discussions focusing on gender-neutral fitness standards and the definition of lethality. Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School, shares her experiences and perspectives on the issue. Vanasse argues that lethality extends beyond physical fitness, encompassing tactical skills, decision-making, leadership, and the ability to build trust. She also addresses claims that standards were lowered for women in combat roles, asserting that she and other women met the same standards as their male counterparts.</p>

Manchester City would need to complete the transfer before 10 June in order for Ait-Nouri to be available for the group stage of the Club World Cup.</p>

          <p>Three massive wildfires in northeastern Minnesota are nearly contained after burning for weeks, with all evacuations lifted on Memorial Day. Firefighters have made significant progress since the fires broke out around May 12, though all of Minnesota remains under an air quality alert due to hazardous smoke. The fires have covered approximately 30,000 acres, with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources leading the Jenkins Creek and Munger Shaw fight, while the National Incident Management Organization commands the Camp House and Horse River fires. Donations are being accepted to support relief for affected community members.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna in Italy produced a spectacularly explosive eruption, sending a massive ash cloud into the sky and triggering a red alert for aviation crews. The volcanic cloud rose to an estimated height of about 21,325 feet and moved in a west-southwest direction. While the eruption forced officials to halt tourist visits to the volcano, it doesn't seem to have had any immediate impact on people in the area. Aviation alerts were eased later as volcanic activity and ash emissions decreased.</p>
