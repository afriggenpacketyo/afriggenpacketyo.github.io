          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, the North American chief operating officer, as its new CEO, succeeding Carlos Tavares, who resigned unexpectedly. Filosa aims to mend relationships with partners, especially in the U.S., and balance investments in both internal combustion engines and electric vehicles. The company recently reported a downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties surrounding trade policy. Filosa's focus will be on strengthening bonds with dealers, suppliers, unions, and communities while navigating the company's financial recovery and strategic investments.</p>

          <p>CNBC has selected "Hope for Cynics" by Stanford psychology professor Jamil Zaki as its June book club pick, exploring the idea that believing in the fundamental decency of people is not foolish but supported by science. Zaki argues that a shift towards "hopeful skepticism" leads to better outcomes, a mindset that can be learned by anyone. The book delves into research indicating that cynics experience poorer health, sadness, financial instability, and inaccurate perceptions. This selection aims to offer a positive perspective during complicated times when distrust is prevalent.</p>

          <p>Shares of Abercrombie & Fitch surged despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to an expected $50 million impact from tariffs.

However, Abercrombie's first-quarter results surpassed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue, with sales reaching a record high. While the company slightly raised its full-year sales guidance, it also anticipates a slowdown at its Abercrombie brand, even though the Hollister brand performed well.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has settled a six-year legal battle with Tamara Lanier, a woman claiming to be a descendant of enslaved people depicted in 175-year-old daguerreotypes.

The images, originally commissioned by a Harvard professor to support discredited theories of Black racial inferiority, sparked a legal fight over their custody and care.
