        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump urged House Republicans to support his legislative agenda, specifically cautioning them against altering Medicaid provisions within the bill. This comes as some Republicans are pushing for stricter Medicaid cuts, creating a sticking point that threatens the bill's passage. Trump also addressed concerns regarding state and local tax deductions, urging Republicans to accept the current deal. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the legislation, decrying it for what he called the "largest" cut to Medicaid and nutritional assistance in American history, and the White House official noted that Trump is losing patience with the Republican holdouts, including the SALT Caucus and the House Freedom Caucus.</p>
