          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is running as an independent for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska, challenging incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. After a surprisingly strong performance in a previous race against Senator Deb Fischer, Osborn is campaigning on a working-class platform, contrasting his life experiences with those of the wealthy Ricketts. He aims to appeal to voters tired of the two-party system and has garnered support from the state's Democratic party, though he maintains he will not caucus with either party if elected. His candidacy has prompted political forecasters to re-evaluate the race, shifting it from "Safe Republican" to "Likely Republican."</p>

          <p>A searchable public database containing 1.5 million pages of records on police use of force and misconduct from nearly 700 California law enforcement agencies is now available. The Police Records Access Project, a collaborative effort by UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and several news outlets, provides unprecedented access to internal affairs documents. This initiative is the result of years of work collecting and organizing public records following a 2018 state law that increased transparency. The database aims to shed light on how police departments across the state handle allegations of misconduct and incidents resulting in serious injury or death.</p>

          <p>A national survey of American children aged 8 to 12 reveals that despite spending significant time online, their preferred way to socialize is through unstructured, in-person play. The research suggests that the rise of the "phone-based childhood" is not just due to addictive technology, but also a lack of real-world freedom. Many children reported not being allowed to play unsupervised, even in their own yards, pushing them toward digital spaces as their only escape from adult supervision. The article argues that to get kids off their phones, parents and communities must restore opportunities for independence and free play.</p>

Forbes, who represents the Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch constituency, cited a desire to spend more time with her young family as the reason for her decision. First elected in 2016, she had a rapid political ascent, becoming finance secretary and narrowly losing the 2023 SNP leadership contest. She will continue to serve as an MSP and in her current government role until the election, with First Minister John Swinney praising her invaluable contribution to public life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global fur industry has seen a staggering decline, with the number of animals farmed for fur plummeting from over 140 million in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This transformation reflects a major shift in public perception, turning fur from a luxury status symbol into an ethical misstep. The article attributes this success to sustained animal welfare campaigns that pressured major fashion brands to go fur-free and persuaded numerous countries to ban fur production. The trend was accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which highlighted the risks of mink farming, as well as changing economic and political conditions in key markets like China and Russia.</p>

          <p>A UK Home Office minister has confirmed that migrants arriving on small boats will be allowed to keep their mobile phones. This clarification comes as new legislation, the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, is being debated. The bill aims to grant authorities new powers to seize devices from those suspected of being people smugglers, but the minister, Dame Angela Eagle, stated the government does not intend to apply a blanket policy to every arrival. This approach follows a High Court ruling that found the previous blanket seizure of phones from all small boat arrivals was unlawful.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, one of the world's most polluted cities, is implementing a phased ban on motorbikes to improve its air quality. The restrictions will begin in 2026 by banning gas-powered motorbikes from a central ring road, with the ban expanding to more areas and including some cars by 2030. The new law also mandates upgrades to the city's public transportation fleet and a public awareness campaign. This aggressive action is part of a broader environmental push by the city, which is also rolling out a ban on single-use plastics to address its significant pollution challenges.</p>

          <p>A new report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health has revealed a promising decline in suicidal thoughts and behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The prevalence of serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12-17 fell from nearly 13% to 10%, while major depression episodes also decreased. Experts are hopeful about the trend, suggesting it may be linked to more teens seeking and receiving treatment. However, the report also highlights that millions of teens still struggle, and access to mental health care remains a significant challenge for many Americans.</p>
