          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was photographed using the Signal app during a Cabinet meeting with President Donald Trump, just a day before Trump announced Waltz would be replaced. The photo revealed that Waltz was texting with figures including Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The White House defended Waltz's use of Signal, stating it is an approved app on government phones. Waltz had previously faced scrutiny for a Signal chat incident involving a journalist and sensitive military information, and is now nominated to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has initiated lawsuits against Hawaii, Michigan, New York, and Vermont, all states led by Democrats, challenging their climate policies that the DOJ argues threaten U.S. energy independence and national security. These legal actions follow President Donald Trump‚Äôs Executive Order 14260, which aims to protect American energy from state overreach. Attorney General Pam Bondi stated that these laws are ideologically motivated and impede the production of affordable, reliable energy. The DOJ claims that the states are attempting to regulate energy beyond their constitutional authority, harming the country's energy production capabilities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as National Security Advisor and nominated him as the U.N. Ambassador. Waltz was replaced by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Waltz faced scrutiny for mistakenly including a journalist in a secure Signal chat where sensitive military plans were discussed.
