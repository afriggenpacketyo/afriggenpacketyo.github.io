        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Rijksmuseum in the Netherlands is exhibiting a nearly 200-year-old condom decorated with erotic art. Believed to be made around 1830 from a sheep's appendix, the condom is part of the "Safe Sex?" exhibition about 19th-century sex work. The condom features an erotic image of a nun and three clergymen, along with the phrase "This is my choice" in French, referencing a Renoir painting. The museum acquired the condom at an auction to highlight 19th-century sexuality and prostitution, a subject underrepresented in their collection, and it will remain on display until the end of November. The museum emphasizes that it embodies both the playful and serious aspects of sexual health during an era fraught with fears of pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases. </p>

          <p>Scientists at the American Museum of Natural History preparing a planetarium show about the Milky Way made an unexpected discovery about the Oort Cloud. While fine-tuning a scene, they noticed a spiral shape within the cloud's inner section, resembling a bar with two waving arms, similar to the Milky Way. This contradicted the long-held belief that the Oort Cloud was shaped like a sphere or flattened shell, and the researchers published their findings in The Astrophysical Journal. The discovery, based on data on celestial object movements and simulations, may be difficult to confirm with observations, but it provides a new understanding of the outer solar system. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across mayoral authorities in the Midlands, North, and West Country. The funding will focus on tram, train, and bus projects, with Greater Manchester receiving ¬£2.5 billion to extend its tram network and the West Midlands getting ¬£2.4 billion for extensions from Birmingham. Six other metro mayors will also receive investments for various transport improvements in their regions, marking a shift away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for favoring London and the South-East. While some Conservative figures criticized the plan as lacking serious planning, local leaders welcomed the investment as a boost for their regions. </p>

          <p>England Under-21 head coach Lee Carsley has signed a new contract with the Football Association (FA) that will keep him in his position until 2027. This commitment comes just before England attempts to defend their European Under-21 title in Slovakia. Carsley's future was uncertain during his interim role as head coach for the senior England team. The U21 squad is filled with promising young players, but preparations have faced challenges due to potential player unavailability related to club transfers and the Club World Cup. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act, leading to increased benefits and lump-sum retroactive payments for nearly 3 million people. The Fairness Act eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for individuals receiving income from public pensions without Social Security payroll taxes. The agency credits automation for expediting payments, and expects to update all beneficiary records affected by the law by early November. Commissioner Frank Bisignano has committed to completing the updates promptly.</p>

The company, which is pursuing a public listing in Hong Kong, observed improvements in lung function among patients receiving a higher dose of rentosertib.

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a record in quantum-based secure direct communications, tripling the distance of a multi-user network to around 300km. Researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University said the optical fiber network is theoretically scalable, showing the viability of this type of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to help hide the signals. The transmission rate is still too low to handle images, but the researchers aim to develop a 10,000km-level quantum communication network containing hundreds or thousands of users. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Stanford University have found that a sustained signal in the brain after an experience may explain how experiences lead to emotions. The process involves a lingering signal that puts the brain into a broader state, allowing experiences to merge and interact. This finding could help explain emotional differences seen in some neuropsychiatric conditions, such as autism and schizophrenia. While some researchers question whether this signal is specific to emotion, the study suggests that persistent signals in the brain play a role in altering a person or animal's brain state. </p>

          <p>Air quality regulators in Southern California are considering new rules to phase out the sale of gas-powered furnaces and water heaters. The South Coast Air Quality Management District (AQMD) is set to vote on regulations that would establish zero-emission sales targets for manufacturers, distributors, and installers, starting in 2027 and increasing to 90% by 2036. While gas-powered appliances would still be available, manufacturers would face surcharges, likely increasing costs for consumers. Officials argue the plan is crucial for reducing air pollution and improving public health, but opponents worry about strains on the electric grid and higher consumer costs.</p>

          <p>The BBC has refuted claims made by the White House regarding its coverage of events in Gaza. The BBC stated that it did not remove any stories and stands by its journalism. The White House press secretary had accused the BBC of relying on information from Hamas and retracting a story, but the BBC clarified that its coverage was updated with new figures throughout the day, a standard practice for fast-moving news. The corporation also addressed claims about a BBC Verify report, explaining that it examined a viral video unrelated to its news reporting. </p>

          <p>The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, shared new intimate family photos of Princess Lilibet to commemorate her fourth birthday. The photos include a black-and-white image of Meghan cuddling Lilibet on what appears to be a boat, and another of Meghan holding Lilibet as a newborn. Meghan expressed her love for her daughter and thanked those who sent birthday wishes. The photos offer a rare glimpse of Lilibet, as Meghan typically shares images where the princess's face is not fully visible to protect her privacy. </p>

          <h2>French Cognac Industry Hopes for Tariff Relief After China Talks</h2>

          <p>French cognac businesses are expressing optimism that recent talks between China and France could lead to a rollback of tariffs imposed by Beijing. China imposed temporary anti-dumping duties on brandy and cognac imported from the European Union in retaliation for the bloc‚Äôs tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. One cognac director reported that a Chinese client refused to take a paid order due to the additional fees, awaiting the outcome of negotiations. The hope is that positive discussions between officials will result in the removal of these duties, providing relief to the affected industry. </p>
