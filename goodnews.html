          <p>A growing chorus of voices, from conservative and religious groups to cryptocurrency companies, are raising concerns about "debanking," the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services based on political positions or perceived risks. While banks are generally permitted to avoid customers deemed too risky, critics argue that some denials constitute politically motivated discrimination. The Trump administration has signaled a willingness to address the issue, potentially through executive action or revived regulations, but legal experts remain divided on whether debanking is a genuine problem or simply a reflection of banks' risk management practices. This article explores the debate surrounding debanking, highlighting the conflicting perspectives and potential policy responses.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Mexico dismissed trespassing charges against dozens of immigrants caught in a new military zone on the US-Mexico border, marking a setback for Trump administration efforts to raise penalties for unlawful crossings into the US. Judge Wormuth ruled that immigrants did not know they were entering the military zone and therefore could not be charged. The immigrants still face charges accusing them of crossing the border illegally. This article reports on a legal challenge to the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Hansi Flick has asked the club for very little so far, paying money for just Dani Olmo and Pau Victor in the summer and adding no-one in the winter transfer window. The 60-year-old German also strongly believes no-one knows their fitness better than the players themselves. So, any plans to rest the likes of Yamal or Raphinha are not taken without asking them - again building the trust and his popularity among the team. This article discusses how Hansi Flick turned Lamine Yamal & co into champions for Barcelona.</p>

          <p>Unemployment rates are near historical lows, and finding good help is hard. Perhaps that‚Äôs why Donald Trump keeps turning to the same group of officials to fill multiple positions. As secretary of state, he was part of a Signal group discussing strikes on Yemen‚Äôs Houthi rebels, to which Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg was inadvertently added. These discussions are too sensitive to happen over Signal, an off-the-shelf application, but once they did take place, they became subject to public-records laws. How and whether the administration was preserving them remains unclear, though, and they may have been deleted.</p>
