          <p>Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis, who returned from a brief retirement, is leading an aggressive turnaround plan for the Stellantis truck brand following a significant 38% sales decline since 2019. The strategy includes resurrecting the popular Hemi V-8 engine, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new industry-leading warranty to regain market share. Kuniskis aims to restore dealer confidence and boost sales, targeting a market share of over 20% by the end of 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers with a significant sum like $10,000, both high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts currently offer highly competitive and nearly identical interest rates. A comparison shows that the difference in earnings between the two over a year would be minimal, making either a strong choice for growing savings. The decision between them may therefore depend more on other features, such as check-writing privileges, rather than on potential interest earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Oliver Tarvet, who qualified for the Wimbledon main draw, has drawn attention to restrictive NCAA rules that prevent him from claiming his full ¬£66,000 in prize money. As a student-athlete at the University of San Diego, he is limited to profiting $10,000 per year plus expenses from professional tournaments. Tarvet's situation has fueled calls for a change in NCAA regulations, which are already being challenged in a class-action lawsuit by other college players.</p>

          <p>Lorde's fourth album, "Virgin," marks a return to an electronic, rhythm-driven sound, exploring themes of youthful possibility, desire, and self-obsession. The album is set against a downtown Manhattan backdrop and reflects on a transitional period of womanhood, including a major breakup and crises of confidence. While praised for its craftsmanship and conversational style, the review suggests the album's impact is sometimes muted by familiar production and a deeply insular focus.</p>
