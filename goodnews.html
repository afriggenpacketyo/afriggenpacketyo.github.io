          <p>Home electricity bills are expected to reach an average of $784 this summer, marking a 12-year high due to rising temperatures and electricity prices. The National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA) reports that electricity prices are outpacing inflation, leading to higher cooling costs for households. Low-income families, who already spend a larger portion of their income on energy, may struggle to afford air conditioning, posing health risks. Modernizing homes and increasing energy efficiency can help mitigate these costs.</p>
