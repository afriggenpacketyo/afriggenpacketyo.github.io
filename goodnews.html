          <p>The Dashixia Water Control Project in Xinjiang has officially begun storing water. As the world's tallest concrete-faced rockfill dam, its construction utilized advanced technologies including artificial intelligence, digital twins, and unmanned equipment. This innovative, 3D-printing-like approach was employed to overcome significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. The project represents a new milestone in intelligent dam construction and is considered safer and more cost-effective than previous designs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated the restoration of $500 million in federal grants to UCLA, ruling that the Trump administration's freeze on the funds likely violated federal procedures. The funding suspension was related to administration allegations of civil rights violations concerning antisemitism and affirmative action. The restored grants are designated for hundreds of medical research projects, including studies on Parkinson's disease and cancer recovery.</p>
