          <p>Despite the imposition of US tariffs, China's exports experienced an 8.1% year-on-year increase in April, surpassing market expectations. This growth indicates a degree of resilience in the Chinese economy amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. Imports, however, saw a slight decrease of 0.2% compared to the previous year. The trade surplus for China in April was reported at US$96.18 billion, a decrease from the US$102.64 billion recorded in March, reflecting some impact from global economic factors.</p>

          <p>According to a mines developer, industries in developed nations, including the defense sector, are realizing the need to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China restricted exports. China's move to add tungsten to its export restriction list has caused panic in the industry, which has relied on China for raw materials for 30 years. US defense contractors face a 2027 deadline to cease using Chinese tungsten. Tungsten is used in various applications, including cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy technologies.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports, while Britain will be able to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10 percent tariff. The US will also remove its additional tariffs of 25 percent on steel and aluminum.

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the US on a reciprocal basis, signaling a shift from its protectionist trade policies. The potential deal with the US, its largest trading partner, could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding access to global markets. Experts suggest that the removal of tariffs may not significantly harm India's domestic manufacturing sector, as factors like transportation costs and product pricing remain influential.</p>

          <p>The enforcement of skort-wearing in camogie, a Gaelic sport, has sparked a debate over sexism, with former player Jane Adams calling for a change to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts. A recent survey revealed that many players experience discomfort while wearing skorts. The Camogie Association has scheduled a Special Congress to vote on the issue.
