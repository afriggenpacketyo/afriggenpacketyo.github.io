          <p>The offshore yuan strengthened, surpassing 7.2 against the US dollar, a level not seen since November, fueled by optimism about potential trade negotiations between the US and China. Experts anticipate that both countries may reduce tariffs, although negotiations are expected to be lengthy and uncertain. Despite renewed interest in Chinese assets, global investors remain cautious and seek concrete evidence of China's ability to withstand US challenges before increasing their investments. Former President Trump indicated a willingness to lower tariffs on China. Optimism score: 65</p>

          <p>Two Chinese scientists propose that "Shi's Star Catalogue," an ancient astronomical list, is the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. Researchers Zhao Yongheng and He Boliang used image processing to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming observations around 335BC. If confirmed, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously recognized as the oldest. Experts believe that detailed astronomical studies began around the same time in both China and Greece. Optimism score: 75</p>

          <p>A joint Chinese and Dutch study has revealed that the earliest roses were likely yellow, contradicting the popular association of roses with the color red. The study used evolutionary genetic analysis of domesticated and wild rose samples. Researchers found that the common ancestor of roses most likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' are among the most cultivated ornamental flowers globally. Optimism score: 70</p>
