          <h2>Study Reveals How Dietary Fiber Protects Body from Sugar Damage via Gut Bacteria</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 16:06:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking UC Irvine study has uncovered how dietary fiber, specifically inulin found in vegetables like onions and garlic, protects the body from the harmful effects of sugar by reshaping gut bacteria. Researchers discovered that these gut microbes metabolize fructose in the small intestine before it reaches the liver, preventing overwhelming sugar spillover and fat accumulation. This mechanism not only shields against sugar damage but can also reverse signs of fatty liver disease, reducing fat and boosting liver antioxidants. The findings offer crucial insights for personalized nutrition and potential new treatments for metabolic conditions, emphasizing fiber's vital role in overall health.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams secured a 17-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, with quarterback Matthew Stafford delivering a touchdown pass and Kyren Williams running for another score. A potent defense, spearheaded by Jared Verse and safety Quentin Lake, proved instrumental in shutting down the Lamar Jackson-less Ravens, improving the Rams' record to 4-2. Despite early challenges, including an ankle injury to star receiver Puka Nacua and other special teams errors, the team rallied in the second half. This crucial victory demonstrated resilience as they prepare for their next game against the Jacksonville Jaguars in London.</p>

          <p>A recent agreement in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany, formalizing the option for Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave on two major Islamic holidays, has sparked significant public debate. Despite tabloid headlines inaccurately claiming "extra holidays," legal and Islamic scholars clarified that the regulation merely affirms a long-standing legal practice rooted in religious freedom, not a new entitlement. The state's Ministry of Education emphasized this aligns with existing provisions for various religious groups, reflecting Germany's ongoing national conversation about integration and cultural identity, and how religious observances are accommodated within its diverse society.</p>
