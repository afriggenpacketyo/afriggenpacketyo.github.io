          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:05:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct breed of Bronze Age cattle, within a cave system in the Yorkshire Dales. The find was part of a larger archaeological project surveying caverns near Ingleborough, which also uncovered evidence of Neolithic human burials. This discovery helps illuminate the prehistoric farming and living practices of people in the region. The project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, underscores the vital role of recreational cavers in uncovering subterranean history, as many sites require specialized skills to access and document.</p>

          <p>Over £100 million in Premium Bond prizes, including eleven awards of £100,000, remain unclaimed in the United Kingdom. Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to locate the winners, especially those with older, paper-based bonds. The NS&I states it has successfully paid over 99% of prize winners since the draws began in 1957 and provides tracing services for mislaid accounts. However, consumer advocates and solicitors are calling for reforms to make the process less bureaucratic, particularly for those tracing bonds inherited or gifted years ago.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:55:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy, who also serves as interim NASA administrator, is set to announce an accelerated plan to develop a nuclear reactor on the moon. This directive establishes a more definitive timeline for fission surface power, which is considered essential for future lunar and Martian exploration and a potential lunar economy. The move is seen as a response to a joint Russo-Chinese plan to build a similar reactor by the mid-2030s, which could create a "keep-out zone" and hinder U.S. presence. The initiative also signals NASA's continued involvement in nuclear development despite the recent cancellation of a joint Pentagon program for nuclear-powered rockets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society reveals a significant increase in early-stage colon cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, directly linked to a rise in screenings for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates for this demographic jumped 62% between 2019 and 2023. This uptick in testing is credited with catching the disease earlier, which is considered promising news by health experts. However, researchers caution that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable, highlighting the need for continued public health efforts to expand access.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born just before the Civil War, will finally receive a headstone 101 years after his death. Despite his international renown and founding several newspapers, Bruce was buried in an unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York, in 1924. His fame did not translate to wealth, and plans for a monument never materialized, an oversight attributed to the passage of time and the Great Depression. Now, through private and public funding, a black granite headstone etched with his portrait will be installed, honoring his legacy and his dedication to preserving Black history.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those entering the country illegally, a measure the administration credited for a sharp drop in border apprehensions. The court ruled that while the government could pause access to the asylum system, it could not ignore other laws protecting migrants from being returned to places where they face persecution or torture. This directive effectively reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain detained during processing.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer stated that the stock market's recent rebound is largely due to the positive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" technology stocks, such as Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He argued that despite a weaker-than-expected labor report, the market's resilience is fundamentally supported by the financial strength of these tech giants. Cramer highlighted their success in key areas like cloud infrastructure, AI development, and advertising revenue. He concluded that these cash-rich companies, with their diverse income streams and tight expenses, are proving to be robust and reliable forces in the current market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held firearm says she is hopeful after new, stricter gun control laws came into effect in the UK. Emma Ambler has campaigned for changes since her family was killed in 2020 by her sister's partner, who had lied on his shotgun application about his mental health history. The new rules require two character references for shotgun certificate applications instead of one and mandate that police consult with applicants' partners to identify signs of domestic abuse. The changes are seen as a significant step toward preventing similar tragedies.</p>

          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced that his office has saved the state nearly $170 billion by successfully litigating against the Trump administration over the past six months. Speaking alongside Governor Gavin Newsom, Bonta reported that for every dollar of special funding spent on these legal challenges, the state has seen a return of $33,600. The bulk of the savings came from a lawsuit that blocked the administration's attempt to freeze federal funding. Bonta's office has filed 37 lawsuits against the administration on issues ranging from healthcare and education funding to environmental protections and voting rights.</p>

The plan includes approving new medical products for the domestic market and introducing dozens of innovative international drugs and devices each year. This strategic push comes as a key competitor, South Korea, is set to lose some of its appeal after announcing it will remove value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery services. Hainan's medical tourism zone has already seen a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in visitors in the first quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that people coming off obesity medications like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year. Health assessment body NICE issued the advice, warning that patients often regain a significant portion of lost weight after stopping treatment. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process and that patients need a plan, including healthy eating and exercise, to maintain their new weight. This support system is crucial as an estimated 240,000 people are expected to be prescribed Mounjaro on the NHS over the next three years.</p>
