          <p>Sales of previously owned homes in the U.S. unexpectedly rose by 2% in July, reaching a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.01 million units. This increase, reported by the National Association of Realtors, coincides with a record-high housing inventory level since May 2020, which is helping to moderate price growth. The median home price saw a minimal 0.2% annual increase, suggesting the market may be reaching an inflection point where affordability improves. The rise in all-cash buyers to 31% of transactions indicates that higher mortgage rates continue to influence market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New York state appeals court has nullified the monetary penalty of over $500 million imposed on President Donald Trump and other defendants in his civil business fraud case. The court ruled that the massive financial penalty constituted an "excessive fine" that violated the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. While the monetary disgorgement was thrown out, the court upheld the non-monetary injunctive relief designed to curb the Trump Organization's business practices. The original lawsuit, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, can be appealed to a higher court.</p>

          <p>In his debut feature film "Lurker," writer-director Alex Russell examines the toxic dynamics of parasocial relationships and unspoken hierarchies within male friend groups. The movie follows a young fan who infiltrates the inner circle of a rising music star, exploring how the desire to belong can become dangerous. Russell, who has written for acclaimed shows like "Beef" and "The Bear," drew from his own experiences of feeling like an outsider to craft the story. The film aims to dissect the unsettling nature of modern fandom and the often-unspoken jealousies that exist between men.</p>

          <p>Walmart has raised its full-year sales and earnings outlook, signaling confidence despite rising costs associated with tariffs. The retail giant reported a 4.6% rise in U.S. comparable sales for the second quarter, driven by strong performance in its grocery and e-commerce divisions, the latter growing 26%. While the company exceeded Wall Street's revenue expectations, it fell short on earnings per share due to one-time expenses. Management noted that while they are absorbing some tariff costs, price increases on certain items are unavoidable, which could impact lower-income households' spending on discretionary goods.

          <h2>New Research Suggests Wolf Hunting is Ineffective at Protecting Ranchers' Livestock</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science Advances challenges the long-held belief that hunting wolves effectively reduces livestock losses for ranchers. Researchers analyzed data from Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington and found that public wolf hunting had a negligible impact on livestock depredation. According to the findings, approximately 14 wolves would need to be killed to save a single cow, suggesting it is not an efficient management tool for this purpose. The study's authors hope the research will encourage a shift towards more effective non-lethal strategies to mitigate human-wildlife conflict, rather than fueling political debates over hunting.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Serena Williams has revealed she is using GLP-1 weight loss medication after struggling to lose weight following the birth of her children. In a new campaign for a telehealth company, Williams explained that despite working out and eating clean, her body was not responding as it used to. She aims to address the stigma surrounding these popular drugs, stating that using them is not "the easy way out" but rather a way of taking care of oneself. Williams, who has lost 31 pounds in eight months, joins other public figures in openly discussing their use of these medications.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has filed a lawsuit against the operators of L.A. Fitness and its affiliated gyms, accusing them of using intentionally complicated and opaque cancellation procedures. The complaint alleges that the company's policies make it "exceedingly difficult" for members to end their subscriptions, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal, unwanted recurring fees. The FTC claims that customers face confusing and contradictory requirements, such as being forced to cancel in person at specific times or through restrictive mail-in processes. Fitness International, the parent company, has denied the allegations.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is set to sign England international Eberechi Eze from Crystal Palace after making a decisive bid that trumped a competing offer from rival club Tottenham Hotspur. The move reportedly happened quickly after an injury concern arose for Arsenal's Kai Havertz, prompting the club to act on its long-standing interest. For Eze, a boyhood Arsenal fan who was once in their youth academy, the decision was straightforward. The transfer is seen as a major coup for Arsenal, adding a dynamic and creative forward who can provide a different attacking option as they challenge for titles.</p>

          <p>A team of police divers in Italy has completed the annual cleaning of the iconic "Christ of the Abyss" statue, located on the seabed near Portofino. Using pressurized water hoses, the divers carefully removed a year's worth of accumulated crustaceans and bacteria from the 2.5-meter bronze monument. The statue was installed in 1954 as a memorial to those who have died at sea and has become one of the most popular diving spots in the Mediterranean. This delicate, non-damaging cleaning method ensures the preservation of the artwork while protecting the surrounding marine ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Amid high interest rates on other forms of debt, financial experts suggest that a home equity loan can be a strategic way for homeowners to save money. This type of loan is particularly effective for consolidating high-interest credit card debt, allowing borrowers to switch from high variable rates to a lower fixed rate. Another beneficial use is financing home improvements that increase the property's value, as the interest paid may be tax-deductible. Experts advise that these loans are best suited for those with stable income and significant equity, and caution against using them for luxury spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a five-year fixed mortgage in the UK has dropped to 4.99%, falling below the 5% threshold for the first time since May 2023. This marks a symbolic turning point in the borrowing market, signaling increased competition among lenders and offering some relief to homebuyers and those looking to remortgage. The average two-year fixed rate also continued its decline, reaching 4.97%. While the drop provides a modest boost to affordability, analysts suggest that persistent inflation may limit further significant rate cuts in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to financial experts, the single most crucial action Americans should take with their 401(k) is to contribute enough to receive the full employer match. Failing to do so is equivalent to leaving "free money" on the table, as the employer's contribution provides an immediate and risk-free return on investment. Despite this clear benefit, a recent Vanguard report found that nearly one in five eligible workers does not take full advantage of this feature, often due to tight personal budgets. Experts stress that capturing the full match should be the primary retirement savings goal. (not investment advice)</p>
