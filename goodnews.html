          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in harvesting "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, a practice believed to bring good luck for the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, gathered plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. These plums are pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, and drinking tea made from them on New Year's Day is thought to promote good health and ward off illness. The scouts carefully hand-picked plums that were between three to four centimeters in diameter, expressing their enjoyment of the tradition.</p>

          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) is contemplating mandating changes to Google's search services to foster greater competition. The CMA's investigation, initiated under a new law, could lead to requirements such as choice screens for users to access different search providers and increased transparency for publishers whose content appears in search results. While the CMA is not currently accusing Google of anti-competitive practices, it has outlined a "roadmap" of potential changes ahead of a final decision in October. Google, which dominates the UK search market, has stated that the proposed changes could significantly impact businesses and consumers.</p>

Article 5 of the charter outlines the collective defense clause, stating that an attack on one member is considered an attack on all.

          <p>The escalating conflict between Iran and Israel is forcing airlines to reroute flights, potentially causing greater disruption for Western carriers compared to their Chinese counterparts. Western airlines, already barred from Russian airspace, face more limited options for avoiding dangerous airspace over Iran and the Middle East. Chinese airlines, however, can utilize Russian airspace, giving them a competitive advantage in terms of airfare and flight times.

Investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some suggesting a "peace through strength strategy." Trump thanked Iran for early notice of the strike, which allowed for the prevention of casualties, and called for peace between the Islamic Republic and Israel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to approve the 2025 draft budget, which includes record figures for defense spending and government borrowing. The defense budget is projected to more than double by 2029, reaching ‚Ç¨152.8 billion. Net borrowing is also expected to increase significantly, reaching ‚Ç¨81.8 billion in 2025. These increases are made possible by the easing of Germany's debt brake. The budget reflects Germany's growing security concerns and pressure to increase defense spending.</p>
