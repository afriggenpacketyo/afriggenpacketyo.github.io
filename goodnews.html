          <p>Palantir's stock surged after the company reported its first-ever billion-dollar revenue quarter, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. The software analytics provider attributed its strong performance to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and government contracts, leading it to raise its full-year financial forecast. CEO Alex Karp celebrated the "extraordinary numbers" and expressed immense pride, though some analysts remain cautious about the stock's high valuation relative to its growth.

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a significant bid for RB Leipzig striker Benjamin Sesko, with the total offer potentially reaching £73.8 million (€85m). The Premier League club's proposal includes a guaranteed payment of £65.2 million (€75m) as it seeks to secure the 22-year-old Slovenian forward. The move indicates United's serious interest in the player, who is also being pursued by Newcastle, and suggests a willingness to let current striker Rasmus Hojlund leave to accommodate the new signing.</p>

          <p>Photographs have begun circulating of a previously unseen stealth aircraft in China, sparking analysis that it could be a new sixth-generation fighter or an advanced unmanned drone. The images reveal a slim, lambda-wing design, smaller than other known Chinese stealth prototypes like the J-36, which suggests it may be optimized for high speed. Military analysts are debating its purpose, with some suggesting its streamlined features point towards it being a collaborative combat aircraft or a drone designed for maximum stealth.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has raised its adjusted profit guidance for the full year, buoyed by effective cost-cutting measures and strong second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The pharmaceutical company's revenue was bolstered by its COVID-19 products and other key drugs, leading to a 10% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year. The updated outlook also accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to expectations, a new Gallup report reveals that Gen Z is the generation least in favor of fully remote work, with only 23% preferring it. The youngest cohort of employees shows a strong preference for hybrid models, citing the importance of in-person connection for mentorship, career development, and combating loneliness. The findings suggest that early-career professionals feel their growth is compromised in a fully remote setting and crave the spontaneous interactions and learning opportunities available in an office.</p>

          <p>For homeowners with significant equity, home equity loans and lines of credit (HELOCs) currently offer a more affordable borrowing alternative compared to personal loans or credit cards. As of early August 2025, the average interest rate for a HELOC is 8.26%, while 15-year home equity loans average 8.34%, both notably lower than the double-digit rates common for other unsecured credit. These rates are variable and can differ by lender, but they present a viable option for accessing large sums of money. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) are presented as a strong option for savers looking to protect their money from inflation, with top accounts offering yields higher than the current inflation rate. While national average rates for CDs are modest, online banks are offering highly competitive rates, with some one-year CDs yielding around 4.40% APY. Financial experts suggest that short-term CDs currently provide the best returns due to an inverted yield curve, making them an attractive and safe, FDIC-insured investment.

New Delhi remains cautious, balancing its strategic autonomy with an openness to dialogue, raising questions about whether the three powers can effectively cooperate to ensure stability in Asia.</p>

Critics argue that the operator, the government-owned National Savings and Investments (NS&I), is not doing enough to trace the winners. The process is particularly difficult for those who were gifted bonds as children or only have old paper records, leading to calls for reform to make it easier for people to claim their winnings.</p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit decreased by 16.0% in June to $60.2 billion, its narrowest point since September 2023, as reported by the Commerce Department. The change was driven by a sharp decline in the import of consumer goods, reflecting the impact of President Trump's sweeping tariffs on global commerce. While the narrowing deficit provided a boost to second-quarter GDP figures, underlying economic indicators suggest that overall activity may be weakening as a result of the trade policies.
