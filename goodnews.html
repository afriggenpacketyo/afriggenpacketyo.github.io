          <p>Boeing's CEO, Kelly Ortberg, announced that airplane deliveries to China will resume next month after a pause due to trade tensions. Ortberg downplayed the impact of tariffs, noting Boeing pays tariffs on imported components but can recoup much of it upon exporting the planes. The company will also ramp up production of its 737 Max aircraft. This resumption is a positive sign for Boeing, as China is a significant market for its airplanes, and increased production will help meet global demand. Optimism is seen with the company's ability to navigate trade challenges and increase output.</p>

          <p>President Trump pardoned reality television stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who had been incarcerated since 2022 for bank and tax fraud. The couple was convicted of conspiring to defraud community banks out of over $30 million and the IRS out of nearly $500,000. Trump stated the couple received "pretty harsh treatment" and that he doesn't know the Chrisleys personally.

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a decline despite exceeding Wall Street's fiscal first-quarter estimates and raising its full-year guidance, which was attributed to artificial intelligence tailwinds. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings per share between $11.27 and $11.33, along with revenue ranging from $41.0 billion to $41.3 billion for the fiscal year. Analysts noted a slight miss on current remaining performance obligation growth for the second quarter and a slight operating margin miss as contributing factors to the stock's downturn. Salesforce's recent intent to acquire Informatica for $8 billion to bolster its AI offerings also influenced market sentiment.</p>

The author asserts that these controls aim to prevent China's military from using U.S.-designed technology. While Huang expressed concerns about Nvidia's declining market share in China, the op-ed contends that China's innovation model is evolving regardless of U.S. export controls. The author suggests Nvidia should focus on competing in other markets and highlights the company's continued success despite the strategic shift in its market exposure.</p>

Experts suggest evaluating financial goals and liquidity needs before deciding between short and long-term CDs. The uncertainty in the marketplace and the potential for future rate cuts make short-term CDs a more advantageous choice for many savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported strong fiscal first-quarter earnings, with sales growth hitting 69%. The company's data center division continues to surge due to demand for AI software. However, U.S. export controls on the H20 chip are hindering Nvidia's potential in China, a $50 billion market. Cloud providers, including Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for about half of its data center revenue. Nvidia is also focusing on AI inference, with surging demand for GPUs to serve AI models to millions of customers.</p>

          <p>Lincoln Center is undertaking a $335 million project to overhaul Damrosch Park, aiming to open it to the surrounding neighborhood and address past civic injustices. The park, currently hidden and in decline, will be renovated with a new amphitheater and tiered gardens. The project seeks to rectify the urban renewal campaign led by Robert Moses, which displaced a largely Black, Afro-Caribbean, and Puerto Rican neighborhood called San Juan Hill. The redesign includes a subtle geometry inspired by the landscape at Amsterdam Houses, symbolizing a new civic orientation.</p>

          <h2>Stocks Rise After Court Blocks Trump's Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 09:53:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock markets experienced gains after a panel of U.S. judges blocked President Trump from imposing some of his steepest tariffs. The S&P 500 index rose 0.8 percent in early trading, with Nvidia contributing significantly to the market's upward movement. Analysts noted that the court ruling suggested extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely, which reduces uncertainty. However, White House officials conveyed that they have other avenues for pursuing tariffs, potentially leading to continued market fluctuations.</p>
