          <p>British authorities have successfully intercepted a significant drug shipment, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The drugs, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million, were discovered hidden within a vessel arriving from Panama. This operation marks the sixth-largest cocaine seizure in the UK since record-keeping began, according to the Home Office. The National Crime Agency notes that Britain remains one of Europe's largest cocaine markets, and this seizure highlights the ongoing efforts by Border Force officers to disrupt international criminal networks using container ships for smuggling.</p>

          <p>Don Bacon, a Republican congressman representing a swing district in Nebraska, will not seek re-election in 2026. Bacon has been a vocal critic of former President Trump on several issues, including demanding the removal of the defense secretary and opposing certain tariffs. His district, which includes Omaha, voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in the last two elections, and his retirement is seen by Democrats as an opportunity to flip the seat. Bacon's decision underscores the challenges faced by moderate Republicans in the current political climate.</p>

Another 10% should consist of elements you can improve over time, such as paint or countertops, while the final 10% are imperfections you can live with.

          <p>According to petroleum analysis from GasBuddy, Americans may see the lowest summer gas prices since 2021. An expert predicts that the national average could fall below $3 a gallon by September. A recent price spike, driven by the conflict in the Middle East, is expected to be temporary now that a ceasefire is in place. Typically, gas prices decline over the summer as refineries increase production and the switch to more expensive summer-blend gasoline is complete, suggesting a period of relief for consumers at the pump.

A key step is to calculate your personal hourly rate to see if the time saved is more valuable than the money spent.
