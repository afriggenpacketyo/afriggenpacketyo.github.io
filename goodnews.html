          <p>Actress Kelly LeBrock, famous for her roles in '80s films like 'The Woman in Red' and 'Weird Science,' reflects on her decision to abruptly leave Hollywood at the peak of her career. She explains that she 'ran away' to a rural ranch to prioritize raising her three children away from what she describes as an 'ugly' industry culture, a choice she felt was essential for their well-being. Now a grandmother, she finds more beauty and contentment in her simpler life with animals and family, expressing no interest in returning to the spotlight and instead focusing on developing a pet care product line.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As generative AI empowers attackers with sophisticated tools for creating deepfakes and malware, corporations are now drafting AI agents into their own cyber defense forces. These AI 'teammates' help security professionals by automating routine tasks, such as analyzing alerts and investigating potential threats, which frees up human workers for more strategic responsibilities. This approach not only multiplies the capabilities of existing security teams but also helps address the industry's talent shortage and combat worker burnout. Experts view this as a necessary evolution, as defending against AI-driven attacks requires the use of AI in defense, creating a new dynamic in the cybersecurity landscape.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European leaders, including those from the UK, France, and Germany, has issued a joint statement emphasizing that peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. This declaration comes as President Trump prepares for a one-on-one meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a summit that has raised concerns about potential deals made without Ukrainian consent. While welcoming efforts to end the conflict, the European statement insists that Ukraine's sovereignty must be respected and that the current line of contact should be the starting point for negotiations. The White House has indicated it remains open to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy in the talks.</p>

          <p>Jacksonville Jaguars rookie kicker Cam Little made a remarkable 70-yard field goal during a preseason game against Pittsburgh, a distance that would have shattered the official NFL record. Although the kick will not be recorded in official league history because it occurred in the preseason, the feat caused a massive celebration among his teammates. The current NFL record is a 66-yard field goal by Baltimore's Justin Tucker. Little's powerful kick, which appeared to have cleared the crossbar with room to spare, demonstrates his potential as a significant long-range weapon for the team, especially in critical end-of-game situations.</p>

          <p>An advisor who helps Americans move abroad identifies Albania as a top overlooked destination in Europe, citing its surprising affordability, stunning natural landscapes, and welcoming culture. A key advantage for Americans is the ability to live in Albania for up to a year without a visa, offering a rare opportunity to 'test drive' life overseas without complex paperwork. Expats who have relocated there praise the low cost of living, with apartments available for under $500 a month, and the growing, supportive community of foreigners. The country's unique combination of authentic local culture and pro-American sentiment is making it an increasingly popular choice for digital nomads and retirees.</p>

Companies highlighted include energy giant Chevron (CVX), asset manager Rithm Capital (RITM), and telecom leader AT&T (T), all of which recently reported strong quarterly results. Analysts favor these stocks for their attractive dividend yields and solid business fundamentals, such as Chevron's enhanced growth from its Hess acquisition and Rithm's pivot towards an alternative investment manager model.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nineteen states are holding 'sales tax holidays' in 2025, temporarily waiving taxes on specific items like back-to-school supplies to encourage consumer spending. While politically popular, tax policy experts argue these holidays offer limited benefits, as they often just shift the timing of planned purchases rather than stimulating new economic growth. Critics also note that wealthier taxpayers, who have more flexibility in their spending, are often best positioned to take advantage of the temporary tax breaks. However, some middle- and lower-income families do strategically plan for these events to save on major expenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A schoolboy in Scotland made a remarkable historical find while jogging on a beach, discovering the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship. After the hull was exposed by a storm on an Orkney Island, a community effort was launched to preserve the timbers and research their origin. Historians identified the vessel as the whaling ship Earl of Chatham, which was formerly the HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy ship built in 1749. The ship had a storied history, serving in British sieges during the 1750s and during the American Revolution before it was sold and eventually sank in a storm in 1788.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of negativity bias, the human tendency to focus more on threats and bad news than on positive developments, an evolutionary trait that now fuels 'doomscrolling.' It argues that while the media often amplifies this bias, there are significant, underreported stories of progress, such as the potential for historic lows in the U.S. murder rate. The author suggests that embracing a mindset of realistic optimism is not naive but necessary, as it fosters resilience and inspires action by showing that even large-scale problems are solvable. This perspective is crucial for placing our challenging reality into a broader, more accurate context.</p>

          <p>Scientists have confirmed that a meteorite that crashed through the roof of a home in McDonough, Georgia, is approximately 4.56 billion years old, making it about 20 million years older than Earth itself. The object, a type of stony meteorite known as a chondrite, created a loud boom as it entered the atmosphere before fragments struck the residence. Researchers at the University of Georgia are studying the fragments to understand its composition and trajectory. This event marks the 27th meteorite recovery in Georgia and highlights how modern technology is aiding in the discovery of more such objects.</p>

          <p>The Airbus A340 was developed with four smaller engines, in contrast to the twin-engine design of its sister aircraft, the A330, primarily to address airline preferences in the late 20th century. At the time, four-engine jets were favored by some carriers, particularly in Asia, for the perceived safety and redundancy they offered on long-haul routes over open oceans. This design choice predated the widespread adoption of higher ETOPS ratings, which now certify twin-engine jets as safe for extended flights far from diversion airports. Ultimately, the higher operating and maintenance costs of four engines made the A340 less competitive, leading to its limited production.</p>

The restored building, known as 'el refugio' (the shelter), uses interactive displays and recorded testimonies to convey the often-traumatic arrival experiences of more than half a million Cubans. One such story is from Jorge Malagón Márquez, who arrived as a tearful five-year-old clutching a teddy bear that had been shredded by Cuban authorities.

Tarpley discusses how shifting her mindset to normalize slips, rather than viewing them as failures, has been crucial.

It recommends specific actions to lessen harm, such as choosing pasture-raised products over factory-farmed ones and opting for meat from larger animals like cows instead of chickens, as this results in fewer animal lives taken per pound of meat.

The novel imagines a dystopian future where society is rigidly stratified by educational achievement rather than traditional social class, a system that ultimately leads to a populist revolt against the new elite. The author of the column notes that Young, a sociologist who helped shape Britain's welfare state, intended the book as a warning.

This approach uses green infrastructure, such as parks and wetlands with permeable surfaces, to absorb, clean, and store stormwater rather than flushing it away through concrete channels. By making the urban landscape more absorbent, the city could mitigate flood risk, replenish groundwater aquifers, and reduce its dependence on imported water. While programs like Measure W are funding such projects, progress is slow, highlighting the challenges of implementing these nature-based solutions on a large scale.</p>
