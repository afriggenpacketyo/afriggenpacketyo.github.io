          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls basketball team made an unprecedented decision to return their division championship trophy after their coach, reviewing game tape, discovered a scoring error meant they had actually lost. Following a seemingly victorious buzzer-beater, the coach recounted every basket, revealing the true score favored Apache High, which had been incorrectly displayed on the scoreboard. Despite league rules preventing official score changes after a game concludes, the team unanimously agreed to appeal their own win, demonstrating remarkable integrity and sportsmanship. This act was lauded by the opposing coach, who emphasized the hope it instilled, serving as a powerful lesson that character and fair play supersede the singular pursuit of victory.</p>

          <p>Quaker, a 15-year-old military horse from the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, has officially retired to a sanctuary after sustaining injuries during a dramatic bolting incident in central London last April. The horse was one of five spooked by construction work, leading to them running loose, causing injuries to personnel and smashing into vehicles. Quaker suffered bleeding and a small break, and despite receiving surgery, was the only horse from the incident unable to return to active duty. He now enjoys a peaceful retirement at the Horse Trust in Buckinghamshire, while his rider has recovered and returned to service.</p>

          <p>China, in a significant collaborative operation with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and the Royal Thai Police, successfully seized a record 4,973.4 kilograms of methamphetamine near the disputed Scarborough Shoal. This joint effort, executed on February 24 but only recently disclosed, led to the arrest of seven suspects aboard the vessel Ji Sheng. The haul represents the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years, underscoring effective international cooperation. Representatives from all three nations have since met to further strengthen their combined efforts against drug trafficking syndicates.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a deal with AstraZeneca to implement "most-favored-nation" drug pricing for Medicaid patients and new drugs, aiming to reduce prescription costs and avoid administration tariff threats. This agreement, similar to a prior one with Pfizer, establishes a framework for the White House's goal of lowering U.S. prescription medicine prices, with AstraZeneca also listing drugs on the "TrumpRx" website. However, experts like Craig Garthwaite and Rena Conti question the deal's significant impact, noting Medicaid already secures low prices and its limited scope may not address broader healthcare affordability issues or rising insurance premiums for most Americans.</p>

          <p>New UK passports, set to be issued from December, will prominently feature King Charles's coat of arms on the cover and incorporate natural landscapes from all four UK nations within their pages. This marks the first comprehensive redesign of British passports in five years, following the post-Brexit change from burgundy to dark blue. The updated documents will also include enhanced security features, utilizing the latest anti-forgery technology to ensure they remain among the most secure globally. This transition aligns with the gradual introduction of the King's insignia across national symbols, while passports bearing Queen Elizabeth II's coat of arms remain valid until their expiry.</p>

          <h2>Apple Nears Acquisition of Computer Vision Startup Prompt AI's Talent and Technology</h2>

          <p>Apple is in late-stage talks to acquire key talent and technology from Prompt AI, a computer vision startup known for its home security app, Seemour. This "acqui-hire" aims to bolster Apple's AI research and development, likely integrating Prompt's sophisticated detection capabilities for specific people, pets, and objects into its HomeKit smart home division. Prompt AI's co-founders include notable AI researchers, and while their technology was strong, the business model proved unsustainable, leading to the app's retirement. This move aligns with Apple's historical strategy of quietly acquiring smaller teams to develop new features for its product lines, addressing its perceived slow progress in AI.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced a finalized agreement allowing the Qatari Emiri Air Force to build a training facility at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho, clarifying it is not a foreign base but a contingent for F-15 pilots. This arrangement will enable Qatari pilots to train alongside U.S. soldiers, enhancing combined training, lethality, and interoperability, similar to the Singaporean Air Force's existing presence. The move reflects the Trump administration's strengthening relationship with Qatar, which also played a "substantial" role in the Israel-Hamas peace deal and recently received U.S. security assurances against armed attacks.</p>

          <p>Navan, a developer of corporate travel and expense software, has set its IPO price range, anticipating a market capitalization of up to $6.5 billion, which represents a decrease from its $9.2 billion private valuation in 2022. This public offering is part of a resurgence in tech IPOs in 2025, following a three-year drought, despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown potentially impacting SEC operations. The company, founded in 2015, reported a $38.6 million net loss on $172 million in revenue for the July quarter.

          <p>President Donald Trump's emissaries successfully brokered a Gaza ceasefire and prisoner swap, leading to the Israeli cabinet's approval despite objections from hard-line ministers. The deal involves an IDF pullback and the return of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, marking a significant breakthrough after two years of hostilities. The article details Trump's unconventional "bellicosity in service of peace" approach, driven by concern over Gaza's humanitarian crisis and leveraging his relationships with Israel and Arab nations. A proposed 20-point plan outlines postwar governance, including an International Stabilization Force and potential amnesty for Hamas members who disarm, though challenges remain for a lasting peace.</p>

          <p>"Tron: Ares," the latest sequel in the "Tron" franchise, is critiqued for its visually stunning but narratively puzzling approach, featuring a "rock-brained screenplay" despite dazzling imagery. The article highlights the film's attempt to bring sentient computer programs into the real world, but criticizes its lack of scientific logic and the "charisma vacuum" of Jared Leto's performance as the titular AI. While director Joachim Rønning provides plenty of primary-colored glowing rings and vehicles, and a thrumming score from Nine Inch Nails, the film struggles with its protagonist and collapses the distinct appeal of the digital world with mundane real-world scenes, leaving many questions unanswered about its radical science.</p>
