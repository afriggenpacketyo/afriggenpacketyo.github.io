          <p>Walmart has shifted its tone regarding President Donald Trump's tariffs, warning that higher duties on imports will soon lead to increased prices for shoppers. CFO John David Rainey stated that the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb, prompting Trump to lash out at Walmart on social media. This situation illustrates the delicate balance business leaders face in appeasing customers, shareholders, and a transactional White House. Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to maintaining low prices, motivated by a sense of obligation to explain potential price hikes to customers and investors.</p>

          <p>With gold's value surging, investors are considering adding it to their portfolios, but it's essential to approach gold investments strategically. Limiting gold to a maximum of 10% of an overall diversified portfolio remains sound advice, as gold serves as an income protector rather than an income producer. It's best to avoid riskier investment types like gold mining stocks, opting instead for gold bars, coins, or gold IRAs. Investors should monitor the economic climate and their portfolio to ensure gold effectively hedges against inflation and to identify potential selling opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
