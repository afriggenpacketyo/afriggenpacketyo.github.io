          <p>President Donald Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, potentially ending nearly two weeks of escalating air assaults. The agreement involves two 12-hour ceasefire periods, starting with Iran and followed by Israel, after which the war would be officially declared over, according to Trump. However, neither Israeli nor Iranian officials immediately commented on the proposal, and Iran's foreign minister initially denied the existence of a ceasefire agreement. Despite the uncertainty, Trump congratulated both countries on their "stamina, courage, and intelligence" in ending what he termed "THE 12 DAY WAR."</p>

          <p>The article explores the enduring mystery of D.B. Cooper, who hijacked a Northwest Orient flight in 1971, demanding $200,000 and four parachutes before jumping from the plane and vanishing. Despite extensive investigations, neither Cooper nor the majority of the ransom money has ever been found, fueling numerous theories about his identity and fate. Some believe he was a former paratrooper, while others suggest he was inspired by a Franco-Belgian comic book series featuring a heroic test pilot named Dan Cooper. The case remains captivating due to its audacity and the lack of a definitive resolution, drawing in amateur sleuths and podcasters who are determined to uncover the truth.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1", the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, which represents a significant advancement in using light for simultaneous computations. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power of 2,560 TOPS at 50GHz optical frequency, rivaling the performance of advanced Nvidia GPUs. This development is particularly crucial as traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, and US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips. Optical computing offers inherent advantages like ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption, positioning it as a vital future direction for AI and data centers.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell nearly 3% after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing fears of escalating conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil prices and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant declines, dropping below levels seen before Israel's attack on Iran. The market sell-off suggests investors believe the conflict will de-escalate following President Trump's actions, with some analysts suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the U.S. to avoid casualties and calling for peace.</p>
