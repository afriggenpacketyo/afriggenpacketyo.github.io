          <p>An opinion article suggests that Hong Kong should be considered to co-host China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Shanghai's front-runner status. While Shanghai offers extensive AI infrastructure and political backing, Hong Kong's unique "one country, two systems" framework and independent judiciary could help reassure international partners and mitigate Western skepticism amid US-China tech tensions. The proposal argues that this strategic choice would position the city at the center of China's AI diplomacy and influence on global standards, blending Chinese interests with international credibility.</p>

          <p>A man from Norfolk, England, has spoken out after his attacker was sentenced to eight years in prison, two decades after the crime occurred. Dan Cooper, who waived his right to anonymity, was inspired to re-report the sexual assault to police after serving on a jury in an unrelated 2018 trial. The case highlights the long-term trauma faced by survivors and the challenges of the legal process, as Cooper was diagnosed with complex PTSD linked to the attack. He now uses social media to share his story and support other survivors of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has publicly refuted accusations from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who claimed the agency was hiding dysfunction and removing critical performance data. In a letter, SSA Commissioner Frank J. Bisignano asserted that the agency is more transparent and efficient under the Trump administration, now reporting nearly three times more performance metrics than under the previous one. The SSA provided data indicating improvements in customer service, such as reduced phone wait times and faster disability claim processing, and urged the senator to cease what it called "fearmongering" about the agency's stability.</p>

          <p>Japan's exports in August experienced a smaller-than-expected decline of 0.1% year-on-year, an improvement from the 2.6% drop in July, marking the fourth consecutive month of contraction. The softer decline was supported by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe, which helped offset a significant 13.8% fall in exports to the United States. This economic data arrives as Japan faces political uncertainty with the impending resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and ahead of the Bank of Japan's upcoming interest rate decision.

          <p>A 19-year-old woman in Chino Hills, California, successfully defended herself against an armed robber by throwing her cup of tea at him. The incident occurred when the alleged attacker, brandishing a knife, demanded she hand over her beverage. The woman's quick thinking to toss the drink at the man created a distraction, allowing her to escape unharmed and call for help. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived shortly after and arrested a 29-year-old suspect at the shopping center on a single count of robbery.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that artificial intelligence could boost the United Kingdom's economy by 10% within five years, potentially faster than previous technological shifts. This prediction coincides with Microsoft's new $30 billion investment in the UK's AI sector, its largest outside the US, which is part of a broader £31 billion agreement between the UK government and several American tech giants. The investment will support AI infrastructure, including a new supercomputer in Essex, and aims to stimulate significant economic growth and create highly skilled jobs across the country.</p>

This pricing falls at the midpoint of the expected range the company had previously announced.

The move comes amid a resurgent IPO market that has seen successful debuts from other tech and finance companies in recent months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Five partially built homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon, which have been the subject of legal battles for over two decades, are set to be demolished under a plea agreement. The city first ordered the structures torn down in 2003 after the original developers failed to complete a required environmental impact assessment. Despite the order, a series of subsequent owners attempted to restart construction on the dilapidated properties. The current owners pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders and are now required to demolish the homes by August 2026.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that JPMorgan Chase is positioned to become the next non-technology company to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization, joining a select group of tech giants. Cramer highlighted the bank's strong performance across lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon, as key drivers of its potential growth. The analysis notes that while JPMorgan is currently valued around $850 billion, a recent expansion in the price-to-earnings multiples for the entire banking sector could provide the momentum for it to reach this milestone.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals a significant shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This trend is largely driven by the increasing popularity of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. According to the AA, learners are becoming more comfortable with an all-electric driving future, making the skill of driving a manual car less relevant for many. This marks a dramatic increase from just over a decade ago, when only 6% of tests were taken in automatics.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur has demonstrated a significant strategic shift under manager Thomas Frank, prioritizing defensive solidity over the attack-focused style of the previous season. The team's 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal marked their fourth clean sheet in five games, a stark contrast to their record at the same point last year. Players have highlighted a new "clean sheet mentality," focusing on structure and making the team difficult to break down. While this pragmatic approach has yielded strong defensive results, it has come at the cost of offensive excitement, with the team registering only one shot on target in the win.</p>
