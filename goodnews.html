          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, released its first earnings report since its IPO, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company reported a loss of $1.49 per share but generated $981.6 million in revenue, exceeding the expected $853 million. Management anticipates revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, driven by new client uptake and a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite long-term uncertainties in AI supply and demand, CoreWeave is working to diversify its business and sees no meaningful impact from President Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>A federal grand jury indicted Wisconsin Judge Hannah Dugan on charges of concealing a person from arrest and obstruction related to an immigration case. Dugan allegedly misdirected federal agents away from a person in her courtroom who was in the U.S. illegally. Prosecutors say Dugan escorted Eduardo Flores-Ruiz and his lawyer out of her courtroom through a back door after learning ICE agents were seeking his arrest. The state Supreme Court has suspended Dugan from the bench, and she is expected to enter a not guilty plea.</p>

Starting in 2027, adults with "unsatisfactory immigration status" will also have to pay a $100 monthly premium.

          <p>Mark Carney, the newly elected Canadian Prime Minister, criticized the UK government's invitation to US President Donald Trump for a second state visit, saying Canadians were not "impressed" by the gesture. Carney stated that the invitation, extended by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, did not help Canadians, who were facing repeated comments from Trump about making Canada the 51st US state. Carney contrasted this with Canada's invitation for King Charles III to attend the opening of Canada's Parliament, reaffirming Canada's sovereignty.</p>
