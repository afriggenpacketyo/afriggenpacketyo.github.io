          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 19:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a child psychology expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills often have parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about feelings to build emotional vocabulary, modeling empathy in everyday interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than lecturing, these parents validate their child's feelings and treat mistakes as learning opportunities. The article suggests that creating an environment of emotional safety and connection is the true foundation for developing strong social skills.</p>

          <p>UK Work and Pensions Secretary Pat McFadden has stated that reforming the welfare system is a necessity that must proceed. He vowed to press forward with changes aimed at providing better support for individuals to return to work and addressing the escalating costs of benefits. This commitment comes after the government recently abandoned a major policy intended to cut disability benefits. McFadden emphasized that the current system is unhealthy for recipients and fiscally unsustainable, suggesting that specially trained job centre staff will offer voluntary support to those on long-term sickness benefits.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists is developing a novel approach to reduce the transmission of Lyme disease on the island of Nantucket by genetically engineering the local mouse population. The project, led by an MIT associate professor, aims to make the native white-footed mice—the primary carriers of Lyme bacteria—heritably immune to the disease. By introducing an antibody gene into the mice, they hope to break the infection cycle where ticks feed on infected mice and then transmit the illness to humans. The project is proceeding with a strong emphasis on community consultation to ensure public buy-in before any potential release.</p>

Founded by figures like Niall Ferguson and Bari Weiss, the university aims to combat what they see as a culture of self-censorship and ideological conformity on other campuses. For now, the institution offers free tuition, funded by nearly $200 million in private donations. Its curriculum is rooted in Western civilization, and classes are small, seminar-style discussions intended to foster open debate and intellectual diversity.</p>

          <p>A unique "super generation" of monarch butterflies, which can live up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, has completed its mysterious and epic 3,000-mile migration from the northern U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. This annual journey is a natural wonder, guided by the butterflies' internal clocks and compasses. However, the monarch population has declined significantly over the past 30 years due to threats like habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their caterpillars. Conservation efforts, including planting milkweed waystations and tagging butterflies, are underway to protect this iconic species.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost their regular-season home finale to the San Francisco Giants 3-1, despite a strong seven-inning, one-hit performance from pitcher Emmet Sheehan. A bullpen collapse in the eighth inning allowed the Giants to take the lead. The game marked a milestone for the franchise, as attendance surpassed four million for the first time, reflecting strong fan support throughout the season. With their magic number to clinch the division title at three, the team is now focused on its final road trip before an expected return to Dodger Stadium for the playoffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The southern right whale population in South Australia is showing a remarkable recovery, thirty years after the establishment of the Great Australian Bight Marine Park. Researchers from Flinders University report that the repopulation rate is among the fastest in the world for this species, which was once hunted to near extinction. These whales were considered the "right whales" to hunt due to their slow speed. The success story highlights the critical importance of marine protected areas in allowing threatened species to rebound and underscores how targeted conservation efforts can yield significant positive results for ecosystems.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, along with Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell, are likely to be part of an investment group seeking to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. The potential sale is mandated by a 2024 law requiring the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. Trump described the potential investors as "American patriots" and suggested a deal could be finalized in the coming days. The involvement of such powerful media and tech figures would give them significant influence over one of America's most popular social media platforms.</p>

This tactical gamble aimed to stifle Arsenal's potent central attack and counter the fatigue of his players, who were playing their third game in a week. For over 90 minutes, the strategy nearly worked, as City frustrated the home side.
