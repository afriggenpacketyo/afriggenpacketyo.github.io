          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Six Common but Potentially Harmful Untruths Parents Tell Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist with over two decades of experience highlights several common "lies" that well-intentioned parents tell their children, which can inadvertently hinder their long-term success and well-being. Phrases like "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" can create self-blame, while admonitions against being selfish can prevent the development of healthy self-care. The article suggests that parents should instead foster realism, emotional honesty, and an understanding that asking for help is a sign of strength. It advocates for more nuanced conversations about difficult feelings and social situations to build emotional resilience.</p>

          <h2>Boeing Reports Reduced Losses and Increased Sales, Citing a Potential Turnaround Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:06:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing has significantly reduced its quarterly losses and reported a 35% increase in revenue, driven by the highest number of airplane deliveries since 2018. CEO Kelly Ortberg described 2025 as a potential "turnaround year," highlighting improved performance and stability, although the company still posted an adjusted loss. The positive results were tempered by a $445 million charge related to a Justice Department settlement over the 737 Max crashes and a delay in the certification of new Max models. The company is increasing production and aims to be cash-generative by the fourth quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German historian Karl Schlögel, a renowned expert on Eastern Europe, has been awarded the 2025 Peace Prize of the German Book Trade. The prize jury highlighted his early warnings about Vladimir Putin's expansionist policies and his continued advocacy for Ukraine's place within Europe. Schlögel's work, which includes deep dives into Stalinist Russia and the Soviet era, is praised for its vivid narrative style that challenges prejudices. In accepting the honor, he reiterated his belief that a free Ukraine is essential for peace in Europe and that Germany must be prepared to defend it.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that while society has heavily promoted coding and college degrees, the rise of AI is demonstrating the enduring value of skilled manual labor. The author, referencing Mike Rowe, points out that AI cannot perform the work of electricians, plumbers, welders, and other tradespeople, for whom there is a massive and growing demand. The article calls for a cultural shift to value vocational training and create direct pathways to these careers for individuals in underserved communities. It posits that investing in the trades is a crucial way to reverse economic decline and empower a new generation of workers.</p>

          <p>Walmart is entering into a multiyear partnership with Major League Soccer (MLS), becoming an official sponsor to connect with the sport's rapidly expanding and diverse U.S. audience. The collaboration, which kicks off with the Leagues Cup tournament, aims to capitalize on the rising interest in soccer ahead of the 2026 World Cup in North America. As part of the deal, Walmart's brand will be featured prominently during games, and the partners will develop exclusive content and fan experiences. The move is strategic for Walmart, as the MLS fanbase is notably younger and more culturally diverse, aligning with the retailer's target growth demographics.</p>

The statement came as the firm reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by strong demand for its cancer and biopharmaceutical products, further underscoring the strategic importance of its U.S. operations.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 09:57:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage experts are largely predicting that rates will remain relatively stable through August, as the Federal Reserve continues its cautious approach to inflation and potential interest rate cuts. Uncertainty stemming from the administration's tariff policies is a key factor contributing to the Fed's hesitation. While many analysts do not expect a rate cut until at least September, they advise prospective homebuyers against trying to time the market, as a future drop in rates could fuel increased competition and higher home prices. For those considering refinancing, however, waiting a few months might prove beneficial if a rate cut materializes later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A lead researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day, 32-hour workweek has identified three critical strategies for success. The first involves significant changes to meetings, such as shortening them, deleting unnecessary ones, and protecting focused work time. Secondly, companies improved efficiency through process engineering, empowering employees to streamline their own tasks. Finally, businesses eliminated low-impact work by re-evaluating which projects truly aligned with their core mission. These methods have led to increased productivity, higher profits, and improved employee well-being in the piloted programs.</p>

The litter is the largest born in the UK and brings new hope for the global population, which is estimated to be fewer than 400 in the wild due to habitat loss and poaching. The birth is part of a highly regulated European breeding program that genetically matches tigers to ensure the health and diversity of the species.
