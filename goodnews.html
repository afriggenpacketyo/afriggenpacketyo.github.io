          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to explore ways to potentially reduce costs and improve efficiency for Amtrak's Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, a project connecting Baltimore to Washington and Virginia, which has seen its estimated cost increase from $6 billion to $8.5 billion. The Department of Transportation has confirmed that the Boring Company is among several firms being considered for a new engineering contract. Concerns have been raised regarding Musk's potential conflicts of interest due to his involvement with companies regulated by federal agencies and his role in government efficiency initiatives. The Frederick Douglass Tunnel is intended to replace the 152-year-old Baltimore and Potomac Tunnel, but has faced concerns about rising costs and missed deadlines.</p>

          <p>House Republicans have outlined a tax bill featuring temporary extensions of President Trump's 2017 tax law, including lower marginal income tax rates and a larger standard deduction, along with new tax breaks such as exemptions for tips and overtime pay, and tax advantaged 'MAGA accounts' for children's investments. To offset the costs, the bill proposes raising taxes on President Biden's clean energy initiatives, university endowments, and remittances sent overseas, with an expected addition of $2.5 trillion to the deficit over the next decade. The bill has already faced criticism from some House Republicans over the proposed increase to the limit on state and local tax deduction to $30,000 from $10,000, signaling potential challenges in securing enough votes for passage.</p>

Ciattarelli, a former member of the State Assembly, expressed honor in receiving Trump's endorsement. The endorsement could prove to be a liability in the general election, as New Jersey traditionally leans left, and Mr. Trump is seen as an increasingly polarizing figure in a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by more than 800,000 voters. In 2021, Ciattarelli strained to avoid appearing overtly aligned with Mr. Trump, whom, years earlier, he had called a charlatan who was ‚Äúnot fit to be president.‚Äù</p>
