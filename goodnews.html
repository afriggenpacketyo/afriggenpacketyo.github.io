          <p>A U.S. Air Force commander has revealed details of "Operation Midnight Hammer," a large-scale, long-duration B-2 stealth bomber mission that struck Iranian nuclear facilities in June. Col. Josh Wiitala described the 30-hour operation, which involved seven bombers and marked the first combat use of the 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator (MOP) bomb. The strikes targeted underground sites at Fordow and Natanz, aiming to cripple Iran's uranium enrichment capabilities. The mission is being hailed by the U.S. military as a flawless success that demonstrated significant strategic coordination and operational secrecy.</p>

Cramer also reiterated his strong support for Boeing, advising investors to consider buying the stock despite recent certification delays for its 777X jet, viewing the price drop as a buying opportunity.

He paid tribute to his wife, Hannah Walters, calling her his "rock" and "soulmate," and thanked his family for their unwavering support throughout his career.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to a "framework" deal concerning the future ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The agreement, reached during trade talks in Madrid, aims to pave the way for U.S. ownership of the popular social media app, thereby addressing national security concerns. The deal is set to be finalized by President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday. This development comes ahead of a looming deadline for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its American arm or face a nationwide ban.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An alliance of nearly 200 shipping companies, known as the Getting to Zero Coalition, has publicly supported the implementation of a first-ever global fee on greenhouse gas emissions for their sector. The proposal is set to be considered by the International Maritime Organization (IMO) next month as a key measure to accelerate the transition to green shipping. This industry-led initiative is in direct opposition to the stance of the Trump administration, which has rejected the framework as a "global carbon tax" and threatened retaliation against nations that support it. The move highlights a growing divide between corporate climate action and current U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has officially reached a market capitalization of $3 trillion, becoming only the fourth company to achieve this milestone alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged over 4% on Monday, propelled by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties on the tech giant. Despite ongoing regulatory challenges and increased competition in the AI sector, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year. This achievement marks a significant moment for the company, roughly two decades after its initial public offering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Proposes Shift to Semi-Annual Corporate Earnings Reports to Foster Long-Term Focus</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has revived his proposal for public companies to move from quarterly to semi-annual earnings reports, a change he argues would encourage long-term strategic thinking over short-term profit chasing. In a social media post, Trump stated the move would save money and allow managers to focus on running their companies more effectively. The idea, which would require SEC approval, has been debated before, with proponents like Warren Buffett arguing against the pressures of quarterly guidance. Critics, however, maintain that frequent reporting is essential for market transparency and providing timely information to investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Is the Most Affordable Power Source</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive analysis of energy production costs reveals that renewable sources, particularly onshore wind and utility-scale solar, are the cheapest forms of energy. The study, using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark, shows renewables are more cost-competitive than fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, as well as nuclear power. This cost advantage holds even before factoring in government subsidies such as those in the Inflation Reduction Act. While renewables have high upfront capital costs, their operational expenses are significantly lower, and they are not subject to the price volatility of fossil fuels.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates, Offering Potential Relief for Borrowers</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely anticipated to announce an interest rate cut this week, which would be its first since 2024, despite recent inflation data being higher than expected. This move is seen as a response to growing concerns about downside risks to the economy and the job market. For consumers, a rate cut could provide some relief from high borrowing costs, particularly for variable-rate debt like credit cards. The article advises savers to lock in high yields on CDs now, while those with debt should prioritize paying it down to benefit from potentially lower rates ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF) on Monday, a move indicating some minor, temporary tightness in funding markets. The borrowing coincided with the deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments and a large Treasury security settlement, which increased the demand for short-term cash. The SRF was established as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding squeezes by allowing banks to exchange Treasuries for overnight cash. Analysts suggest the current pressure is a normal market function related to payment deadlines and not a sign of a broader systemic issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has officially endorsed state assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, a significant boost for the progressive candidate. In a New York Times opinion piece, Hochul acknowledged past disagreements but praised Mamdani as a leader focused on affordability and safety. The endorsement is notable given the deep divisions within the Democratic party over Mamdani's democratic socialist platform and his strong criticism of Israel. Hochul's support provides crucial mainstream backing for Mamdani, who has been leading in the polls against rivals like former governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>
