          <p>A CBS News/YouGov poll reveals mixed opinions among California voters regarding potential 2028 presidential campaigns for Governor Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris. While a majority of California Democrats support a Newsom run, overall state opinion is split, and support for Harris is lower. The survey also indicates that Californians view their state as a leader in technology and culture but not in housing, taxes, or economic policy, reflecting widespread concern over the high cost of living. This sentiment provides context for the upcoming 2026 gubernatorial race, where many voters remain undecided.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have dropped for the second consecutive week to 6.19%, nearing a three-year low and offering a potential opportunity for prospective homebuyers. Experts advise buyers to remain cautious, as rates are declining gradually and could reverse course due to various economic factors, similar to previous fluctuations this year. The current environment may present a window with less competition compared to the anticipated spring 2026 market. Acting now could be advantageous, but buyers should carefully weigh affordability and market volatility before committing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have experienced significant fluctuations, recently dropping from over $4,300 per ounce to around $4,000 before rebounding, driven by conflicting market forces like Federal Reserve rate cuts and a strong stock market. This volatility presents opportunities for investors who can act strategically. The article suggests three approaches to capitalize on these swings: trading gold mining stocks for leveraged exposure, using gold ETFs or futures for short-term plays, and buying physical gold during price dips for a long-term hedge. These methods allow investors to adapt to rapid market changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of quantum computing firms like IonQ and Rigetti Computing remained high even after the Trump administration denied it was "currently" negotiating to take equity stakes in them. Investors appear to be optimistic due to the specific wording of the denial, which leaves open the possibility of future talks or different investment structures, such as warrants. The U.S. government views quantum computing as critical for national security, especially in competition with China. This strategic importance continues to fuel investor interest, despite the technology not yet being commercially viable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pediatric psychologists and child development experts are decoding common toddler behaviors like constantly saying "no," possessiveness, and resisting transitions, explaining them as crucial stages of development. These actions are not defiance for its own sake but rather a toddler's way of establishing independence and understanding their identity in relation to the world. Experts advise parents to reframe this boundary-pushing as a learning process. They recommend strategies such as offering limited choices, modeling desired behaviors like sharing, and clearly stating what to do instead of what not to do, helping to navigate this challenging yet vital phase.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has authorized the hunting of mute swans, classifying them as a "destructive, non-native" species. Starting January 1, licensed hunters can kill the birds at any time, and landowners can do so without a permit, in an effort to control their growing population, now estimated at 6,900. Mute swans, introduced to North America in the 1800s, are not protected by federal migratory bird treaties. Officials state the territorial birds are detrimental to native waterfowl as they compete for limited submerged aquatic vegetation, a crucial food source for other species.</p>

          <p>With an unprecedented concentration of market value in a few mega-cap tech stocks, investors are increasingly seeking uncorrelated assets to mitigate portfolio risk. According to ETF flow data, cash, precious metals, and cryptocurrency have become popular choices for diversification. This shift reflects a growing concern that portfolios are overexposed to the tech and AI sectors. While allocations to alternatives like gold and crypto are still relatively small, the launch of regulated ETFs has made them more accessible and legitimate tools for mainstream investors looking to hedge against market volatility.

          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his plan to "surge" federal forces into San Francisco, citing progress on crime and appeals from prominent tech leaders. In a social media post, Trump said he was swayed by calls from Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, among others, who expressed optimism about the city's future. The decision is a significant political victory for San Francisco's moderate Democratic Mayor, Daniel Lurie, who had engaged with the administration while publicly opposing a military deployment. The reversal comes as city data shows a significant downturn in crime rates and an economic upswing driven by the AI boom.</p>
