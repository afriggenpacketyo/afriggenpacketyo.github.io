          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 23:52:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota and Honda, experienced significant gains following reports that the U.S. would lower tariffs on imported vehicles from 25% to 15%. Toyota's stock jumped over 15%, while others like Nissan and Mazda also saw substantial increases, reflecting investor relief. This development is crucial for Japan's economy, as auto exports to the U.S. represent a major component of its trade. The move provides short-term assurance to an industry that had seen exports decline under the previous tariff structure and faces growing competition. (not investment advice)</p>

The index, which measures travel freedom based on data from the International Air Transport Association, highlights a continued decline for the United States and United Kingdom passports, which have slipped to 10th and 6th place, respectively.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major trade deal with Japan, establishing a "reciprocal" tariff rate of 15% on Japanese exports, a reduction from the previous 25% on automobiles. President Trump touted the agreement as potentially the "largest Deal ever made," claiming it includes a $550 billion investment from Japan into the U.S. and will open Japanese markets to more American goods. The deal provides a significant political boost for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, whose leadership has been under pressure. The announcement spurred a rally in Japanese markets, particularly for auto industry stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed closer Tanner Scott on the injured list due to elbow inflammation, though the team remains optimistic that the injury is not season-ending. Scott exited a recent game after feeling a "stinging sensation" in his forearm, but initial reports suggest he was feeling better the following day pending a full MRI review. The injury adds pressure to a Dodgers bullpen already impacted by several other key injuries this season. The team's management has indicated that acquiring another high-leverage reliever remains a priority ahead of the upcoming trade deadline.</p>

          <p>A wooden shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a remarkable history. Researchers used a combination of tree-ring dating and archival records to determine the ship was originally HMS Hind, a 24-gun Royal Navy frigate built in 1749. The ship served during the sieges of Quebec and the American War of Independence before being sold and repurposed as an Arctic whaling vessel. It ultimately wrecked in a storm in 1788, with all crew surviving, and its discovery has been a major community-driven archaeological project.</p>
