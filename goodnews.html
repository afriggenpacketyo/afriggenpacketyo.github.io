          <p>New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani confirmed he received a congratulatory phone call from former President Barack Obama following his primary victory. Mamdani stated they discussed the importance of maintaining hope in a political climate often characterized by 'darkness.' The conversation also touched on how to govern effectively to deliver on campaign promises. As a democratic socialist, Mamdani has faced significant criticism on the campaign trail, and he mentioned that he looks to Obama as an example of how to rise above such attacks while preparing for the responsibilities of potentially leading the city.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is expected to strengthen further, potentially becoming a major hurricane early next week. Currently a Category 1 storm, Erin is located several hundred miles east of the Leeward Islands and is moving west-northwest. Forecasters have issued tropical storm watches for several Caribbean islands, warning of heavy rain and dangerous surf conditions. Current forecast models predict the hurricane will curve northward, keeping it well offshore from the U.S. East Coast, though meteorologists continue to monitor its path closely.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the Tax Foundation details the financial impact of President Trump's recent tax legislation, revealing significant variations in savings for taxpayers based on their state of residence and income level. On average, individuals are projected to save $3,752 in 2026, with residents of states like Wyoming and Washington seeing the largest benefits. The report also highlights that high-income earners in resort areas could see disproportionately large tax cuts, while a separate Congressional Budget Office report suggests lower-income households may be negatively affected by cuts to social programs.

          <p>The healthcare sector was the top performer in the stock market this week, buoyed by positive developments for major companies like Eli Lilly and UnitedHealth Group. Eli Lilly's stock rebounded following a wave of insider buying, while UnitedHealth saw a surge after Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a new stake in the insurer. In contrast, the technology, consumer staples, and utilities sectors all posted losses for the week as market momentum shifted away from recent winners.

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's justification for federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force reveals his claims about crime being 'out of control' are misleading. While D.C. did have a high homicide rate in 2023 compared to states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and the comparison to states is inappropriate. The article highlights that official data from D.C. police and the FBI show a significant decrease in violent crime and homicides in 2024 and 2025, a downward trend that aligns with national statistics. Even the AI bot on Trump's Truth Social platform provides a more nuanced view, stating that crime is currently declining.</p>

          <p>A research team at Rice University has discovered a more efficient and durable method for converting carbon dioxide into useful industrial materials like alcohols and carbon monoxide. The new process, called electrochemical CO2 reduction, uses 'acid bubbles' instead of water, which prevents the buildup of salt byproducts that typically clog the system. In lab tests, this acid-humidified method operated stably for over 2,000 hours, a significant improvement over the traditional water-based system which failed after only 80 hours. This breakthrough could make it more viable to turn a major pollutant into a valuable feedstock for fuels and other products.</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a leading technology analyst has described such an intervention as essential for U.S. national security. The move is seen as necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC and Samsung. The news caused Intel's stock to surge, marking its best week in over 25 years. While government ownership of private companies is unusual, proponents argue it is justified in this case to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge in critical technology.

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching a magnitude of 4.0, has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area, which is one of the world's most productive geothermal power facilities. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the power generation process itself, which involves withdrawing steam and injecting cold water deep underground. Officials state that these minor quakes do not pose a significant hazard, as the region's major fault lines are located miles away.</p>

This trend is consistent with broader industry data showing a 5% increase in U.S. jewelry sales in the first half of the year.
