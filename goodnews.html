        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Seoul National University College of Medicine indicates that breast cancer survivors may have a slightly reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. Researchers analyzed data from over 70,000 survivors and found an 8% lower risk of dementia within five years of treatment, particularly for those aged 65 and older. The risk reduction was most pronounced in patients who had received radiation therapy. While these findings seem to contradict concerns about "chemo brain," a cognitive decline associated with chemotherapy, experts caution that more long-term research is needed to confirm the link and understand the underlying mechanisms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American summer holidays, has its roots in the Indigenous Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean. The term "barbecue" is derived from the Ta√≠no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used for cooking meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa," which was first documented in print in 1526. Over centuries, the cooking style and its associated sauces have evolved regionally across the United States, influenced by various immigrant cultures, to become the diverse culinary tradition it is today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new version of a major policy bill passed by the U.S. Senate includes enhanced incentives for the semiconductor industry, aiming to strengthen the domestic supply chain. The legislation would increase tax credits for chip manufacturers building plants in the U.S. from 25% to 35%, expanding on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. This move is part of Washington's ongoing effort to onshore advanced chip production from Asia and could benefit companies like Intel, TSMC, and Micron. The bill must still pass the House, but analysts suggest the increased credits, combined with the threat of tariffs, will accelerate efforts to expand U.S. manufacturing capacity.

          <p>China is currently experiencing a period of stark economic contrasts, where a sluggish consumer economy coexists with rapid advancements in artificial intelligence. While pessimism about post-COVID growth persists, Chinese companies like Honor and Huawei are making significant technological leaps, using AI to design ultra-thin foldable phones and automate mining operations. This innovation is not limited to major tech hubs, as development spreads to smaller cities and foreign companies like Siemens also develop AI products in China. This technological transformation is beginning to integrate deeply into business operations, suggesting a pivotal phase for the country's industrial future despite broader economic headwinds.

          <p>Liverpool FC has turned down a formal approach from German club Bayern Munich for forward Luis Diaz. The Premier League club has made it clear to Bayern's director of sport, Max Eberl, that they have no intention of selling the 28-year-old player and will not engage in transfer discussions. This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers the Colombian international, who scored 22 goals for his club and country last season, to be a key part of their squad and not for sale at any price.</p>

          <p>China's senior leadership, led by President Xi Jinping, has explicitly targeted the "disorderly low-price competition" that is affecting numerous industries across the country. The new terminology, used at a top economic meeting, signals a more direct approach to tackling the damaging price wars that have been prevalent. Beijing views this aggressive price-cutting to capture market share as a threat to the economy's health, as it stifles innovation, reduces efficiency, and hinders industrial upgrading. The policy aims to guide companies toward improving product quality and facilitate the exit of outdated production capacity from the market. (not investment advice)</p>

Lillard will now become a free agent, able to sign with any team while continuing his rehabilitation.
