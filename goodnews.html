          <p>Following a ceasefire with Pakistan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi convened a meeting with top government officials, including the Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and External Affairs Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, as well as senior military personnel. The discussions took place a day after both sides alleged ceasefire breaches, although no escalation of hostilities has occurred since US President Donald Trump announced the truce. The meeting suggests a cautious approach by the Indian government to maintain stability in the region after recent tensions. The focus remains on upholding the ceasefire agreement and preventing any further escalation.</p>

          <h2>A Psychiatrist's Perspective: Mothers, Cut Yourselves Some Slack</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 04:17:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times article, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should ease up on the pressure to be perfect, as being flawed is a crucial part of parenting. She points out that the mental health field has historically blamed mothers for their children's problems, overlooking the credit they deserve. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to acknowledge their imperfections and recognize that their flaws help children learn to accept their own, and gives a quiz for mothers to help them realize they are doing a good job. The article ultimately advocates for self-compassion and reducing the unrealistic expectations placed on mothers.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels of the year, according to Freddie Mac. While this rate is lower than the 7.09% from a year ago, it continues to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers. The 15-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by various factors, including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter of 2025, attributed to lower oil prices and reduced production. The company's net income for the quarter was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations, while free cash flow decreased from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion. These figures reflect ongoing pressure on Aramco's financial performance due to sluggish crude prices and slowing global demand. Despite the profit dip, Aramco increased its first-quarter base dividend by 4.2% to $21.1 billion.</p>

This visit underscores the strengthening relationship between Brazil and China, Brazil's largest trading partner since 2009. China has also voiced opposition to the 'bullying' of Latin America, as well as unilateral sanctions against countries in the region, in an apparent reference to the US's trade policies. China's imports of Brazilian agricultural products, especially soybeans, have risen, reflecting Beijing's strategy to reduce reliance on US imports amidst trade tensions.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that Chinese energy investments in Africa are increasingly directed towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of China's energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. This shift aligns with global trends as China commits to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas.
