          <p>Returning to the Hollywood Bowl after a seven-year absence, Colombian artist Juanes delivered a powerful message of unity to the Latino community in Los Angeles. He referenced the fear caused by immigration raids and urged the audience to stay united now more than ever. During the concert, he performed songs from his new album, "Vida cotidiana," along with classic hits like "La camisa negra." The show featured a surprise collaboration with the local band LA LOM and concluded with a mariachi tribute to Mexican culture, honoring the city that launched his U.S. career.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province, identified only as Zhang, has captured local attention by building and successfully operating a seven-meter homemade submarine. Inspired by a television program in 2014, Zhang used 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his savings to buy steel plates, a battery, and an engine to secretly construct the vessel. Having managed a local dock for years, he fulfilled a lifelong dream of invention. The sleek, black submarine has been seen navigating a quiet river, astonishing local villagers with his creation.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Core Inflation Eases in June, but Economic Headwinds Remain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 23:13:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices. Despite this moderation, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists note that while the easing is welcome, persistent inflationary pressures and the threat of higher U.S. tariffs create uncertainty for the nation's economy. These challenges are compounded by political anxiety surrounding the upcoming Upper House election and concerns about future GDP growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on U.S. defense spending but stated they are now committed to increasing their own contributions. In an interview, Merz emphasized that Germany and its allies understand the need to do more for their own security, particularly in response to the threat from Russia. He described being on the same page as U.S. President Trump regarding ending the war in Ukraine and is working to strengthen a triangular alliance between Germany, the UK, and France.</p>

          <p>On the fifth anniversary of his death, tens of thousands of people across all 50 U.S. states participated in "Good Trouble Lives On" protests honoring civil rights icon John Lewis. The events, organized by dozens of advocacy groups, were held to protest the Trump administration's policies on civil rights, immigration, and social programs. Demonstrators in cities like Atlanta and Washington D.C. marched and rallied, invoking Lewis's call to engage in "good trouble, necessary trouble." The day of action aimed to carry forward his fight for justice and voting rights for all Americans.</p>

          <p>Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has indicated that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) may soon alter its long-standing restrictions on liquids in carry-on baggage. Speaking at a conference, Noem said she is questioning the current rules and that an announcement on liquid sizes could be forthcoming. This follows the recent policy change that eliminated the need for passengers to remove shoes during standard security screening. Noem envisions a future of airport security where travelers can walk through a scanner and proceed directly to their plane in under a minute.</p>

          <p>The annual Congressional Women's Softball Game brought together female members of Congress from both parties to compete against a team of journalists for a charitable cause. Unlike the partisan men's game, the women play on a single unified team to raise money for the Young Survival Coalition, which supports young adults with breast cancer. The event, co-founded by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz after her own diagnosis, has raised nearly $5 million over 17 years. Participants emphasized the game's importance for setting aside political divisions to support a deeply personal cause.</p>

          <p>A review roundup in the Los Angeles Times' Spanish section covers several new film releases with Latin American connections. The article critiques the horror sequel "I Know What You Did Last Summer," noting it is ironically self-aware but ultimately not memorable. It also examines Ari Aster's neo-western "Eddington," starring Joaquin Phoenix and Pedro Pascal, praising its ambitious and realistic portrayal of a polarized society. Additionally, the roundup looks at the bullfighting documentary "Tardes de soledad" and two LGBTQ+ dramas, "Before We Forget" and "Unicorns," highlighting their unique perspectives.</p>

He works at a 1940s-themed tea room and antiques shop, where he is adored by customers for his knowledge and passion.

          <p>An ice core, potentially over 1.5 million years old, has arrived at the British Antarctic Survey in the UK, where it will be melted to study Earth's ancient climate. Drilled from deep within the Antarctic ice sheet, the core contains trapped materials like dust and volcanic ash that can reveal information about a previously unknown period of the planet's history. Scientists hope the analysis will revolutionize understanding of climate change, particularly a mysterious shift in glacial cycles that occurred over 800,000 years ago, providing context for today's rapidly changing climate.</p>

          <p>New UK regulations taking effect next July will require shoppers using 'buy now, pay later' (BNPL) services to undergo stricter affordability checks. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is implementing the rules to prevent consumers from accumulating excessive debt, meaning some shoppers may be refused credit. The changes will bring the currently unregulated sector more in line with other forms of lending, providing consumers with rights like faster refunds and access to the Financial Ombudsman. Debt charities have welcomed the move as a significant step forward in consumer protection. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump, 79, has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign vein condition. The announcement followed public speculation after photographs showed swelling in his legs and bruising on his hand. A physician's note confirmed the diagnosis, stating it is common in people over 70 and that Trump's overall health is "excellent," with no evidence of more serious conditions like deep vein thrombosis. The bruised hand was attributed to tissue damage from frequent handshaking combined with taking aspirin.</p>
