          <p>A research team from the Chinese University of Hong Kong has created an AI-powered system that automates a robotic arm to assist surgeons during operations. This "third hand" can perform routine tasks like retracting tissue and clipping blood vessels, allowing surgeons to focus on more complex aspects of the procedure. The development, detailed in the journal *Science Robotics*, aims to alleviate the strain on surgeons and potentially reduce surgical wait times amid the growing demands of an aging population.</p>

This shift comes after months of friction over U.S. tariffs on Indian imports, which were imposed in response to New Delhi's purchases of Russian oil. Despite the positive rhetoric, underlying challenges remain, including India's resistance to opening its agricultural markets and its continued energy trade with Russia, which remains a point of contention.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition in Potsdam is exploring the complex cultural legacy of the "Plattenbau," the prefabricated concrete tower blocks that defined much of East German housing. These buildings were initially promoted as a socialist utopia, offering modern amenities to solve a post-war housing crisis, but later became symbols of urban decay and social problems following German reunification. The exhibition uses art to revisit the Plattenbau's role as both a shared living space and a stage for painful societal transformation.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the New York City mayoral candidate, has faced scrutiny in the U.S. over his multi-hyphenated identity after identifying as both "Asian" and "Black or African American" on a past university application. However, in his birthplace of Kampala, Uganda, his background is viewed as unremarkable, with many Ugandans of Indian descent considering themselves unequivocally African. The article explores the complex history of Uganda's Indian community and how Mamdani's heritage is perceived differently in a country where such identities are deeply integrated.</p>

He suggests the weight and size difference will be a factor, but Crawford's skill makes him a formidable opponent.</p>

          <p>Despite a string of poor results, statistical analysis suggests that Manchester United's underlying performance under manager Ruben Amorim has been stronger than their points tally indicates. Over the last ten Premier League games, the team has generated the most shots while conceding among the fewest, pointing to a significant underperformance in both scoring and goalkeeping. This disparity suggests that issues with player execution and finishing, rather than tactical failure, may be the primary cause for the team's struggles in securing wins.</p>
