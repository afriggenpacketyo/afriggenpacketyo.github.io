          <p>Freed British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has spoken publicly for the first time since his release last month, expressing unexpected relief and joy in "the small things." After over a decade in Egyptian prisons, including a period of suicidal ideation during a hunger strike, he is now focused on recovery and reconnecting with his family. While committed to fighting for a better world, he states his days of street activism are over, as he navigates a new phase of life. He hopes to travel to the UK soon with his son.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is debating whether to criminalize verbal sexual harassment, or "catcalling," in public, a practice already banned in several other European countries. The center-left Social Democrats argue there is a legal loophole that needs closing, citing the significant impact such behavior has on women, leading to intimidation and withdrawal from public spaces. However, some legal experts suggest existing insult laws could be reinterpreted or that awareness campaigns might be more effective than new legislation. The justice ministry is currently examining legal options.</p>
