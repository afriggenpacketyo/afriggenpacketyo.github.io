        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Republican state senator in New Jersey has introduced legislation to officially rename the Delaware Bay as "The Bay of New Jersey." The proposal, inspired by a recent executive order changing the Gulf of Mexico's name, aims to better reflect the bay's significance to New Jersey's commercial and recreational fishing industries. The measure would require state agencies to update all official materials with the new name. This move mirrors other recent politically-motivated naming suggestions and seeks to assert state pride over a body of water named in 1610 for a governor of the Virginia colony.</p>

Tuipulotu praised the intense competition for midfield positions and the coaching style of Andy Farrell. He highlighted the team's blend of structured play with the instinctive talent of players like Finn Russell, which he believes makes them difficult to defend against.</p>

          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that 50.2% of Japanese voters hope Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's ruling coalition loses its majority in the upcoming House of Councillors election. This sentiment comes as Ishiba urges his Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to unite following a poor showing in a recent Tokyo assembly election, driven by money scandals. Despite the dissatisfaction, the LDP remains the most popular party, with rising prices and social welfare cited as the top concerns for voters. The outcome of the July election could reshape the ruling bloc and determine Ishiba's political future.</p>

With this investment, the French state becomes the largest shareholder, viewing Eutelsat as a strategic asset for Europe's technological sovereignty and defense communications. However, experts are skeptical about its ability to challenge Starlink's dominance in the consumer market, citing a significant disparity in scale; Eutelsat operates about 650 low-Earth orbit satellites compared to Starlink's 7,600. The company is seen as better positioned to compete for government and enterprise contracts where jurisdictional control is prioritized. (not investment advice)</p>

While Taipei still promotes it as a symbol of its governance and a deterrent to the People's Liberation Army, its geographical proximity to the mainland creates a distinct local reality.

While e-cigarettes are not included and restaurant terraces are exempt, violators of the new ban could face fines up to ‚Ç¨700.
