          <p>The private equity industry is facing pressure as a previously forecast boom in M&A and IPO activity has not materialized, leading to discussions about its ability to generate top returns. The SuperReturn conference in Berlin highlighted concerns over geopolitical tensions, volatility in public markets, and the impact of U.S. tariffs on market risk appetite. Despite these challenges, attendees expressed optimism about growth areas such as European defense firms, undervalued mid-caps, and Middle Eastern data centers. Experts suggest that private equity outperforms public markets over the long term, although many firms overpaid during the peak dealmaking period in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has approved a plan to enhance the disaster resilience of the country's infrastructure over the next five years, with an expected cost exceeding 20 trillion yen ($139 billion). The plan focuses on addressing aging infrastructure and includes 326 measures to be implemented by government bodies from fiscal 2026 through 2030. This decision follows prolonged water outages after the Noto Peninsula earthquake and a sinkhole formation in Saitama Prefecture, prompting the allocation of funds for vital services, disaster prevention infrastructure, and disaster preparedness. The plan aims to repair damaged sewer pipes and bridges while enhancing preparedness through measures such as installing air conditioners in schools used as evacuation centers.</p>

          <p>Job growth is expected to have slowed in May, reflecting the impact of President Donald Trump's fluctuating tariffs on the economy. Economists anticipate the U.S. added 125,000 jobs in May, a decrease from the previous month's 177,000. While a trade agreement between the U.S. and China led to tariff reductions, concerns remain regarding the potential impact of tariffs on consumer spending and business performance. Several major companies have warned of potential losses due to the uncertainty tied to tariffs, though the unemployment rate remains historically low. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The public feud between President Trump and Elon Musk raises questions about the future of SpaceX and Tesla, both heavily reliant on federal support. Trump's threat to end subsidies and contracts could impact SpaceX's role in the U.S. space program and Tesla's electric vehicle initiatives. While SpaceX's crucial role in space travel makes immediate cancellation of contracts unlikely, Tesla faces potential challenges with federal support for electric vehicle infrastructure. Experts suggest that Musk's wealth and resources could allow him to navigate these challenges, though Tesla's business faces challenges independent of the Trump administration's policies.</p>
