          <p>Alphabet reported second-quarter results that exceeded analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by strong performance across its divisions. The company announced it will increase its 2025 capital expenditure forecast to $85 billion, a $10 billion raise, citing robust and growing demand for its Cloud and AI services. Despite increased competition in the AI space, Google's core search and advertising segments demonstrated continued growth, with YouTube's advertising revenue also beating forecasts. However, overall operating expenses saw a significant 20% increase, partly due to a $1.4 billion charge related to a legal settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>IBM's shares fell in extended trading even as the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's projections. The company saw its revenue increase by nearly 8% year-over-year, a significant acceleration from the previous quarter, driven by strong performance in its infrastructure division. However, software revenue fell slightly short of consensus, and executives noted that some clients are acting cautiously due to geopolitical tensions and delayed decision-making on discretionary projects. IBM affirmed its full-year guidance and highlighted that its generative AI book of business has grown to $7.5 billion since inception. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has introduced a comprehensive AI Action Plan designed to ensure American dominance in the rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence. The plan includes over 90 federal policy actions aimed at accelerating AI innovation by supporting infrastructure like data centers and semiconductor plants, and by removing regulatory hurdles. A key focus is on creating rules for government contractors to eliminate what the administration calls 'ideological bias' in AI chatbots and to ensure AI systems align with free speech principles. The plan also establishes a program to export AI packages to U.S. allies, reinforcing the nation's global leadership in AI diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Spain secured a 1-0 victory over Germany in the UEFA Euro 2025 semifinal, with a decisive goal from Aitana Bonmati in the final minutes of extra time. Germany, which was aiming for its second consecutive Euro final appearance, was unable to convert several scoring opportunities throughout the match. Despite a strong defensive effort, a poor clearance allowed Bonmati to score past German goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger, who had otherwise delivered an excellent performance. Spain will now face England in the final, a rematch of the 2023 World Cup Final which Spain also won.</p>

          <h2>Exploring the American Origins of the Globally Recognized Word 'OK'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:27:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word 'OK' is one of the most universally understood terms, yet its origin is distinctly American, tracing back to a journalistic joke in 1839. Scholars now widely accept that 'OK' began as a playful abbreviation for 'oll korrect,' a deliberate misspelling of 'all correct,' part of a linguistic fad at the time. Its popularity was cemented during President Martin Van Buren's 1840 reelection campaign, where his nickname 'Old Kinderhook' conveniently aligned with the abbreviation, leading to the formation of 'O.K. Clubs.' The word's simplicity and versatility allowed it to spread globally, particularly through its use in telegraphy and by American soldiers during the World Wars.</p>

          <h2>Trump Suggests Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes on Home Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 17:26:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that his administration is considering the elimination of capital gains taxes on home sales as a measure to stimulate the housing market. Currently, home sellers can face taxes on profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples. The proposal follows the introduction of the 'No Tax on Home Sales Act' by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, which aims to unlock equity for long-term homeowners and address housing shortages. While the National Association of Realtors supports reform, some policy experts believe a complete elimination is unlikely and that raising the existing exemption thresholds would be a more probable outcome.

          <p>In response to decreased foot traffic following recent ICE raids, a group of Latino-owned bars in downtown Los Angeles has formed the 'Friday Night Latin District' to reinvigorate the area's nightlife. This coalition, which includes venues like Las Perlas and La Cita, aims to create a safe and culturally rich weekly celebration that reflects the county's large Hispanic population. The initiative seeks to support local businesses struggling from the downturn by creating a cycle where larger, established venues help drive traffic to smaller, lesser-known ones. Organizers hope the effort will help Angelenos rediscover downtown while providing crucial support to the local service industry.</p>

          <p>Republican Senators Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski have joined Democrats in supporting a new bill that would shield U.S. small businesses from President Trump's tariffs on Canadian imports. The legislation, named the CANADA Act, comes as the administration threatens a blanket 35% tariff on Canadian goods starting August 1. The bill specifically targets the tariffs announced in February and would make them inapplicable to goods imported by or for small business concerns. Co-sponsors argue the tariffs harm small businesses, drive up costs, and damage the long-standing economic relationship between the U.S. and Canada, which is the largest export partner for dozens of states.

          <p>Meta has rolled out new safety features for its teen users, including enhanced protections in direct messaging on Instagram to help prevent contact with potential scammers and predators. The company also reported it removed nearly 135,000 Instagram accounts for sexualizing children and an additional 500,000 linked accounts earlier this year. These updates, which include placing teen accounts into stricter default settings, are part of a broader effort by Meta to address mounting pressure from policymakers and state attorneys general.

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account for a $10,000 deposit. While a high-yield savings account offers flexibility with withdrawals, its variable interest rate is likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates later in the year. In contrast, a CD offers a fixed, guaranteed rate of return, but requires the money to remain untouched for the term. Based on current rates, a 6-month CD at 4.45% would earn slightly more guaranteed interest than a high-yield savings account at 4.30% over the same period. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, which are designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field, a phenomenon that creates 'space weather.' These identical satellites will fly in tandem, allowing researchers to measure rapid changes in the magnetosphere and better understand how energy from the sun is transferred to Earth's system. This research is critical for predicting space weather events that can disrupt GPS signals, power grids, and endanger astronauts and satellites. The SpaceX launch also carried five other small satellites for various scientific and technology-demonstration missions, including one to test advanced space-based communications.</p>
