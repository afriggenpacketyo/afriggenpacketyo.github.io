        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reform UK deputy leader Richard Tice suggested that the UK should learn from Dubai's strong national pride and low crime levels, citing his frequent visits to the UAE to see his partner, journalist Isabel Oakeshott. Tice praised Dubai's education system for instilling pride in the country and argued that politicians are ignoring lessons from countries that are "getting it right." He acknowledged Dubai is not "perfect" but criticized the current state of Britain, citing high crime rates and ineffective justice. Tice also expressed his ambition to become chancellor if Nigel Farage were to become prime minister, highlighting his experience in dealing with money in his business career.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reportedly seeking new migrant deals with Balkan countries after Albania rejected Prime Minister Starmer's plan to deport asylum seekers, with Bosnia, Serbia, and North Macedonia potentially acting as return hubs. The Financial Times reports that Britain's economy experienced its fastest growth in a year during the first quarter, providing a boost to Labour before potential impacts from US President Trump's tariffs. Additionally, UK ministers are planning to block bonuses for Thames Water bosses due to the company's financial struggles. The Daily Telegraph highlights a government initiative to teach children "grit" in schools to address the growing mental health crisis among young people.</p>

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law allowing preemptive cyberdefense measures, enabling the government to monitor communications data and neutralize hostile servers during peacetime. The law obliges key infrastructure operators in sectors like electricity and railways to report cyber breaches. This move aims to enhance Japan's cybersecurity capabilities to match those of the United States and major European nations, with a goal of full operational readiness by 2027. An independent panel will provide prior approval for data acquisition and actions, ensuring government surveillance is properly conducted and personal rights are upheld.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, with exports dropping by 0.6% and subtracting 0.8 percentage points from the GDP. Despite the export slump, domestic demand showed strength, growing by 0.6% and adding 0.7 percentage points to the GDP. The data emerges as Japan engages in trade negotiations with the U.S., with warnings of downside risks from U.S. trade policies impacting the economy.</p>

          <p>California's commercial Dungeness crab season faces threats from migrating humpback whales, leading to entanglement issues and prompting new fishing methods. Traditional crab fishing ropes have harmed numerous whales, leading to the adoption of a high-tech system involving remote-controlled pop-up devices that minimize rope usage. Fisherman Brand Little has been using this experimental device, sponsored by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and has not injured any whales. The technology faces criticism due to cost and tradition, but it allows some fishermen to continue fishing while protecting whales.</p>
