          <p>Following its highly successful market debut, design software company Figma's stock value surged, creating approximately $24 billion in paper wealth for its primary venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia. The company's IPO performance is a major positive development in a previously stagnant tech IPO market, with its valuation now exceeding $68 billion, more than triple Adobe's failed acquisition offer. This outcome highlights a renewed investor appetite for tech stocks and has provided significant returns for early investors after a prolonged period of limited exits for venture firms.

          <p>Several MLB teams executed major trades to strengthen their rosters for the postseason push before Thursday's deadline. The Houston Astros reacquired former star Carlos Correa, while the New York Yankees overhauled their bullpen by adding three new relievers, including All-Stars David Bednar and Camilo Doval. The New York Mets also bolstered their bullpen and acquired center fielder Cedric Mullins, and the San Diego Padres made an aggressive series of seven acquisitions, most notably All-Star closer Mason Miller. These moves signal teams' intentions to make a serious run in the final months of the season, significantly altering the competitive landscape.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the terminations until a November hearing, providing a reprieve for individuals whose status was set to expire in early August, many of whom have lived in the U.S. for over two decades. In her decision, the judge criticized the administration's actions, stating they appeared to be based on a "preordained determination to end the TPS program" rather than an objective review of current country conditions, which remain unsafe for return according to some advisories.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 21:07:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising discovery published in the journal Cell, scientists have determined that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. Researchers found that the potato inherited a crucial gene from the ancient tomato that signals the plant to form its starchy tubers. This finding solves a long-standing puzzle about the potato's origins, as its closest look-alike relative does not produce tubers. The study, which analyzed hundreds of potato genomes, demonstrates how interbreeding between different species can lead to the emergence of entirely new traits and organisms.</p>

          <p>Apple announced a strong fiscal third quarter, with revenue growing 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, significantly outpacing estimates. The positive results were driven by record sales for the iPhone and growth in the services division, with the company setting new revenue records in over 24 countries. Despite the robust performance, the company offered little new information on its artificial intelligence strategy, which remains a key point of focus for investors. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that AI is a profound technology and that the company is significantly increasing its investments in the area, buying time for a clearer AI roadmap.

          <p>A new monument honoring Robert Smalls, who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, is being created for the South Carolina State House grounds. This will be the first statue dedicated to an individual African American at the state capitol, a site currently dominated by monuments to White men, many with Confederate ties. The project, a result of bipartisan support from state lawmakers, is seen as a significant step in telling a more complete story of the state's history. The statue will depict Smalls, a champion of civil rights, on a platform of books to symbolize his journey to becoming a pioneering statesman.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profit for its second quarter, with overall sales increasing 13% year-over-year. However, shares fell in after-hours trading as investors were underwhelmed by the modest revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and a mixed forecast for the upcoming quarter. While the high-margin advertising and online store segments performed well, the growth rate for AWS was not as strong as that of its main competitors. The company also signaled a significant increase in capital expenditures for the rest of the year, primarily to support demand for AI services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new $200 million ballroom, a project President Trump has long desired. The construction, which will be funded by private donations from Trump and other anonymous donors, is set to begin in September alongside a modernization of the East Wing. The new venue will have a seating capacity of about 650, significantly larger than the current East Room, eliminating the need for temporary tents for state dinners and other large events. The project is expected to be completed well before the end of the president's current term in 2029.</p>

          <p>Pop star Justin Timberlake has revealed in a candid social media post that he was battling a "relentlessly debilitating" case of Lyme disease throughout his recent Forget Tomorrow world tour. The 44-year-old singer explained that the diagnosis helped him understand the severe nerve pain and fatigue he was experiencing on stage. He chose to continue the tour to prove his mental tenacity despite the physical and mental toll of the illness, which is caused by a bacterial infection from tick bites. Timberlake stated he wanted to be more transparent about his struggles with fans and thanked them for their support.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced that its main civil service internship program will now be exclusively available to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This change is part of a ministerial effort to diversify Whitehall and ensure it better reflects the country it serves. A student's eligibility will be determined by their parents' occupations when they were 14. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry program for the civil service. The move aims to address the underrepresentation of working-class individuals in senior government roles and harness a broader range of talent.</p>

          <p>Amid pressure from Wall Street to detail its AI strategy, Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that the company is "very open" to mergers and acquisitions to accelerate its roadmap. During an earnings call, Cook confirmed that Apple is significantly increasing its investments in AI and has already acquired around seven smaller companies this year, though not all were AI-focused. This comes as competitors like Google and Microsoft are spending tens of billions on AI infrastructure. Cook emphasized that Apple's focus is on creating deeply personal and private AI features that are seamlessly integrated across its platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers had a quiet trade deadline, making only minor additions by acquiring veteran reliever Brock Stewart and outfielder Alex Call. Unlike other National League contenders who made blockbuster deals, the Dodgers' front office chose to maintain faith in its current roster rather than pursuing high-priced stars. Team executives had foreshadowed this strategy, expressing confidence that their talented group, once fully healthy and performing to established levels, is capable of another World Series run. The approach prioritizes internal improvement and relies on the return of injured players and the resurgence of slumping stars for the season's final stretch.</p>

          <p>Cole's French Dip, a historic Los Angeles restaurant, has delayed its planned closure by 45 days due to a massive outpouring of community support. Since the closure was announced, the restaurant has seen hours-long lines of customers wanting a final meal, leading to a dramatic jump in sales. Owner Cedd Moses struck a deal with the landlord to extend service, providing a temporary reprieve for the landmark establishment and its staff. While grateful for the surge, Moses noted that the business model remains challenging and is actively seeking a new buyer who will respect the historic value of the city's oldest restaurant.</p>
