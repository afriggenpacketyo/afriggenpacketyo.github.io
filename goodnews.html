          <p>The Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership under a wartime law, citing due process concerns. In other news, a New Jersey Transit strike disrupted commutes after locomotive engineers walked off their jobs, demanding wage parity with other local railroads. Additionally, House Republicans blocked their own party's major domestic policy bill due to demands for deeper budget cuts. This legislation aimed to enact President Trump's agenda, cutting taxes while increasing military and immigration enforcement funding, but faced opposition from conservative hard-liners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A dust storm blanketed Chicago, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its second-ever dust storm warning for the area. High winds, reaching 60 to 70 mph, swept over dry farmlands and collected dust into the air, significantly reducing visibility. The dust storm forced drivers to pull over on Interstate 55 and temporarily halted incoming flights at Midway International Airport. While dust storms are more common in rural parts of Illinois, this event marked the first time such a warning included the city itself.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, a stark contrast to the backlash he faces at home. He received standing ovations, investment pledges, and the UAE's highest civilian honor, with gulf leaders adopting Trump's favorite phrases. The trip resulted in economic investments between the United States and the three nations he visited. Trump surrounded himself with friendly audiences, turning events into campaign-style rallies, praising a former jihadist, welcoming Qatar‚Äôs friendship with Iran and accepting a ‚Äúgift‚Äù of a $400 million airplane.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin judge pleaded not guilty to federal charges of helping an undocumented immigrant evade immigration authorities, drawing parallels to a similar case in Massachusetts. In the Massachusetts case, Judge Shelley Joseph was charged with conspiracy and obstruction of justice for allegedly helping an undocumented immigrant escape a courtroom to avoid ICE. These cases raise questions about the balance between state judges' autonomy in their courtrooms and federal officials' authority to enforce immigration law, sparking debate over federal overreach and equal justice.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is expanding its influence through strategic investments. Emirati corporations are involved in ports, mines, renewable energy, and other key sectors across the continent. This push is part of an ambitious plan to increase the country's influence, particularly over global supply chains, as the Emirates diversifies its economy away from fossil fuels. However, the Emirates' political choices have stirred concerns, including accusations of fueling conflict in Sudan.</p>

          <p>Chinese defence scientists are working to transform traditional rocket artillery into a system capable of striking aerial targets. A research team has developed a small rocket named Tianxing-1 or ‚ÄúSky Star-1‚Äù, which features lift-enhancing wings and adjustable tail fins for extended range and powerless-flight manoeuvrability. Launched at an angle from ground-based platforms, the rocket transitions into a glide phase to engage targets. While it operates on similar principles to hypersonic glide missiles, its slower speed may limit its ability to chase high-speed aircraft or drones.</p>
