          <p>The Army is implementing a two-phase plan to separate service members experiencing gender dysphoria, following President Donald Trump's directive to prioritize military excellence and readiness. The first phase allows service members diagnosed with or having a history of gender dysphoria to voluntarily separate from the military branch, with a deadline of June 6. After the deadline, the Army will enter the involuntary separation phase, identifying service members' records reflecting their sex at birth. The Army spokesperson said that regardless of potential outcome, every service member will be treated with dignity and respect.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Temperatures in the seas around the UK and Ireland have risen sharply, with some areas up to 4C warmer than normal, potentially affecting marine life and swimmers. The heatwave is most intense off the west coast of Ireland and parts of Cornwall and Devon. Scientists attribute the surge to climate change and one of the warmest Springs on record, with high temperatures and weak winds warming the ocean's top layer. While the worst impacts on species may be avoided for now, the heatwave could disrupt breeding patterns and lead to an influx of jellyfish and harmful algae.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid claims of a "white genocide" in South Africa, some Afrikaners are pushing back against the narrative, stating it is not happening. While the Trump administration has welcomed Afrikaner asylum applicants, granting them expedited refugee status, others within the Afrikaner community dispute the claims of widespread violence and discrimination. Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp says the claims are untrue, noting that Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein agrees, saying that he feels safe and that most farmers understand that the land must be shared by both Black and White.</p>

The event, expected to cost between $25 million and $45 million, has been designated a "national security special event," requiring significant security resources.

          <p>The leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) have regained control of their offices after a judge declared the Trump administration's takeover "null and void." The ruling followed a lawsuit by USIP leaders after they were forcibly removed from the organization's building in Washington, D.C., by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in March. The Justice Department plans to appeal the ruling, but USIP leaders intend to resume their stewardship of the organization, which provides analysis, education, and resources for peace efforts worldwide.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to sign a deal with Mauritius, granting sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius while leasing back a crucial military base for 99 years. The deal previously appeared to have stalled after a change in government in both Mauritius and the US, but has now been revived. Under the terms of the deal Mauritius would gain sovereignty of the islands from the UK, but allow the US and UK to continue operating a strategically important military base on one of the islands for an initial period of 99 years in exchange for a multi-billion pound payment. Representatives of the Chagossian community have been invited to meet with Stephen Doughty, the minister for Europe, North America and overseas territories, for discussions on the sovereignty of the territory.</p>
