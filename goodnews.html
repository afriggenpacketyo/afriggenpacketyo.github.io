          <p>Shares of data center company Applied Digital jumped 16% after it reported first-quarter revenue that significantly surpassed expectations, largely fueled by high demand for artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company's revenue of $64.2 million marked an 84% increase from the previous year, contributing to a stock value increase of over 350% year-to-date. This growth is supported by a major lease agreement with CoreWeave and plans for further expansion, positioning the company to capitalize on massive investments in AI deployment.

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed Senate Bill 79, a historic law designed to combat California's housing crisis by overriding local zoning regulations near public transportation. The bill permits the construction of taller, denser residential buildings near subway stops, light rail stations, and dedicated bus lanes in eight key counties. While praised by housing advocates for promoting affordability and transit use, the legislation has faced opposition from some cities, including Los Angeles, over concerns about the loss of local control.</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics will publish the Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for September, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown that has halted the release of other economic data.

While the crucial CPI report will be released nine days late, other key indicators like the nonfarm payroll report remain indefinitely delayed. (not investment advice)</p>

While crediting Trump for halting the immediate violence, the piece also criticizes him for not acting sooner, which could have prevented months of additional conflict and loss of life.</p>
