          <p>Bitcoin has surged past $100,000 for the first time in three months, buoyed by President Trump's announcement of a new trade deal framework between the U.S. and the UK. This development has boosted investor confidence in risk assets and reaffirmed Bitcoin's status as a resilient asset. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, suggests that Bitcoin's strength will be tested further amid global macro and geopolitical uncertainties, including tensions between India and Pakistan. The article notes that Bitcoin is supported by a pro-crypto Trump administration and growing investment from spot-ETF investors.</p>

          <p>Shopify's stock experienced a slight decline after the company released its first-quarter results and provided a cautious outlook for the upcoming period, which investors interpreted as a sign of uncertainty. Despite beating earnings expectations, Shopify's guidance for gross profit and revenue growth fell slightly below analyst estimates. The company acknowledged the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on Chinese imports, which affect many of its small- to medium-sized business merchants. Shopify is actively monitoring the situation and adapting to changes, including the addition of a "buy local" tool to support merchants.</p>

          <p>Nicola Packer, a 45-year-old woman, was found not guilty of having an illegal abortion after taking abortion medicine at home when she was approximately 26 weeks pregnant.

The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists stated that the trial highlights how outdated and harmful current abortion laws are and calls for reform, emphasizing the need for women to access healthcare in a safe and supportive environment.</p>

While details are still being finalized, the agreement is expected to generate $6 billion in revenue for the U.S. due to the 10% tariff on imports from the U.K., but British negotiators are aiming to reduce or eliminate the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel.</p>

Chapter 7 bankruptcy offers a near-full financial reset by eliminating many unsecured debts, but it is income-based and does not discharge obligations like child support or student loans. Chapter 13 bankruptcy provides a structured repayment plan, suitable for those with higher incomes or wanting to protect more assets, but requires consistent income and budgeting. Alternatives to bankruptcy, such as debt consolidation, debt management, and debt settlement, are also discussed as options to ease debt burdens without court filings.</p>

          <p>Grandparents are playing a larger and more enduring role in kids‚Äô lives, providing benefits such as better educational and mental health outcomes, a fresh perspective, and child care. However, they are increasingly stepping in to plug holes in America‚Äôs crumbling child care system, a role they‚Äôre not always excited about filling. Experts say policymakers should embrace reforms that allow grandmothers and grandfathers to spend time with their grandkids because they want to ‚Äì not because their families have no other choice.</p>

          <p>Coinbase has agreed to acquire Deribit, a major crypto derivatives exchange, for $2.9 billion in a cash-and-stock deal. The acquisition aims to position Coinbase as a leader in crypto derivatives, allowing it to compete with larger players like Binance. Deribit facilitated over $1 trillion in trading volume last year and has about $30 billion of current open interest on the platform. The deal comes amid regulatory tailwinds for the crypto industry and a surge in crypto M&A activity.</p>
