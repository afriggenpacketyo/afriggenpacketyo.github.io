          <p>The Chicago Sky secured a 92-85 victory over the Los Angeles Sparks, overshadowing the Sparks' ceremony to retire Candace Parker's No. 3 jersey. Sky rookie Angel Reese delivered a dominant performance with 24 points and 16 rebounds, proving too much for the Sparks to handle. The game was a tribute to Parker, who won championships with both franchises and is only the third player to have her jersey retired by the Sparks. Despite a third-quarter surge from Los Angeles, Chicago's strong finish sealed the win.</p>

          <p>Warren Schaeffer, the interim manager for the Colorado Rockies, was ejected for the first time in his career during a game against the Milwaukee Brewers. Schaeffer vehemently argued a strike-three call made against outfielder Tyler Freeman, leading to a heated confrontation with home plate umpire Ramon De Jesus. After being tossed, Schaeffer dramatically drew a line in the dirt to show where he believed the pitch was. The fiery display appeared to energize his team, as the Rockies went on to win the game 4-3 in extra innings.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a US expert on Chinese law, suggests that the current strained relationship between the US and China has historical precedents that indicate it can be overcome. Drawing a parallel to the period after 1989, he notes that American students and scholars are only now beginning to return to China following the pandemic, similar to how they slowly returned in the 1990s. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm reception, which he interprets as a sign of hope. He believes that despite immense changes in China, the pattern of rupture and eventual reconnection in academic exchange offers a positive outlook.</p>

The Dodgers' offense was powered by home runs from Kik√© Hern√°ndez and Will Smith, securing the series win and a 5-1 record on their road trip. Wrobleski's recent success, marked by increased fastball velocity, is making him a valuable depth option for the team's pitching staff.</p>

          <p>Vin Diesel has revealed that the character of Brian O'Conner, famously played by the late Paul Walker, will return for the final installment of the "Fast & Furious" franchise, slated for 2027. Speaking at an event, Diesel stated this was one of three conditions he gave Universal Studios for the finale, along with returning the story to its Los Angeles street-racing roots. Walker died in 2013, and his character was given an emotional send-off in "Furious 7" using a combination of archival footage, digital effects, and his brothers as stand-ins. It remains unclear how the production will accomplish the character's return.</p>

          <p>A controversial provision to mandate the sale of up to 1.2 million acres of public land in 11 Western states has been removed from a major Republican spending bill. The measure, championed by Senator Mike Lee, faced strong bipartisan backlash from lawmakers, conservationists, and recreation advocates. Lee stated he withdrew the proposal because he could not secure safeguards to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations. Critics had viewed the land sale as a way to offset the cost of tax cuts in the bill, and its removal is being celebrated as a victory for public land preservation.</p>
