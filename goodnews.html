          <p>The MLB All-Star Game was decided by a home run swing-off for the first time, with the National League defeating the American League 7-6 overall. After the game ended in a 6-6 tie, Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs in the tiebreaker to secure the win and earn MVP honors. A unique aspect of the new format involved Dodgers third base coach Dino Ebel pitching to the NL hitters during the high-pressure event. The exciting conclusion was widely praised by players and managers for energizing the exhibition game.</p>

          <p>Semiconductor equipment giant ASML reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, with net bookings also coming in strong at 5.5 billion euros. However, the company's revenue guidance for the third quarter fell short of forecasts, and it narrowed its full-year 2025 sales growth to 15%. Citing increasing uncertainty from macroeconomic and geopolitical developments, CEO Christophe Fouquet stated that while ASML is preparing for growth in 2026, it could not be confirmed at this stage. This cautious outlook reflects ongoing challenges, including U.S. tariff policies impacting the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is ending the deployment for 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, which is nearly half of the force sent to the city amid protests against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The troops were federalized against the wishes of California Governor Gavin Newsom, who sued to stop the deployment. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass applauded the decision as a retreat by the administration, attributing it to peaceful protests and legal challenges. Both Newsom and Bass have called for the remaining troops to be sent home immediately.</p>

          <p>Ahead of The Open Championship, this article revisits the legendary round of golf played by a 16-year-old Rory McIlroy 20 years ago at Royal Portrush.

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for its popular Labubu dolls, fell over 6% despite the company forecasting a profit increase of at least 350% for the first half of 2025. The company attributed its strong profit outlook to growing global brand recognition and diversified products. However, one analyst suggested the negative stock reaction may reflect a conservative investor outlook, with concerns that the company's stellar growth may have peaked and could slow in the second half of the year. This indicates investor uncertainty about the long-term sustainability of its intellectual properties' popularity. (not investment advice)</p>
