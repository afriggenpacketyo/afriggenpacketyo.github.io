          <p>President Trump has postponed the imposition of 50% tariffs on European Union imports into the U.S. until July 9, following a "very nice call" with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. This decision marks a reversal from Trump's earlier warning that tariffs would be imposed on June 1 due to stalled discussions with the EU. Von der Leyen announced the tariff delay on social media, noting that Europe is prepared to swiftly and decisively move forward with trade talks. The delay aims to allow more time for negotiations between the U.S. and the EU to reach new trade terms, potentially averting escalating tensions between the two major economic powers.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that United States Steel Corp. will remain under American control despite a "planned partnership" with Nippon Steel Corp. Trump mentioned that Nippon Steel would hold "a partial ownership" in U.S. Steel, without providing specific details regarding the Japanese steelmaker's acquisition plan. This announcement follows a review of the buyout plan by a panel of federal agencies at Trump's request. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have both acknowledged Trump's decision positively. This development occurs amid ongoing discussions on trade and economic cooperation between the U.S. and Japan.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" indicates that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were identified as fake, a figure more than double that of 2022. This increase is attributed to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews and improvements in Tripadvisor's detection systems, which rely on auto-detection, human review, and community feedback. The company moderates a substantial number of reviews, categorizing fake submissions into boosting, vandalism, member fraud, and paid reviews.

          <p>Xu Lin, a former senior economic planner, has suggested that China should consider lowering its annual GDP growth target to around 4% for the next five years. This recommendation takes into account potential protracted rivalry with the United States and the need to address structural issues within China, including a shrinking population, falling savings, and property and debt challenges. Xu, now with the Pangoal Institution, emphasizes that prioritizing employment expansion and debt ratio control is crucial. China did not specify a quantitative growth target in its 2021-2025 development plan, but the market had anticipated an annual expansion of at least 4.8%. (not investment advice)</p>
