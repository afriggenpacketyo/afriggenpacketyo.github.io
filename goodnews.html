          <p>The article discusses the factors influencing the price of gold, a commodity often viewed as a safe-haven asset and inflation hedge. As of June 10, 2025, the price of gold is $3,343.44 per ounce, but this is subject to constant fluctuations. Factors such as supply and demand, economic conditions, inflation, interest rates, geopolitical uncertainty, currency movements, market sentiment, and central bank policies all play a role in determining gold prices. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for investors considering gold as a store of value, portfolio diversifier, or speculative investment. (not investment advice)</p>

The inflation rate remains higher than the Federal Reserve's 2% target, leading to expectations that the Fed will hold off on cutting rates in the near term.

          <p>President Trump announced that a U.S. trade deal with China is "done," pending final approval from himself and President Xi Jinping, following trade talks in London. The "framework deal" would maintain China's 10% tariffs on U.S. goods, while the U.S. would keep 55% tariffs on Chinese imports. The agreement aims to ease trade tensions, with the U.S. seeking increased shipments of rare earth elements from China in exchange for concessions, including allowing Chinese students to study in the U.S. While U.S. officials confirmed the agreement in principle, there was no immediate confirmation from China's government.</p>

Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, emphasized that this rule will alleviate the pressure on players to return to the court prematurely, potentially risking their health.

Annuities are agreements between individuals and insurance companies that provide guaranteed income, often for life. The safety of annuities during market crashes varies depending on the type, with fixed annuities offering the most protection due to their set interest rates, while variable annuities carry more risk due to their market exposure. Fixed indexed annuities offer a middle ground, providing potential for higher returns with limited risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk expressed regret over some of his recent social media posts about President Donald Trump, stating that they "went too far." The feud between Musk and Trump had previously dissolved a tight partnership, impacting Tesla's stock. The conflict was sparked by Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," which Musk claimed would increase the U.S. budget deficit. Trump had previously indicated there would be consequences for Musk if he supported Democratic candidates.</p>
