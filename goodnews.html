        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article analyzes why Boeing aircraft frequently feature in Donald Trump's trade agreements, suggesting both performative and pragmatic reasons. Experts note that large, high-value aircraft orders serve as visible symbols of trade commitment, helping countries address bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S. without disrupting domestic industries. While the deals offer a public relations boost for the president, the rising international tourism industry also creates a genuine need for new passenger aircraft. Despite recent safety concerns and whistleblower allegations against Boeing, airlines are reportedly regaining confidence in the company's production quality, making its inclusion in trade pacts strategically beneficial for all parties involved.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high, extending gains after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. The rally was primarily driven by the technology sector, with investors anticipating that the incoming Liberal Democratic Party leader might introduce new fiscal stimulus measures to bolster the economy. Analysts from Julius Baer foresee further upside for the Nikkei 225, projecting it to reach 46,000 within 12 months, citing expectations of greater long-term policy and political stability. This positive market sentiment also saw the Japanese yen strengthen against the U.S. dollar, reflecting investor confidence in the country's economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family has reached an agreement regarding the control of Rupert Murdoch's media empire after his passing, ensuring his eldest son, Lachlan Murdoch, will solidify his leadership. This resolution ends litigation where other siblings contested Rupert's initial efforts to install Lachlan as the sole successor, deviating from a previous shared control agreement. The new arrangement involves Prudence MacLeod, Elisabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch divesting their holdings in News Corp and Fox Corp for an estimated $3.3 billion cash settlement. This deal is expected to maintain the editorial direction of key outlets like Fox News and the Wall Street Journal, despite some political differences among the siblings.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a new visa category on October 1, designed to offer greater flexibility and fewer barriers for international professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This strategic move aims to bolster China's innovation and competitiveness in its high-tech sectors, signaling a significant shift in its immigration policy. The initiative seeks to address concerns from foreign students and professionals, like Pakistani PhD student Rahdar Hussain Afridi, who face uncertainty about staying in China post-graduation due to visa limitations. While observers caution that its effectiveness remains to be seen, the plan reflects China's ambition to gain a global edge in talent acquisition.</p>

          <p>New league tables have been published for the first time, ranking the performance of NHS trusts across England, with specialist hospitals generally occupying the top positions. The system categorizes trusts every three months, granting top performers more autonomy and offering support to those struggling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables aim to identify areas needing "urgent support" and end the "postcode lottery" in care. However, NHS Providers raised concerns about the accuracy and potential unintended consequences of the metrics, while think tanks cautioned that a focus on rankings might not always align with the best patient outcomes, especially given the financial performance component.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older increased by 46% between 2021 and 2023, according to a JAMA Internal Medicine study, as the drug becomes legal in more states and its stigma diminishes. Seniors like Gayle Crawley and Steven Clarke use cannabis for various reasons, including pain management, PTSD, and relaxation, often preferring edibles. However, medical professionals like UC San Francisco professor Matt Springer warn of potential health risks, particularly for the cardiovascular system, regardless of ingestion method. Despite studies linking cannabis use to increased risks of cardiovascular disease and stroke, some seniors view these risks as comparable to other common lifestyle factors.</p>

          <p>China's Liaoning Port Group is developing a "durian express" shipping service and transit center in Dalian to expedite the import of durians from Southeast Asia to its northeastern region. This initiative aims to reduce shipping times significantly, from up to two weeks to as little as six days, ensuring fresher deliveries for the growing consumer demand in northeastern China. Analysts note that this market is relatively underserved compared to southern and eastern China due to logistics challenges. The project, which will handle approximately 10,000 twenty-foot equivalent units of fresh durians annually, reflects efforts to overcome geographical barriers and meet increasing consumer curiosity for the prized fruit.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved Assembly Bill 519, which aims to ban online pet dealer websites and middlemen from selling dogs to consumers, targeting the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills. This legislation follows a previous ban on pet store sales of commercially bred dogs and seeks to close loopholes exploited by resellers posing as local breeders. The bill, which now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature, applies to dogs, cats, and rabbits under a year old. Supporters, including the Attorney General, emphasize the need for transparency to protect consumers from unknowingly purchasing sick or poorly bred pets and to combat cruel breeding practices.</p>

While federal officials emphasize that people can get vaccinated after consulting a doctor, this narrower approval may limit access for some. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stated that the vaccines are available for all patients who choose them, listing numerous conditions that confer higher risk, potentially making 100-200 million Americans eligible.

The ruling coalition secured 87 seats, just two more than needed for a majority, in an election dominated by domestic issues like inflation and public services, alongside international concerns.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed several pessimistic sentiments on Wall Street over recent months that ultimately proved to be overblown, asserting that market negativity is often overhyped. He noted investor concerns about tech giants like Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple, which saw their stocks recover despite initial fears regarding monopoly rulings, web services competition, and AI strategy, respectively. Cramer also touched on Nvidia, whose stock faced a price target cut despite beating earnings, expressing belief in its long-term performance. The article suggests that while negative theories are easy to generate, the market often moves past these concerns to focus on underlying positives. (not investment advice)</p>
