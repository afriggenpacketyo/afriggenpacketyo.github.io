          <p>This New York Times article explores the emerging debate within the Democratic Party, particularly in California, regarding the implementation of mandatory retirement ages for elected officials. Prompted by concerns over leaders holding onto power past their prime, some activists are pushing for age limits at the state and local levels, although the proposal faces resistance due to concerns about ageism and discrimination against experienced individuals. The discussion is fueled by regrets over instances like Dianne Feinstein's declining health while in office and Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision not to retire, as well as concerns about President Biden's age. The article also notes that Americans generally support age limits for elected officials.</p>

          <p>This BBC article discusses Mark Carney's recent election as Prime Minister of Canada and his plans to address the trade war and sovereignty issues caused by President Donald Trump. Carney's campaign focused on standing up to Trump's policies, which resonated with voters concerned about Canada's independence and economic stability. The election result was unexpected, as the Liberal Party had been trailing significantly in the polls before Carney's leadership. His strategy involves uniting Canadians, promoting domestic buying, and using economic expertise to navigate the challenges posed by Trump's administration.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This BBC article features an interview with Robert Harris, author of "Conclave," who draws a comparison between the papal selection process and the TV show "The Traitors." Harris suggests that the dynamics within a conclave, where cardinals secretly vote to elect a new Pope, share similarities with the show's premise of identifying hidden traitors. He argues that the secretive and focused nature of the conclave is a "brilliant device" for choosing the right leader, a process from which UK political parties could learn. Harris also touches on the exclusion of women from the priesthood and papal elections, calling it an oddity in modern religion.</p>

The article highlights that Reform's appeal poses a challenge to both the Conservative and Labour parties, as they need to address the concerns of this segment of the population to recover from recent losses.</p>
