          <h2>Flat Earth Beliefs Surface in American Politics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 06:01:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals with links to the flat Earth movement have gained attention in American politics across states like Alabama, Georgia, and Minnesota. While their motivations vary from spiritual connections to skepticism of scientific consensus, data suggests that nearly 10% of Americans believe the Earth is flat. This emergence of pseudo-scientific conspiracy theories in politics has been met with mixed reactions, ranging from alarm to apathy. Political observers attribute the spread of these beliefs to the internet and social media, noting a decline in intellectualism.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's decision to bypass Israel during his Middle East tour, experts suggest the visit advanced policies aligned with Israeli interests, offering a strategic opportunity for Jerusalem. Trump emphasized Israeli priorities, condemning Hamas, calling for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran about its nuclear ambitions. While some Israeli perspectives express discomfort at being excluded from direct talks, analysts emphasize that Trump's "America First" approach doesn't negate his support for Israel. Experts urge Israel to proactively shape events and push Washington to address issues like Qatar's funding of Hamas.</p>

          <p>Fan Daidi, a chemistry professor turned entrepreneur, exemplifies China's booming chemical sciences sector. As dean of Northwest University's chemical engineering school, Fan has amassed a fortune by commercializing innovations in collagen synthesis, catapulting her skincare enterprise Giant Biogene to a 75 billion yuan valuation. Fan's ascent highlights how state-backed scientific industrialisation is minting a new generation of academic tycoons. According to a report, Fan and her husband Yan Jianya's combined holdings are estimated to be valued at more than 40 billion yuan.</p>

          <p>The Mayo Clinic is using its fecal waste biobank to study the gut microbiome's role in cancer treatment, aiming to personalize medicine by understanding how bacteria influence patient responses to medications. The biobank contains over 2,000 stool samples, and researchers hope to identify which drugs are most effective based on an individual's microbiome and genes. This approach contrasts with current standardized chemotherapy regimens, and it involves exploring fecal transplants and other methods to manipulate the gut microbiome. This research occurs amid potential funding cuts to US scientific institutions, highlighting the importance of private biobanks.</p>

          <p>An 18-month-old spider monkey named Violeta was rescued from a suspected methamphetamine dealer's home in Vallejo, California, and is now receiving care at the Oakland Zoo. The species is endangered, and infants require constant, skilled care to survive. The Oakland Zoo is part of a coalition pushing for the Captive Primate Safety Act, which would enact a federal ban on the pet primate trade. Once fully recovered, zoo staff will work to find Violeta a permanent home in an accredited zoo or sanctuary where she can grow up in a troop of spider monkeys.</p>

          <p>With the NBA draft approaching, a columnist argues that the Lakers should focus on drafting a mature player who has demonstrated the ability to handle the temptations of money and fame during their college career. The league's economic shifts have made 'high ceiling' players more desirable, but the author contends that older, more experienced players can bring valuable resilience and leadership to the team. The columnist suggests the Lakers should consider drafting a 24-year-old college graduate with NIL money in the bank and a good head on his shoulders, emphasizing the importance of maturity and stability.</p>

However, disagreements persist on issues like access for young people to live and work in each other's countries, and fishing rights.</p>
