          <p>Ippei Mizuhara, Shohei Ohtani's former interpreter, has reported to federal prison in Pennsylvania to begin serving his 57-month sentence for stealing nearly $17 million from the baseball star to cover gambling debts. In addition to the prison term, Mizuhara is required to pay $16.9 million in restitution to Ohtani and $1.1 million to the IRS. Mizuhara pleaded guilty to bank fraud and filing a false tax return, admitting to placing approximately 19,000 bets over two years and accumulating over $40 million in debt. Ohtani addressed the scandal, stating he never placed sports bets and that Mizuhara fabricated the story about paying off his gambling debt. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans have unveiled their version of President Trump's "big, beautiful bill," which includes changes to the tax and Medicaid provisions passed by the House. Key differences include steeper cuts to Medicaid funding by lowering provider taxes and permanently extending the $10,000 state and local tax deduction (SALT). House Republicans have threatened to oppose the bill if the SALT cap is not raised, while Senate Republicans are calling for a $5 trillion increase in the debt ceiling. The Senate version also includes provisions to end taxes on tips, overtime, and auto loan interest, while making tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term permanent. (not investment advice)</p>
