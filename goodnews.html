          <p>Chinese drone maker EHang Holdings anticipates that flying taxis could become a reality for public transportation in China within the next five years. According to CFO Conor Yang, fixed-route air shuttle services could emerge by 2030, with air taxi services potentially appearing sooner in cities with adequate infrastructure. EHang has already received certification from the Civil Aviation Administration of China to operate autonomous passenger drones. Trial flights are underway in Guangzhou and Hefei, with plans to commence operations in designated areas by year-end. The EH216-S aircraft, priced at $331,000, has garnered significant international interest, particularly in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>President Trump's crypto advisor, David Sacks, anticipates the stablecoin legislation in the Senate will pass with bipartisan support, potentially unlocking trillions of dollars for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks noted that there is already over $200 billion in unregulated stablecoins, and providing a legal framework could rapidly increase demand for U.S. debt. The GENIUS Act, which aims to regulate stablecoins, recently passed a key procedural vote in the Senate. Sacks expressed confidence in the bill's passage, despite concerns from some Democrats about safeguards to prevent the president and his family from profiting from the legislation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US researchers are suggesting a novel approach to combat malaria: administering malaria drugs to mosquitoes to eliminate their infection and prevent further transmission of the disease. Instead of focusing solely on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, the team at Harvard University has identified drugs that can effectively clear malaria parasites from the insects when absorbed through their legs. The long-term goal is to coat bed nets with this drug cocktail. As mosquitoes have become resistant to insecticides in many countries, this new strategy aims to directly target the parasites within the mosquito.</p>

          <p>Craig Steinley, the vice president of the Appraisal Institute, has been removed from his position following allegations of sexual harassment. Multiple women had accused Steinley of improper touching, prompting an emergency meeting of the national board. The Appraisal Institute had previously paid $412,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim against Steinley. Steinley denies the accusations, claiming his removal was retaliation driven by internal politics. The Appraisal Institute, a key trade group for real estate appraisers, is now facing multiple lawsuits related to Steinley's alleged conduct. This New York Times article details the accusations and the organization's response.</p>

          <p>Researchers are urging the UK's NHS to offer women with dense breasts additional scans as part of the breast screening program to improve cancer detection rates. A Cambridge University study found that alternative scanning methods could triple the number of cancers detected in this group. Dense breasts make it harder to spot cancers on traditional mammograms, as they appear whiter, similar to early-stage cancers. The study tested enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, which detected significantly more cancers than traditional mammograms. The Louise Duffield, a 60 year old trial participant had a tumor removed after it was identified by an additional scan. </p>

The cryptocurrency has benefited from both liquidity in the stock market and recent risk-off scenarios related to concerns about tariffs and deficits in the U.S. On-chain data indicates less selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market.
