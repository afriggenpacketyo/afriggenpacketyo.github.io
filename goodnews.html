          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google after the tech giant altered the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, aligning with former U.S. President Trump's executive order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum criticized Google's action as an infringement on Mexico and Cuba's continental shelf, arguing that Trump's decree only applies within U.S. territory. Google's policy is to reflect official local names, leading to discrepancies in the label across different countries. The lawsuit follows the House Republicans' passage of the Gulf of America Act, aiming to codify Trump's order, and seeks to reverse Google's name change.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani propelled the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 14-11 victory over the Arizona Diamondbacks with a three-run home run in the ninth inning, capping a wild comeback. The game featured multiple lead changes and significant offensive performances from both teams, including two doubles from Ohtani earlier in the game. The Dodgers initially built a five-run lead, which they lost before rallying in the ninth with doubles from Andy Pages and Kik√© Hern√°ndez, setting the stage for Ohtani's game-winning hit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour Party in the UK, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing net migration. The proposed changes include stricter requirements for employers to demonstrate investment in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, with a focus on the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa applications from countries with high rates of overstaying and asylum claims, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, are likely to face increased scrutiny. The white paper is also expected to address the "right to family life" under the European Convention on Human Rights, potentially leading to a more defined legal framework.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, the UK's ambassador to the US, has described the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for further trade opportunities between the two nations. The agreement aims to reduce or eliminate tariffs imposed by former U.S. President Trump on certain UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions about the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred during negotiations, Lord Mandelson clarified that abolishing the tax was not part of the deal. He emphasized the positive relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, noting their shared commitment to defending their respective national interests.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island province off China‚Äôs southern coast, is aiming to attract more Chinese shoppers amid the ongoing trade war with the United States. As China considers entering trade negotiations with the United States, Hainan is poised to launch its own separate customs regime, enabling it to bypass the 125% retaliatory tariffs Beijing has imposed on American imports. The hope is that the promise of cheap iPhones and US cosmetics could help drive a surge in visitors to the island‚Äôs duty-free stores, which have struggled over the past two years amid sluggish domestic consumption and a recovery in overseas tourism.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift the 25 percent tariff on steel exported from the UK to the United States has provided some relief for struggling British steel businesses. Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield, a major steel-making facility, anticipates increased demand from U.S. customers following the tariff removal. However, uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. The UK steel industry has faced challenges such as weak demand, competition, and high energy costs, making the tariff relief a welcome development for the sector.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily restrained the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at numerous federal agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove that the administration's efforts to reorganize and downsize the government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The ruling underscores the legal challenges faced by the administration's cost-cutting drive.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift was reportedly subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni regarding the film "It Ends With Us," but her representative denies any creative involvement in the movie. The lawsuit stems from Lively's allegations of on-set sexual harassment and Baldoni's countersuit claiming defamation. Swift's name surfaced due to her friendship with Lively and Reynolds, with Baldoni's team suggesting they pressured him regarding script changes. Swift's spokesperson clarified that her only involvement was licensing her song "My Tears Ricochet" for the film, emphasizing that she had no input on casting, editing, or other creative decisions.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies over claims regarding the blood thinner Plavix, resolving a lawsuit about the drug's efficacy and safety. The settlement follows a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi to pay $916 million, although neither company has admitted wrongdoing. The attorney general's office said that about 30% of patients, especially non-Caucasians, might have a "diminished response" to Plavix. The settlement divides the funds equally between the companies and will be paid by wire transfer by June 9.</p>
