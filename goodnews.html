          <p>In a significant development following devastating floods in Texas, officials in Kerr County have drastically reduced the number of individuals considered missing from nearly 100 to just three. This update comes after extensive follow-up work by state and local agencies successfully verified that many people initially reported as missing were in fact alive and safe. The news provides a small measure of relief amidst the tragedy, as the overall death toll from the July 4 flooding across Texas has surpassed 130, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>England's national rugby team achieved a decisive 40-5 victory against the United States in a match in Washington D.C. that was significantly disrupted by weather. The game experienced nearly two hours of delays due to lightning strikes in the area, forcing players and spectators to seek shelter both before kickoff and during the first half. Despite the interruptions, England scored six tries, concluding their tour of Argentina and the United States with a perfect three-win record while also giving debuts to several new players.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has pledged to introduce a new criminal offense to target individuals who plan mass attacks but are not motivated by a specific ideology, closing a perceived gap in the law. The proposed legislation would give police powers to apprehend and charge suspects for preparatory acts, similar to existing counter-terrorism laws, even without an ideological motive. This move comes in response to incidents like the Southport attack, where the perpetrator's violent plotting could not be addressed with serious charges until after the killings occurred.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned midair. While performing her hit song "Roar" suspended above the audience, the prop suddenly dropped several feet, startling the singer. Perry quickly recovered and continued her performance without interruption, later flying across the arena before being safely returned to the stage. The incident is part of her "The Lifetimes Tour," which features multiple aerial stunts and props.</p>

          <h2>Debate Emerges in the UK Over Shortening School Summer Holidays</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is growing in the UK over whether to shorten the traditional six-week school summer holiday, with various perspectives on the potential impacts on students, parents, and teachers. Proponents argue a shorter break could reduce learning loss, ease childcare burdens for working parents, and help mitigate "holiday hunger" for children on free school meals. However, opponents, including many teachers, contend the long break is essential for rest and preparation, and shortening it could concentrate holiday demand, potentially driving up travel costs further.</p>

          <p>The UK Chancellor has announced plans to encourage savers to move funds from low-interest cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs) to stocks and shares investments, arguing the potential rewards are often understated. The proposal includes sending targeted information to savers and potentially adjusting the tax-free allowance for cash ISAs to incentivize the shift away from the £300 billion currently held in them. Critics, however, raise concerns about the risks for inexperienced investors and the potential to exacerbate the existing gender gap in investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of modern, members-only clubs is emerging in India, catering to the country's growing class of young, self-made entrepreneurs and creative professionals. Unlike the traditional, colonial-era gymkhanas with long waiting lists and legacy-based memberships, new entrants like Soho House offer a more relaxed, contemporary environment focused on networking and community. This trend reflects India's economic shift, creating exclusive spaces for a new generation of wealth that values personal accomplishment and a diverse community over inherited status, though membership costs remain prohibitive for most.</p>

          <p>A viral image purporting to show Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein posing with a young girl has been determined to be a fake, created using artificial intelligence. The image, which has circulated for years and resurfaced recently, contains numerous tell-tale signs of AI generation, such as deformed hands, distorted background figures, and a figure dissolving into the furniture. While some authentic photographs of Trump and Epstein together do exist from the 1990s, this particular image was found to be a digital fabrication and not a genuine photograph.</p>

Finishing the day at eight under par, McIlroy is six shots behind the leader, Scottie Scheffler, but feels he has given himself an outside chance for victory.</p>
