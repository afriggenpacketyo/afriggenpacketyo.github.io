        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a top-10 college football game, No. 9 LSU secured a 17-10 road victory over No. 4 Clemson in a game dominated by defense. Both offenses struggled to find consistency, with multiple punts, fumbles, and field goal attempts marking the initial drives. LSU's Garrett Nussmeier completed 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's Cade Klubnik completed 19 of 38 passes, also for 230 yards, but the ground game was largely ineffective for both teams. The game remained close until late, when LSU capitalized on Clemson's offensive struggles to secure the win, with Clemson failing to convert on a crucial fourth down in the final minutes. The final score was 17-10. </p>

          <p>UK government scientists are using drones, sniffer dogs, and nuclear waste models to combat the spread of the spruce bark beetle, Ips typographus, which poses a significant threat to UK forests. The beetle has caused widespread damage in Europe, and government efforts to control its spread include surveying forests with drones and using dogs to detect infestations. While the UK claims to have eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas, climate change could make the job more challenging in the future. The efforts are aimed at protecting the UK's spruce forests. </p>
