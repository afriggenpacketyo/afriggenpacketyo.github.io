          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced a "framework" deal between the U.S. and China concerning TikTok, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize the terms soon. This agreement, primarily between private parties, aims to shift TikTok towards U.S.-controlled ownership. The development comes as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, faces a September 17 deadline to divest its U.S. business or risk a shutdown, following legislative actions and national security concerns. The deal may require a deadline extension, but ongoing extensions are not anticipated.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump suggested U.S. companies should switch from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, pending SEC approval. He argued this change would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term company operations, drawing a comparison to China's longer-term view. While some financial figures like Warren Buffett have advocated against quarterly guidance, current regulations mandate quarterly reports. Experts are divided, with supporters emphasizing transparency for investors, while critics believe it fosters short-termism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla shares surged after CEO Elon Musk disclosed his first open-market purchase of the company's stock since 2020, buying approximately $1 billion worth of shares. This significant insider acquisition is seen as a strong vote of confidence from Musk, especially as Tesla aims to transform into a leader in autonomous driving, artificial intelligence, and robotics. The purchase comes ahead of a shareholder vote on a new, ambitious pay package for Musk, and after a period where Tesla shares were impacted by slumping sales. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Congressional Budget Office Director Phillip Swagel stated that President Donald Trump's tariffs appear to have increased inflation more than initially expected.

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching record highs of over $3,600 per ounce, experts suggest it remains a worthwhile investment. They argue gold has further growth potential, especially with anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts and persistent inflation, which make it more attractive relative to depreciating dollars. Gold also serves as a low-risk portfolio diversifier, as its value is not tied to other asset classes during economic uncertainty. Various accessible investment options, including fractional gold and ETFs, make it feasible for many investors. (not investment advice)</p>
