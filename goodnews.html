          <p>Circle Internet Group's shares experienced a significant surge of up to 235% during its New York Stock Exchange debut, following an initial public offering that raised almost $1.1 billion. The IPO was priced at $31, far exceeding the expected range, and the stock opened at $69.50, reaching a high of $103.75. Circle joins a limited number of pure-play crypto companies listed in the U.S., marking the company's second attempt at going public after a previous merger collapsed due to regulatory hurdles. CEO Jeremy Allaire emphasized the importance of working with governments and policymakers to ensure the mainstream adoption of stablecoins, highlighting Circle's commitment to compliance and transparency in the crypto industry. Wall Street analysts anticipate substantial growth in the stablecoin sector, potentially creating a trillion-dollar market opportunity in the next five years. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record decrease in April, driven by a sharp decline in import demand ahead of President Donald Trump's tariffs. The deficit fell to $61.6 billion, a significant drop from the previous month, as companies and consumers adjusted their purchasing patterns. While a reduced trade deficit might seem positive, economists caution against interpreting it as entirely beneficial, noting that international trade has generally benefited the U.S. economy. Trump indicated that further trade talks with China are likely to occur soon, following a recent conversation with Chinese President Xi Jinping. </p>

Despite the resignation, Reform leader Nigel Farage expressed his gratitude for Yusuf's contributions to the party's recent electoral successes. Yusuf, a former Conservative and self-described "proud British Muslim patriot," played a crucial role in professionalizing the party and attracting donors. </p>
