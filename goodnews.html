          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang voiced surprise regarding Advanced Micro Devices' agreement to offer OpenAI a 10% stake as part of a multi-billion-dollar chip deal. Huang described the deal as 'imaginative, unique and surprising,' especially considering AMD's upcoming products. This arrangement challenges Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip market, while Nvidia itself plans a significant investment in OpenAI, allowing direct sales to the ChatGPT creator. Huang also confirmed Nvidia's involvement in xAI's funding round, expressing enthusiasm for Elon Musk's ventures.

          <p>The NHS is reportedly preparing to increase payments to pharmaceutical firms for medicines by up to 25% to resolve a standoff over drug pricing. This move follows weeks of intense talks with the Trump administration and drugmakers, who cited the dispute as a reason for pausing UK investments. The government is negotiating funding with the Treasury and No 10, facing criticism from the Liberal Democrats over potential costs. The article explains that the plan includes raising the cost-effectiveness threshold for new medications, a measure unchanged since 1999. Trump's pressure for lower US drug prices and higher international prices has influenced these discussions.</p>

          <p>The German government has increased its economic growth forecasts, now expecting a modest 0.2% growth in 2025, up from an earlier prediction of zero, followed by more robust growth of 1.3% in 2026. This upward revision anticipates a low-level recovery by autumn 2025, accelerating into 2026, primarily driven by higher state financing, particularly for infrastructure and defense investments. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche emphasized the need for decisive reforms, including lower energy prices and taxes, to spur further growth. The article highlights the ongoing struggles of Germany's manufacturing sector, facing high energy costs and international competition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) introduces significant changes to the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption, potentially benefiting startup founders and early employees. The bill expands the capital gains exclusion cap from $10 million to $15 million for stock acquired after July 4, 2025, and offers tiered exclusions for holdings over three or four years. This makes C corporation status more attractive for startups aiming for rapid growth and attracting investors. The article notes the increased gross assets limit for qualifying C corps to $75 million, fostering greater access to capital for new ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests an 'unusual' side effect of popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy is becoming more common, potentially interfering with medical imaging. Researchers found abnormal patterns of FDG uptake in patients taking GLP-1 drugs during PET-CT scans, which could lead to misinterpretations by doctors. The article explains that if a patient's medication history is not considered, these altered patterns could result in unnecessary tests, incorrect cancer staging, and treatment delays. Imaging professionals are advised to meticulously document medication history to avoid these diagnostic errors, ensuring accurate and timely patient care. The phenomenon is an emerging issue without national guidance.</p>
