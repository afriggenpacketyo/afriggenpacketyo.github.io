          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to resume distributing funds allocated for EV chargers to 14 states that had sued to challenge the freeze on these funds. The lawsuit was filed after the Department of Transportation paused the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, citing the need for revised guidance. The judge's preliminary injunction includes a seven-day pause for a potential appeal by the administration. The states argued that the delay hindered their efforts to cut transportation-related carbon emissions, while the Department of Transportation stated the Biden-Buttigieg NEVI program guidance was a disaster and failed to deliver EV chargers.</p>

Rutte later defended his use of the term, describing Trump as a "good friend" and praising his decision to strike Iran and broker a ceasefire. The president responded positively to Rutte's nickname, suggesting it was meant affectionately, and also said that Rutte likes him.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary is analyzed for insights into Democratic politics. Mamdani's success is attributed to his charisma, ability to communicate effectively, and populist messaging about affordability. He focused on containing costs for ordinary New Yorkers while combating the interests that inflated them. His win also suggests that attacking an opponent as insufficiently pro-Israel is not a surefire strategy, reflecting a shift in Democratic views on the Israel-Palestine conflict. This victory also increases the likelihood of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez winning in 2028.</p>

However, Governors Adriana Kugler and Michael Barr opposed the move, arguing it would primarily benefit shareholders rather than increase Treasury intermediation.
