          <p>U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that major trade deals are expected within the next two weeks, just before a hard August 1 deadline for new tariffs on key trading partners like the European Union and Canada. Lutnick asserted that President Trump's strategy of threatening tariffs has successfully brought countries to the negotiating table, forcing them to either open their markets to American goods or face significant import duties. He dismissed concerns about rising consumer prices, claiming that the policy will ultimately benefit American manufacturers and that inflation will remain stable. The Secretary also sharply criticized Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing him of "torturing America" with high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

He is currently targeting a return to the court for the U.S. Open, which is set to begin on August 24. Draper's withdrawal follows similar announcements from other top players, including Jannik Sinner and Novak Djokovic.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary has pledged to cut the number of sewage discharges by water companies in half by the year 2030, marking the first time the government has set a specific target on the issue. The announcement follows intense public outcry over the state of the nation's waterways and data showing serious pollution incidents rose by 60% in 2024. The minister acknowledged that the water sector is "broken" and stated that regulation must change, though he ruled out nationalization. This pledge is part of a broader plan to invest a record £104 billion into the sector's infrastructure over the next five years.</p>

          <p>Scottish ultra-runner Anna Rutherford achieved a remarkable victory in a 100-mile race, finishing over two hours ahead of the nearest male competitor and five hours ahead of the next woman. The 43-year-old mother-of-three completed the Rat Race course from Bamburgh Castle to Edinburgh Castle in 17 hours and 23 minutes. She ran the final 50 miles of the race by herself after overtaking the leader at the halfway point. Rutherford, who credited singing Dolly Parton songs to keep her spirits up, was reportedly already home in bed as the rest of the 600 competitors were still finishing the grueling event.</p>

          <p>An infectious disease physician has written an article to correct what he describes as factually incorrect public statements about vaccine safety made by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The author refutes claims that children receive 92 mandatory shots, that routine immunizations are not placebo-tested, and that 97% of federal vaccine advisers have conflicts of interest. Citing decades of research and public data, the physician explains that the childhood vaccine schedule has dramatically reduced illness and death, undergoes rigorous testing, and is monitored by robust surveillance systems. The article aims to correct the record on vaccine science.</p>

          <p>A face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to occur this year, with the APEC summit in South Korea being the most probable venue. According to multiple sources, the meeting could happen either on the sidelines of the October summit or during a potential visit by Trump to China beforehand. Relations between the two nations have been tense since Trump's return to office and his threats of heavy tariffs. However, recent diplomatic engagements, including a meeting between their top diplomats, suggest a mutual desire to stabilize the relationship.</p>
