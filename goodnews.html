          <p>China is transforming its national laboratory system into a more streamlined and mission-oriented force to advance its technological ambitions amid global competition. The new model replaces loosely defined research with clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's strategic goals. A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, attended by China's Science and Technology Minister, showcased this shift, with revamped labs being urged to directly support national development through innovation. This restructuring reflects a strategic pivot to focus scientific resources on achieving technological self-reliance and supremacy.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the controversy surrounding the cover art for her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet. In a "CBS Mornings" interview, Carpenter dismissed the criticism, stating the image was not a topic of concern among her inner circle and that her interpretation is about being "in on the control" of a situation. She explained the album explores allowing oneself to make mistakes for personal growth, even when the outcome might be poor. Amid the backlash, she released an alternative cover, but defended the original as a form of artistic expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," is a crime comedy set in 1998 New York City, starring Austin Butler as a bartender caught in a web of criminal intrigue. The article's review praises the film's gritty, nostalgic atmosphere that evokes Aronofsky's early work but criticizes its lack of substance and character depth. Despite a star-studded cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the characters are described as cartoonish, and Butler's charm is seen as a mismatch for his down-and-out character. The film is ultimately deemed a stylish but hollow exercise that recalls a disposable Blockbuster rental from its era.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1 billion for the upcoming Saturday night drawing after no grand prize winner emerged from the previous round. This marks the sixth time in the game's history that the jackpot has reached the billion-dollar threshold, with a cash value estimated at $453.1 million. The grand prize has not been won since May 31, leading to its steady increase over the past several months. The odds of winning the top prize remain exceedingly low at 1 in 292.2 million, but the massive sum is sure to attract widespread ticket sales.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive loss to Elena Rybakina in the US Open third round, British tennis player Emma Raducanu believes the world's best players are especially motivated to defeat her. She noted that all four of her Grand Slam exits this year have been against elite opponents, who she feels have a "point to prove" against her. Raducanu is working with new coach Francisco Roig to close the gap, focusing on improving her serve and the crucial first shot after the serve. Despite the tough losses, she feels she is improving and aims to raise her ranking to secure seeding in future major tournaments.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to Harrisburg to protest significant budget cuts to the region's public transportation system. He is aiming to draw attention to the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority's (Septa) $213 million deficit, which he blames on Republican inaction in the state legislature. Kenyatta argues that the funding crisis, which has already led to service cuts affecting students and workers, is a manufactured problem. He frames his march as part of a "time honoured American tradition" of protest to fight for the needs of working people.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has declared the start of a "new industrial revolution" powered by artificial intelligence, predicting a massive surge in demand for computing resources. During an earnings call, Huang stated that advanced AI models will require 100 to 1,000 times more computing power, creating a multi-trillion-dollar market opportunity for Nvidia over the next five years. He dismissed concerns about competition, emphasizing Nvidia's comprehensive, full-stack solutions for building "AI factories." The company's optimistic outlook comes as it reported another strong quarter with revenue up 56% year-over-year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the administration likely acted unlawfully and that the DHS secretary lacked the authority to end the protections. The court emphasized that Congress designed the TPS program to be predictable and insulated from shifting political dynamics. This ruling is a significant victory for TPS holders who have been challenging the administration's efforts to end the humanitarian program.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but with new restrictions on eligibility. Previously available to nearly everyone over six months old, the updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems that make them more vulnerable to the virus. This shift in public health strategy marks a significant change from the broad vaccination campaigns of the early pandemic, focusing protection on the most susceptible populations as the virus continues to evolve.</p>

          <p>With over a third of the Senate's seats up for election in 2026, the political landscape for control of the chamber is beginning to form. Democrats are defending 13 seats while Republicans defend 24, but the map presents few clear opportunities for Democrats to gain the four seats needed for a majority. Key contests are emerging in states like North Carolina, where an open seat is expected to be highly expensive, and Georgia, where incumbent Jon Ossoff is seen as vulnerable. Retirements and contentious primaries in states like Michigan, New Hampshire, and Texas are also setting the stage for competitive and closely watched races.</p>

While the company's overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the strong performance in the high-margin cloud sector and a revival in its e-commerce business have bolstered investor confidence.

          <p>A judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can probe State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's official rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike, and consumer advocates argue no increase should be granted until the numerous complaints are resolved. The ruling combines the issues of rate setting and claims performance, linking the price of insurance to the value and service customers actually receive.</p>
