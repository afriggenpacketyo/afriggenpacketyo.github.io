          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the preliminary design for the CFR-1000, its first commercial gigawatt-level fast neutron reactor. This fourth-generation technology is designed to be more fuel-efficient and represents a key part of the global competition to develop safer and more sustainable nuclear power sources. The project, located in Fujian province, is now awaiting final approval and is expected to be operational after 2030, marking a major milestone for China's atomic energy ambitions.</p>

          <p>Quantitative hedge funds in China are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent who might have previously remained in the United States. Stricter U.S. visa policies and university funding cuts under the Trump administration have created an opportunity for Chinese firms to offer highly competitive salaries and secure the brainpower needed for their expansion. This trend allows these funds to better harness breakthroughs in artificial intelligence and grow their presence in the world's second-largest financial market, often at the expense of American firms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jorge Mas, the owner of Inter Miami, has publicly blasted Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was automatically triggered after both players, citing rest and injury, skipped the MLS All-Star Game. Mas described the punishment as "draconian" and stated that his players did not understand why missing an exhibition match would lead to a suspension from a regular season game. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision and said the league would reevaluate the policy.</p>

          <p>A Leicester-based salon owner is preparing for a pivotal legal hearing in her ongoing trademark battle with the global cosmetics firm L'Oréal. The dispute began when Rebecca Dowdeswell tried to re-register the trademark for her business, "nkd," which L'Oréal opposed, claiming it would cause consumer confusion with its "Naked" line of products. After years of delays and spending over £30,000 in legal fees, the small business owner says she is ready to fight the corporate giant and is determined not to back down.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has experienced a noticeable boom in insects such as ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps, following its warmest and sunniest spring on record. The warm, dry conditions have been ideal for these species, with an abundance of aphids providing a key food source. However, conservation experts express concern that the prolonged lack of rain could harm future populations, as essential wetland habitats for egg-laying are drying up. This could lead to lower numbers of insects and amphibians in the coming year, despite the current visible abundance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration that challenged Chicago's sanctuary city laws. The suit argued that the city's policies, which limit cooperation between local police and federal immigration agents, illegally thwarted federal enforcement efforts. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that Chicago's decision not to participate in federal immigration enforcement is lawful and protected by the Tenth Amendment. City officials praised the ruling, stating it affirms their right to focus on local public safety needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society, titled "The Hollywood Ten," examines the impact and legacy of the Hollywood blacklist during the Red Scare of the 1940s and 1950s. The exhibit details the story of the writers, directors, and other entertainers who were investigated by the House Un-American Activities Committee for alleged Communist ties. Many, like screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, were imprisoned and had their careers destroyed, raising enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy in the face of fear.</p>

          <p>An article explores how Donald Trump has integrated golf into his political and business life, using the sport as a venue for high-stakes networking and diplomacy. Unlike other presidents who used golf for relaxation, Trump views it as a competitive arena for forging connections with allies, world leaders, and business figures, often away from the scrutiny of the press. This approach was highlighted during his recent trip to Scotland, underscoring how he leverages his golf properties to conduct transactional meetings and build relationships in a cloistered environment.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a critical mission to rescue the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. In a carefully planned operation, a team captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range. Recent follow-up observations have brought hope, revealing that the relocated herd is not only surviving but also growing, with the birth of new lambs marking a monumental step in the species' recovery.</p>

          <p>An article delves into the science behind popular health targets, such as walking 10,000 steps, drinking eight glasses of water, and getting eight hours of sleep daily. Health and nutrition experts suggest that while these numbers serve as useful guidelines, they shouldn't be treated as rigid, all-or-nothing rules. They emphasize that individual needs vary based on factors like age, activity level, and overall health. The consensus is to focus on consistency and listen to one's body rather than stressing over hitting a specific number every single day.</p>
