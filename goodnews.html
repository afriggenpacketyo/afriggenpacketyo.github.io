          <h2>Report Suggests Unexpected College Majors May Offer Better Job Security Than Finance or STEM</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CFA Institute survey reveals that while students believe finance offers the best career prospects, other data suggests this perception may be misleading. According to the New York Fed, majors like art history and nutritional sciences have lower unemployment rates for recent graduates than finance or computer science. The article notes a growing demand for humanities majors, driven by the rise of AI, which has increased the need for creative thinking and soft skills. Even major financial firms like BlackRock are reportedly adjusting their hiring strategies to recruit more graduates with degrees in fields like history and English. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March. This sale follows a significant surge in Nvidia's stock value, which recently made it the first company to surpass a $4 trillion market capitalization, driven by the boom in artificial intelligence. Huang's personal net worth has soared to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with investor Warren Buffett. Despite the sale, Huang retains a substantial holding of over 858 million shares in the leading AI chipmaker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gatwick Airport marked a significant milestone by welcoming its first-ever all-electric aircraft, a two-seater Pipistrel Velis Electro plane. The aircraft, which is on a 17-day tour of France, made a stop at the London airport as part of an "early-stage concept proof" by Gatwick's operator, Vinci. The event highlights the airport's commitment to decarbonization, which includes a £250 million program to achieve net-zero emissions for its own operations. As part of this initiative, Gatwick is also upgrading its entire 300-strong vehicle fleet to be fully electric by 2030, demonstrating a broader push towards sustainability in aviation.</p>

The discussions focused on expanding collaboration in trade, finance, renewable energy, and technology. This move is seen as part of China's broader effort to play a more significant role in resolving regional crises amid its ongoing rivalry with the United States.</p>

          <p>This column pays tribute to Jewel Thais-Williams, the founder of the landmark Los Angeles nightclub Jewel’s Catch One, who passed away at 86. The article highlights her legacy not just as the first Black lesbian to own a bar in the U.S. but as a "warrior" for her community, as described by Rep. Maxine Waters. Thais-Williams opened her club in 1973, creating a safe haven during a time of intense discrimination. She later became a healer, founding the Village Health Foundation to support people with AIDS and provide holistic care, cementing her status as a pivotal figure in both LGBTQ+ and Black history.</p>

          <p>Descanso Gardens is hosting a new art exhibition, "Roots of Cool," which uses art to explore the issue of shade equity and the impact of rising urban temperatures. Curated by a husband-and-wife team, the exhibit features all-women artists whose work provokes thought about how urban planning has left some communities more vulnerable to heat. Installations like a series of bus stops without adequate shade and a canopy of colorful umbrellas highlight both past inequities and potential future solutions. The exhibition aims to engage visitors emotionally and intellectually, connecting them to the real-world consequences of climate change and inspiring action.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Argues 'Superman' Film is Not 'Superwoke' Despite Culture War Backlash</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite criticism from some commentators labeling the new "Superman" movie as "superwoke," this analysis argues the film's themes are fundamentally traditional. The controversy stems from director James Gunn acknowledging the character's immigrant origins, a point that has been part of the Superman story for decades. The article contends that the movie is more a story about assimilation and American values, as Clark Kent's heroism is shaped by his upbringing in Kansas, not just his Kryptonian heritage. While the character is an immigrant, his story has rarely delved into the complex political issues of immigration, focusing instead on universal themes of kindness.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor declared she was "very satisfied" after securing a majority-decision victory over Amanda Serrano, completing a 3-0 sweep in their historic trilogy. The fight, which headlined an all-female card at Madison Square Garden, was a more tactical affair than their previous encounters, with Taylor saying she executed a smarter game plan. Promoter Eddie Hearn praised the performance as "lights out," suggesting it has quieted any talk of retirement for the 39-year-old champion. Taylor celebrated the history she and Serrano made together but remained non-committal about her next fight, saying she will take time to reflect.</p>

          <p>The Welsh rugby team has ended an 18-Test losing streak by defeating Japan 31-22 in Kobe, securing their first international win in nearly two years. The victory leveled the series at 1-1 and provided a much-needed boost for the team, which had recently dropped to its lowest-ever world ranking. Wales built an early lead with tries from Kieran Hardy and Josh Adams, and despite a spirited second-half comeback from Japan, a late try from fly-half Dan Edwards sealed the win.
