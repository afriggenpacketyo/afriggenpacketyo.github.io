          <p>Taiwan is increasing its spending in Latin America by over NT$1 billion (US$32.8 million) next year to strengthen ties with its remaining allies and counter Beijing's efforts to draw them away. The budget proposal includes allocating NT$5.37 billion to the Department of Latin American and Caribbean Affairs, up from NT$4.36 billion the previous year. The ministry plans to invite 330 guests from Latin America and the Caribbean to Taiwan and allocate NT$53.8 million for public diplomacy campaigns. Taipei hopes to improve understanding of its policies and development model by inviting influential figures to conferences and forums, aiming to promote a positive image and increase international visibility. Optimism surrounding this article stems from the proactive measures being taken to maintain diplomatic relationships. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have apologized after the medals awarded to participants mistakenly featured Sunderland and the River Wear instead of Newcastle and the River Tyne. About 60,000 people completed the half-marathon, and the medals were intended to showcase an aerial view of Newcastle, Gateshead, and South Shields. The Great Run Company humorously acknowledged the error, calling it a "mistake" and claiming it made the medal and merchandise unique. Despite the geographical gaffe, event founder Sir Brendan Foster said he would still wear the medal with pride, and that the event celebrated the region. The event is an important regional event, and the tone of the author in writing about the mistake is more jovial than serious. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expressed confidence that President Trump's tariff plan would be upheld by the Supreme Court, but warned of massive refunds if the court rules against it. Bessent stated that the Treasury would have to refund about half of the tariffs collected, which would negatively impact the Treasury. The Trump administration is seeking an expedited ruling to overturn an appeals court decision that deemed most of his tariffs illegal. The administration is also working on backup plans, including implementing tariffs through Section 232, should the Supreme Court block Trump's tariffs (not investment advice). The discussion of financial planning and potential legal authorities creates a sense of stability. </p>

Indeed's Cory Stahle notes that AI's impact has been fairly small, but not zero, and that most of the impact has been isolated in the tech industry.
