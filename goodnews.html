          <p>Republican Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are introducing a framework for a major bill that would set the rules for digital assets. The bill aims to define when crypto is a commodity or a security, allow crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and reduce the Securities and Exchange Commission's regulation of digital currencies. The proposed legislation also includes measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Scott hopes the bill will provide clarity for digital asset regulation.
