          <h2>Conservative Leader Proposes New Fiscal Rule to Reduce Borrowing and Taxes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 20:55:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kemi Badenoch, the Conservative leader, is set to unveil a new economic "golden rule" aimed at reducing government borrowing and taxes. This plan mandates that half of all future government savings would go towards deficit reduction, with the other half funding economic growth policies, including tax cuts. Badenoch criticizes the Labour government's economic approach as unsustainable and warns against a "borrowing and tax doom loop." The Conservatives seek to restore fiscal credibility and differentiate themselves from past policies that spooked markets, while facing challenges like a difficult autumn budget and a rebellion over welfare spending.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer stated that the UK will not relax visa rules for India, ahead of a visit to promote a recent trade agreement. Leading a delegation of over 100 business and cultural leaders, Starmer emphasized "massive opportunities" in trade and cultural ties, but reiterated that immigration policy remains unchanged. The trade deal, signed in July, aims to boost exports by making goods cheaper, but does not include broader visa concessions. Starmer also distanced himself from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's birthday greetings to Vladimir Putin, focusing instead on UK efforts against Russia's "shadow fleet."</p>

          <p>Unlawful crossings along the U.S.-Mexico border plummeted to their lowest annual level since 1970 in fiscal year 2025, according to internal federal statistics. U.S. Border Patrol recorded nearly 238,000 apprehensions, a stark contrast to the record 2.2 million under the Biden administration. The Trump administration's stringent policies, including sealing the border, closing asylum systems, and dispatching soldiers, are credited with this significant reduction. While the crackdown has faced criticism as inhumane and illegal from civil rights groups, those living along the border confirm a dramatic change in migration flows.</p>

          <p>Ethan Mollick, a leading generative AI expert from Wharton, candidly stated that "no one knows anything" definitively about AI's future impact on jobs and the economy. He noted that even top AI research labs consult his social media for use cases, highlighting the rapid, unpredictable evolution of the technology. Mollick stressed the need for a cultural shift in the workplace, moving from rewarding "having answers" to valuing "asking brilliant questions" and adaptability. He advises leaders to personally engage with AI tools for at least 10 hours weekly to understand its capabilities and limitations.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed, diverging from Wall Street's losses, after the World Bank raised its regional growth forecast. This positive outlook follows a summer marked by U.S. tariff-led global economic uncertainty. Japan's Nikkei 225 remained stable, while the Topix saw gains, and Hong Kong's Hang Seng futures rose. Mainland China and South Korean markets were closed for holidays, while the Bank of Thailand and Reserve Bank of New Zealand awaited policy decisions. U.S. markets closed lower due to Oracle shares and the ongoing government shutdown, influencing global sentiment.</p>

Launched for International Day of the Girl, the initiative addresses research showing 1 in 3 girls stop playing sports by age 14 due to body confidence issues, self-doubt, and lack of role models. Maher, a two-time Olympian and social media personality, uses her platform to champion body positivity and rugby. The campaign aims to break down barriers and showcase inspiring female athletes, reinforcing Barbie's commitment to girls' limitless potential.</p>

          <p>Former football star Herschel Walker has been confirmed by the Senate as the U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas. President Trump nominated Walker last year, following his unsuccessful 2022 Senate bid in Georgia. Walker's confirmation marks the first Senate-approved ambassador to the Bahamas in over a decade. His political career has been controversial, including accusations of paying for abortions despite his anti-abortion stance, which he denied. Walker was among over 100 Trump nominees approved in a single "en bloc" vote by Senate Republicans, a procedural change aimed at expediting confirmations amidst the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Arsenal Women are under pressure after a 2-1 Champions League defeat to Lyon extended their winless run to four games, compounding a sense of a "blip" in their season. Despite early success, the team is now five points adrift domestically and struggling with defensive errors. Coach Renee Slegers faces significant pressure to reverse the team's form. Players acknowledge the slump but emphasize positive moments and the long season ahead. While individual errors are identified as costly, the team remains hopeful of rebounding, drawing on past successes and a strong team culture to regain their winning edge.</p>

          <p>Paintings by the beloved art instructor Bob Ross will be auctioned by Bonhams to help fund U.S. public television stations, which have faced significant funding cuts under the Trump administration. Approximately 30 artworks, mostly created during his "Joy of Painting" show, will be sold starting in November. Bob Ross Inc. donated the paintings to American Public Television, with all net proceeds going to local PBS and NPR stations. This initiative aims to ensure Ross's legacy continues to support the medium that brought his art into American homes, especially after Congress approved Trump's request to strip federal funding.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed his company's new "direct partnership" with OpenAI, highlighting a shift from previous indirect engagements. This collaboration marks the first time OpenAI will purchase directly from Nvidia, rather than renting through cloud service providers. Nvidia plans to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI to build AI data center capacity, aiming for systems requiring 10 gigawatts of power. This significant investment underscores the growing demand for AI processing power, with Nvidia becoming the most valuable company in the market. The partnership is incremental to Nvidia's existing work with other AI firms, focusing on building OpenAI's self-operated AI infrastructure for the future.</p>

          <p>Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell acknowledged that while demand for AI computing power is "tremendous," the production of AI data centers will eventually reach saturation. Dell's server networking business has seen significant growth, with AI servers powered by Nvidia chips sold to major clients like CoreWeave and xAI. However, Dell highlighted energy supply as a "clear constraint" for customers, with many delaying deliveries until sufficient power is available. The massive investments by tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in AI data centers will require substantial energy consumption, posing a significant challenge for infrastructure development.
