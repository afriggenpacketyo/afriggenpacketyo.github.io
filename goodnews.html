          <p>Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani and U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have agreed to enhance cybersecurity cooperation following Japan's enactment of a law permitting government monitoring of online communications due to escalating cyber threats.

This collaboration underscores the growing importance of cybersecurity in international relations and defense strategies, especially as digital threats become more sophisticated and frequent.
