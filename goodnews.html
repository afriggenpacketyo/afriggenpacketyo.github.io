          <p>Waymo, Zoox, and Tesla are competing to deploy driverless taxis, with Waymo expanding its service areas in Los Angeles and San Francisco. Zoox opened a new production facility in California capable of producing 10,000 robotaxis annually, while Elon Musk plans to launch a commercial Tesla robotaxi service in Austin, facing pushback from local lawmakers. The article highlights that the robotaxi industry's growth depends on safe testing, citing incidents involving Tesla's Full Self-Drive mode and Waymo recalls, and notes that widespread adoption of robotaxis is still estimated to be years away.</p>

          <p>A SpaceX Starship upper stage exploded during a test at the company's Starbase facility in Texas, potentially due to the failure of a high-pressure nitrogen tank. The explosion occurred during preparations for a test firing of the rocket's Raptor engines, causing a large fireball and scattering debris. While SpaceX is investigating the cause, the incident raises concerns about the timeline for NASA's Artemis program, which relies on Starship for lunar landings, but NASA expressed support for SpaceX and their continued development.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from requiring states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive transportation grant funding. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by 20 Democratic-led states, who argued that the administration was unlawfully withholding federal funds to coerce them into adhering to Trump‚Äôs immigration agenda. The judge agreed with the states, stating that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, as the states argued that the transportation secretary lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding that Congress appropriated.</p>

          <p>Labour MP Vicky Foxcroft has resigned as a government whip in protest against the government's plans to cut disability benefits. Foxcroft expressed her understanding of the need to address the increasing welfare bill but opposed cuts to personal independence payments and universal credit. The government defends the reforms as necessary to fix a broken welfare system and ensure support for those with the most severe disabilities. The proposed bill tightens the criteria for personal independence payments and reduces the sickness-related element of universal credit, leading to concerns from Labour MPs and potential rebellion from backbenchers.</p>

          <p>'28 Years Later,' directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, adopts a more ambitious position than the original by extending its geographic coverage and placing us in the midst of a supposedly idyllic rural community that serves as a seemingly safe haven for those who have so far escaped the virus in an England that has been separated from the world. Spike ends up being the real protagonist of a story that feels more intense than it already is due to his participation and what he is forced to do in a world threatened not only by the infected of the first installment, but by three different classes of "creatures" as a product of an unusual evolution that becomes an excuse for the presentation of a particularly risky circumstance that will give much to talk about. Visually, the film, which was largely filmed with iPhones 15 Pro Max, keeps us constantly entertained, although full acceptance of its staging will largely depend on what you think of Boyle's style, a director who is not exactly adept at classicism, but seeks to impress with his choice of shots, his camera movements, the use he makes of music and the way he edits his works.</p>

          <p>A review of "28 Years Later" describes the film as ambitious, quirky, and tonally ungainly, with a dull central plot elevated by unusual ambition and maniacal editing. The film picks up nearly three decades into a viral "rage" pandemic, focusing on a community in Lindisfarne, and the movie's editing splices in archival footage and historical allusions.
