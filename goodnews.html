        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia, collectively known as the "Quad," have announced a new initiative to secure a stable supply of critical minerals. This move is widely seen as an effort to reduce global reliance on China, which currently dominates the market for minerals essential for high-tech manufacturing. The joint statement emphasized concerns about economic coercion and supply chain disruptions. The announcement was made following a meeting of the nations' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., aimed at strengthening strategic stability in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article suggests that investors seeking exposure to the energy sector can mitigate volatility by focusing on midstream companies, which often provide more stable returns than upstream or downstream businesses. It highlights that midstream assets like pipelines generate reliable cash flows through fees, making them less susceptible to commodity price swings. The article contrasts the dividend reliability of companies like Enterprise Products Partners and Enbridge with others such as Energy Transfer and Kinder Morgan, suggesting the former have stronger track records.

          <p>Preliminary data shows that the number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border fell to a new historic low in June. Border Patrol recorded just over 6,000 apprehensions, the lowest monthly total ever reported by the agency. The Trump administration attributes this dramatic decrease to its aggressive deportation policies, which include empowering officials to swiftly deport migrants without asylum hearings and halting nearly all migrant releases into the U.S. The numbers represent a stark contrast to the record-high levels of crossings seen under the previous administration.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel has agreed to the conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in its war with Hamas. He urged Hamas to accept the deal, stating it is the best they will get and that the situation will only worsen otherwise. The president did not provide specific details of the proposal, which he said would be delivered by mediators from Qatar and Egypt. There has been no public confirmation from either Israel or Hamas regarding the agreement, which comes after previous ceasefire efforts have failed to end the 21-month conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, often called "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, known as "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. Strande's community was heavily affected by PFAS waste from manufacturer 3M, which contaminated local groundwater. Her powerful testimony inspired lawmakers to act, creating a lasting legacy of public health protection.</p>

With drone warfare increasing the frequency of fragmentation injuries, these tools have become essential, used to perform over 70 successful heart operations in one year alone. The devices are now being distributed to hospitals and medics across the country, providing a critical advantage in treating wartime trauma.</p>

Nvidia's rally was driven by the persistent and unrivaled demand for its AI chips, overcoming earlier concerns about competition and U.S. sales restrictions in China. Cramer suggests Meta's strong performance is due to its powerful advertising capabilities, which led to blowout quarterly earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is planning the first major redesign of its banknotes in over 50 years and is asking the public for input on potential new themes. Since 1970, notes have featured notable historical figures, but future designs could celebrate subjects like nature, British innovation, or key historical events. This change could see images of animals, landmarks, or cultural items replacing figures like Winston Churchill and Jane Austen. The consultation aims to create notes that serve as a symbolic representation of the UK's collective national identity, with the monarch's portrait remaining a feature.</p>
