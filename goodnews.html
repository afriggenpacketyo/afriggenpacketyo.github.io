          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to halt deadly border clashes that have killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000. The agreement was mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim during an ASEAN regional bloc meeting. The conflict, which flared after a landmine incident, represents a rare military confrontation between ASEAN members. Both nations' leaders expressed commitment to de-escalation, a move praised by U.S. President Trump, who had threatened to halt trade deals if hostilities continued.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Sphere is set to screen the 1939 classic "The Wizard of Oz" as its first-ever immersive film experience. The project will utilize the venue's massive wraparound screen, 16K resolution, spatial audio, and haptic seating to place audiences inside the movie's world. Engineers used AI "outpainting" to expand the original film frames to fit the unique space, while 4D effects like wind and fog will enhance the experience. The innovative presentation, opening to the public on August 28, aims to immerse viewers without altering the original film's content.</p>

          <p>PayPal has announced a new service, "Pay with Crypto," that will permit businesses to accept payments in more than 100 different cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The system will automatically convert the crypto payments into fiat currency or a stablecoin, like PayPal's own PYUSD, for the merchant. The company claims this will simplify cross-border transactions, reduce fees, and increase profit margins for businesses. PayPal is promoting the service with a low transaction rate to encourage adoption, aiming to address common crypto challenges like price volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Human Immune System Can Be Triggered by the Virtual Sight of Infection</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Swiss study has found that the human immune system can be activated merely by seeing virtual images of sick people. Researchers used VR headsets to show participants avatars, some of which appeared to have rashes or coughs. Brain monitoring and subsequent blood tests revealed that viewing the sick-looking avatars, especially as they moved closer, triggered a response in the participants' innate immune cells. The findings suggest the brain can prime the body's defenses against a perceived threat before any actual pathogen is present, opening potential new avenues for non-pharmacological therapies.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club is selling a portion of its shares in the industrial manufacturer Eaton after the stock reached a new record high. The article states the stock's recent climb is a reaction to the new U.S.-E.U. trade deal, which includes significant energy purchases. However, the club believes the market reaction is overblown relative to the actual impact on Eaton's business. The sale is intended to lock in profits and free up capital to invest in other industrial stocks that are viewed as having more growth potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing new technology to help prevent spatial disorientation, a dangerous condition that contributes to 5-10% of general aviation accidents. The system, which could be integrated into a flight suit or pilot's seat, uses haptic vibrations to provide sensory cues to the pilot. Similar to lane departure warnings in cars, the vibrations would guide a pilot on how to respond if they show signs of being disoriented, especially when flying in clouds or bad weather. The technology aims to provide an additional sensory input to improve flight safety.</p>

          <p>In the current high-interest-rate environment, savers with a significant sum like $20,000 are weighing the benefits of short-term CDs versus high-yield savings accounts. This article provides a comparative analysis, calculating the potential earnings for both options over 3, 6, 9, and 12-month periods. In each scenario, the CD earns slightly more interest due to marginally higher fixed rates compared to the variable rates of savings accounts. The primary advantage of a CD is its guaranteed return, offering security against potential interest rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has announced it will offer annual subsidies of 3,600 yuan (about $500) per child for families with children under the age of three. This national policy is the latest attempt to address China's demographic crisis, which has seen its population decline for three consecutive years. The move follows similar initiatives by various provinces to encourage childbirth amid record-low marriage rates and high child-rearing costs.

Even Pep Guardiola, a proponent of fluid forward lines, adapted his system for Erling Haaland.

          <p>As homeowners look to tap into their record-high home equity, experts are advising on the choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan. With interest rates remaining elevated, a fixed-rate home equity loan offers predictability, making it suitable for large, one-time expenses. Conversely, a variable-rate HELOC provides flexibility for ongoing or uncertain costs, with the potential for lower payments if the Fed cuts rates. The best choice ultimately depends on the borrower's specific financial needs, project timeline, and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>
