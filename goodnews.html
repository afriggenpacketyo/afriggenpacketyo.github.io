          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet. The move is expected to see the return of former senior minister Sir James Cleverly to a prominent front-bench role. Initially anticipated to be a minor adjustment, the reshuffle is now seen as a larger strategic shake-up to strengthen the party's opposition to the current Labour government. A party source described the changes as reflecting the next phase of policy renewal and underlining party unity under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has pledged to invest $50 billion in its U.S. operations by 2030, a move that follows similar commitments from other major drugmakers amid potential U.S. trade tariffs. The cornerstone of this investment will be a new facility in Virginia dedicated to its weight management and metabolic treatments, including an oral GLP-1 obesity pill. The funding will also expand R&D and cell therapy manufacturing across several states, creating numerous jobs. This commitment highlights the company's focus on the American market, which is expected to generate half of its ambitious $80 billion annual revenue target by 2030.</p>

          <p>This article addresses key questions in Formula 1, including the potential for Max Verstappen to move to Aston Martin, which is deemed unlikely for now. It also examines the transition of new team principal Laurent Mekies to Red Bull, suggesting he will initially observe before making significant changes. The piece clarifies that current floor upgrades are unrelated to the 2026 regulations, as F1 will be abandoning the current ground-effect concept for a different aerodynamic philosophy. Finally, it explains that information on 2026 engine development circulates through industry gossip, personnel movement, and FIA discussions, with Mercedes currently rumored to be ahead.</p>

          <p>The UK government has become the primary shareholder in the Sizewell C nuclear power plant, taking a 44.9% stake in the now £38 billion project. This investment, alongside funding from EDF, Centrica, and other firms, aims to secure the nation's future energy supply and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. The plant, located on the Suffolk coast, is projected to power six million homes and create thousands of jobs, though its cost has nearly doubled from the last official estimate of £20 billion. Critics have raised concerns that taxpayers will bear the risk of potential cost overruns.</p>

          <p>A small Norwegian town, Ulefoss, sits atop what is believed to be Europe's largest deposit of rare earth elements, critical materials for modern technology and green energy. A mining company, Rare Earths Norway (REN), plans to develop an "invisible mine" by tunneling diagonally to access the deposit without displacing the community above ground. The project aims to begin full-scale operations by 2030, which could significantly reduce the EU's heavy reliance on China for these strategic resources. While there are local concerns about environmental impact and potential subsidence, the project has so far avoided major opposition due to the town's mining history.</p>

          <p>The Chinese AI start-up Moonshot AI, backed by Alibaba, has launched its new large language model, Kimi K2, to rapid user adoption and praise from industry experts. The model utilizes a "mixture-of-experts" (MOE) architecture, which activates only a fraction of its one trillion total parameters for any given task, making it highly cost-efficient to train and run. This approach is seen as a potential turning point in AI development, challenging the massive computational spending of firms like OpenAI. Kimi K2 is available for free, distinguishing it from subscription-based competitors like GPT and Claude, and highlighting a different strategy.</p>

          <p>Italy has emerged as a formidable dark horse at Euro 2025, reaching the semi-finals for the first time in 28 years where they will face defending champions England. The team's success is credited to the leadership of veteran striker Cristiana Girelli and the tactical flexibility of coach Andrea Soncin, who has adapted formations to exploit opponents' weaknesses. Analysts suggest Italy could target England's full-back positions, a known area of concern for the Lionesses, by utilizing their skilled wing-backs. While England are considered favorites, Italy's cohesive play and ability to capitalize on mistakes make them a credible threat.</p>

In an interview, Soon-Shiong stated the move would "democratize" the paper and allow public ownership, though specific details of the financial arrangement were not provided. The plan comes as the newspaper, like much of the industry, has faced significant financial challenges in recent years. Soon-Shiong, a billionaire from the biotech industry, purchased the L.A. Times in 2018, returning it to local ownership after years of control by a Chicago-based company.</p>

          <p>China has announced the commencement of a colossal hydropower project on the Yarlung Tsangpo River in Tibet, which will become the world's largest such facility. With an estimated investment of 1.2 trillion yuan (US$167 billion), the project will feature five cascade stations and is expected to have three times the capacity of the Three Gorges Dam. The announcement triggered a surge in the stock prices of Chinese infrastructure, hydropower, and cement companies.

          <p>The race to commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is gaining new momentum, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Nissan, and Toyota targeting mass production before the end of the decade. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. Some companies are initially focusing on semi-solid-state designs as a practical bridge technology. However, challenges such as high production costs persist, and some analysts caution that rapid improvements in existing battery technology are weakening the investment case for the still-developing solid-state alternatives.</p>

          <p>The British government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, aiming to restore trust after significant criticism. The changes come after a report from the public inquiry chair described the payment process as "profoundly unsatisfactory." A key change ensures that if an affected family member dies before their claim is settled, the payment can be passed on to their estate. These adjustments are expected to add £1 billion to the already allocated £11.8 billion fund, providing a measure of justice for those impacted.</p>
