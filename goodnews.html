          <h2>Lowe's Maintains Full-Year Forecast Due to Strong Sales from Home Professionals</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, as increased sales among home professionals helped to offset slower demand from do-it-yourself customers. While the home improvement retailer's quarterly sales slightly missed Wall Street's expectations, its earnings exceeded estimates. CEO Marvin Ellison attributed the company's resilience to investments in its stores, technology, and customer service amidst 'near-term uncertainty and housing market headwinds'. Lowe's anticipates full-year total sales to range from $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, with comparable sales projected to be flat to up 1% year over year, and earnings per share ranging from approximately $12.15 to $12.40.</p>

          <p>Half of all states in the U.S. now have laws regulating cellphone use in schools, with many more likely to follow suit, reflecting a growing consensus that phones are detrimental to children. Legislators across various states have voiced concerns about the negative impacts of cellphones on students' attention spans, social-emotional well-being, and mental health. While initial laws focused on banning phones during instructional time, many states are now implementing bans for the entire school day, aiming to foster social development and a sense of community. Some states are mandating that school districts adopt cellphone policies, while others are providing funding for phone storage solutions.</p>

          <p>West Nile virus has been detected in UK mosquitoes for the first time, according to UK health officials, though the risk to the general public remains 'very low'. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) stated that there is no evidence of the virus spreading in the UK, despite the virus being found in many parts of the world, including Europe. The fragments of the virus were found in mosquitoes collected at ponds near Retford, Nottinghamshire, in 2023. The detection is attributed to climate change and other factors that are pushing mosquitoes and the diseases they carry further north.</p>
