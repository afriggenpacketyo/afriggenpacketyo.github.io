          <h2>India Considers Zero Tariffs on Select U.S. Imports in Potential Trade Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals imported from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis. This move signals a potential shift away from India's protectionist trade policies, which have historically relied on high import duties. The U.S. is India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024. Experts suggest that a trade deal could boost India's economic growth by attracting foreign investment and expanding its global market access. Concerns remain about the potential impact on India's domestic manufacturing sector.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Jump Amid US Tariffs, Imports Decline</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, offsetting a sharp drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Overall exports rose 8.1%, while imports declined slightly. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%. President Trump has imposed tariffs of 145% on imports from China, leading to retaliatory tariffs of 125% on American imports. The rise in exports may be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>Nvidia intends to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July to circumvent U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip represents Nvidia's effort to maintain its presence in China amid increasing restrictions on advanced semiconductor technology. The original H20 chip was blocked from the Chinese market after U.S. officials stated it would require an export license. The modified chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity to meet new technical thresholds set by Nvidia.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with the U.K., which could reduce the burden of his tariffs and deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for the U.S. to the U.K. market and reduced non-tariff barriers. The 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain, but the first 100,000 vehicles imported by British automakers will be subject to that rate.
