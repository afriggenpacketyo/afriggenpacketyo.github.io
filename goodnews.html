          <p>Rams second-round draft pick Terrance Ferguson made a strong impression in his preseason debut against the Browns, showcasing his potential as the heir apparent to veteran tight end Tyler Higbee. After missing two games with a hamstring injury, Ferguson delivered a 33-yard over-the-shoulder catch and a 15-yard gain, demonstrating his vertical speed and receiving ability. Coach Sean McVay praised Ferguson's performance, noting his 'nice pace to his game.' This article suggests Ferguson will be a significant factor in the Rams' tight end group this season, alongside Colby Parkinson and Davis Allen.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has significantly out-raised his rivals in the New York City mayoral contest, securing over $1 million between July and August, with an average donation of $121. This fundraising dominance is mirrored in recent polls, where he holds a 13 to 19-point lead over his nearest competitor, Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's platform includes rent freezes, free public transport, city-run grocery stores, and higher taxes on universities to subsidize city colleges. The article highlights his strong grassroots support, despite a recent large donation to a PAC from a billionaire's daughter, as the crucial post-Labor Day campaign push approaches.</p>

          <p>Beirut's historic Hamra district is experiencing a cultural revival with the reopening of Le Colisee cinema, now the Lebanese National Theater, after decades of closure. This initiative, led by actor Kassem Istanbouli and supported by NGOs and volunteers, aims to restore Hamra's status as a cultural epicenter despite Lebanon's ongoing economic and political instability. The district, once a vibrant melting pot, has endured civil war and economic collapse, but local resilience and community efforts continue to preserve its identity. The theater's reopening symbolizes a persistent belief in the country's future, offering a shared cultural space against divisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ron Howard's new film, 'Eden,' is a dark, melodramatic portrayal of disenchanted Europeans who attempt to create a utopia on a remote Galapagos island in the 1930s, only to see it descend into power struggles and murder. The article describes the film as a 'sticky, sweaty hoot,' well-cast with actors like Jude Law, Ana de Armas, Vanessa Kirby, and Sydney Sweeney. Despite not being deeply illuminating about the human condition, the movie is praised for its entertaining, if overcooked, depiction of isolated megalomaniacs. It offers a fascinating, albeit farcical, look at survival-of-the-fittest dynamics.</p>

          <p>David Mackenzie's new film, 'Relay,' is a smart, paranoid thriller that explores the difficulty of anonymity in the digital age through the story of Ash, a tech-savvy fixer who helps whistleblowers disappear. Riz Ahmed stars as Ash, who uses a text-telephone relay service to maintain traceless communication, keeping identities and call logs secret. The article praises the film's unique premise, which avoids the over-romanticized assassin trope, focusing instead on the cynical choice between escape and financial settlement with tormentors. As Ash aids a rattled biotech scientist, the cat-and-mouse chase offers a dizzyingly enjoyable ride, reminiscent of classic '70s thrillers.</p>

Conservation biologists warn that species are disappearing at an alarming rate, emphasizing the cascading effects on ecosystems when even one species is lost. The article highlights the critical role of SCBI's work in maintaining ecological balance and training future conservationists.</p>

          <p>The war in Ukraine is profoundly reshaping geopolitics in former Soviet states, notably diminishing Russia's influence as countries like Azerbaijan forge new alliances. A US-brokered peace treaty between Azerbaijan and Armenia, mediated by President Trump, highlights this shift. Relations between Russia and Azerbaijan have become tense, marked by diplomatic incidents and a recent plane crash. The article suggests that Russia's preoccupation with Ukraine has created a 'window of opportunity' for these states to diversify foreign policy and strengthen ties with other powers like Turkey and China, challenging the long-held perception of Moscow's regional dominance.</p>
