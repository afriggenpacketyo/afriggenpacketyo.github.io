          <p>Despite looming tariff deadlines, the stock market is being buoyed by several positive factors, according to a recent analysis. Strong corporate earnings, particularly from the banking sector, have set a positive tone for the current season. Furthermore, proposed tax relief measures in President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill," including extensions of tax cuts and new deductions, are expected to inject hundreds of billions of dollars into the economy. Other key drivers include business tax relief, major infrastructure spending on data centers and the grid, and a more favorable environment for mergers and acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen-based quantum computing company SpinQ projects that the technology will cross a critical "usefulness" threshold for practical applications within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company develops both small-scale educational quantum computers and industrial-grade superconducting systems. The firm's CEO, Xiang Jingen, compared the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, indicating that while there is significant progress to be made, the field is on the cusp of a major transition. SpinQ currently sells its range of quantum products to over 50 countries.</p>

          <p>The number of people listed as missing following the deadly Fourth of July weekend floods in Texas Hill Country has been drastically reduced from over 100 to just three, officials announced. Extensive follow-up work by local, state, and federal agencies verified that many individuals initially reported missing were safe. The historic flash floods along the Guadalupe River in Kerr County resulted in at least 135 fatalities, including many campers at a youth summer camp. Recovery efforts are ongoing, and the Texas Legislature is set to review the state's response and consider improvements to flood warning systems.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will launch a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The incident, which occurred on June 18, 1984, involved violent clashes between striking miners and thousands of police officers outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners amid allegations that police falsified evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had unanswered questions for over 40 years, and campaigners have expressed cautious elation at the news.</p>

          <p>Mezcal, a traditional Mexican spirit, is experiencing a global surge in popularity, transforming from a little-known liquor into a premium product featured in high-end bars and restaurants. The vast majority of this artisanal spirit is produced in Oaxaca by family-owned distilleries, or palenques, using traditional, labor-intensive methods passed down through generations. This boom has created a half-billion-dollar industry, allowing families like the Hernandez brothers of Mal de Amor distillery to return from the U.S. and grow their business. The spirit's rise reflects a growing appreciation for handcrafted, authentic products with deep cultural roots.</p>

Designed to guide students toward answers through inquiry rather than providing them directly, the platform helps with homework, essay writing, and lesson planning. A unique feature, added at a school's request, can detect if a student expresses emotional distress or self-harm ideation in their chats, flagging it for teachers and counselors. While still a work in progress, proponents see it as a way to personalize education and provide critical support.</p>

          <p>At a recent concert, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously advised the audience to prepare for their close-up before the band's "Jumbotron Song," where they feature fans on the large video screens. The lighthearted warning comes after a previous show where a man and woman, later identified as a CEO and HR executive from the same company, were caught in an awkward embrace on camera. That viral moment led to the CEO's resignation and a formal investigation by his company. Martin's new pre-song banter appears to be a subtle acknowledgment of the recent internet fallout.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a parenting expert who has studied numerous parent-child relationships, the single most important skill to teach a child is "self-connection"—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. This skill builds emotional resilience, fosters healthy boundaries, and develops authentic confidence, which can protect a child's mental health. Parents can cultivate this by validating their child's feelings rather than dismissing them, welcoming all emotions, and modeling their own emotional regulation. Small shifts in language and interaction, focusing on curiosity over shame, can help a child build a strong and lasting sense of self-worth.</p>
