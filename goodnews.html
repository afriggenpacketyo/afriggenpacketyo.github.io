          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:03:58 EDT</div>

          <p>Archaeologists have uncovered the earliest known evidence of rice in Remote Oceania, finding 3,500-year-old remnants in Guam. The discovery was made at the Ritidian Site Complex in the form of phytoliths, which are fossilized plant parts, found exclusively on ancient earthenware pottery. This finding suggests the rice was part of specialized cultural rituals within a cave that also contained rare rock art and formal burials. The evidence indicates that the first settlers of Guam successfully transported and cultivated rice after a record-setting ocean migration of over 2,300 kilometers.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny launched a 30-show residency in San Juan, Puerto Rico, with an emotionally charged performance centered on his album “Debí Tirar Más Fotos.” The three-hour concert celebrated Puerto Rican culture and history, urging locals to protect their heritage amidst challenges like gentrification and government neglect. The stage design, featuring a lush hill and a pink vacation home, served as a backdrop for a mix of new hits, older acoustic songs, and high-energy reggaeton. Through poignant video vignettes and direct addresses to the audience, the artist delivered a powerful message of cultural preservation and activism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon has entered the AI-assisted coding space with the launch of Kiro, a new program from its cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Positioned to compete with tools from Google and Microsoft, Kiro is designed to help developers write software with minimal human direction, a process known as "vibe coding." The tool aims to simplify development by using specifications to define requirements and system design before generating code, and it can create diagrams and task lists. Initially available in English and utilizing models from Anthropic, Kiro will be offered in free and premium tiers after its preview period.</p>

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal has publicly criticized a new Bleacher Report ranking that places his late teammate, Kobe Bryant, at number 11 on its list of the top 100 NBA players ever. O'Neal, who was ranked sixth, commented that placing Bryant outside the top 10 is "criminal." The list, which features Michael Jordan and LeBron James in the top spots, has reignited debates among basketball fans. O'Neal has consistently ranked Bryant among the very best, often including him in his personal all-time starting five, reinforcing the deep respect he held for his former Lakers teammate despite their well-documented on-court tensions.</p>

          <p>As the new school year approaches, students face the critical decision between federal and private student loans to cover college costs. The article advises that federal loans are typically the best starting point due to their fixed interest rates, income-driven repayment plans, and forgiveness options, which provide a crucial safety net for borrowers. However, federal loans have strict borrowing limits, often creating a funding gap. Private loans can cover the remaining costs and may offer lower rates for those with good credit, but they lack the flexible protections of federal options, making a balanced approach essential.

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new blue color additive for use in foods and drinks, derived from the fruit of the gardenia flower. The approval was petitioned by the Gardenia Blue Interest Group and marks a step towards using more natural alternatives to synthetic, petroleum-based dyes. This new color can be used in products like sports drinks, candy, and teas. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. praised the decision as a move to protect children's health, aligning with his call to phase out artificial dyes from the U.S. food supply.</p>

          <p>A 20-something woman named Kate called into "The Ramsey Show" for advice, explaining that despite earning $150,000 annually and saving $125,000, her community was pressuring her not to buy a home because she is single. She stated the pressure was rooted in a belief that men should be the providers. Host Dave Ramsey reacted strongly, telling her to "leave the cult" and calling the belief "nuts" and not representative of true Christian faith. Both Ramsey and his co-host encouraged her to ignore the toxic advice, buy the house, and continue her successful path.</p>

          <p>Despite the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), prospective parents with disabilities continue to face significant discrimination from adoption agencies. The article highlights the story of Kelly and Larry Peterson, a married couple who both have spina bifida and were initially rejected by an agency because of their condition. They eventually adopted their daughter, Hadley, who also has spina bifida, believing their shared experience makes them uniquely qualified to care for her. The story underscores how, in practice, equal access is not always guaranteed, even when disabled adults are well-equipped to be parents.</p>

          <p>Calvin Duncan, who was wrongly convicted of murder in 1982 and sentenced to life, has earned his law degree at age 60. While incarcerated for over 28 years at Louisiana's Angola prison, Duncan studied law and became a "jailhouse lawyer," providing legal assistance to hundreds of fellow inmates who could not afford an attorney. With the help of the Innocence Project of New Orleans, he was released in 2011 and later fully exonerated. He has since founded the Light of Justice program to help currently incarcerated people access the courts, fulfilling a promise to help others.</p>
