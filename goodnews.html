          <p>A 21-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of arson with intent to endanger life following fires at two properties linked to Prime Minister Keir Starmer and a car fire. The first fire occurred at a house converted into flats in Islington, while the second took place at Starmer's private home in Kentish Town, causing damage to the entrance. Counter-terrorism police are leading the investigation due to the properties' previous connections with Starmer, who still owns the Kentish Town home but resides at Downing Street. Residents in the area expressed concern and worry about future unwelcome visitations, highlighting the unusual nature of the incidents in their typically quiet neighborhood.</p>

Defenders maintain that the policies were successful in attracting investment and creating jobs, but that the benefits were slow to materialize.
