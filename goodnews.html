        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As GCSE results day approaches, a debate is ongoing among students, parents, and experts about whether cash rewards or gifts effectively motivate teenagers to achieve higher exam grades. While some parents offer financial incentives, believing it encourages more study time, students like Imogen Farmer suggest such rewards might not significantly alter effort if ambition is already present. Psychologists like Natasha Tiwari argue that rewarding effort rather than just grades fosters a more sustainable learning approach, cautioning that large monetary treats risk making achievements feel "transactional." Experts emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation and parental involvement over financial inducements.</p>

          <p>Grants Pass, Oregon, a city recently at the center of a major U.S. Supreme Court homelessness ruling, has settled a lawsuit with Disability Rights Oregon. The city agreed to ensure at least 150 ADA-compliant camping spaces for unhoused individuals for the next 12 months, including access to drinking water and hand-washing stations. Additionally, Grants Pass will provide $60,000 in grant funding to a non-profit for homeless services. This settlement follows the Supreme Court's decision allowing cities to criminalize outdoor sleeping, and addresses the city's previous efforts to restrict camping without adequate alternatives, marking a significant step forward.</p>

          <p>Rainmaker, a weather modification startup backed by Peter Thiel, is actively conducting cloud-seeding operations in south-central Texas, using airplanes to release silver iodide into clouds to increase rainfall.

However, the article notes that Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene is seeking to prevent such weather modification efforts.

On her "Show Me Something" podcast, Cunningham explained that she tore her MCL and is scheduled for surgery, but stressed there was "no ill intent" and it was simply a basketball play. She expressed continued friendship with Hartley and dismissed the interpretation of a photo showing Hartley smiling after the incident, emphasizing her desire for the accusations to cease.</p>

The Sheriff’s Office shared lighthearted photos of the incident, showing the bear peeking over the counter, seemingly interested in strawberry ice cream. With some encouragement, the animal eventually left the premises. The bear caused minimal property damage and required very little cleanup, turning what could have been a problematic situation into a quirky and memorable local news story.</p>

          <p>New robotic technology is significantly enhancing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of solar farm construction, even amidst reduced government support for renewable energy projects. CivDot, a four-wheeled robot developed by California-based Civ Robotics, can precisely mark up to 3,000 layout points daily across challenging terrains, saving considerable time and labor compared to traditional manual surveying. This innovation allows highly paid field engineers to focus on more complex tasks. With over 100 robots deployed, primarily by renewable energy companies, this technology is accelerating project timelines and reducing costs in the expanding solar industry, demonstrating a key advancement in infrastructure development.</p>

          <p>Reverse mortgages, designed to help homeowners aged 62 and older convert home equity into cash without monthly payments, come with stringent eligibility requirements that can disqualify many applicants. Key factors include not meeting the age criteria, especially if a younger spouse is involved, or having insufficient home equity to pay off existing mortgage balances. Property condition, adherence to FHA standards, and specific property type restrictions can also lead to rejection. Furthermore, severe financial events like unresolved bankruptcies or an inability to cover ongoing property taxes and insurance can prevent approval, making careful preparation essential.
