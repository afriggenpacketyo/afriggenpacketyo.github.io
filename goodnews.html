        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a 3% increase in April, marking the second consecutive month of growth despite tariffs imposed by the U.S. This growth follows a 0.8% rise in the first quarter, reversing previous declines. While U.S. tariffs had reached as high as 145%, a trade truce in Geneva led to a reduction, with current tariffs at 51.1% for U.S. goods and 32.6% for Chinese imports. Despite the growth in profits, manufacturing activity fell, and exports to the U.S. declined significantly, though overall exports were boosted by shipments to Southeast Asian nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A House bill proposes cutting in half a significant tax write-off for professional sports team owners, potentially impacting the high valuations and sales prices of teams. The legislation would allow owners to deduct only half the value of intangible assets, such as player contracts and media rights, over 15 years. This tax break, which can amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, has helped fuel the lofty prices that investment firms and billionaires have paid for teams. While the provision would only affect future owners, it could cool demand for teams and potentially hurt current owners' investments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada at the invitation of Prime Minister Mark Carney, a move interpreted as a subtle rebuke to President Trump's threats to Canada's sovereignty. Carney invited Charles to open Canada‚Äôs Parliament to emphasize Canada‚Äôs distinct heritage from the United States. The visit has been seen as a show of support for Canada's independence, with many Canadians expressing the desire to distance themselves from American influence. The King will deliver a speech, written by the prime minister's office, that is expected to assert Canada‚Äôs sovereignty in diplomatic language.</p>
