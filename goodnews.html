          <p>The European Union is set to announce its next steps regarding potential countermeasures against U.S. tariffs, as stated by European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic. While negotiations remain the priority, the EU is preparing for all scenarios in case trade talks fail. The EU has paused its initial retaliatory measures targeting approximately 21 billion euros worth of U.S. goods but is consulting with member states and industry stakeholders to ensure readiness for future actions. Trump had initially imposed tariffs on EU goods but lowered them temporarily to allow for negotiations.</p>

          <p>In his first broadcast interview since leaving the White House, former President Biden criticized President Trump‚Äôs handling of the war in Ukraine and his dealings with global allies. Speaking to the BBC, Biden attacked Trump‚Äôs management of foreign policy, including his combative meeting with President Zelensky of Ukraine. Biden defended the timing of his own withdrawal from the 2024 presidential campaign, despite polling data indicating that many Democrats did not want him to run for a second term. Biden's re-emergence into the public sphere suggests he intends to continue playing a role in the Democratic party, despite some within the party blaming him for their 2024 defeat.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares experienced a significant drop after Apple's services chief, Eddy Cue, indicated that AI search engines might eventually replace traditional search engines like Google. Cue mentioned the possibility of integrating AI services from OpenAI, Perplexity, and Anthropic into Apple's Safari browser. This statement was made during a Justice Department lawsuit against Alphabet, focusing on Google's practice of paying platform providers like Apple to be the default search engine. Cue also noted that searches on Safari declined for the first time in April, which he attributed to the rise of people using AI.</p>

          <p>India's military attack on Pakistan has been named "Operation Sindoor," drawing attention to the cultural significance of sindoor, a vermillion powder worn by married Hindu women. The choice of name has been criticized by some feminists who view it as reinforcing traditional gender roles and patriarchal views. The operation was launched in retaliation for a terrorist attack in Kashmir where many Hindu women lost their husbands, making the name symbolic of avenging the widowed women. However, critics argue that it reduces women to symbols and objects of protection rather than recognizing their individual agency.</p>
