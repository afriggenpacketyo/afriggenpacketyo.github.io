          <p>British Foreign Secretary David Lammy has acknowledged that he fished without the required rod licence during a diplomatic engagement with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at Chevening House. Lammy attributed the incident to an "administrative error" and has since purchased a licence and notified the Environment Agency of the mistake. While the Foreign Secretary did not catch any fish, the oversight could have resulted in a fine of up to £2,500. The Environment Agency confirmed the relevant licences have now been purchased but did not state whether a fine was issued.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a list of 11 individuals to succeed Jerome Powell as the next Federal Reserve Chairman when his term concludes in May. According to sources, the list includes previously unmentioned names like Jefferies' David Zervos and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside known candidates such as Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is said to be leading a "deliberative process" to interview all candidates and narrow the list for the president's final decision. This extensive process suggests a decision is not imminent, potentially avoiding market disruption from a long-term "shadow Fed chair." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A detailed timeline reveals how investigators solved the murders of Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, two young women killed in Phoenix in the early 1990s. The case went cold for over two decades until 2014, when forensic genealogist Colleen Fitzpatrick used public databases to link crime scene DNA to the surname Miller. This led cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf to Bryan Patrick Miller, a man known locally for his "Zombie Hunter" persona. After obtaining Miller's DNA through an undercover sting, investigators confirmed he was the killer, leading to his arrest, trial, and eventual death sentence in 2023.</p>

          <p>An undercover operation at a Chili's restaurant proved crucial in the 2015 capture of Bryan Patrick Miller, the man responsible for the infamous Phoenix "canal murders" of the early 1990s. Cold case detective Clark Schwartzkopf, suspecting Miller but lacking definitive proof, orchestrated a meeting under the guise of a job offer to obtain his DNA. By securing the water glass Miller used during the meal, investigators were able to match his DNA to evidence from the crime scenes of victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas. This breakthrough directly led to the arrest and eventual conviction of Miller, who was sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

          <p>As of August 11, 2025, the price of gold stands at $3,353.44 per ounce, reflecting its status as a valuable commodity and safe-haven asset during times of economic uncertainty. This article explains that the price of gold is influenced by numerous factors, including supply and demand, global economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Because gold is often seen as a hedge against inflation and currency devaluation, its price tends to rise during periods of market volatility. The article notes that while its value can fluctuate in the short term, gold has historically been a reliable store of value for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>FEWS NET, a critical U.S.-funded system designed to predict and prevent famines, is coming back online after being shut down by the Trump administration in January. Created in 1985 in response to the Ethiopian famine, the network provides vital data that allows governments and aid organizations to pre-position food and avert humanitarian crises. Its shutdown created a dangerous information gap, particularly in vulnerable regions like Ethiopia, which is currently on the brink of another major food crisis. While humanitarian experts welcome its return, questions remain about the revived system's budget, scope, and ability to trigger timely action.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Alcohol Consumption Hits Record Low as Health Concerns Rise, Survey Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 11:03:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that alcohol consumption among U.S. adults has fallen to its lowest level on record, with only 54% reporting that they drink. For the first time, a majority of Americans (53%) now view even moderate drinking as harmful to one's health, a significant increase from previous years. This shift in perception is accompanied by a decline in regular drinking, with the average weekly intake dropping to 2.8 drinks, the lowest since 1996. Researchers suggest this trend is driven by growing health warnings and not by a shift to alternatives like recreational cannabis.</p>
