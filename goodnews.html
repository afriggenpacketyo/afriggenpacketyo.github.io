          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen, diagnosed with terminal lung cancer in 2023, has appealed to the House of Lords to pass the Terminally Ill Adults Bill, which would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. The bill has already passed the House of Commons, but faces potential opposition in the Lords, with some peers raising concerns about the potential for coercion of vulnerable individuals. Dame Esther argues that the bill includes rigorous safeguards, ensuring that only those with six months or less to live, who are mentally competent and make a clear, informed choice, would be eligible. The bill requires two declarations, approval from doctors and a multidisciplinary panel, and a reflection period. Optimism surrounding the bill is tempered by the reality of the legislative process.</p>

          <p>Kris Jenner, the matriarch of the Kardashian-Jenner family, has recently sparked speculation about undergoing a deep plane facelift due to her more youthful appearance. While a representative confirmed that Dr. Steven Levine performed the procedure, the specific type was not disclosed. Plastic surgeons suggest that Jenner's natural-looking results indicate a well-executed procedure, potentially involving a deep plane facelift and fat transfer. The deep plane technique involves wider dissection to reset facial tissues, leading to more durable and natural outcomes, though it carries risks such as facial paralysis. The importance of patients openly communicating their medical history and aesthetic goals with their surgeons before undergoing any procedure is emphasized.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has been proactive in building supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth minerals, long before China's recent export restrictions. After experiencing a rare earth export ban from China in 2010, Japan invested heavily in non-China rare-earth projects, notably Australia's Lynas, reducing its dependence on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. This strategic shift, involving stockpiling, recycling, and promoting alternative technologies, has positioned Japan to be more prepared for the current mineral squeeze than many other countries. The situation highlights the challenges and potential strategies for Western nations seeking to diversify their critical mineral supply chains (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The article critiques the current trend of online "feminist critiques" targeting celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae, arguing that these critiques often devolve into puritanical tellings-off rather than meaningful analysis. The author points out the irony of celebrating historical "first" women while criticizing contemporary female figures for their choices, and suggests that these critiques often lack historical context and economic awareness. The article advocates for a more nuanced understanding of women's sexuality and agency, warning against policing feminine expression under the guise of concern for women's safety. It urges critics to consider the complex interplay of capitalism, kink, and choice, rather than resorting to paternalistic chastisement.</p>
