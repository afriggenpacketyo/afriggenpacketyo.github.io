          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has announced a planned partnership between Nippon Steel Corp. and United States Steel Corp., projecting the creation of 70,000 jobs and a $14 billion boost to the U.S. economy. Meanwhile, Japan has stated that its economic importance is becoming more clear to the U.S. in ongoing tariff talks, with both countries aiming for an early trade deal. Separately, families of Japanese abductees have urged North Korea's Kim Jong Un to return their loved ones, and Japan's new farm minister plans to sell government rice at 2,000 yen per 5 kg to combat rising prices. </p>

          <p>A study reveals that UK workers continue to work from home more frequently than most global rivals, averaging 1.8 days a week. Hybrid working patterns have become dominant in advanced economies, especially in English-speaking countries. The popularity of remote work in the UK is attributed to commuting costs and length. Despite some companies mandating a return to the office, home working levels have stabilized, with men and women working from home at similar rates, although women with children show a stronger preference. </p>

          <p>New research suggests that the sensitivity of human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish. Scientists analyzed the anatomy of these ancient fish and found similarities to the teeth of vertebrates, suggesting that the armor allowed them to sense the water around them. The tooth-like scales of shark, skate, and catfish embryos were found to contain nerves. The results of the new research explain why we get toothaches. </p>
