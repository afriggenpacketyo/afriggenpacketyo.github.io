          <p>A 49-year-old convicted felon, Billy Joe Cagle, has been federally charged for threatening to "shoot up" Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. Cagle allegedly made the threats during a FaceTime call, leading to a rapid law enforcement response. He was apprehended at the airport's South Terminal, and an AR-15-style rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition was subsequently discovered in his pickup truck. U.S. Attorney Theodore S. Hertzberg commended the swift action of citizens and law enforcement for preventing a potential tragedy. This article underscores the effectiveness of the "See Something, Say Something" initiative and the serious implications of illegal firearm possession and threats against public safety.</p>

          <p>Samsung and Google have unveiled the Galaxy XR, an AI-powered mixed reality headset, entering the market at $1,800, roughly half the cost of Apple's Vision Pro. This device, a collaboration with Google and Qualcomm, offers an immersive computing experience controlled by hand gestures and voice, heavily integrating Google's Gemini AI assistant. While the Gemini demo showcased impressive capabilities for task organization and information retrieval, the article highlights a significant privacy concern as Gemini operates via cloud processing, requiring user data transmission to Google servers. The Galaxy XR is positioned as an interim step towards future AI glasses, acknowledging the current niche status of immersive headsets and the ongoing shift from metaverse to AI focus in tech.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Overall Exports Rebound in September, But Shipments to U.S. Continue to Fall</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 21:42:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's September exports rebounded by 4.2% year-on-year, primarily fueled by strong growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. Despite a trade deal reducing tariffs, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, continued to decline by 13.3%, particularly in the automotive sector. Semiconductor exports were a significant contributor to the overall growth. The article highlights that the new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, and her administration's policies, including loose monetary policy and fiscal stimulus, are anticipated to weaken the yen and enhance the competitiveness of Japanese goods, positively influencing the benchmark Nikkei 225.

          <p>The UK government has announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills "quicker and easier," with automatic penalties up to £20,000 for minor offenses and simpler punishment for serious ones. Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the plans aim to give the Environment Agency "teeth" to tackle rule-breaking, expecting to raise £50m-£67m annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers. The article highlights past BBC investigations revealing frequent rule breaches and the EA's struggle to act. These changes, including a reduced burden of proof for some offenses, will be open for public consultation.</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Common Myths About Shampoo, Repair, and Scalp Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks four common haircare myths, drawing on expertise from trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker. It clarifies that cold water does not make hair shinier, and no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which require a haircut. The experts also refute the idea that hair can "self-clean," emphasizing the necessity of regular washing to prevent oil and bacteria buildup. Finally, the article advises using dry shampoo sparingly, only once between washes, as overuse can lead to an itchy, flaky scalp. The core message is to prioritize scalp health and simple, consistent care over expensive or trendy fixes.</p>

          <p>La Liga has canceled its controversial plan to stage the Villarreal-Barcelona match in Miami this December, citing "uncertainty" caused by widespread criticism and protests in Spain. The league, which had partnered with promoter Relevent, expressed deep regret, arguing that playing official matches abroad is crucial for global growth and revenue generation amidst competition from other leagues. The decision follows player protests over a lack of transparency and complaints from clubs like Real Madrid, who argued the move would distort competition. Uefa had reluctantly approved the match, but the Spanish football ecosystem's strong opposition ultimately led to the cancellation.</p>
