          <p>Following a bold prediction that the Celtics would win Game 2 against the Knicks, former Celtics legend Paul Pierce was forced to walk 20 miles to the Fox studio after the Celtics lost. Pierce had stated he would walk the distance barefoot in his robe if the Celtics lost, a promise he kept, documenting the journey on Instagram Live. Despite blowing a 20-point lead, the Celtics' loss resulted in Pierce completing his "walk of shame", arriving at the studio in a wheelchair. The Knicks won 91-90, leading to Pierce's long trek.

          <p>The US and UK have agreed to a deal that reduces tariffs imposed during the Trump administration on goods such as cars, steel, and aluminum. The agreement includes reducing import taxes on British cars to 10% for a set number annually and allowing some steel and aluminum into the US tariff-free. While leaders from both countries have hailed the deal as significant, some analysts say it does not substantially alter the terms of trade as they stood before the tariffs. The deal also includes reciprocal access for beef exports, with a quota of 13,000 metric tonnes for UK farmers. Relevant context: This is in reference to the article directly.</p>
