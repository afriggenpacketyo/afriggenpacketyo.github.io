          <h2>Trump Administration Pauses Social Security Benefit Cuts Over Student Loan Defaults</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. This policy change aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes, according to an Education Department spokesperson. The pause provides older student borrowers more time to address their debt and avoid reduced benefit checks. More than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are in default and likely receiving Social Security benefits (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed judge in California has blocked the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants in the Los Angeles area, citing inadequate due process. The ruling applies to migrants in custody in the Central District of California and stems from a case involving a Venezuelan man detained due to his tattoos. The judge determined that the government failed to provide sufficient notice for individuals to challenge their deportation under the act. This decision adds to the complex legal landscape surrounding the Alien Enemies Act, with courts in other states reaching different conclusions.</p>

          <p>Analysts are comparing Pop Mart, the company behind the Labubu character, to Sanrio and its Hello Kitty property, suggesting it could be a new playbook for cultural exports.

          <p>NPR is seeking input from parents about the songs they sing to their babies, following a Yale University study indicating that singing lifts infants' moods and improves their overall well-being. The study found that babies who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day. Parents are encouraged to share the songs they use to calm or bring joy to their babies, with the possibility of their submissions being featured on Morning Edition. Researchers emphasize that any song, including non-traditional lullabies, can be beneficial.</p>

          <p>The Broadway play "John Proctor Is the Villain," set in a high school during the MeToo movement, has been eliciting intense emotional responses from audiences, particularly women. The play, which revolves around an honors English class studying Arthur Miller's "The Crucible," explores themes of feminism, accusation, and the complexities of the MeToo era. The play transports viewers back to a time when MeToo felt alive with possibility. The play's power lies in its ability to evoke catharsis and prompt reflection on the current state of gender dynamics.</p>
