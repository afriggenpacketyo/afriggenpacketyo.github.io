          <p>This article addresses and debunks several false claims made by Donald Trump and amplified on social media regarding wind energy. These claims include assertions that windmills are driving whales crazy, killing birds in large numbers, and are not truly green due to recycling issues. The article cites scientific evidence and reports from organizations like NOAA Fisheries and the US Fish & Wildlife Service to counter these claims. It clarifies that while some negative impacts exist, they are often exaggerated or overshadowed by other factors and that the wind energy industry is actively working to mitigate them.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the concept of time limits on federal rental aid, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit. The Delaware program also includes a work requirement and financial counseling, helping recipients save money through flat monthly payments and interest-bearing savings accounts. While some experts support time limits to encourage turnover and upward mobility, others argue there's little evidence they boost employment or help people move off subsidies, citing a failed experiment in Washington state. The article highlights the importance of support services and financial incentives in making time limits effective.</p>

          <p>China's liquor industry is experiencing a shift as Gen Z consumers opt for lighter, fruit-flavored beverages over traditional baijiu. Farmers in Baisha, known for its liquor production, are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum grain. This trend reflects a broader change in alcohol consumption, with younger generations prioritizing personal experiences over social rituals.

          <p>This article discusses how fees on forgotten 401(k) accounts can significantly reduce retirement savings. Former employees who leave their 401(k) with their previous employer may be charged maintenance fees that erode their balance over time. While rolling over funds into an IRA is an option, it can also come with higher investment fees. The Department of Labor has created a database to help workers find lost retirement plans, and updating contact information can also help reconnect individuals with their accounts (not investment advice).</p>
