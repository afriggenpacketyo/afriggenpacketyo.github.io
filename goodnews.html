          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Emerges as Top Approach for Raising Resilient Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting framework called emotionally safe parenting emphasizes attunement to a child's emotional needs, promoting resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. This approach involves accepting a child's emotions without rushing to fix them, responding without shaming, and viewing "bad" behavior as stress signals rather than defiance. Emotionally safe parents take responsibility after conflicts, do internal work to become less reactive, and create an environment where their child feels safe expressing themselves, ultimately leading with calm authority and compassion.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul won his first-round match at the French Open after dealing with the recent repossession of his truck due to missed payments. Paul said that he missed three payments after changing banks and forgot to properly adjust the automatic payments for his Ford F-150, and that his trainer discovered the vehicle was missing when he was asked to check his security camera footage to see whether there were any packages that needed to be picked up. After figuring out what had happened, Paul posted the black-and-white footage of his truck being towed away, adding a soundtrack of Celine Dion‚Äôs My Heart Will Go On.</p>

          <h2>Cramer Weighs in on US vs European Stocks Amid Market Shifts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jim Cramer and his team are addressing the question of whether U.S. stocks are bad investments compared to European and Chinese stocks, particularly given recent market underperformance and trade tensions. While Germany's Dax index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, analysts emphasize the long-term strength and unique merits of the U.S. stock market, including its size and the international exposure of many S&P 500 companies. Cramer advocates for a constructive approach, suggesting investors focus on domestic companies with pricing power and the ability to thrive in a slowdown, rather than selling American equities altogether.

          <p>Julie Moore, an Army spouse, is remembered for her efforts to change military protocol regarding casualty notifications, ensuring that families receive in-person notification and support following the death of a service member. Her advocacy stemmed from her own experience and a desire to prevent others from receiving news of their loved one's death via telegram. Her efforts led to a lasting impact on how the military cares for grieving families, with service members now providing personal support and guidance during the difficult time, and is now honored at the military base that was re-named after her and her husband.</p>
