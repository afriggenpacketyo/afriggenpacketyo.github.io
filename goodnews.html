          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food costs, cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly higher than the 3% forecast by economists but down from the previous month. This moderation was partly driven by an easing in rice prices, which had previously skyrocketed. The data comes as the Bank of Japan closely monitors inflation trends to guide its monetary policy, having recently upgraded its inflation forecasts amid signs of economic growth supported by exports.

          <p>A fourth-generation Texas cotton farmer, facing mounting debt from years of poor harvests, has found significant financial success by shifting to solar grazing. Instead of farming crops, he now rents out his flock of sheep to graze on vegetation at large-scale solar farms, effectively acting as natural lawn mowers. This innovative business model has proven highly profitable, turning substantial losses from traditional farming into a six-figure profit and creating a sustainable enterprise he can pass on to his sons.</p>

          <p>The UK government has released new guidelines directing baby food manufacturers to reduce the levels of sugar and salt in their products. The guidance also calls for an end to marketing snacks to infants under one year old and restricts the use of health claims that are not scientifically proven. Companies have been given an 18-month grace period to comply with these voluntary standards, after which the government may consider alternative measures if the industry fails to improve its products.</p>

          <p>Bill Simon, the former CEO of Walmart U.S., expressed his bewilderment at the market's negative reaction to the company's recent earnings report.

          <p>In response to crippling price wars in key sectors like solar panel manufacturing, China is moving to amend its primary pricing law for the first time since 1998. The proposed revision aims to combat what is known as "involution," a form of hyper-competition where companies aggressively slash prices, often selling at a loss, to drive out rivals. The goal of the new regulation is to establish a more sustainable and orderly market equilibrium by preventing such destructive competitive practices.</p>
