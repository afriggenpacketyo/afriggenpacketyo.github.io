          <p>Amid Middle East conflict and macro uncertainty, analysts suggest focusing on stocks with solid growth prospects. Chewy (CHWY) is favored due to strong execution and active customer growth; analysts expect profitability to ramp up. Pinterest (PINS) is highlighted for its partnership with Instacart, which could drive incremental ad spending and improve ad performance. These partnerships are expected to create more precise ad campaign insights and performance tracking for the brands involved. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Analysts believe that despite the U.S.'s direct involvement in the Israel-Iran conflict, the long-term strategic focus will remain on containing China in the Indo-Pacific region. While the U.S. has repositioned some forces, including canceling a port call in Vietnam, Washington has repeatedly affirmed its commitment to prioritizing resources in the Indo-Pacific. Observers note that the U.S. has pledged to keep the main focus of strategic resources on China. The redeployment of assets to the Middle East is viewed as a short-term distraction rather than a fundamental shift in strategy.</p>

          <p>An Altoona warehouse is providing Iowa importers with temporary respite from tariff volatility by offering bonded warehousing space. This allows importers to hold goods duty-free until they are ready to go to market, improving cash flow and cost certainty. Bonded warehouses, overseen by the U.S. Port Authority, are gaining popularity as companies seek to manage trade policy uncertainty. The warehouse is believed to be the first of its kind in the Des Moines metro area.</p>

          <h2>Baseball's Lessons in Failure: Grace and Imperfection</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reflects on baseball's unique acceptance of failure and the importance of embracing imperfection. It uses the example of Clayton Kershaw's dominant no-hitter marred by a single error to illustrate that dwelling on errors leads to disappointment, while accepting imperfections defines success. The author contrasts this with Lou Gehrig's response to his terminal illness, highlighting his grace and humility in the face of loss. The article suggests that learning to accept failure is essential for personal growth and resilience.</p>
