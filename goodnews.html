        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its disbandment after 41 years of armed conflict with the Turkish state, a decision met with both celebration and uncertainty. Political experts suggest this move could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape, requiring parties to adapt their programs. The pro-Kurdish DEM party may see considerable changes, particularly regarding the release of jailed politicians. The article also addresses concerns about the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential impact on neighboring countries, specifically Syria and its Kurdish factions. Optimism surrounding the group's dissolution is tempered by internal resistance and the need for broader constitutional reforms within Turkey.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economy is experiencing a boom driven by pharmaceutical exports, particularly Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Ozempic. The IMF expects Denmark's growth to moderate in the coming years but believes the country is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports. This is due to Danish drugmakers relying on a 'merchanting and processing' system where manufacturing is contracted to other countries. The IMF notes that heightened trade tensions pose risks but the direct impact of U.S. tariffs on the Danish economy is limited.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited U.S. troops at Qatar's al-Udeid Air Base, a central hub for American involvement in the Middle East, signaling a shift away from interventionist policies. Trump praised Gulf nations as models for economic development and announced plans to recognize the Syrian government and ease sanctions. He also lauded Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former insurgent, contrasting with previous U.S. policy. The Qatari base houses 8,000 U.S. troops and has been significantly developed with Qatari investment.

          <p>The Japanese government is considering releasing 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months to address near-record high rice prices. This action supplements the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The rice shortage is partly due to a poor harvest in 2023 and increased consumption from foreign tourists. Lawmakers are also considering relaxing the buyback requirement to encourage more distributors to participate in auctions, aiming to stabilize rice prices and ensure adequate supply.</p>

          <p>The New York Times analyzes the elements of a successful Eurovision song, suggesting that a track about personal liberation sung in English with folk music allusions can increase a contestant's chances of winning. The article uses examples like Conchita Wurst's 'Rise Like a Phoenix' and Ruslana's 'Wild Dances' to illustrate the importance of themes of self-belief and empowerment. It also advises against dramatic key changes and stresses the need for memorable staging, including pyrotechnics, while warning against novelty acts. By blending traditional sounds with a pop chorus and delivering a visually stunning performance, artists can capture the hearts of Eurovision viewers.</p>

          <h2>China to Establish Market Stabilisation Fund</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 00:00:13 EDT</div>

          <p>China is establishing a market stabilisation fund to maintain stability in uncertain economic times caused by trade turmoil. The fund will help reduce market volatility and protect investors' interests. China's strong economy and large foreign exchange reserves make it possible to set up the fund. Similar mechanisms have been tested by major economies, including Hong Kong's interventions during the 1997 Asian financial crisis. The announcement follows face-to-face trade talks between Chinese and US officials.</p>

          <p>Japan's antitrust watchdog is implementing a law to prevent Google and Apple from blocking app store competitors. The law aims to promote competition from smaller firms and address the dominance of the tech giants. It will also prohibit the firms from using data obtained from their app stores in their own products. The commission hopes the changes will reduce prices and improve access to convenient apps for consumers.</p>
