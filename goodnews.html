          <p>Federal authorities have charged a 22-year-old Oregon man, Ethan Foltz, for allegedly creating and operating a powerful botnet known as "Rapper Bot." This network of malware-infected devices, including routers and DVRs, was reportedly used to launch large-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks for paying customers since 2021. Prosecutors describe the botnet as one of the most sophisticated of its kind, capable of overwhelming websites and government networks in over 80 countries. Law enforcement dismantled the network after a search of Foltz's home, and he now faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted.</p>

          <p>Home Depot's stock rose by 3% after the company maintained its full-year financial forecast, despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The home improvement retailer anticipates total sales growth of 2.8% for the year, signaling stability to investors. While the company noted that homeowners still show a "deferral mindset" due to economic uncertainty, it also saw encouraging signs, such as a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000. This performance suggests resilience in a challenging market, even as the broader real estate sector remains sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following electoral setbacks, some Democratic Party elites are exploring "abundance liberalism" as a new guiding philosophy to inspire voters. This ideology, popularized by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, advocates for streamlining bureaucracy to aggressively build more housing, clean energy infrastructure, and other public goods. The goal is to shift from a liberalism of regulation and constraint to one focused on tangible growth and development. However, the article notes that this vision faces significant political hurdles, particularly in suburban areas where policies promoting dense development can be unpopular with existing homeowners.</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit in Argentina as a car manufacturer, signaling potential plans to establish production in the country. The legal filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina SAU to manufacture, import, and sell vehicles, batteries, and auto parts. While the company has not formally announced a factory, this move aligns with its broader regional expansion strategy in Latin America, which includes a major project in Brazil. If realized, an Argentine plant would mark BYD's second vehicle factory in the region and a significant investment in South America's auto market.</p>

          <p>Restaurant chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are heavily investing in new beverage offerings to attract customers, particularly younger consumers. The number of drink options at top chains has grown over 9%, with a strong emphasis on customized cold beverages, specialty coffees, and energy drinks. This strategic shift comes as data shows consumers are increasingly making trips specifically for a "pick-me-up" drink rather than as an add-on to a meal. With customer traffic under pressure, companies see the higher-margin beverage category as a key opportunity to boost sales and profitability in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly evaluating a new, more powerful artificial intelligence chip for the Chinese market, tentatively named the B30A and based on its latest Blackwell architecture. This development follows a recent agreement where Nvidia and AMD were granted permission to resume selling chips in China in exchange for giving the U.S. government a 15% cut of their sales. The potential new chip comes after the Trump administration halted advanced chip sales to China over national security concerns, which had previously led Nvidia to develop a less powerful, compliant chip. The move highlights the company's continuous effort to navigate U.S. export controls. (not investment advice)</p>
