        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $1.7 billion for the upcoming Saturday drawing, after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This massive sum, which has an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, would rank as the third-largest lottery prize in U.S. history. The current sequence of 41 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner ties a game record, making Saturday's drawing the 42nd attempt to find a victor. Potential winners can opt for an annuity paid over 30 years or a single lump sum payment, facing daunting odds of 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally saw gains on Thursday, tracking an overnight tech sector rally on Wall Street that positively impacted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic concerns persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 advanced significantly, propelled by domestic technology companies, although Nidec Corp experienced a sharp decline following allegations of improper accounting. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also rose, buoyed by stronger-than-expected household spending figures for July. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines amidst volatile trading, while global bond yields, including U.S. 30-year Treasuries, remained elevated due to wider fiscal anxieties and a recent court decision regarding Trump's tariffs.</p>

This journey marks the furthest the men's national team has traveled for a qualifier, yet the distance has only heightened its appeal for the "Red Wall" supporters. Fans described the locals as incredibly welcoming and highlighted the camaraderie of traveling to unexpected destinations to support their team. While players focus on the match, supporters like John McAllister, who traveled through 12 countries by train and bus, are enjoying the extensive tourism opportunities in Central Asia.</p>

The rule, championed by Martha Mills' parents after her death from sepsis due to care failings, aims to foster a more equal doctor-patient relationship and empowers staff to request independent reviews.

          <p>A new survey by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre indicates that the Chinese public holds more nuanced and flexible views on U.S. rivalry and international alliances than Americans typically perceive. While Chinese respondents are optimistic about their nation's future, economy, and military, a plurality (48%) expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" globally, implying a desire for peaceful coexistence with the United States and the West. Experts suggest these findings could open avenues to reduce U.S.-China tensions, though authors cautioned that self-censorship might have influenced some responses.

          <p>A U.S. federal court judge has overturned the Trump administration's decision to cut billions in research funding to Harvard University, ruling that the government violated the Ivy League institution's free speech rights. Judge Allison Burroughs blocked further funding stoppages and withheld payments, though the White House vowed to appeal, calling the judge an "activist." The Trump administration had frozen funding, accusing Harvard of antisemitism, "radical left" ideologies, and racial bias, claims which the judge suggested were a "smokescreen" for an ideologically motivated assault on universities. Harvard's president welcomed the ruling, affirming the university's First Amendment and procedural rights.</p>

Twenty participants from eight Southeast Asian nations are attending the 14-day workshop in Beijing, covering topics like safety management, airworthiness certification, and new technologies related to Chinese large aircraft. This initiative comes as Southeast Asia leads the world in accepting Chinese aircraft deliveries, despite the market dominance of Airbus and Boeing. Experts suggest this is a strategic move by China to "break the duopoly" and deepen economic cooperation within the region, leveraging its nine-year-old C909 regional jets which have already made significant passenger trips.</p>

Sununu stated he would make a decision by the end of next month, aiming to appeal broadly across the political spectrum, including seeking support from President Trump.

          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, looted by Nazis during World War Two, has been recovered in Argentina after being missing since 1945. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose collection was seized by the Nazis after his death in 1940. The painting was discovered last month when Dutch journalists spotted it in an online real estate listing in Mar del Plata, belonging to the daughter of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien, who escaped to Argentina. Police raids followed, and the painting was handed over, leading to house arrest and charges for Kadgien's daughter and her husband.</p>

The "Great Jeans" ad featuring Sweeney sparked debate, with some critics interpreting it as a play on eugenics, but American Eagle maintained it referred only to denim.
