          <h2>Novo Nordisk Adjusts 2025 Forecast Due to Wegovy Competition</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 02:35:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk reported a rise in first-quarter net profit, but the company has lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to weaker demand for its Wegovy weight loss drug. Sales of Wegovy rose 83% annually, but fell slightly short of analysts' expectations, while sales of Ozempic beat forecasts. The company now anticipates sales growth of 13% to 21% for 2025, a decrease from the previously predicted 16% to 24%. This adjustment reflects the impact of increased competition from copycat compounders in the weight loss drug market. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the U.S. administration expresses skepticism towards trade deals, other countries are actively pursuing bilateral agreements to strengthen economic ties. The U.K. and India have agreed on a trade agreement to eliminate tariffs, while ASEAN and China are negotiating improvements to their free-trade agreement. This comes as the U.S. Treasury Secretary claims to be close to some deals and the newly elected Canadian Prime Minister met with the U.S. President, but the growing protectionism of the U.S. may ironically help other countries forge closer economic ties with each other, potentially bypassing the U.S.</p>

          <p>A new bill is being introduced to Parliament that would allow judges to add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. The move is intended to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions and to provide a moment of recognition and reparation for victims' families. While some argue that the additional jail time may not be a significant deterrent for those facing lengthy sentences, others suggest restricting family visits and parole eligibility as alternative options.</p>

          <p>Finley, a 14-year-old from Essex, suffers from a rare digestive condition that prevents him from eating food due to an intolerance of lipids, causing internal bleeding.

Finley's case is so rare that doctors are considering presenting it to a medical journal. Despite his condition, Finley maintains a positive outlook and participates in cooking and restaurant outings with his family, and is planning to abseil down a tower block to raise money for the hospital that provides his care.</p>
