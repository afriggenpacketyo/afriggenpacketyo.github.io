        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has announced that its nonprofit arm will retain control of the company as it restructures into a public benefit corporation, a decision influenced by civic leaders and former employees. This move comes after discussions with the attorneys general of California and Delaware, and aims to ensure the company's mission remains consistent despite commercialization efforts. CEO Sam Altman expressed satisfaction with the decision, emphasizing the alignment of the nonprofit and PBC missions, but the company is currently engaged in a legal dispute with Elon Musk, who opposes the conversion to a for-profit structure. Musk is attempting to keep OpenAI from converting into a for-profit company as he competes in the generative AI market with his own startup, xAI.</p>

          <p>This article explains how to qualify for a debt management program, which helps consolidate unsecured debts into a single monthly payment with potentially lower interest rates. Key qualifications include having eligible types of unsecured debt (like credit cards or personal loans), sufficient income to make the monthly payment, a meaningful level of debt, and a willingness to close existing credit card accounts.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump claimed gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, while the national average is over $3. Sources suggest Trump is referencing RBOB gasoline futures, which did briefly touch $1.98 per gallon, but this contract does not reflect what consumers pay at the pump. RBOB tracks wholesale, unfinished gasoline before taxes, transportation, and other costs are added, making it irrelevant to consumers. Experts emphasize that the RBOB price excludes taxes, tariffs, transportation costs, and credit card fees, meaning it does not accurately reflect what drivers pay at the pump.</p>

          <p>General Motors has been engaged in a decade-long effort to revive Cadillac as the quintessential American luxury car brand, focusing on all-electric vehicles, sporty sedans, and the Escalade. GM President Mark Reuss has played a key role in this transformation, aiming to regain Cadillac's prominence amid competition from brands like BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Tesla. The strategy involves isolating Cadillac's products from GM's other brands and prioritizing value over volume, with the all-electric Celestiq serving as the pinnacle of this plan.

          <h2>The Rehearsal Explores the Limits of Sincerity and Comedy</h2>

          <p>This article discusses HBO's *The Rehearsal* and how, in its second season, the show has evolved to explore the limits of sincerity and comedy, specifically for comedian Nathan Fielder. Fielder stages elaborate exercises to help people prepare for challenging interactions, but the show often shifts its focus to Fielder himself and his personal fixations. The author posits that Fielder is questioning whether he can assist people without mocking them and whether true sincerity is possible for someone known for anything but, which results in a surreal interrogation of comedy, disaster prevention, and an existential crisis.</p>
