          <p>According to sources, President Trump is expected to announce the relocation of the U.S. Space Command headquarters from its current base in Colorado to a new facility in Alabama. This decision follows a lengthy review process involving multiple states competing to host the strategic military command.

          <p>Authorities in La Salle County, Texas, have arrested a 66-year-old man for the 2005 murder of Valerie Laguna, who was nine months pregnant when she was killed. Laguna's body was discovered in a cemetery, with the cause of death determined to be blunt force trauma. The case remained unsolved for two decades until advanced forensic investigation techniques linked the suspect, Saul Gonzalez, to the crime. The local sheriff's office emphasized their persistent efforts over the years, stating the arrest marks a significant step toward justice and healing for the victim's family and the community.</p>

As both nations face economic pressure and tariffs from the United States, they are seeking to strengthen their partnership. During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, the two countries signed over 20 cooperation agreements covering sectors like energy, aerospace, and agriculture. Russia's demand for consumer goods and machinery, which are harder to source from the West due to sanctions, aligns with China's manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a 78-year-old Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Nadler stated that his decision was influenced by the recent presidential election cycle, which highlighted the necessity for a generational shift within the Democratic Party. As the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee, he played a key role in both of Donald Trump's impeachments. His retirement is expected to open up a competitive primary for his safe Democratic seat, which covers parts of Manhattan.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, a member of the London Assembly, has won the Green Party leadership election in the UK, defeating two of the party's sitting Members of Parliament. Running on a platform of bold communication and "eco-populism," Polanski aims to adopt a more confrontational style and shift the party further to the left. He has declared his intention to challenge the Labour Party directly, stating, "We are here to replace you." His victory signals a potential new direction for the Greens, focusing on connecting with voters on an emotional level and possibly collaborating with other left-wing movements.</p>

The drones blast a variety of sounds, including AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," scenes from films like "Marriage Story," and live human voices, to haze the predators. This nonlethal method, developed by the USDA, is part of a growing number of creative strategies to manage the conflict between ranchers and the recovering wolf population. The technique leverages the wolves' fear of novel and unexpected noises to interrupt potential livestock attacks.</p>

Experts emphasize the importance of not locking up too much cash in long-term CDs to maintain liquidity for unexpected expenses, especially given current inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

With new and higher deductions for 2025, individuals with taxable income below $48,350 (or $96,700 for joint filers) can sell appreciated assets without paying taxes on the profits. This allows for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting" during lower-income years or resetting an asset's cost basis to reduce future tax liabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark U.S. case, an identical twin has been convicted of a crime using advanced DNA analysis that can distinguish between twins. Russell Marubbio was found guilty of a sexual assault that occurred in Virginia in 1987 after forensic scientists identified minute, acquired mutations in the DNA. Standard DNA tests are typically inconclusive for identical twins, but Parabon NanoLabs used whole-genome sequencing to find subtle genetic differences between Marubbio and his brother. This pioneering technique, which successfully identified the perpetrator from a 37-year-old crime scene sample, was admitted as evidence in a U.S. court for the first time.</p>
