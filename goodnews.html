          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of Pepsi Prebiotic Cola, a new beverage aimed at health-conscious consumers. The drink, available this fall, will feature three grams of prebiotic fiber, five grams of cane sugar, and contain 30 calories per serving. This move follows PepsiCo's recent acquisition of the popular prebiotic soda brand Poppi and reflects a broader industry trend toward functional, gut-healthy beverages. The company is also reformulating other products and introducing protein-enhanced snacks to adapt to shifting consumer preferences for healthier options.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has appointed former Home Secretary Sir James Cleverly as the new shadow housing secretary in a significant reshuffle of her top team. This move marks Cleverly's return to the front bench and positions him to challenge Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner. The reshuffle included several other changes, such as Richard Holden becoming shadow transport secretary and Stuart Andrew taking the shadow health secretary role. Badenoch stated the changes were an opportunity to bring back experienced figures to strengthen the party's opposition front bench.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams made a successful return to the court after a 16-month absence, winning a doubles match with partner Hailey Baptiste at the D.C. Open. The 45-year-old, who underwent a procedure last year to remove uterine fibroids, expressed joy at being able to play again, stating her health has given her a new perspective on her career. Williams humorously joked that her former doubles partner, sister Serena, had been "in the way" of her new partnership's success. She is also scheduled to compete in the singles tournament, marking a significant comeback for the seven-time major champion.</p>

          <p>U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers at Los Angeles International Airport discovered and seized nearly 300 pounds of methamphetamine cleverly concealed within fake solar panels. The shipment was destined for New Zealand and was intercepted before it could be exported. This seizure is the latest in a series of creative smuggling attempts thwarted by LAX security, which have previously included drugs disguised as dog shampoo and hidden in soaked clothing. The agency highlighted the incident as another example of their daily efforts to combat sophisticated drug trafficking operations.</p>

          <p>For the first time in eight years, the number of Americans engaged in side hustles has decreased, according to a new Bankrate survey. The report found that 27% of working Americans have a second income stream, down from 36% in 2024, marking the lowest percentage since 2017. Analysts attribute this decline to a solid job market and wage growth that has outpaced inflation, allowing people to feel less economic anxiety. This contrasts with the post-pandemic peak, when many relied on side gigs to cover essential living expenses amid record-high inflation.</p>

The signing is seen as a crucial move for manager Mikel Arteta, who has been keen to add an elite center-forward to his squad.</p>
