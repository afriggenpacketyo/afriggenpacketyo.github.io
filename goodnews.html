          <p>Owen Farrell is set to captain the British and Irish Lions for their upcoming match in Melbourne, marking his first start of the tour. The team lineup for this game does not include any players from the first-Test victory against Australia, instead featuring a mix of other squad members, including nine Scots. This match serves as an opportunity for players on the fringe of the Test team to make their case for selection in the upcoming second Test. The opposing team is a special XV celebrating First Nations and Pacific Islands heritage.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial analysts are increasingly viewing the Singapore dollar (SGD) as a "quasi safe-haven" currency, particularly within Asia, due to Singapore's strong institutional framework and stable policymaking. While it exhibits defensive qualities during financial stress, its global status is not yet comparable to traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, or Swiss franc. Hurdles to achieving this status include the relatively small size of the SGD market and the managed nature of its monetary policy, which limits liquidity. Experts suggest it could become the "Swiss franc of Asia" over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 01:07:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new 'Superman' movie directed by James Gunn continued its strong box office performance, earning $57.3 million in North America during its second weekend and remaining the number one film. The movie experienced a standard 54% drop from its opening weekend and has now grossed over $406.8 million globally. This success is a positive start for DC Studios' plan to reboot its cinematic universe, with the film's profitability seen as crucial for the studio's long-term strategy. The overall summer box office for 2025 is reportedly up significantly compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Despite years of U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese tech giant Huawei has transformed into a major force across the entire artificial intelligence landscape. The company has expanded beyond its telecom roots into sectors like AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to U.S. firms like Nvidia. U.S. sanctions inadvertently spurred Huawei to become a national champion in China's tech race, receiving state backing for its AI ambitions. The company is now developing a full suite of AI hardware and software, including its Ascend chips and Pangu industry-specific models.</p>

          <p>The struggling Chinese rust-belt city of Hegang, located in the northeast, is investing in a new airport as part of a strategy to revive its declining economy. The city has faced years of industrial decline and a shrinking population, which has fallen from 1.1 million to 850,000. The Luobei Airport, backed by a 1.2 billion yuan investment, is scheduled to open in 2027 and is expected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually. This infrastructure project is seen as a key effort to improve connectivity and attract new opportunities, particularly through increased trade with nearby Russia.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the United States to face federal charges of drug and arms trafficking. Fito, the leader of the Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after escaping from a high-security prison where he was serving a 34-year sentence. His gang is linked to powerful international criminal organizations and is blamed for much of the escalating violence in Ecuador. The extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadoreans voted to allow citizens to be sent abroad to face trial, a key policy of President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on crime.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a common hormonal disorder, are reporting significant improvements in their symptoms after using GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy. While not an approved use, the drugs appear to help with issues beyond weight loss, such as regulating menstrual cycles, reducing hair loss, and improving mental health. Researchers believe the benefits are linked to the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity, which in turn can help balance hormone levels. However, experts stress the need for larger clinical trials and note that high costs and limited insurance coverage remain major barriers for patients.</p>

          <p>Contrary to concerns about an upcoming tariff deadline, market analyst Jim Cramer argues that numerous positive factors are currently supporting the stock market. He points to a strong earnings season, pro-business tax relief and deductions in the "big beautiful bill," and massive investment in data centers and the electrical grid. Other tailwinds include a potential U.S. energy renaissance, a resurgent IPO market, and increased M&A activity. Cramer suggests these elements create a pro-growth environment that could lead to economic expansion, even if President Trump's actions on trade create volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

He predicts that quantum computing will cross a "usefulness" threshold within the next five years, transitioning from a niche technology to one with broader practical applications. Founded in 2018, Shenzhen-based SpinQ develops both small-scale quantum computers for educational purposes and more powerful industrial-grade systems. Xiang compares the current state of quantum technology to the pivotal era of semiconductors in the 1950s, just before the advent of integrated circuits transformed computing.</p>
