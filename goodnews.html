          <p>A trove of secret Nazi documents seized during World War II was accidentally discovered in the basement of Argentina's Supreme Court. The documents, intended to propagate Nazi ideology in Argentina, arrived from the German embassy in Tokyo in 1941. The contents include Nazi propaganda, postcards, photographs, and notebooks from the National Socialist German Workers' Party Organization Abroad and the German Trade Union. The documents will be scanned, digitized, and reviewed to uncover information about the Holocaust and the "global Nazi money trail."</p>

          <p>President Trump endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican candidate for New Jersey governor, solidifying his position in the upcoming primary. Ciattarelli, who narrowly lost to the Democratic governor in 2021, has openly courted Trump's support after initially distancing himself. The endorsement could be a liability in the general election, as New Jersey leans left and Trump remains a polarizing figure in the state. Democrats are also engaged in a competitive primary, and the race is expected to be closely contested, given Trump's improved performance in New Jersey in the November election.</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber criticized the Trump administration's actions against the school in a letter to Education Secretary Linda McMahon, defending the university's commitment to ending antisemitism and fostering intellectual diversity. Garber argued that the federal government's overreach threatens the constitutional freedoms of private universities. This response follows McMahon's letter stating Harvard is ineligible for federal grants due to its handling of antisemitism on campus. The Trump administration has frozen $2.2 billion in funding and threatened to revoke Harvard's tax-exempt status, which Garber has pushed back on.</p>

          <p>Edan Alexander, a US-Israeli hostage, was released by Hamas after being held captive in Gaza for 19 months, with Israel pausing its military operations to facilitate the transfer. A Hamas official stated that the release was a goodwill gesture aimed at reaching a ceasefire deal before President Trump's visit to the Middle East. Trump congratulated the family on the release, which was made possible by military and political pressure on Hamas. The release is intended to facilitate a deal for the entry of humanitarian aid into the enclave.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs for 90 days, leading to a surge in stock prices. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both saw significant gains, with tech companies particularly benefiting. Starting May 14, both countries will lower tariffs, bringing the U.S. tariff on Chinese imports down to 30% and China's rate on American goods down to 10%. While investors cheered the agreement, they also warned that the market rally could falter as the end of the tariff pause approaches in August, and the value of the dollar climbed against other major currencies.</p>

          <p>A new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark airport after a telecommunications line failed again. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy blamed the Biden administration for not properly equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, where Newark's air traffic controllers had been moved. The FAA will meet with airlines to discuss extending traffic limits into the summer. A spokesperson for former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg defended the Biden administration's efforts to bolster air traffic controller hiring and address infrastructure problems.</p>

          <p>Hollywood figures, including Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, joined labor unions and major studios in urging President Trump to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions. In a letter to Trump, the studios and unions thanked him for supporting the industry through domestic production. The letter calls for Trump to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill, which they argue would make America more competitive and bring jobs back to the country. There is no mention of Trump's tariff proposal on foreign film production, which sparked outcry in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>Chinese officials, influencers and state-run media were casting the initial trade agreement and 90-day tariff pause with the U.S. as a victory and a vindication of Beijing's negotiating strategy. They are arguing that their defiant public posture worked and was a major reason they were able to strike a deal with U.S. officials in Switzerland with relatively few concessions. China's firm countermeasures and resolute stance have been highly effective. The 90-day pause drops U.S. import duties from 145% to 30% on Chinese goods, and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%.</p>

          <p>Teachers are calling on the Scottish government to urgently publish new guidance on how schools should deal with single-sex spaces. The Scottish Secondary Teachers Association (SSTA) said ministers need to provide clarity following the UK Supreme Court's landmark ruling over the definition of a woman. The union says schools "don't have the luxury of waiting for updated guidance" because the ruling means they are required to comply with the Equality Act now. Trans people are still protected by the Equality Act, and Lord Hodge stressed there were other defences against direct and indirect discrimination and harassment.</p>
