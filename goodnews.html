          <h2>Number of Individuals Missing After Texas Floods Substantially Decreases in Kerr County</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 00:02:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Kerr County, Texas, the number of people reported missing following severe floods earlier this month has dropped from nearly 100 to just three. Officials attribute the significant reduction to diligent follow-up work by local and state agencies, which verified that most individuals were safe. The devastating July 4 floods resulted in a statewide death toll of 134, with 107 of those fatalities occurring in Kerr County alone. The update provides a measure of relief amid the ongoing recovery efforts from the widespread natural disaster.</p>

          <p>In a Wisconsin murder case, data from a Fitbit device played a crucial role in clearing the initial suspect and leading investigators to the actual perpetrator. After Nicole Vander Heyden was murdered in 2016, her boyfriend, Doug Detrie, was arrested but later released when his Fitbit data corroborated his alibi, showing minimal movement during the time of the crime. DNA evidence from the scene eventually identified George Steven Burch, a man with no prior connection to the victim, who was tracked by his phone's Google Dashboard data to the crime scenes. Burch was subsequently convicted of the murder and sentenced to life in prison.</p>

          <p>Justin Fulcher, a senior advisor to U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, has resigned from his position at the Pentagon after six months of service. Fulcher stated the decision was his own and that he had always planned to serve for that duration, describing his departure as amicable. During his tenure, he contributed to reviews of major acquisition programs, helped streamline IT procurement, and supported efforts to redirect funds toward military readiness. His departure is part of a broader series of personnel changes within Hegseth's office, which defense officials have characterized as standard transitions.</p>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game wore warmup shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us" to protest the lack of progress in negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA). The players, who opted out of their previous CBA, are seeking a better revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and improved benefits. After a recent meeting failed to produce an agreement, players have expressed frustration with the league's offers, with some mentioning a potential walkout if a new deal is not reached by October.</p>

          <p>UK Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has announced plans for a new criminal offense to target individuals preparing for mass killings, even if they lack a specific terrorist ideology. The proposed legislation aims to close a legal gap highlighted by cases like the Southport attack, where plotters could not be charged with serious offenses before acting. This new power would allow police to intervene and apprehend suspects for preparatory actions, such as researching targets, mirroring existing counter-terrorism laws. The move is intended to address the growing threat from lone, violence-obsessed individuals radicalized online.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during her concert in San Francisco when a mechanical butterfly prop she was riding malfunctioned mid-air.

After the song, Perry humorously commented, "Not today, Satan," acknowledging the brief scare. The incident is one of several recent technical malfunctions involving artists using complex aerial systems during live shows.</p>

          <p>Travelers at Edinburgh Airport are increasingly avoiding the official drop-off zone to evade fees that can reach £6 for a ten-minute stay. Drivers are instead waiting in nearby lay-bys and on side streets, coordinating with arriving passengers by phone to arrange a quick pickup and avoid the charges. This behavior highlights public frustration with rising "kiss-and-fly" fees, which have increased at more than half of the UK's busiest airports in the last year. Critics call the charges "extortionate" and "greedy," especially for those with mobility issues who cannot use the distant free drop-off area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The traditional six-week summer holiday for schools in the UK is the subject of a growing debate, with arguments for and against shortening the break. Proponents suggest a shorter holiday could help prevent learning loss, ease the burden of childcare and food costs for working parents, and potentially lower holiday travel prices. However, many teachers oppose the change, arguing the long break is essential for them to rest and prepare for the new school year. While some schools have already moved to a five-week summer and two-week October half-term, recent consultations in Wales show the public remains deeply divided on the issue.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has stated that savers are missing out on financial rewards due to an overly negative perception of investing in stocks and shares. She announced plans to encourage investment, including sending information about opportunities to those with money in low-interest accounts. The government is also considering changes to the popular tax-free Individual Savings Account (ISA) system to incentivize a shift from cash savings to investments. Experts note that women in particular invest less than men and caution that any policy changes must be handled carefully to avoid deterring new investors. (not investment advice)</p>

While still luxurious and expensive, these new spaces prioritize personal accomplishment over family pedigree, providing a networking and social haven for India's self-made elite.

The image, which resurfaced in July 2025, contains numerous tell-tale signs of AI generation, such as deformed hands, a distorted jacket sleeve on Trump, and malformed faces in the background. While authentic photos of Trump and Epstein together do exist, this specific viral image is not one of them.
