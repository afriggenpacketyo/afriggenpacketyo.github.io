          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a jailed Belarusian opposition leader, has been released from prison after being incarcerated since 2020. He was pardoned, according to the Viasna rights group, after being jailed by Alexander Lukashenko's authoritarian regime following his attempt to challenge Lukashenko in an election. Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who ran against Lukashenko in his place, released a video thanking the U.S. for its efforts. His release coincided with a visit to Belarus by U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who aimed to facilitate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than Those Abroad, Experts Say</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that U.S. sunscreens are often less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, with the FDA classifying sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug, have slowed the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients. While American sunscreens adequately block UVB rays, their UVA protection is often weaker compared to products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations and allow non-animal testing alternatives. Dermatologists still emphasize the importance of wearing sunscreen and recommend broad-spectrum options with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

The exhibit features portraits of eight women who posed with traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their courage in breaking taboos and speaking publicly about the disease. The women are depicted against a backdrop representing contaminated water, highlighting the waterborne nature of the infection.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, deeming it unconstitutional. The ruling is a victory for civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state. Republicans have supported the mandate, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws in Arkansas and Texas are also facing legal challenges.</p>
