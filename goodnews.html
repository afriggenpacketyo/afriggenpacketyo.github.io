        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 is on track to end its nine-day winning streak, opening lower due to a stronger-than-expected ISM services index, which also showed higher prices paid, causing bond yields to rise. President Trump's plan to impose 100% tariffs on films produced abroad initially caused Disney's stock to drop, however it reversed slightly positive before noon ET. CrowdStrike's stock rose after Citizens JMP raised its price target, citing the company's continued momentum. Wells Fargo's CEO noted the strength of consumer health and progress in regulatory and risk controls, expressing confidence in the removal of the Federal Reserve-imposed asset cap.</p>
