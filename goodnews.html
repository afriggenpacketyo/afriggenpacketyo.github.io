          <p>A large, bright meteorite, described as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina before exploding over Georgia with the energy of about 20 tons of TNT. NASA reported the object was roughly three feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and was traveling at 30,000 miles per hour. The explosion created a pressure wave that resulted in audible booms heard by residents on the ground. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event, which may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

In an interview, he explained his part in the 60-fold increase, linking it to changes in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) that broadened the definition of autism. This expansion led to many individuals who previously might have been considered eccentric or received other diagnoses now being identified as on the autism spectrum.

The drug's development is a remarkable success story, as the disease itself was only identified in 2013 by Cambridge researchers studying the patient's family.
