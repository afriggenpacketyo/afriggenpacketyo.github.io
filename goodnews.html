          <p>Ray French, a revered figure in rugby and a long-time BBC sports commentator, has passed away at the age of 85. Known as the voice of rugby league for decades, he commentated on every Challenge Cup final from 1981 to 2008. Before his broadcasting career, French was a distinguished dual-code international player, representing England in rugby union and Great Britain in rugby league. Tributes have poured in from across the sport, remembering him as a giant of the game, a warm personality, and a unique voice that defined an era of rugby league coverage.</p>

          <h2>Taiwanese Voters Reject Mass Recall of Opposition KMT Lawmakers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant political outcome, Taiwanese voters have rejected a recall effort targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party. The result is seen as a setback for President Lai Ching-te's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to regain a parliamentary majority. The KMT, which advocates for closer ties with China, framed the recall as a power grab by the DPP. The vote for stability suggests public weariness with intense political infighting, and the KMT has called on the president to apologize and focus on governance.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his substantial overall lead. Australian sprinter Kaden Groves secured a solo victory in Stage 20, marking his first-ever stage win in the prestigious race. With only the traditional processional stage into Paris remaining, Pogačar's lead is considered unassailable, barring any unforeseen incidents. The 26-year-old's dominant performance throughout the tour has solidified his position at the top of the general classification.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both achieved record highs this past week, buoyed by positive news on international trade and strong corporate earnings reports. The market reacted favorably to a new trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with China, while the Federal Reserve has signaled a potential for future interest rate cuts. Housing data presented a mixed picture with rising prices for existing homes but lower prices for new homes. Many S&P 500 companies have surpassed earnings expectations, though some major firms saw their stocks dip despite positive results. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris has claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix, narrowly beating out his teammate Oscar Piastri in a competitive qualifying session. Norris's first lap in the final session was enough to secure the top spot, as Piastri made a small mistake on his faster second attempt. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start third, just ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen, who was disappointed with his final qualifying laps. With rain expected for Sunday's race, the starting grid sets the stage for a potentially chaotic and unpredictable contest at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit.</p>

          <p>The failure of a mass recall vote against 24 opposition KMT lawmakers is being widely interpreted as a significant political miscalculation and failure for Taiwan's President William Lai and his DPP party. Analysts suggest the high-stakes campaign, which framed the KMT as 'pro-China forces,' backfired and revealed a growing public fatigue with using 'anti-China' rhetoric as a primary political strategy. The result solidifies the KMT's position in parliament and underscores a public desire for stability over constant political confrontation, especially amid heightened military pressure from Beijing.</p>

          <p>According to sources, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China this autumn, although a previously rumored September trip is no longer being considered. Officials from both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange a visit for October or November. A potential meeting could occur either before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. Recent high-level diplomatic engagements between the two countries have been described as positive, suggesting that groundwork is being laid for a potential leader-level summit later in the year.</p>

This move provides more certainty for companies, with a small but growing number already offering such programs to attract and retain talent.

          <p>China has unveiled a global action plan for artificial intelligence, advocating for international cooperation on development and regulation, just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy. The move, announced at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, signals an intensification of the tech race between the two global powers. China's plan emphasizes an 'AI plus' strategy to integrate the technology across industries and offers to assist other nations, particularly in the Global South. Analysts suggest this is creating two distinct camps, with China pursuing a multilateral approach while the U.S. builds a coalition with its allies.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's new single 'Daisies' has unexpectedly climbed the charts, offering a soothing alternative in a summer music landscape that has lacked a clear, upbeat anthem. The song comes from his surprise album 'Swag,' which departs from his previous pop sound for a more subtle, R&B and indie-influenced style. Critics note the album's gentle, aqueous production and melancholic yet awake emotional tone seem to resonate with the current cultural mood. This reserved, simmering quality is seen as a trend, reflecting a collective desire for comfort and stability over high-energy party tracks.</p>

These 'Wolbitos' are bred to carry the Wolbachia bacteria, which prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them, thus stopping transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to scale up the project nationwide.
