          <p>Five months after the Los Angeles County fires sent tons of toxic material into the ocean, questions remain about the safety of swimming at L.A.‚Äôs beaches. While agencies haven't found contaminant levels likely to pose health risks to beachgoers, the ecological damage dwarfs available measurement tools. Seawater safety testing primarily targets sewage, not fire debris, and lacks clear health guidelines for contaminants like heavy metals.
