          <p>Nvidia refuted reports that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China after speculation arose about a new research and development center in Shanghai. According to a spokesperson, Nvidia will not modify GPU designs to comply with U.S. export controls, despite CEO Jensen Huang discussing a potential center with Shanghai's mayor to assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market. The company maintains that production and design will continue outside of China, emphasizing its commitment to adhering to export regulations.

          <p>A group of Just Stop Oil (JSO) activists who plotted to glue themselves to a runway at Heathrow Airport have been spared jail terms. The nine campaigners were convicted of conspiracy to cause a public nuisance after police stopped them from causing "unprecedented disruption" at the west London airport on 24 July. The defendants had either already served the time they were sentenced to or they were handed suspended sentences. The judge criticized the activists for treating their trial as an extension of their protest, emphasizing the disruption caused to the court system and the lack of remorse shown.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, an artificial intelligence infrastructure provider, has seen its shares surge nearly 60% this week, boosting its market cap to around $38 billion, driven by the AI growth momentum and a significant stake held by Nvidia. The company reported a 420% revenue growth in its first earnings report as a public company, surpassing full-year expectations. Nvidia's 7% stake in CoreWeave is now valued at approximately $2 billion following this week's surge. CoreWeave's success is notable given the limited number of IPOs recently, providing investors with a way to invest in generative AI.</p>
