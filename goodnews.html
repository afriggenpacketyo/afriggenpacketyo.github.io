          <p>In a move to increase accessibility, Roche's subsidiary Genentech has announced it will sell its flu medication, Xofluza, directly to some patients at a discounted price. This direct-to-consumer program is designed to assist individuals who are uninsured, have limited coverage, or whose insurance plans do not cover the pill. The initiative comes as pharmaceutical companies face increasing pressure from the Trump administration to find ways to lower prescription drug costs for American consumers. The discounted cash option represents a 70% reduction from the pill's current list price.</p>

          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, titled "Gone Before Goodbye," with bestselling author Harlan Coben. In an interview, she discussed her motivation for the project, emphasizing her desire to create a strong female protagonist defined by her unique skills rather than her sex appeal. Witherspoon contrasted her character with the women often portrayed in James Bond films, which she watched growing up, questioning why their roles were so often reduced to wearing bikinis. The novel centers on a talented surgeon caught in a dangerous conspiracy.</p>

          <p>Apple and Formula 1 have finalized a five-year media rights agreement that will bring all F1 events exclusively to the Apple TV streaming service in the United States, beginning in 2026. The deal, valued at approximately $140 million per year, will include coverage of all practice, qualifying, and race sessions within the standard Apple TV subscription. This move marks a significant expansion of Apple's foray into live sports broadcasting and shifts F1's U.S. distribution away from its current partner, ESPN, aiming to control the user experience more directly.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent aggressive actions by Russia, including violations of NATO airspace, appear to have strengthened the resolve and unity of the transatlantic alliance. According to European officials, these provocations have backfired on Vladimir Putin by prompting a more coordinated and robust defense posture on NATO's eastern flank. This renewed alignment, which seems to include support from the Trump administration, is sending a strong message of deterrence to Moscow. The unified stance is seen as increasing pressure on Russia to de-escalate and potentially negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>The UK's Conservative Party has given a seat on the influential Public Accounts Committee to Rupert Lowe, who was elected as a Reform UK MP but was later expelled from the party. The committee is responsible for overseeing government spending, and the Conservatives justified the appointment by stating that Lowe "shares our values on cutting waste." This move represents an instance of cross-party cooperation, allowing an MP from outside the Conservative party to fill one of their reserved spots, though it has drawn criticism from the opposition Labour Party.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat from San Francisco, is reportedly planning to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Pelosi, who has represented the district since 1987, has not yet announced if she will seek another term, Wiener's entry into the race sets up a potential challenge from a well-known figure in state politics. Wiener is recognized for his legislative work on housing density and as a leading advocate for LGBTQ+ rights, and would be the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in Congress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article provides guidance for consumers dealing with debt collectors, clarifying that making payments on a delinquent account does not automatically provide legal protection against a lawsuit. Unless a formal, written agreement explicitly states that legal action will be withheld, a debt collector retains the right to sue for the remaining balance. Experts advise consumers to always request payment plan terms in writing to create a formal record. They also suggest exploring options like lump-sum settlements or professional debt relief services for more structured protection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant cultural shift is occurring within the bodybuilding community as many move away from the traditional practice of "dirty bulking," which involves consuming massive quantities of high-calorie, often processed, foods to gain mass. Instead, a method known as "lean bulking" is gaining popularity, which focuses on achieving a modest caloric surplus through healthy, whole foods. This trend reflects broader societal wellness movements and the desire for a lean, aesthetic physique year-round. However, health experts caution that even this cleaner approach can still pose risks and may lead to disordered eating habits.</p>

          <p>Analysts at Deutsche Bank have designated DuPont as a short-term "catalyst buy" in anticipation of the company's planned spinoff of its electronics division, which will be named Qnity. The bank's report suggests that this corporate restructuring is poised to unlock significant shareholder value, arguing that DuPont's current stock price represents a substantial discount compared to the sum of its parts. The analysis views the new Qnity entity as a particularly attractive long-term investment due to its strong growth prospects tied to the expanding semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>
