          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has clarified that a new $100,000 fee for H-1B visas, imposed in September, applies exclusively to new applicants residing abroad who are not current H-1B visa holders. This significant charge also covers petitions filed on or after September 21st that request consular notification, port of entry notification, or pre-flight inspection for an alien already within the United States. Crucially for employers, the fee does not apply when a visa applicant files to change from one visa type to another, such as from an F-1 student visa to H-1B status. President Trump had initially announced the fee to address perceived abuses of the program and prevent employers from undercutting U.S. workers' wages.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has launched its new web browser, Atlas, aiming to challenge Google's decades-long dominance in the browser and search markets by deeply integrating artificial intelligence. With ChatGPT at its core, Atlas allows users to chat with websites, find products, and automate tasks such as booking appointments or planning events, fundamentally rethinking the browsing experience. CEO Sam Altman envisions future internet access shifting from traditional search bars to a chat-based experience, with ChatGPT potentially becoming the default operating system for the AI age. This strategic move intensifies the "browser wars," as OpenAI leverages its 800 million weekly ChatGPT users and significant investments from partners like Nvidia to compete with Google's established technological infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Shield AI, a company valued at $5.3 billion, is set to unveil its next-generation autonomous fighter jet, the X-Bat, which is piloted by its proprietary AI software, Hivemind. The X-Bat boasts a 2,000-mile range, a 50,000-foot flight ceiling, and vertical takeoff and landing capabilities, enabling operations in remote locations without requiring a runway. Designed for combat and capable of being equipped with missiles, this advanced drone aims to be produced for around $27 million, a fraction of the cost of current military aircraft. This development represents a significant advancement in AI-driven defense technology, potentially saving service members' lives by reducing human risk, despite the company's past challenges with a drone landing incident that temporarily impacted customer confidence.</p>

          <p>Toys R Us is making a significant comeback, announcing the opening of eight new flagship stores and 20 seasonal locations across the U.S. ahead of the crucial holiday shopping rush, including at least two in California. The once-dominant toy retailer, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2017 and subsequently closed its brick-and-mortar operations, has been actively working to re-establish its physical presence through partnerships with Macy's and Go! Retail Group. This expansion, which includes locations in Texas, Colorado, and New York, aims to bring "the magic of Toys R Us" to even more communities. The company is reintroducing popular brands like Lego, Barbie, and Hot Wheels, signaling a renewed effort to reclaim its market position and engage with a new generation of shoppers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence has deployed a small number of planning officers to Israel to join a US-led multinational taskforce, known as the civil military coordination centre, aimed at monitoring the Gaza ceasefire. This taskforce, which will not involve British troops entering Gaza or combat zones, is also expected to include forces from Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE. The UK's participation, explicitly requested by the US, leverages its extensive experience in security force capacity-building. This deployment underscores Britain's commitment to international efforts to support the peace process and coordinate humanitarian assistance, despite the historical complexities of its relationship with the Middle East. Further contributions are reportedly under discussion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total compensation for fiscal 2025 surged 22% to $96.5 million, largely driven by over $84 million in stock awards, reflecting the company's rallying stock price propelled by the artificial intelligence boom. Microsoft's shares have risen 23% this year, outperforming the S&P 500, with its Azure cloud business driving significant expansion as companies' cloud infrastructure needs grow to meet AI demand. This compensation increase follows a 63% jump in Nadella's pay the previous year, despite a series of cyberattacks and workforce turmoil, including over 15,000 employee eliminations in 2025. The company's strong financial performance is closely tied to its growing cloud infrastructure to meet AI demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adam Driver has revealed that Disney ultimately rejected his pitch for a Ben Solo "Star Wars" movie, which he had spent two years developing with filmmaker Steven Soderbergh and writer Scott Z. Burns. Driver, who portrayed Kylo Ren/Ben Solo in the sequel trilogy, envisioned a character-driven story set after "The Rise of Skywalker," despite his character's fate in the films. Lucasfilm reportedly "loved the idea" for the movie, titled "The Hunt for Ben Solo," which would have captured the handmade feel of the original films. However, Disney executives Bob Iger and Alan Bergman ultimately said no, citing their inability to reconcile the concept with the character's death. Driver expressed disappointment that fans won't get to see what he considered one of the "coolest" scripts.</p>

          <p>The price of silver has declined by approximately 9% this week, prompting questions for investors about whether now is a strategic time to buy into the metal. Historically, price drops in precious metals often precede subsequent surges, suggesting the current dip could be a potential opportunity for entry. Silver is also presented as a more affordable alternative to gold, which has recently broken multiple price records, offering similar portfolio protection benefits at a a significantly lower entry point. Given ongoing economic uncertainties, including the government shutdown and elevated everyday expenses due to inflation, diversifying a portfolio with silver is suggested as a valuable hedge.
