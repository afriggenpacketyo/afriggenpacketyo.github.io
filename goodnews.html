The right-hander pitched seven innings, allowing only one run on four hits while striking out nine batters, showcasing his Cy Young-caliber form. After a shaky period earlier in the season, Yamamoto has regained his command, improving his record to 9-7 with a 2.48 ERA. The Dodgers' offense provided ample support, with key hits from Mookie Betts, Shohei Ohtani, and Teoscar Hernández, securing a crucial win as the team looks to build momentum with its star-studded pitching rotation.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te has reportedly canceled a planned stopover in the United States on his way to South America, a decision that could ease tensions with Beijing and potentially create an opportunity for a meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump later this year. The Taiwanese Presidential Office cited typhoon recovery efforts and regional developments as reasons for the change in plans, though sources suggest Washington had discouraged the visit. The move comes as Lai's Democratic Progressive Party faces domestic political pressures, having recently lost key recall votes against the opposition Kuomintang party.</p>

          <p>Two Mexican nationals, brothers Carlos and Oscar Gonzalez, have been released from a Florida immigration detention center and have returned to Mexico without facing charges. The younger brother, Carlos, was initially detained during a traffic stop for driving an unregistered vehicle, and both were subsequently transferred to the controversial Everglades detention facility. Their father raised concerns about the poor conditions inside the center, which advocates have called "unlivable." The Mexican government confirmed it secured the brothers' voluntary departure and is monitoring the situation for other Mexican nationals detained at the facility amid human rights concerns.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a European-led peace plan and humanitarian aid for Gaza, following warnings of mass starvation. Starmer presented the plan to U.S. President Donald Trump during a meeting in Scotland, emphasizing collaboration with France and Germany to provide immediate relief and a pathway to a two-state solution. The move comes amid increasing domestic pressure, with over 250 MPs signing a letter urging the government to immediately recognize Palestinian statehood. Downing Street has stated that recognition is a matter of "when, not if," as it coordinates its next steps with international allies.</p>

          <p>Mount Paektu, an active volcano on the border of North Korea and China, has been designated a UNESCO Global Geopark, recognizing its geological and cultural significance. The mountain holds a sacred place in Korean mythology and is central to the foundation myth and propaganda of North Korea's ruling Kim dynasty, which claims a "Paektu bloodline." UNESCO cited the site's impressive volcanic legacy, including a massive eruption in 946 CE, and unique geological features. This designation, which follows a similar one for the Chinese side of the mountain, may encourage North Korea to promote the site for geotourism.</p>

According to a researcher from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the inscription details a journey to the source of the Yellow River, a location historically associated with myths of immortality. This artifact is described as the only known stone carving from the emperor's era that remains at its original site. The finding provides a potential physical link to the legendary quest for eternal life pursued by the powerful but paranoid first emperor over two millennia ago.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer's recent meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Scotland provided invaluable, if unconventional, diplomatic access. The encounter, which included a helicopter tour of Trump's golf course and a lengthy, free-wheeling press session, allowed Starmer to build a personal rapport with the unpredictable American leader. While this access is seen by Downing Street as crucial for aligning on key issues like Gaza, it also presents risks, forcing Starmer to carefully navigate Trump's spontaneous commentary on various topics. This article analyzes the blend of personal business and international diplomacy that characterizes Trump's approach to foreign relations.</p>

Would-be campers can now enter a free drawing for a chance to book a site months in advance, with a points system designed to favor those who have been unsuccessful in previous lotteries. The move aims to reduce no-shows and give more people an opportunity to visit these coveted locations.</p>

          <p>Financial analyst Jim Cramer suggests that the stock market's muted reaction to the new U.S.-EU trade agreement is due to investors being preoccupied with more immediate economic factors. He argues that Wall Street is currently more focused on this week's major tech company earnings reports, the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting, and Friday's employment data than on tariff news. Cramer notes that investors may have "tariff ennui," as the pattern of threatening high tariffs followed by a negotiated deal has become familiar. He believes the market will not significantly react to trade policy until these other major economic events have passed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding the imposition of more severe tariffs threatened by President Trump. The deal establishes a 15 percent tariff on many EU imports, a rate lower than the threatened 30 percent, and includes provisions for mutual tariff-free trade on certain products like aircraft and some generic drugs. Additionally, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years. This agreement is one of several the U.S. has pursued ahead of an August 1 deadline, though the legality of the administration's tariff strategy remains under challenge in federal court.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline approaches, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to strengthen their roster, with a focus on upgrading their outfield defense. Amid a team-wide offensive slump in July, the club is considering adding a position player to complement its pitching staff. Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins has emerged as a potential fit; he is a premium defensive outfielder who is also having a solid offensive season. Acquiring a player like Bader could allow the Dodgers to improve their run prevention, a key factor for their potential postseason success, by shoring up a defense that has shown weaknesses this year.</p>
