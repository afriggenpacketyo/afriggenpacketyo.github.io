          <p>Serena Williams revealed that winning the 2017 Australian Open while pregnant was her most important career moment. Williams, who was nine weeks pregnant at the time, recalled the physical challenges she faced, including fatigue and breathlessness. She kept her pregnancy a secret from most people, only confiding in her sister Venus, whom she defeated in the final. Williams humorously remembered having to rely on aces and winners to shorten points due to her condition, reflecting on the surreal experience of competing at such a high level while pregnant. </p>

          <p>The government announced that from September 2026, any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible and save parents ¬£500 a year, potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, and has pledged ¬£13 million to food charities to combat food poverty. While the announcement has been largely welcomed, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective at reducing child poverty.</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator, MHRA, has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro, advising them to use effective contraception. It is uncertain whether these medicines could harm an unborn baby, and they may reduce the effectiveness of the contraceptive pill, particularly in overweight or obese individuals. The MHRA recommends using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before attempting pregnancy. The regulator acted after receiving reports of unintended pregnancies related to these drugs.</p>
