          <p>Shares of Danish wind energy developer Orsted plummeted over 5% after the company announced a plan to raise $9.4 billion by issuing new shares at a steep 67% discount to its recent closing price. This news contrasted with a generally positive start for European markets, which saw modest gains ahead of a key U.S. Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are widely anticipating an interest rate cut from the Fed, spurred by recent data indicating a weakening labor market and controlled inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite falling to 0-2, the New York Giants displayed newfound offensive vitality in a 41-38 overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys. Quarterback Russell Wilson delivered a stellar performance with 450 passing yards and three touchdowns, largely connecting with standout receiver Malik Nabers. Although the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a late interception, their competitive and entertaining play marked a significant improvement from their season opener. This performance suggests the team may be more watchable this season, offering a glimmer of hope for progress.</p>

          <p>Data from China's central bank indicates a sustained shift of household savings into the nation's stock market, suggesting the current equity rally may have further room to grow. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions, including brokerages and mutual funds, increased by 1.17 trillion yuan. This trend is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors toward the capital market in search of better returns as China's stock earnings yields appear more attractive.

Stars like Dani Dyer and Vicky Pattison discussed their anticipation for the glamorous costumes and their strategies for managing performance nerves. The conversations also touched on the infamous 'Strictly curse,' which contestants largely dismissed. BBC bosses are hopeful the focus will return to the dancing itself following recent off-screen controversies involving some of the show's professional dancers.</p>

          <p>China is considering a new initiative, codenamed C2N, to repurpose retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for advanced nuclear reactors. This strategy, proposed by a top state-owned energy firm, aims to leverage existing infrastructure in coastal areas to accelerate the country's decarbonization efforts. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal power capacity expected to be retired by 2030, converting these sites could offer a direct path to clean energy while preserving valuable assets and potentially improving public acceptance of nuclear power.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaboration between biotechnology firm Allonia and Lundin Mining is testing a new technology that could make nickel mining more efficient and environmentally friendly. The method, called D-Solve, uses microbes to selectively dissolve unwanted minerals, which initial tests show can increase nickel purity by reducing magnesium impurities by 40%. This innovation is particularly significant as the global demand for nickel grows due to its use in batteries and clean energy, offering a way to reduce waste and costs in the extraction process.</p>
