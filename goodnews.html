          <p>Hamas has formally agreed to significant portions of President Trump's proposed Gaza peace plan, notably consenting to release all remaining hostages and transfer the Strip's administration to an independent Palestinian body. This development, seen as a positive step by U.S. officials, still requires further negotiations on specific details, including the decommissioning of weapons. Following Hamas's statement, President Trump urged Israel to immediately cease bombing Gaza to ensure the safe and swift release of hostages. This marks a critical moment in efforts to de-escalate the conflict, though a comprehensive agreement remains to be finalized.</p>

          <p>Recent anti-China protests in South Korea's Myeongdong and Daelim-dong districts have not significantly deterred Chinese tourists, with scheduled flights between the two nations operating as expected. A travel marketing firm confirms that South Korea remains a top destination for Chinese visitors, despite the Chinese embassy expressing regret over the demonstrations. Analysts suggest that the continued tourism is due to both governments opposing the protests and the maintenance of public safety. However, the article notes that a potential decline in tourism remains possible if underlying tensions were to escalate further.</p>

These closures mirror others in various U.S. states and the UK, as the company meticulously evaluates store performance to enhance the chain's distinctiveness. While Amazon is streamlining its physical Fresh footprint and discontinuing cashierless technology in these stores, it reaffirms its robust commitment to the grocery sector. The company recently launched a new "price-conscious" brand and expanded same-day delivery, with CEO Andy Jassy remaining "bullish" on grocery as a pivotal business segment.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court in Boston has ruled that the Trump administration cannot withhold citizenship from children born in the U.S. to non-citizens, upholding lower court injunctions. This decision is a significant legal defeat for President Trump's executive order seeking to narrow birthright citizenship, a concept largely interpreted under the 14th Amendment. The court emphasized historical precedents and a need to be wary of breaking with established traditions. While state attorneys general and civil liberties advocates lauded the ruling, the White House announced its intention to appeal to the Supreme Court for a definitive constitutional determination on the matter.</p>
