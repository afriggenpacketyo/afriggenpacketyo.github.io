          <p>The United Kingdom is reportedly on the verge of signing a trade deal with the United States, potentially becoming the first country to do so following the U.S. announcement of "reciprocal" tariffs. President Trump hinted at the development, and a U.K. government spokesperson confirmed that talks are ongoing with the U.S., emphasizing the importance of the alliance. While details remain uncertain, the agreement could be a finalized deal or a framework for future negotiations, aiming to alleviate pressure on U.K. businesses and consumers. Britain was spared the higher tariffs when Trump announced his duties, though it was still hit with the baseline 10% levy.</p>

          <p>The House is set to vote on a bill introduced by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the "Gulf of America," codifying an executive order signed by President Trump. The bill faces opposition, with Democrats calling it a waste of taxpayer money and some Republicans deeming it "juvenile." If passed, federal agencies would be required to update documents and maps within six months, though other countries would not be obligated to adopt the new name. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the change would cost less than $500,000 over five years.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing movement is advocating for the modernization of U.S. building codes to allow single-stair apartment buildings up to six stories tall, arguing it could significantly increase affordable housing options. Currently, most American cities require two staircases for buildings over three stories, adding substantial construction costs and limiting design flexibility. Proponents argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe, citing examples from Europe and cities like Seattle and New York City. However, fire safety officials express concerns about evacuation times and resident safety, advocating for more research before revising building codes.</p>

          <p>Nintendo forecasts sales of 15 million Switch 2 consoles for the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales prediction since announcing the successor to the Switch. The company reported lower revenue and profit in its fiscal fourth quarter, largely expected as consumers await the new console. Nintendo is also monitoring U.S. tariff rates, which could impact profitability, as its consoles are manufactured in Vietnam, facing duties of 46% once the pause lifts. Despite these challenges, analysts anticipate a strong launch for the Switch 2, fueled by an established user base.</p>

Lisa Flanagan from the Department of Conservation, who has worked with the snails for 12 years, said the species still holds surprises. The snails are hermaphrodites, simultaneously exchanging sperm with another snail before creating an egg, which can take over a year to hatch.</p>
