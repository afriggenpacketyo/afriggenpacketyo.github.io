          <p>Baidu is set to expand its driverless taxi service, Apollo Go, into Europe starting in 2026, partnering with U.S. ride-hailing company Lyft. The collaboration aims to deploy thousands of robotaxis initially in the U.K. and Germany, pending regulatory approval. This move follows Baidu's recent partnership with Uber for international expansion, focusing on the Middle East and Asia. For Lyft, this deal offers a key differentiation in the competitive European ride-hailing market against rivals like Uber and Bolt, boosting its regional presence after acquiring FreeNow.</p>

          <p>The European Union has announced a six-month suspension of its planned countermeasures against U.S. tariffs, aiming to allow for further trade talks. This decision follows an agreement between EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and U.S. President Donald Trump, which seeks to restore stability in transatlantic trade relations. The delay, taking effect Tuesday, is a concession after weeks of negotiations, where Trump had previously imposed 15% tariffs on most European goods. The EU's move signals a commitment to resolving trade disputes through dialogue.</p>

          <p>Everton has agreed a deal worth approximately £28 million to acquire Chelsea midfielder Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall. The 26-year-old is expected to finalize personal terms and undergo a medical, despite late interest from Fulham. Chelsea was willing to let Dewsbury-Hall go to recoup most of the £30 million they paid for him in 2024. This transfer aligns with manager David Moyes's anticipation of securing new deals, as Chelsea also seeks to trim its squad with multiple sales this week.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has approved a new $29 billion stock-based pay package for CEO Elon Musk, aiming to retain him and address shareholder concerns. This comes six months after a Delaware judge revoked his 2018 $56 billion package, deeming it unfair. The new grant, comprising 96 million restricted shares, requires Musk to pay an exercise price per share. Wedbush analysts believe this will keep Musk as CEO until at least 2030, motivating him as Tesla transitions into an AI-focused company, despite recent stock declines and financial struggles.

          <p>Millions of car finance customers in the UK could be eligible for compensation due to a recent Supreme Court ruling on hidden commissions paid by lenders to dealers. The ruling clarified that undisclosed, unfair commission payments could be unlawful, particularly for loans with discretionary commission arrangements (DCAs) banned in 2021. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is establishing a compensation scheme, with first payments expected in 2026. Consumers are advised to await the FCA scheme and can contact their lender, but should avoid claims companies for now. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A clinical associate professor of pharmacy explains that a significant number of Americans who believe they have a penicillin allergy are likely incorrect, with fewer than 1% actually allergic. Mislabeling, often from childhood rashes or minor side effects, can lead to less appropriate and more costly broad-spectrum antibiotic use, increasing antimicrobial resistance. The article highlights that about 80% of true penicillin allergies fade after 10 years. It advises consulting a healthcare professional for assessment, including skin testing or a monitored test dose, to safely re-evaluate allergy status.</p>

The phenomenon is attributed to factors like scarcity, surprise blind boxes, and celebrity endorsement, but primarily to the growing trend of "kidulthood," where adults embrace childlike objects. Unlike previous plushie trends, Labubus are publicly displayed, signaling a playful attitude and a rejection of traditional adulthood.

          <p>Financial advisors emphasize the importance of having a clear strategy for investing in Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which have surpassed $13 trillion in assets. ETFs offer lower costs and more flexibility than traditional mutual funds, but a plan helps investors navigate market volatility. Advisors suggest avoiding trading at market open and close due to high volatility, though they caution against "timing the market." Instead, strategies like "dollar-cost averaging" and using "limit orders" are recommended to manage risk and control investment prices, ensuring money is put to work effectively.
