          <p>An opinion article argues that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, is uniquely positioned to host the 2036 Olympic Games. The region already possesses numerous world-class sports facilities and a highly efficient, expanding transport network, which would significantly reduce the economic burden typically associated with hosting the event. By leveraging existing infrastructure and the scenic backdrop of Hong Kong's harbor for temporary venues, the area could meet and even surpass the logistical standards set by previous Games. This approach would offer a cost-effective and sustainable model for future Olympic hosts.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Roki Sasaki has re-entered consideration for the team's postseason roster after a strong rehabilitation performance for the triple-A affiliate. In his start, Sasaki pitched four shutout innings and reached speeds over 100 mph multiple times, a significant improvement from his previous rehab struggles. While a starting role is unlikely, manager Dave Roberts indicated that a bullpen position is possible for the 23-year-old, who has been on the injured list with a shoulder impingement since May. The organization will now convene to determine the next steps for Sasaki as the regular season nears its end.</p>

Judge hit his 359th career home run during a game against the Detroit Tigers, which was also his 44th of the current season. He now trails only Joe DiMaggio, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, and Babe Ruth in the Yankees' record books.

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw has won the special election for a congressional seat in Northern Virginia, further tightening the Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a former chief of staff to the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson in a reliably Democratic district where federal job cuts under the Trump administration were a key issue. His victory continues a trend of Democratic overperformance in recent elections and adds another voice to the House ahead of critical federal funding deadlines. Walkinshaw has also pledged to support a bipartisan effort to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged after the company released forward-looking revenue projections that left financial analysts astounded, despite missing current quarterly estimates. The company forecasts its cloud infrastructure revenue will grow from $10 billion to $18 billion this fiscal year and projects it to reach $144 billion within five years, driven by massive AI-related deals, including with OpenAI. This explosive growth forecast caused the company's stock to rally significantly in after-hours trading. Analysts on the earnings call expressed shock and effusive praise for the company's outlook, signaling a major shift in its market position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new blood test capable of detecting key biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease is being trialed across the UK, with hopes it could revolutionize early diagnosis. The test, which measures a protein called p-tau217, is expected to increase diagnostic accuracy from 70% to over 90% when used alongside cognitive assessments. Over 1,000 patients at 20 NHS memory clinics will participate in the study, led by University College London, to evaluate its effectiveness within the health system. If successful, this relatively low-cost test could replace more invasive and expensive methods, enabling earlier access to treatment and support for patients.</p>

Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham stated the policy will provide significant financial relief to families, support the economy, and improve child well-being.

          <p>The Metro bus system in Akron, Ohio, has been named the national mass transit system of the year after a successful overhaul dramatically increased ridership. By redesigning routes based on passenger feedback, improving frequency to every 15 minutes on key lines, and extending service to seven days a week, the system saw a 24% jump in ridership. The transformation was achieved without a budget increase and was led by CEO Dawn Distler, a former bus driver who prioritizes direct communication with riders.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 cap on contactless card payments, potentially allowing for unlimited transactions via tapping. If approved, the change would grant banks and card providers the flexibility to set their own limits, aligning card payments with the unrestricted limits already available on smartphone digital wallets. While the move aims to reduce 'payment friction' for larger purchases like grocery shopping, it has raised concerns about fraud. The FCA stated that providers would be responsible for fraud losses and would need to ensure robust security measures are in place for high-value transactions.</p>

While the overall pace of buybacks has slowed, investors are rewarding what the analysis calls 'buyback aristocrats'—companies that consistently reduce their share counts. Cramer pointed to Apple and Wells Fargo as prime examples, suggesting their generous repurchase programs signal strong management confidence and provide an 'edge' for investors, especially as the economy slows. This strategy helps absorb excess share supply from the market, supporting stock prices. (not investment advice)</p>
