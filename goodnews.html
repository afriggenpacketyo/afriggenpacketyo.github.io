          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, is now available at GP surgeries in England for eligible patients meeting strict criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over with specific health conditions. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to manage demand and resources, with wider availability expected in the coming years. The injection, which makes users feel full and can lead to significant weight loss, requires regular check-ups and wrap-around care. GPs are urging people to check their eligibility before contacting their local surgery due to workforce constraints, as Mounjaro is also available through specialist weight management services.</p>

          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, equipped with the world's largest digital camera, has released its first images of nebulae and distant galaxies with unprecedented clarity. The observatory will conduct a decade-long survey of the southern hemisphere sky, creating a detailed time-lapse record. The initial images include a composite photo of the Trifid and Lagoon Nebulae, as well as the Virgo Cluster, showcasing up to 2,000 galaxies. The observatory is expected to track asteroids and spot interstellar objects, contributing significantly to astronomical research.</p>

          <h2>Cosmic Rays May Affect Quantum Computer Operations, Chinese Scientists Find</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered the first evidence that cosmic rays may be affecting the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. The researchers monitored superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays and gamma ray-induced particle disturbances. The findings, published in Nature Communications, suggest that these particles can induce correlated errors in qubits, potentially impacting the scaling of quantum processors. The proposed detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection.</p>
