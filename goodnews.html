          <h2>Gold Investment for Seniors: Weighing the High Price</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses whether seniors should invest in gold given its current high price. While gold is known as a safe haven asset, its soaring price presents a tricky choice. Investing in gold can protect a portfolio but won't generate income like dividends or interest. Experts recommend a small allocation, typically 4% to 9%, to act as a stabilizer during inflationary periods or market stress. The article suggests considering fractional gold investing or gold ETFs as lower-cost alternatives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>House Passes Tax Bill with Increased SALT Deduction Cap</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 09:52:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House of Representatives passed a tax bill that includes changes to the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT), increasing the cap to $40,000. The increased SALT cap phases out over $500,000 and goes into effect in 2025, increasing annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. The revised text also reduces itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could reduce the benefit of the higher SALT cap. The House proposal could still face pushback in the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Republican-led House narrowly passed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," advancing President Donald Trump's tax and immigration agenda. Speaker Mike Johnson secured the victory after weeks of internal GOP struggles, with the bill passing by a 215-214 vote. The bill includes tax cuts, Medicaid reform, and immigration spending, fulfilling many of Trump's campaign promises. The bill now moves to the Senate, where revisions are expected. The bill also includes a $40,000 SALT deduction for incomes under $500,000, expedited cuts to clean energy credits, billions for border security, and the end of the tax on silencers.</p>
