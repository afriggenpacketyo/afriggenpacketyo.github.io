        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Tennessee magistrate judge has denied the government's motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran migrant who was mistakenly deported and subsequently returned to the U.S. Judge Barbara Holmes stated that Abrego Garcia would receive due process, scheduling a hearing to review his release conditions. Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S., adding complexity to his legal situation. The judge's decision underscores the importance of upholding legal rights even in complex immigration cases, ensuring fair treatment under the law. The case continues to develop with the upcoming hearing to determine the specific conditions of his release. The optimism score reflects the due process being followed in this legal matter.</p>

          <p>Keegan Bradley won the Travelers Championship by a single shot, denying Tommy Fleetwood his first PGA Tour title. Fleetwood, who held a three-shot lead going into the final round, bogeyed the 18th hole after a missed putt, allowing Bradley to secure the victory with a birdie. Fleetwood expressed his disappointment, stating it was the worst way to finish after leading by two with three holes to play. Bradley, who will captain the USA at the Ryder Cup, celebrated his win, while Fleetwood reflected on the missed opportunity. The optimism score is based on the fact that Bradley won the golf game.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 17:33:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government's new 10-year industrial strategy includes measures to lower energy costs for over 7,000 UK businesses by scrapping green levies. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for manufacturing firms. The plan also aims to speed up connections to the energy grid and support the creation of over one million new jobs. Critics argue the plan admits the high costs of net zero, while supporters welcome the action to reduce energy costs for manufacturers. The optimism score reflects the potential economic benefits of the plan but acknowledges the ongoing debate surrounding energy policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso stated his zero tolerance for racism after Antonio R√ºdiger reported that he was a victim of abuse during their 3-1 win against Mexican side Pachuca at the Club World Cup on Sunday. It was not immediately clear whether the alleged abuse came from the crowd or an opponent, and FIFA is investigating the allegations. The preceding 90 minutes had seen Jude Bellingham and Arda G√ºler score late in the first half to help 10-man Real Madrid to a victory in a Group H clash played amid sweltering conditions on Sunday in Charlotte, North Carolina. The optimism score is based on the fact that Madrid won the soccer game.</p>
