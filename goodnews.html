The pair also performed Mel C's 1998 hit, "When You're Gone," and Grennan spoke about "uniting the city."

          <p>Germany's new government is considering amending or abolishing key climate protection laws, including the "Building Energy Act," which promotes heat pumps. Katherina Reiche, the new Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy, aims to prioritize energy supply alongside climate protection, potentially including constructing new gas-fired power plants. Critics, like Greenpeace's Martin Kaiser, argue this could lead to new fossil fuel dependencies. Despite these potential shifts, the government has committed ‚Ç¨100 billion of a ‚Ç¨500 billion infrastructure investment program to climate protection.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan's election as president of Romania was significantly influenced by votes from ethnic Hungarians and Moldovans with dual citizenship. Conservative estimates suggest that over 500,000 of these voters supported Dan, contributing substantially to his victory against a hard-right candidate. This outcome is crucial for maintaining Romania's pro-European stance, as the alternative would have strengthened the autocratic, pro-Russian, anti-EU camp in Europe. The Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) played a pivotal role by opposing Viktor Orban's recommendation to vote for Simion.</p>
