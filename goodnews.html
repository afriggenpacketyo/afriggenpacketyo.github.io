          <p>Germany's women's national team secured a dramatic victory over France to advance to the Euro 2025 semifinals, winning 6-5 in a penalty shootout. The German side played with only ten players for over 100 minutes after an early red card was issued to Kathrin Hendrich. Despite the disadvantage and falling behind on the resulting penalty, Germany equalized and held on through extra time, with goalkeeper Ann-Katrin Berger making the decisive save in the shootout.</p>

          <p>Pop star Katy Perry encountered a technical issue during a concert in San Francisco when a large, mechanical butterfly prop she was riding suddenly dropped several feet. The incident occurred mid-song while she was suspended above the audience. Perry, startled but unharmed, quickly recomposed herself and continued her performance of 'Roar' without interruption. She later made a lighthearted comment about the malfunction, saying, 'Not today, Satan,' as the song concluded.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy towards closer security and arms cooperation with France and the United Kingdom, forming a new bloc informally known as the 'E3.' This strategic shift, highlighted by a new bilateral treaty with the UK, is largely driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty about future U.S. defense commitments to Europe. The alliance aims to bolster European security, potentially using French and British nuclear deterrence to supplement NATO's protective umbrella.</p>
