        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has declared former President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship to be unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals panel found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the "subject to the jurisdiction" clause excludes children of undocumented immigrants, but the court disagreed with this interpretation. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy successfully avoided a technical recession by expanding 0.6% in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations. The growth was primarily driven by a significant increase in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products, as firms reportedly expedited shipments ahead of potential U.S. tariff adjustments. However, economists caution that this pace may not be sustainable, as domestic consumption remains weak and global trade could soften. The positive data comes as South Korea navigates tense trade negotiations with the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix reported record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, driven by soaring demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI chipsets. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its revenue climb 35% and operating profit surge nearly 69% year-over-year. SK Hynix expects this strong demand to continue, fueled by ongoing investments in AI by major tech companies and governments. The results solidify its leadership in the HBM market as competitors like Samsung and Micron work to catch up. (not investment advice)</p>

This agreement codifies reforms Columbia had already announced, such as new disciplinary processes, and marks the first major resolution in the administration's broader campaign to reshape higher education institutions it has targeted over various cultural and political issues.</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati became the hero of the Euro 2025 semi-final, scoring the winning goal in extra time to defeat Germany and send Spain to its first-ever final. Her performance was especially remarkable given she was discharged from the hospital with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner's journey from a hospital bed to scoring the decisive goal highlights her resilience and world-class talent. Spain will now face England in the final, a highly anticipated rematch of the 2023 World Cup final.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. Responding to a request led by the island nation of Vanuatu, the U.N.'s highest court affirmed that existing international laws compel nations to protect the climate and that violators must provide "full reparations" for damages. While not legally binding, the unanimous opinion sets a powerful legal precedent that could influence climate litigation and international policy worldwide. It reinforces the principle of accountability for polluters.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the twin TRACERS satellites, a mission designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The identical probes will fly in tandem to provide detailed measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere, creating "space weather." This phenomenon can generate spectacular auroras but also poses a risk to satellites, power grids, and GPS systems. By better understanding these processes, scientists hope to improve predictions of space weather events and help protect critical infrastructure on Earth and in space.</p>

The victory provided a much-needed boost for the team, but the article notes that the bullpen's recent struggles remain a significant issue.

          <p>Southern California Edison has announced it will create a compensation program to directly pay victims of the deadly Eaton fire, a move aimed at avoiding lengthy and costly litigation. The utility plans to compensate those who lost homes, businesses, or suffered injuries, even though an official cause of the January blaze has not been determined. While Edison frames the program as a way to provide fair and prompt resolutions, some attorneys for fire victims expressed skepticism, suggesting it could be a tactic to underpay claimants. The cause of the fire is widely suspected to be linked to Edison's equipment.</p>
