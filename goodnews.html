          <p>President Trump is scheduled to visit Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, with a primary focus on bolstering economic ties and regional security cooperation. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, Arab countries anticipate Trump's visit will promote greater economic engagement, particularly in defense, artificial intelligence, and advanced weaponry. Discussions will also cover regional security, including a potential US-Iran nuclear deal and the situation in Yemen, while the Saudi-Israeli normalization deal remains stalled due to the Gaza conflict. Analysts suggest Trump's "big announcement" during the trip will likely align with US business interests, promoting trade and investment opportunities in the Gulf.</p>

          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing tests for myocardial ischemia, a condition involving reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. The 91-year-old former emperor showed no symptoms during the tests, but will require careful follow-up care. Akihito was admitted to the hospital after an earlier checkup revealed signs of the heart condition, and he previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito stepped down from the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft intended for Venus, is predicted to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Launched in 1972, a rocket malfunction left the spacecraft stranded in Earth orbit, and it has been slowly spiraling back ever since. Experts anticipate the spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, may partially survive its descent. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and south latitude, encompassing a large portion of the globe, and the risk of injuries on the ground is low.</p>

          <p>A South Korean temple has returned a 14th-century Buddha statue to a Japanese temple after a protracted legal battle. The statue was stolen from Kannonji Temple in Japan in 2012 by South Korean thieves, but Buseoksa Temple in South Korea claimed it was looted from them by Japanese pirates centuries ago. After years of legal disputes, including conflicting court rulings, South Korea's Supreme Court upheld a decision to return the statue to its rightful Japanese owners, resolving a sensitive historical issue between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google for changing the label of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following an executive order by President Trump. Mexico's President Sheinbaum argues that the label change affects Mexico and Cuba's continental shelf, not just the U.S. portion. Google's policy is to follow local official names, but Mexico argues the change is a violation of this principle. The lawsuit follows the House's passage of the Gulf of America Act, which aims to codify Trump's order.</p>

The new laws, expected in an immigration white paper, may include skills investment requirements for employers, visa restrictions for high-risk nationalities, and extended residency periods before migrants can apply for permanent residency. Tougher English language requirements and enforcement of rules on international care worker recruitment are also anticipated.
