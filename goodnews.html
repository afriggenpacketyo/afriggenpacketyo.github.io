          <p>Montie Quinn, a running back for Curry College, made college football history by rushing for an NCAA-record 522 yards in a single game against Nichols College. Quinn achieved this remarkable feat on just 20 carries and scored seven touchdowns, five of which were on runs of 50 yards or more. His performance shattered the previous Division III record of 465 yards and also surpassed the Division I FBS record of 427 yards set by Samaje Perine in 2014. Quinn became the first player at any NCAA level to rush for over 500 yards in one game.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Tim Curry's forthcoming memoir, "Vagabond," illustrates his complicated relationship with his most iconic role, Dr. Frank-N-Furter. He recounts being amusingly denied entry to a "Rocky Horror Picture Show" screening in 1976 by a ticket booth worker who accused him of being an imposter, as two other "Tim Currys" had already called. The anecdote serves as a jumping-off point for Curry to define himself as a "vagabond," an actor who roves, reinvents, and resists being pinned down by any single identity. The passage sets a witty and reflective tone for his life story.</p>

          <p>Actor-director Ben Stiller is releasing a documentary titled "Stiller & Meara: Nothing Is Lost," which examines the lives of his famous parents, comedy duo Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara. The film delves into the complexities of their 62-year marriage, their on-stage partnership, and how their professional lives shaped their family. Using newly discovered audio tapes his father secretly recorded, Stiller explores his parents' tensions, including his mother's struggles with alcoholism. The project also became a journey of self-examination for Stiller, prompting him to reflect on his own life and relationships.</p>

The team, composed of players now living in Australia, the UK, Portugal, and Italy, will compete in the FIFA Unites: Women's Series in the United Arab Emirates. For players like defender Najma Arefi, the matches represent more than just a game; they are a chance to represent the silenced women of Afghanistan. The tournament marks a significant step in their fight for recognition and a powerful message of resilience against oppression.</p>

          <p>Following over a week of intense and deadly fighting along their shared border, Pakistan and the Taliban government in Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The clashes had escalated after the Taliban accused Pakistan of carrying out attacks in Kabul, leading to cross-border strikes that caused dozens of casualties. Under the new deal, both sides have agreed to end hostile actions and refrain from targeting security forces or civilians, with further talks planned.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 10:01:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The decision to move retirement savings from a 401(k) into an annuity involves a significant trade-off between control and certainty. While an annuity can provide a guaranteed, lifelong income stream, shielding retirees from stock market volatility, it also comes with drawbacks like high fees, loss of liquidity, and limited growth potential. Once the funds are in an annuity, they are locked into a contract with an insurance company, making it difficult to access large sums for emergencies. The choice depends heavily on an individual's risk tolerance, health, and existing sources of guaranteed income. (not investment advice)</p>

Other points include the shift from car dependency to walkable cities, the affordability and accessibility of Spanish healthcare, and a greater sense of public safety.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled a plan to create 400,000 additional jobs in the clean energy sector by 2030, aiming to double the workforce in renewables, wind, solar, and nuclear power. The strategy focuses on training workers for high-demand occupations like plumbers, electricians, and welders to support the country's transition to net zero. To facilitate this, the government will establish five "technical excellence colleges" and launch programs to match military veterans and others with careers in the green economy. Energy Secretary Ed Miliband stated the plan is essential for lowering energy bills.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece commends two federal district court judges for blocking President Trump's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges are praised for courageously ruling that the administration's rationale, which described the cities as "war-ravaged," was "untethered to the facts" and not made in good faith. The article contrasts their actions with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to the president, arguing these lower court rulings uphold the nation's tradition of resisting military intrusion in civil affairs. It frames the decisions as a crucial defense of constitutional law.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is exploring the possibility of cutting the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While declining to speculate ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability crisis and stated that officials are "looking at all of these issues." The potential tax cut comes as the government faces pressure to fulfill its pledge to lower average energy bills. The move would offer direct relief to households but would need to be balanced against what Miliband described as "difficult fiscal circumstances."</p>
