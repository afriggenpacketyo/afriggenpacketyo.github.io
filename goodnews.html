          <h2>Expansion of Nuclear Waste Compensation Program Included in Senate Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 10:14:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senator Josh Hawley announced that reauthorization and expansion of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA) has been included in the Senate's version of the "One Big Beautiful Bill." This expansion would allow individuals in regions of Missouri, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Alaska, along with existing "downwinders," to receive compensation for nuclear waste exposure. The proposal also includes claims for increased atmospheric testing and eligibility for uranium mine workers from 1971-1990. Hawley hopes this inclusion demonstrates the country's support for those affected by nuclear exposure, calling it a measure of vindication and appreciation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A second federal judge has blocked an executive order from President Donald Trump aimed at overhauling elections in the U.S. The executive order sought to compel officials to require documentary proof of citizenship for everyone registering to vote for federal elections, accept only mailed ballots received by Election Day, and condition federal election grant funding on states adhering to the new ballot deadline. The ruling is a setback for the Trump administration's efforts to change election procedures.</p>

          <p>England has recalled left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone for their five-match T20 series against India, which is England's last before the 50-over World Cup in India and Sri Lanka from late September.
