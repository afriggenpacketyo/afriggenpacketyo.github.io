          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that Donald Trump will undertake a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This is an unusual honor, as second-term U.S. presidents are not traditionally offered a full state visit. The trip is seen as a significant diplomatic opportunity for the British government to engage with Trump on issues like the war in Ukraine and trade tariffs. The full program will include a ceremonial welcome and a state banquet involving senior members of the Royal Family.</p>

          <h2>Former Rent Board Member Defends Zohran Mamdani's Rent Freeze Proposal for New York City</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, former NYC Rent Guidelines Board member Leah Goodridge argues that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for a citywide rent freeze is a necessary and precedented policy, not an unrealistic idea. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she describes rent freezes as a lifeline for New Yorkers struggling with affordability. Goodridge contends that criticisms of the proposal are part of a broader agenda by landlord interests to weaken and ultimately dismantle rent stabilization protections, which would harm millions of residents.</p>

          <p>A new frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwich brand called Jams is launching in 3,000 Walmart stores, aiming to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Created by 26-year-old entrepreneur Connor Blakley and backed by high-profile athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, Jams positions itself as a healthier alternative. The product boasts no seed oils, artificial ingredients, or high fructose corn syrup, and contains more protein per ounce than its competitor. The launch represents a significant new entry into the convenient snack food market.</p>

          <p>This article explores the long and varied history of queerness, demonstrating that non-binary gender identities and same-sex relationships have existed across many cultures for centuries. It contrasts periods of acceptance, such as in ancient Greece and Rome, with eras of severe persecution legitimized by religious doctrine. The text highlights historical LGBTQ+ figures from Leonardo da Vinci to Anne Lister, as well as the existence of third-gender identities in various societies. It concludes by noting that modern-day rights are hard-won and must be continually protected against efforts to reverse them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the state-owned Post Office, suggesting it could be transformed into a mutual, employee-owned organization. This proposal comes as part of an effort to reform the institution's culture following the devastating Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also explore what services the Post Office should offer, particularly as high-street bank branches close. The government aims to start an "honest conversation" about the service's future vision and operational stability.</p>

          <p>A bomb-sniffing military dog named Sanson is being celebrated as a hero in Colombia for saving the lives of 36 soldiers and numerous civilians. While on a reconnaissance operation, Sanson detected a bomb planted by ELN guerrilla fighters on a community path, which then detonated. The blast shattered one of the dog's legs, which later had to be amputated, but his detection prevented a much larger tragedy. The Colombian army praised Sanson's bravery, stating his legacy will live on in every soldier he protected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues against the misconception that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement is a centrist or conservative scheme, asserting instead that its goals are fundamentally progressive and aligned with anti-monopoly principles. The author contends that restrictive zoning and land-use laws function as a form of regulatory capture by wealthy landowners to artificially limit housing supply and inflate their property values. By advocating for the removal of these barriers, the pro-housing abundance movement seeks to break this cartel, increase affordability, and create a fairer market for everyone, which is a populist, not a libertarian, goal.</p>

          <p>India's headline consumer inflation rate continued its downward trend in June, falling to 2.10%, a level lower than economists had forecast. This marks the eighth consecutive month of decline, driven largely by a continued drop in food prices, which registered at -1.06%. The cooling inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more flexibility to continue easing its monetary policy and potentially cut interest rates further. Strong crop production is expected to keep food inflation low, which could help boost domestic consumption and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
