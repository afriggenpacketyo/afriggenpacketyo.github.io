          <p>According to sources, China is planning to invite U.S. President Donald Trump to a military parade in September commemorating the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. This event would mark the first in-person meeting between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping since Trump's return to office. The invitation comes as the U.S. has proposed a visit by Xi during the same month. The potential joint celebration, which Russian President Vladimir Putin is also expected to attend, could present a complex diplomatic situation for Japan and other global powers amid ongoing trade tensions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Labour government has significantly altered its welfare reform bill after facing a substantial rebellion from over 120 of its own MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled but stated the government is now in a "better position" to pass the reforms. Key concessions include limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants only and ensuring the health-related component of Universal Credit will rise with inflation for existing recipients. Rebel MPs have indicated they are now likely to support the bill, narrowly avoiding a major defeat for the prime minister.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing market uncertainties, some top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending dividend-paying stocks as a strategy to enhance returns. This article highlights three such companies: McDonald's (MCD), EPR Properties (EPR), and Halliburton (HAL). Analysts favor McDonald's for its brand power and defensive qualities, EPR Properties for its improving cost of capital and growth potential in experiential real estate, and Halliburton for its strong international market presence and free cash flow generation. These selections are based on in-depth analysis of the companies' fundamentals and their consistent ability to provide shareholder dividends. (not investment advice)</p>

Dorsey, who has predicted Bitcoin's price could reach $1 million by 2030, emphasized the importance of the update on social media. He has consistently argued that Bitcoin needs to evolve from a simple store of value into a practical tool for everyday transactions to ensure its long-term relevance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) reflects on the challenge of maintaining hope and finding purpose amid a climate of political hostility and social despair. The author argues against succumbing to immobilization, advocating instead for channeling rage and sorrow into constructive action and community building. Citing examples from activists in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and former congresswoman Cori Bush, the piece emphasizes that resistance is found in mutual care and local organizing. The author concludes that humanity and connection are powerful forms of resistance that fascists cannot take away.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental increase, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million today. The company has grown from a niche electric sports car maker into one of the world's most valuable companies, though its stock has experienced significant volatility and a recent downturn in 2025. CEO Elon Musk now frames the company's future value on advancements in autonomous driving and humanoid robots rather than car sales alone. However, the company faces challenges from an aging vehicle lineup, increased competition, and concerns over Musk's unpredictable leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines dim cabin lights during takeoff and landing primarily as a critical safety measure, not to conserve energy. According to a pilot and a flight attendant, this procedure allows passengers' and crew's eyes to pre-adjust to darkness. This is crucial in the event of an emergency evacuation, particularly if there's a power failure, as it significantly reduces the time needed for eyes to adapt to low-light conditions. Dimming the lights also makes it easier to see emergency floor path lighting and to spot potential hazards outside the aircraft, such as fire or debris, during the most critical phases of a flight.</p>
