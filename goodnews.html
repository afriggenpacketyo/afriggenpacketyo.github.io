          <p>President Donald Trump has appointed Detroit-area entrepreneur Mark Savaya as Special Envoy to Iraq, publicly acknowledging Savaya's significant role in boosting Muslim American turnout for his campaign in Michigan. Trump praised Savaya's deep understanding of the Iraq-U.S. relationship and regional connections, anticipating these will help advance American interests. This appointment follows Trump's recent signing of a peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which he hailed as achieving "peace in the Middle East" and a step towards ending terror in the region. The administration aims to expand the Abraham Accords, with Savaya's diplomatic role potentially supporting further normalization deals between Israel and Arab/Muslim-majority nations.</p>

          <h2>Film Explores Japanese and American Baseball History Through Shohei Ohtani's Rise</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new film, “Diamond Diplomacy,” explores the intertwined history of Japanese and American baseball, using the journeys of four Japanese players, including Shohei Ohtani, to the Major Leagues as its narrative thread. The documentary highlights baseball's role in cultural exchange, from Babe Ruth's 1934 tour of Japan to post-WWII government-funded tours aimed at repairing relations between the two nations. It also touches on the challenges faced by Japanese American players during internment and the eventual integration of Japanese stars into MLB, like Hideo Nomo. Ohtani's current iconic status, with his best-selling jersey and cultural influence, symbolizes the profound impact of Japanese talent on American baseball and the evolution of this cross-cultural relationship.</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team secured a crucial four-run victory over India in Indore, advancing to the World Cup semi-finals with two group games remaining. This win is hailed as the most significant of the Charlotte Edwards/Nat Sciver-Brunt era, demonstrating England's newfound ability to perform under pressure after previous collapses in high-stakes matches. Despite India's formidable partnership and strong batting, England's improved body language and disciplined fielding allowed them to close out a tight match, a notable shift from past tendencies. Captain Heather Knight's sparkling century was pivotal, though concerns remain about the consistency of the middle order. The team now looks ahead to a challenging, unbeaten clash against their greatest rivals, Australia.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Owen Farrell's two-year absence from the national team is set to continue, as he was excluded from head coach Steve Borthwick's 36-man training squad for the autumn internationals. Saracens number eight Tom Willis also missed out due to his impending move to play in France for Bordeaux, rendering him ineligible. The squad sees the inclusion of former England Under-20s captain Emeka Ilione and 19-year-old Saracens wing Noah Caluori, who impressed on his Premiership debut. Borthwick has opted for other midfield options, while Farrell, despite returning to Test eligibility this summer, faces an extended period away from international rugby, highlighting a shift in team strategy.</p>

          <p>Centre-left politician Tufan Erhurman has won the Turkish Cypriot presidential elections with 62.8% of the vote, defeating hardliner incumbent Ersin Tatar. Erhurman's victory signals a major policy shift, as he campaigned on a platform of reinvigorating stalled U.N. talks to reunify Cyprus under a federal solution, a stance long supported by the United Nations. This contrasts sharply with Tatar's and Turkey's backing of a two-state policy, which Greek Cypriots have consistently ruled out. The outcome could help revive peace talks on the island, split since 1974, with both Turkish President Erdogan and Greek Cypriot leader Christodoulides congratulating Erhurman, signaling potential for renewed diplomatic engagement.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Salt Lake City last week after pilots discovered a crack in one of the multilayer windshield's layers. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is actively investigating the incident, with the damaged windshield being sent to its laboratory for examination to determine if an object struck it mid-flight. The aircraft, a Boeing 737 carrying 134 passengers and six crew members, landed safely in Salt Lake City, and passengers were transferred to another flight to Los Angeles. This incident highlights the robust safety protocols for aircraft design, as multilayer windshields are specifically engineered to maintain integrity even with damage to a single layer, ensuring passenger safety.</p>

          <p>Longtime Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga was laid to rest on Sunday in a state funeral, marking the culmination of days of national memorials across the country. Odinga, who died in India while receiving medical treatment, is reportedly the first non-president to receive full military honors, including a 17-gun salute. Thousands traveled to his rural home in western Kenya for the ceremony, which passed without major security incidents, unlike previous memorial events that saw five deaths. Odinga was revered for his fight against autocratic rule, and his death raises questions about the future of a political pact he signed with President William Ruto, who has vowed to honor the deal, despite uncertainty from Odinga's party.</p>

In a memorable QVC sketch, she portrayed a designer whose ergonomic neck pillow inadvertently resembled female genitalia, while Carpenter maintained an oblivious innocence, subtly pushing back against critics' interpretations. Her opening monologue and other sketches, including a "girlboss" seminar, directly or indirectly referenced controversies surrounding her album art, "Man's Best Friend," and bawdy live performances. Carpenter's performance demonstrated self-awareness, suggesting she is in on the joke and using humor and physical comedy to challenge misogynistic interpretations of her artistic expression and public image.</p>

          <p>Disgraced Republican U.S. Representative George Santos, recently released from prison after President Trump commuted his seven-year sentence for wire fraud and identity theft, has announced a new mission: prison reform. Santos told The Washington Post that his 84 days in federal prison were "dehumanizing" and "humbling," describing rotting facilities, thick black mold, and broken air conditioning. He plans to dedicate his life to this cause, having already spoken with President Trump about helping his administration achieve prison reform. Santos, who was expelled from Congress in 2023 after a damning ethics report, has stated he is not interested in running for office again for at least a decade, focusing instead on this new advocacy.</p>

          <p>Southeast Asia has achieved a dramatic reduction in smoking prevalence, falling from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, a success attributed to strong political commitment and comprehensive public health policies. Measures like increased taxation, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions have made tobacco less accessible and socially acceptable across most countries. However, challenges persist, including the World Health Organization's inconsistent regional definition that makes comparisons difficult, and a Lancet study indicating a 63% rise in the absolute number of smokers due to population growth. The region also faces the rapid rise of e-cigarettes and political resistance to stricter regulations in some countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, where the vaping industry holds significant economic and political sway.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to cancel student debt under programs it had previously partially blocked, reopening a path to student loan forgiveness for millions of borrowers. This outcome stems from an agreement reached on Friday between the U.S. Department of Education and the American Federation of Teachers, which had filed a lawsuit accusing officials of blocking mandated programs. The Education Department will now process forgiveness for eligible borrowers in the original Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR) and Pay as You Earn (PAYE) plans, though these programs are slated to phase out by July 1, 2028, under President Trump's "big beautiful bill." Additionally, borrowers eligible for forgiveness in 2025 will not owe federal taxes on the relief, providing significant financial benefit. (not investment advice)</p>

Bolivia is currently grappling with its worst economic crisis in decades, marked by a shortage of U.S. dollars, a devalued currency, and 23% inflation, its highest since 1991.

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has hinted that the government is considering cutting the 5% VAT rate on energy bills, ahead of the Chancellor's Budget in November. Miliband acknowledged the country's "cost-of-living crisis" and stated that "all of these issues" are being examined, though he wouldn't speculate on specific budget decisions. While Labour previously pledged to lower average bills by £300 a year by 2030, Miliband emphasized that the long-term solution lies in transitioning to home-grown, clean power to reduce fossil fuel dependence. Scrapping the VAT rate could save average households £86 annually, but would cost the Treasury an estimated £2.5bn per year, with other options like reducing regulatory levies also under consideration.</p>

He stated that at a time when people are "really struggling," the focus should be on the "super wealthy." The party's manifesto proposed an annual tax of 1% on assets above £10m and 2% on assets above £1bn, which Polanski estimates could raise £15bn-£25bn annually. Critics, however, warn such a tax could penalize savings and investment while encouraging wealthy individuals to leave the country. Polanski also advocated for aligning capital gains tax with income tax, emphasizing the need to tax unearned wealth and for everyone to contribute to public services.</p>
