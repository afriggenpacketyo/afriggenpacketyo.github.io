        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, experienced a significant jump in their Hong Kong trading debut, rising as much as 14%. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. Despite a 9.7% drop in 2024 annual revenue due to intense competition, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S., China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April. This contrasts with market concerns over rising Treasury yields and a Moody's downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, as investors move away from U.S. dollar assets. The Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, topping U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are making emerging markets more attractive.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government will launch offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide using cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology, Eneos Corp., and others to study seaweed behavior at significant depths and assess environmental impacts. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon, seeking to offset declining CO2 absorption by forests due to aging trees.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced its key lending rates by 10 basis points, marking the first reduction since October, in an effort to boost the economy. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) was lowered to 3.0% from 3.1%, and the 5-year LPR to 3.5% from 3.6%. This move comes as part of a broader stimulus package, including reductions to the lending rates and the amount of cash that banks must hold in reserves. The Chinese offshore yuan has remained relatively stable, supported by a weakening U.S. dollar.</p>

          <p>A new UK-EU deal, the first of many annual summits planned, underscores the ongoing complexity of their relationship post-Brexit. The agreement aims to ease trade frictions, but specifics regarding timeframes and costs are still being negotiated. Some Brexiteers criticize the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, trading some power for easier trade. The deal will determine the cost, defence cooperation, youth travel, and mutual recognition of professional qualifications. While the government touts a "reset," the trajectory of the relationship remains subject to change with future administrations.</p>

          <p>The Senate advanced a crypto regulation bill, the GENIUS Act, after Democratic opposition tanked an initial vote earlier in the month due to concerns about the Trump family's ties to the digital asset industry. The legislation aims to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency tied to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. The measure moved forward in a 66-32 vote after gaining support from some Democratic holdouts, with Senator Mark Warner advocating for the measure as a "meaningful step forward."</p>
