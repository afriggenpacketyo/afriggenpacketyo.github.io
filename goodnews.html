        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A British survey reveals that nearly half of young adults in Europe would prefer a time without the Internet, prompting a Dutch startup to organize offline meetups. The Offline Club, with almost 530,000 Instagram followers, encourages people to disconnect from social media and engage in real-world activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies show that young people spend over three hours daily on smartphones, leading to mental health problems such as depression and anxiety. Governments in the UK, Norway, and Australia are considering measures like digital curfews and age limits to address excessive smartphone use and its harmful effects.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts announced that Shohei Ohtani's return to the mound is likely to occur after the All-Star break. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters in a simulated game, marking his first time since elbow surgery in September 2023. The Dodgers initially considered an earlier return but prioritized his hitting during spring training while slowing down his pitching rehabilitation. The natural progression of building a starter up to five or six innings makes a pre-All-Star return unlikely.</p>

          <p>The Pacific Coast Highway (PCH) in Malibu has reopened just in time for Memorial Day weekend after being closed due to the Palisades Fire in January. The closure had isolated Malibu, but the reopening is seen as a sign of recovery from the fire that killed 12 people and burned over 23,000 acres. While some locals are concerned about increased traffic and insensitive tourists, businesses are hopeful for a robust summer season. The area still shows signs of devastation, but progress is being made in clearing debris and rebuilding.</p>

          <p>A major Japanese tutoring company, Trygroup Inc., has apologized for inaccurately describing Minamata disease as hereditary in its online study material. The false claim appeared in a video lesson for junior high school students, prompting criticism from patients, victims, and the Environment Ministry. Minamata disease is a neurological disorder caused by mercury poisoning from contaminated seafood in the Minamata Bay area, with the Japanese government recognizing the cause in 1968. The company has since removed the video and issued a statement of apology.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways became the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership, marking the start of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the country's rail services by 2027. The move aims to address the poor reputation of Britain's railways, characterized by frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed this as a watershed moment, while rail unions expressed their support for the state takeover. The government anticipates saving up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators through this renationalization effort.</p>

          <p>Michelle Renee, a California mother, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank, but was later falsely painted as a criminal in court during the trial of her kidnappers. The men, led by Christopher Butler, broke into her home, strapped fake dynamite to her and her daughter, and forced her to rob the bank. Despite overwhelming evidence of her innocence, the defense attorneys attacked her character, bringing up her past as a stripper and inconsistencies in her resume. Butler was eventually convicted, but Lisa Ramirez, another suspect, was acquitted, highlighting the challenges Renee faced in proving her innocence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may pass anxiety to their dogs. Researchers found that when owners dwell on work problems, their dogs exhibit more stress-related behaviors like whining and pacing. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to dogs' sensitivity to their owners' moods and changes in care routines. The study suggests that employed dog owners should avoid work-related ruminations at home to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

The government will also cover the cost of rented accommodation for chefs who prefer it, and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya emphasized the significant role chefs play in hosting foreign dignitaries.
