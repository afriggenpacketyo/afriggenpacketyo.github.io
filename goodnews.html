          <p>The European Central Bank's chief economist, Philip Lane, announced that the recent cycle of monetary policy interventions to control inflation is now considered "done." This declaration follows the eurozone's inflation rate falling to 1.9%, just below the bank's 2% target, and a reduction of the key interest rate from 4% to 2% over the past year. While the primary mission of taming the 2021-2022 price shocks is over, the ECB remains prepared to adapt to new economic developments and will continue monitoring data closely.

          <p>At a technology conference in Bangkok, panelists argued for the importance of nations developing "sovereign AI" to maintain strategic control over their own data and technological infrastructure. They highlighted that emerging economies can build AI systems tailored to their specific languages and cultures by utilizing open-source models and accessible cloud computing services. This approach aims to democratize access to artificial intelligence, preventing its benefits from being concentrated within a few global tech powers and fostering inclusive growth.</p>

          <p>According to royal experts, Prince William has adopted a firm stance that his uncle, Prince Andrew, will have no future formal role within the monarchy. The Duke of York is reportedly seen as a significant "reputational risk" due to his controversial associations, and William is determined to sideline him to protect the institution. This decision is said to be fully supported by King Charles, effectively ending Andrew's public royal life, though he may still attend private family gatherings.</p>

          <p>Beijing has reportedly offered tax refunds to major French cognac producers, including Hennessy and Martell, in an effort to resolve an ongoing anti-dumping investigation. To qualify, the companies must agree to a minimum selling price and commit to fair trade practices, according to a source. This development comes as a July 5 deadline nears, after which temporary tariffs of up to 39% on European brandy could be made permanent if no agreement is reached between the two sides.</p>

          <p>The British government has initiated a "landmark" review of its entire parental leave and pay system, which has not undergone significant reform in decades. The 18-month review will assess maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave policies, which have been criticized as confusing and among the least generous in the developed world. Campaigners are hopeful the review will lead to a modernized system that better supports working families and addresses the very low take-up rates for paternity and shared leave options.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have created a new framework that uses satellite remote sensing technology to accurately measure carbon dioxide emissions from individual power plants. This method provides a high-precision, standardized approach for global carbon inventory, addressing a current gap in transparent emissions monitoring. The scientists suggest this technology has significant potential for tracking other industrial emission sources, such as oil and gas fields or steel manufacturing plants, contributing to better environmental oversight.</p>
