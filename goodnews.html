          <p>China's Tiangong space station has surpassed the International Space Station (ISS) in a key area of space research, specifically in developing heat-resistant materials. Scientists aboard Tiangong successfully conducted experiments using a container-free laboratory cabinet to suspend and heat tiny metal samples to extreme temperatures, reaching around 3,000 degrees. These findings are crucial for designing advanced tungsten alloys and supporting fundamental research for fusion reactors, rocket engines, and hypersonic vehicles. The achievement underscores the reliability of the cabinet, which has been operational for four years, and highlights China's growing prowess in high-temperature materials science in orbit.</p>

          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has become Netflix's most-viewed film ever, accumulating over 236 million views since its June release and surpassing "Red Notice." The film, produced by Sony Pictures Animation, follows a fictional K-pop girl band battling demons, and has achieved global success through word-of-mouth, viral social media content, and its highly popular soundtrack. Songs from the movie have topped Spotify charts and the Billboard Hot 100, making its fictional groups the highest-charting K-pop acts in U.S. Spotify history. Netflix has capitalized on this success with a sing-along version, which also became a U.S. box office number one, with a sequel reportedly in early development.</p>

          <p>Coco Gauff overcame a challenging first-round match at the US Open, defeating Ajla Tomljanović 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in nearly three hours. Despite struggling with 10 double faults and six breaks of serve, the No. 3 seed demonstrated resilience, particularly after faltering while serving for the match in the third set. Gauff acknowledged her serve remains a work in progress, a focus of recent team changes, but expressed satisfaction at navigating the early-round pressure. Her victory keeps alive her ambition to potentially achieve the world No. 1 ranking, as she advances to face Donna Vekić in the next round.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits in July saw a notable recovery, declining by a slower rate of 1.5% year-on-year, marking the smallest drop in five months. This improvement is attributed to Beijing's policy interventions aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels, which have enhanced companies' profit margins. While state-backed firms still experienced a 7.5% profit drop in the first seven months, businesses with foreign investments saw a 1.8% increase, and manufacturing and utilities sectors also improved. This data suggests a partial success in government efforts to boost profitability and economic stability within China's industrial sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Less than eight months after the Eaton and Palisades wildfires devastated Los Angeles County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is nearing completion of its federal cleanup efforts, clearing wreckage from nearly 10,000 residential properties. Officials celebrated this as the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history, finishing roughly four months ahead of schedule. The operation involved removing 2.5 million tons of debris, including hazardous materials, paving the way for communities to begin rebuilding. Despite some homeowner complaints about the work's quality, the rapid response has provided a foundation for physical and emotional healing, with many areas now transitioning into the reconstruction phase.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated retail crime ring, responsible for over 600 thefts and an estimated $10 million in stolen merchandise from Home Depot stores across Southern California, has been dismantled. Authorities announced 48 felony counts against nine alleged key players in "Operation Kill Switch," including the ringleader, David Ahl, who resold high-value items through his electronics storefront. The criminal enterprise, which sometimes hit multiple stores daily, involved family members and multiple boosting crews. Law enforcement seized $3.7 million in stolen property and over $800,000 in illicit money, highlighting a successful inter-agency effort bolstered by new legislation allowing consolidation of multi-county retail crime charges.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, achieving critical milestones after a series of previous failures. The 40-story-tall rocket deployed eight dummy Starlink satellites and performed a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean for its upper stage, while the Super Heavy booster also landed as planned in the Gulf of Mexico. Despite some reentry damage to the Starship's heat shield and a control flap, the vehicle remained controllable, marking a significant step forward for Elon Musk's vision of Mars colonization and NASA's Artemis moon landing program. This success is crucial for proving the rocket's reusability and operational capabilities.</p>

          <p>A German court has convicted a 16-year-old Syrian national, Mohammad A., for supporting a foiled plot to attack Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna last year. The teenager received a suspended 18-month sentence for preparing a serious act of violence and supporting a terrorist act abroad, having confessed to his role. Prosecutors stated he supported the Islamic State group's ideology and communicated with an Austrian individual planning to use knives or explosives outside the stadium, where up to 30,000 onlookers were expected. This conviction highlights international efforts to counter terrorism and protect large public gatherings from extremist threats.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking collaboration between U.S. and Chinese researchers has achieved a significant scientific first: converting diverse plastic waste directly into petrol in a single step, at ambient temperature and pressure. Published in the journal Science, this method also yields chemical raw materials and hydrochloric acid, which can be used in various industries including water treatment, pharmaceuticals, and petroleum. The team, comprising scientists from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, Columbia University, Technical University of Munich, and East China Normal University, emphasizes that this innovation strongly supports a circular economy by transforming difficult-to-degrade mixed plastics into valuable products efficiently.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have finalized their initial 53-man roster for Year 2 under Coach Jim Harbaugh, with quarterback Trey Lance winning the backup role to Justin Herbert. Notable cuts included veteran quarterback Taylor Heinicke and safety Tony Jefferson, alongside 25 other players. The team faces challenges with injuries, placing several players on injured reserve, including linebacker Junior Colson for the season. Despite a much-improved offensive line on paper, injuries have forced reshuffles, leaving depth razor-thin in some areas. The roster reflects a focus on a run-oriented offense and strong special teams, as the team aims to shed its postseason underachiever label.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has reversed its decision to adopt a new, modernized logo following significant public backlash, including criticism from President Donald Trump. The company announced it would retain its traditional "Old Timer" figure, acknowledging customer feedback. The initial rebrand, unveiled with a new menu, removed the iconic image of a man leaning against a barrel, leading to accusations that the chain was abandoning its Southern-style, nostalgic roots. Trump applauded the reversal, suggesting the company gained valuable publicity, while a branding expert noted the rebrand failed by going against the brand's established story. Shares in the company had initially dropped following the announcement of the new logo.</p>
