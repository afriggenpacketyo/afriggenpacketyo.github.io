          <h2>Bank of Japan Considers Slower Bond-Buying Cuts Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 06:25:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to reduce its government bond-buying at a slower pace than initially planned, starting in April 2026, amid concerns about trade and economic uncertainties. Governor Kazuo Ueda expressed worries about the Japanese economy, particularly due to potential impacts from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff hikes, noting that downside risks now outweigh upside ones for growth and prices. The BOJ will decrease debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, aiming for a monthly purchase of about 2 trillion yen by early 2027. Ueda emphasized the need for a cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy, pledging to make nimble responses to stabilize the market and review the pace of bond purchase reductions if necessary.

          <p>Santa Monica community gardeners are protesting a proposed 200% fee increase for garden plots, which could force some residents to vacate their spaces. The city aims to generate $30,000 in revenue to address a $60-million budget shortfall, but gardeners argue the increase threatens accessibility for residents and could turn the gardens into a "rich person's playground." Community members are voicing opposition, emphasizing the value of the gardens for residents, especially seniors and those in subsidized housing.
