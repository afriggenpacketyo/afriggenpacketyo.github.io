          <p>The CEOs of major companies, including Uber, Dell, and Goldman Sachs, are expected to announce multi-billion dollar investments into 'Trump accounts' for newborns. This initiative, part of President Trump's pilot program, aims to deposit $1,000 from the government into investment accounts for newborn Americans. The 'Invest America' roundtable at the White House will feature commitments from corporate leaders, with the goal of bolstering financial security for future generations. The provision passed the House as part of a budget bill and is awaiting Senate approval, facing some Republican pushback. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Referendums in Italy concerning citizenship and labor reforms are likely to fail due to low voter turnout, marking a victory for Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who opposed the measures. With only about 30% of eligible voters participating, the referendums, which require a 50% plus one voter participation to be legally binding, are unlikely to pass. The referendums addressed workplace protections and easing citizenship laws for non-EU immigrants. Supporters hoped easing citizenship would address Italy's low birth rates and integrate foreign workers to boost the economy, but the low turnout signals a strengthening of Meloni's government.</p>

The issue had lingered on the political news agenda for nearly a year, drawing complaints from Labour MPs and voters. The government has since adjusted the threshold and expanded eligibility, aiming to address concerns and regain public trust.</p>
