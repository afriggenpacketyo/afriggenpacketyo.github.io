          <p>YouTuber-turned-boxer Jake Paul has officially entered the World Boxing Association's cruiserweight rankings at number 14, making him eligible for a world title bout. This development follows his recent victory over Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. and positions him for a potential fight against WBA champion Gilberto ‚ÄòZurdo‚Äô Ram√≠rez. While a significant milestone for Paul, critics suggest the WBA's decision reflects his immense financial drawing power more than a traditional boxing career path. Paul continues to express his ambition to become a world champion.</p>

          <p>Collaborative design software company Figma has officially filed for an initial public offering, planning to trade on the NYSE under the ticker "FIG." The move comes after a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee for Figma. The company has shown strong growth, with revenue up 46% in the first quarter and a growing base of high-value customers. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public aims to allow the broader community to share in Figma's ownership.</p>

          <p>A person walking along a beach in Walton County, Florida, discovered a large quantity of cocaine, valued at nearly half a million dollars, that had washed ashore. The 25 kilos of narcotics were distinctively wrapped in packaging featuring the cartoon character Yosemite Sam. The local sheriff's office confiscated the drugs and issued a public warning not to touch any suspicious packages found on the coast. This incident is the latest in a series of discoveries where large quantities of illicit drugs, often in unique packaging, have been found on Florida's beaches.</p>

          <p>A late header from 21-year-old Gonzalo Garc√≠a propelled Real Madrid to a 1-0 victory over Juventus, advancing them to the Club World Cup quarterfinals. The match, which also featured the long-awaited debut of Kylian Mbapp√© for Madrid, was largely a stalemate until Garc√≠a's decisive goal.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a sweeping new law that bans smoking in most public areas, including beaches, parks, and near schools, in an effort to "denormalize" tobacco use. The move aims to protect public health, particularly children, as over 200 people in France die from tobacco-related illnesses daily. Violators of the new ban face fines up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While smoking has been illegal in restaurants and bars since 2008, this law extends the restrictions significantly, with sidewalk caf√© terraces remaining one of the last public refuges for smokers.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team defeated England by 24 runs in Bristol, taking a commanding 2-0 lead in their five-match T20 series. After an early stumble, India recovered to post a strong total of 181-4, thanks to impressive half-centuries from Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early and could not recover, managing only 157-7 despite a notable 54 from Tammy Beaumont. The result highlights England's ongoing batting struggles and India's growing confidence ahead of the upcoming 50-over World Cup.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Thom Tillis's announcement that he will not seek reelection has ignited a fierce, wide-open race for his North Carolina Senate seat in 2026. On the Republican side, potential candidates include the president's daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, who has received his endorsement, and several congressmen. For the Democrats, former Governor Roy Cooper is strongly considering a run and is seen as a top contender, though former U.S. Representative Wiley Nickel has already entered the race. The open seat presents a key opportunity for Democrats to flip a seat in the closely divided Senate.</p>

          <p>Stocks for clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant jump after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the final Senate version of the Republican spending bill. The tax, which would have targeted projects using components from China, was described by industry groups as punitive and could have cost the sector up to $7 billion. While the bill still phases out key clean energy tax credits, the removal of the new tax was seen as a limited but positive development for the renewable energy industry. (not investment advice)</p>
