          <p>Oscar-winning actor Riz Ahmed shared insights into his career and personal life, recounting his "worst audition" for "Slumdog Millionaire" and his serendipitous meeting with his wife, novelist Fatima Farheen Mirza, in a Brooklyn cafe. Ahmed, also a rapper and Oscar winner for his short film "The Long Goodbye," discussed how becoming a father has deeply influenced his artistry, making him realize the extent to which loved ones co-author one's work. He is currently promoting his new summer thriller, "Relay," where he portrays Ash, a loner who facilitates payoffs between whistleblowers and corrupt entities, a role he describes as reminiscent of classic, edge-of-your-seat thrillers.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones publicly accused Micah Parsons' agent, David Mulugheta, of obstructing contract negotiations for the two-time All-Pro defensive end. Jones claimed the organization had reached an agreement on terms, amount, and guarantees with Parsons directly, only for the agent to demand further negotiation. Parsons, who is entering the final season of his five-year rookie contract and seeking a new deal around $40 million annually, has been staging a "hold-in" and previously requested a trade, emphasizing the need for his agent's presence. Jones stated the offered deal would have made Parsons the highest-paid guaranteed player in the NFL, excluding quarterbacks, highlighting the public fallout of the dispute.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his speech at the annual Jackson Hole gathering, characterized the current economic landscape as a "challenging situation," balancing a hiring slowdown with tariff-driven price increases. Powell noted the "clearly visible" effects of tariffs on consumer prices, expecting them to accumulate in coming months, while also observing a "shifting balance of risks" that "may warrant adjusting our policy stance." This statement was widely interpreted by futures markets as a strong indication of potential interest rate cuts at the Fed's next meeting. The central bank faces the bind of stimulating the economy without worsening inflation, all while navigating persistent political pressure from President Trump for rate reductions, emphasizing the importance of the Fed's independence.

          <p>Waymo, Alphabet's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, has secured its first permit from the New York Department of Transportation to commence testing self-driving cars within New York City. This milestone represents the city's inaugural launch of autonomous vehicle testing, with Waymo planning to deploy up to eight vehicles in Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn until late September, with potential for extension. Crucially, New York state law requires a trained human driver to be present behind the wheel during these operations. This expansion aligns with Waymo's broader national growth strategy, including recent launches in Austin and San Francisco, and signifies a major step towards integrating autonomous technology into the complex and bustling urban landscape of New York.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom's social media strategy, which involves expertly parodying President Donald Trump's distinctive online rants and use of exclamation points, has elicited strong reactions from MAGA supporters and even some Fox News commentators. The article posits that Newsom's satirical posts act as an effective mirror, compelling observers to critically assess Trump's public persona. While some critics, including Dana Perino, argue Newsom should adopt a more "serious" demeanor, the commentary suggests these parodies effectively expose a double standard in how Trump's behavior is often excused. This unconventional approach aims to reveal the perceived absurdity of Trump's antics without resorting to conventional political attacks.</p>

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his high-profile libel case against The Guardian, which had published extensive allegations of sexual misconduct against him in 2021. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, ruling that the newspaper successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest, concluding the core meaning of the articles was "substantially true." The judge explicitly found Clarke to be "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejected his assertion of an "unlawful conspiracy" by the more than 20 women who testified against him. The Guardian's editor-in-chief welcomed the decision as a "deserved victory for those women who suffered" and a significant landmark for investigative journalism.</p>

          <p>Texas Instruments is embarking on a monumental $60 billion manufacturing megaproject across the U.S., with Apple committing to produce "critical foundation semiconductors" for its iPhones and other devices at TI's new chip fabrication plants in Utah and Texas. This significant investment aligns with President Trump's policy of incentivizing domestic manufacturing through tariffs. Although TI's shares experienced an initial dip following weak guidance and tariff concerns, analysts view the expansion of its US foundries as a strategic advantage for achieving cost competitiveness against chips produced in Taiwan. The ambitious project is set to quintuple TI's manufacturing capacity, generate 60,000 US jobs, and is addressing talent shortages through robust partnerships with universities and the military.

          <p>John Deere is at a critical juncture, grappling with significantly weaker demand in the agricultural sector, which has resulted in notable year-over-year decreases in net income and sales. The company recently announced 238 layoffs, adding to thousands over the past year, directly attributing these reductions to decreased demand and lower order volumes. Despite these immediate challenges, Deere is committed to a "bold move," investing $20 billion into U.S. manufacturing over the next decade, partly to reinforce its "Made in the USA" credentials amidst political pressure. Analysts, however, express optimism for a future rebound, citing growth in Europe and South America, and view the current cost-cutting measures as a disciplined strategy within a cyclical industry.

          <p>A threatened red-cockaded woodpecker species is remarkably thriving within the Avon Park Air Force Range in Florida, an active military bombing range that conservation biologists have successfully converted into a vital sanctuary. Strategic translocation efforts between 1998 and 2016, involving 54 woodpeckers, yielded successful long-term outcomes, with approximately 70% of relocated birds surviving and forming breeding pairs that produced offspring with stronger survival rates. This initiative not only boosted the species' overall population but also restored crucial genetic diversity, underscoring the effectiveness of translocation when combined with habitat management strategies like controlled burns. The success in this unexpected location, which encompasses over 35,000 acres of suitable pine savannas, offers significant hope for managing other imperiled species.</p>

          <p>Recent earnings reports from major retailers, including Walmart and Home Depot, suggest that President Trump's tariff increases have not yet severely impacted big retailers or consumer spending, largely due to strategic mitigation efforts. Companies have managed to avoid widespread price hikes by diversifying their sourcing, pushing back on vendor costs, and making selective price adjustments. While some lower-income households are exhibiting sensitivity to price changes, overall consumer spending remains resilient, with strong sales observed in discretionary items. Retailers are also actively developing new revenue streams, such as advertising businesses and third-party marketplaces, to offset potential tariff costs, though uncertainties regarding future tariff rates and evolving market conditions continue to exist.

          <p>Chocolate lovers should brace for further price increases, a delayed consequence of soaring cocoa prices that reached record highs due to adverse weather, pest outbreaks, and supply shortages in West Africa. Although cocoa futures have slightly eased this year, they remain historically elevated, and these increased costs are being transferred to consumers, subsequently dampening demand for sweet treats. Swiss chocolate manufacturers report significant pressure on their margins and anticipate additional price adjustments. However, J.P. Morgan analysts foresee a potentially brighter outlook by next Easter, as industrial demand softens and cocoa supply gradually improves with increased production and maturing new plantings, though overall prices are still expected to remain structurally higher.
