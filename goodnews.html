          <p>Amid rising prices for package holidays, travelers are employing various strategies to save significant amounts of money on their vacations. Techniques highlighted by budget-conscious consumers include booking trips at the last minute, traveling during off-peak seasons, and searching for "kids go free" deals to cut costs drastically. Other creative methods involve using home-swapping websites to eliminate accommodation expenses, accumulating and using credit card loyalty points for flights, and opting for house-sitting arrangements to enjoy free lodging. These hacks demonstrate a growing trend of resourcefulness in making travel more affordable.</p>

          <p>The third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden concluded a historic trilogy in women's boxing, with Taylor securing another victory. Unlike their previous explosive encounters, this match was a more tactical and controlled affair, with both fighters adjusting their strategies. This article reflects on the bout not as a spectacle of chaos but as a mark of progress, arguing that true equality in the sport includes the right for women to fight strategically and win without needing to be thrilling entertainers. It also explores the broader contradictions within women's boxing, from pay disparities to the athletes' right to choose risk for glory.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned at Sotheby's in New York. The rock is estimated to fetch between $2 million and $4 million, representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet. It is believed to have been ejected from Mars by an asteroid impact before landing in the Sahara desert, where it was found in Niger in 2023. The auction also features a rare juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton, highlighting a growing market for significant natural history artifacts.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has declared an end to its four-decade-long armed conflict with Turkey, initiating a disarmament process with a symbolic ceremony in Iraqi Kurdistan. This move follows a call for peace from the group's imprisoned leader, Abdullah Ocalan, and has been cautiously welcomed by the Turkish government as an opportunity for reconciliation. The PKK has outlined several demands for a complete disarmament, including Ocalan's release and legal reforms for other political prisoners. A successful peace process could significantly improve Turkey's domestic stability and enhance its diplomatic relations throughout the Middle East.</p>

          <p>The remains of a wooden boat dating back to the late 18th century have been discovered by workers installing a water pipeline in the Old Town harbor of Dubrovnik, Croatia. The vessel was found embedded in the seabed, and marine archaeologists have confirmed its age through radiocarbon analysis. The discovery in the historic city, famously used as a filming location for "Game of Thrones," adds another layer to its rich maritime history. The shipwreck is now being protected for further examination, joining a series of other significant underwater archaeological finds across Europe this year.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the Live Aid concert is being remembered as a landmark moment in global fundraising and media, but also re-examined through a more critical lens. The event, which united billions of viewers and raised millions for famine relief in Ethiopia, set a new standard for benefit concerts and put global poverty on the political agenda. However, retrospective analyses highlight significant flaws, including the lack of African performers and a reinforcement of a "white savior" narrative. The anniversary sparks a debate about its true impact and whether such an event could be replicated in today's media landscape.</p>

          <p>A campaign is growing in the UK to require cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in plain English, rather than the currently used Latin-based universal system. Advocates, including MP Becky Gittins who has a severe nut allergy, argue that the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) is incomprehensible to most consumers, putting those with allergies at serious risk. While some brands voluntarily provide English translations, it is not a legal requirement. The industry's trade association defends the INCI system, stating it provides a globally harmonized language for ingredients, ensuring consistency across countries.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study indicates that China's dams on the upper reaches of the Brahmaputra River may not cause the droughts in India that have long been feared. The research, based on data from two existing dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, suggests the opposite effect is occurring. By regulating water release, the dams have significantly increased the river's flow during the dry season, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This finding could reframe the conversation around the controversial mega-dam project planned for Tibet, suggesting its impact on downstream water availability might be more complex than previously assumed.</p>
