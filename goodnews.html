          <p>An American Airlines flight at Denver International Airport was evacuated after a "possible landing gear incident" during takeoff. All 173 passengers and six crew members were safely removed from the Boeing 737 MAX 8. The airline confirmed a maintenance issue with a tire, and the FAA is investigating the event, which caused a temporary ground stop and dozens of flight delays. One person was transported for a minor injury, while several others were evaluated at the scene but did not require further medical attention.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Postal Service is celebrating its 250th anniversary, marking the occasion with an event at the Smithsonian's National Postal Museum and the release of two new commemorative stamps. One stamp honors Benjamin Franklin, the first postmaster general, while the other celebrates postal workers. Founded on July 26, 1775, the postal service has been a crucial part of American history. The celebration comes amid discussions about the agency's future, though the new postmaster general has affirmed his commitment to keeping it a public service.</p>

          <p>Following the passing of Ozzy Osbourne, this article reflects on his unexpected second wave of fame as a reality TV star in the early 2000s. The MTV show "The Osbournes" pioneered the "reality sitcom" format, showcasing the mundane yet chaotic home life of the heavy metal legend and his family. Before the Kardashians, the show's blend of celebrity life and relatable family dynamics captivated millions and won an Emmy. Producers and critics note how the series established many reality TV tropes and paved the way for a new genre of celebrity-focused programming.</p>

          <p>The remains of U.S. Army Air Forces 1st Lt. Henry J. Carlin have been identified nearly 80 years after his bomber crashed during a raid in Burma in 1943. Carlin, a 27-year-old from Philadelphia, was one of four crew members whose remains were unrecovered after the war and were buried as "unknowns." Scientists at the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency used dental, anthropological, and DNA analysis to make the positive identification. His remains will be buried at Arlington National Cemetery, bringing long-awaited closure to his family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Euro 2025 final approaching, this article explores the science behind the intense anxiety and physical reactions fans experience during high-stakes matches. Experts explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge, causing a "fight or flight" response that can raise heart rates and affect sleep and behavior. Psychologists advise fans to manage these effects by getting adequate rest, eating well, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. Ultimately, they suggest reframing the nervous jitters as part of an enjoyable, communal experience that allows for emotional expression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures remaining below normal and daytime highs struggling to leave the 60s. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface and cools the air. While some residents are enjoying the temperate weather as a reprieve from heatwaves elsewhere, the persistent gray, drizzly conditions are a notable departure from typical summer patterns. Experts caution that hotter weather could still arrive later in the season.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to better protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, which have threatened the existence of several establishments. Under the proposed changes, developers building new properties near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing. The reforms also aim to fast-track permissions for new businesses and outdoor areas in designated locations to help revitalize struggling town centers. While the government touts the changes as a boost to the hospitality industry, the opposition criticizes the move as hypocritical.</p>

The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the event. While no passengers reported injuries, one flight attendant was treated for minor injuries and another was hospitalized upon landing, but the flight continued to its destination safely.</p>
