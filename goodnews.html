          <p>Toyota has announced that the redesigned 2026 RAV4 SUV will be offered exclusively as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. This decision reflects the growing popularity and customer demand for hybrid vehicles, aligning with Toyota's long-standing leadership in hybrid technology. The move comes despite a slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles, with automakers increasingly turning to hybrid models to meet fuel economy regulations. In 2024, electrified vehicle sales accounted for 43.1% of Toyota's domestic sales, and the RAV4's hybrid variants already represent a significant portion of its sales.</p>

          <p>A new report by ICF forecasts a significant increase in electricity demand, potentially jumping by 78% by 2050, alongside rising costs, posing substantial energy challenges for the United States. This growth is attributed to rising temperatures, emerging technologies like cryptocurrency mining, data centers, and electric vehicles. Retail electricity costs are expected to double by 2050, impacting affordability for consumers. Electric grid operators are already sounding alarms about elevated summer temperatures, emphasizing the need for adequate resources to maintain grid reliability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists predict that the Axial Seamount, an underwater volcano located 300 miles off the Oregon coast, could erupt later this year. The volcano, which last erupted in 2015, is showing signs of increased activity, though scientists emphasize that the eruption poses no danger to people on land. The first sign of an eruption will be a sharp increase in the number of earthquakes around the volcano, caused by magma moving toward the surface. Experts expect the eruption to continue slowly for about a month, with lava flows spreading across the caldera.</p>

          <p>Palo Alto Networks reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue for its April quarter, but shares fell in extended trading. Despite the positive results, the company's unchanged full-year outlook for key metrics like remaining performance obligation and next-gen security annual recurring revenue may have disappointed investors. Palo Alto Networks is at an inflection point in customer adoption for its next-generation security suite, including AI-powered Cortex XSIAM and Prisma SASE. The company's platformization strategy, aimed at consolidating customer cybersecurity spending, is gaining momentum.</p>
