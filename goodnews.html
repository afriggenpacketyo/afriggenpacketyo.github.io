        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses how Northern California's commercial crab season is threatened by migrating humpback whales. Fishermen are facing restrictions due to whale entanglements in traditional crab cage ropes. One fisherman, Brand Little, uses a high-tech pop-up system developed by the U.S. military to avoid whale entanglements, allowing him to continue fishing. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife shortened the crab season to protect whales, but Little's innovative technology allows him to fish without harming them.</p>

          <p>New York University has withheld the diploma of Logan Rozos, a graduate who condemned the Gaza war in his commencement speech, accusing the U.S. of supporting "genocide." The university stated that Rozos abused his privilege to express personal political views and is pursuing disciplinary action. Rozos, who identifies as an "actor, artist, and gay Black trans man," criticized the U.S.'s political and military support for what he described as a genocide.

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers are on the verge of striking due to a dispute over pay raises, with a potential strike impacting over 300,000 commuters. Negotiations are ongoing between NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET), which represents about 460 members. The union says engineers haven't had a raise in five years, while NJ Transit claims their offer was competitive. A contingency plan is in place to accommodate 20% of daily riders if a strike occurs, with cross-honoring of tickets on buses and light rail lines.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene era. This migration occurred when lower sea levels created a land bridge connecting the two continents. Fossils of Dalianensis horses, found in northeastern China, show a mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations. These horses, which lived around 17,000 years ago, were slightly larger than modern wild horses, and genetic exchanges occurred between the continents in both directions.</p>

          <p>Walmart has cautioned that despite reduced tariffs on Chinese imports, the company may still need to raise prices on certain items. CEO Doug McMillon stated that even at lower levels, tariffs create cost pressures that impede the retailer's ability to maintain low prices for customers. The price hikes are expected to take effect later this month, joining other retailers in warning of increased costs due to trade policies. Walmart, a key indicator of consumer spending, also pulled its quarterly profit outlook amid global economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>The availability of COVID-19 vaccines this fall is uncertain due to new clinical testing requirements, potentially limiting shots to older Americans and those with chronic health issues. The Department of Health and Human Services announced that substantial updates to existing vaccines, including seasonal strain changes, may require additional clinical evaluation. This could delay the availability of updated COVID shots and even impact the seasonal flu vaccine.

Despite these concerns, the Trump administration believes the chips can be managed securely, with data centers managed by U.S. companies.

          <p>Japan's economy experienced an unexpected contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This GDP data was poorer than economists' expectations of a 0.1% contraction, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter. Uncertainties stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policies significantly impacted Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had recently cautioned that the country's economy would likely moderate due to global trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The government quietly corrected its impact assessment on assisted dying, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year.
