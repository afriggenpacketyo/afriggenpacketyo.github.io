          <h2>Researchers Investigate Why Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Cause Motion Sickness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Scientific studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly their regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which recovers energy while slowing the vehicle, produces a low-frequency deceleration that can induce queasiness and discomfort. Researchers in China and Hong Kong are exploring the issue to find solutions that can improve passenger comfort as the automotive industry continues its rapid transition to electric power.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was first imposed in August 2023. The ban was a strong political statement against Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The two nations had agreed in May to begin the process of resuming trade, and this move formalizes that decision. While the ban is lifted, it may still take several months for procedural steps to be completed before physical shipments of Japanese seafood to China can fully resume. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is noted for its large, diversified portfolio of over 15,600 properties and its reliable, monthly dividend, which currently yields an attractive 5.6%. While its large size means growth is slow and steady, its 30-year streak of dividend increases makes it a foundational investment.
