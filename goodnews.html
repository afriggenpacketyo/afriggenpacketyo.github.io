        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Senate narrowly voted to advance a major piece of legislation, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill" by former President Donald Trump. The advancement came after prolonged negotiations to secure the votes of four conservative holdouts, who expressed concerns about deficit reduction and Medicaid. Key to flipping their votes was a promise for an amendment vote on Medicaid funding. The lengthy bill will now proceed through further legislative steps, though its final passage is not yet guaranteed.</p>

          <h2>Centennial of 1925 Santa Barbara Earthquake Offers Lessons for Modern Seismic Preparedness</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On the 100th anniversary of the devastating 1925 Santa Barbara earthquake, experts reflect on the lessons it provides for California's seismic readiness. The quake exposed deadly flaws in unreinforced brick buildings, a vulnerability that took decades for many cities to address with mandatory retrofitting laws. The event also spurred Santa Barbara to adopt a cohesive Spanish Colonial Revival architectural style, reshaping the city's identity. Experts note that despite progress, many buildings remain vulnerable, highlighting an ongoing reluctance to enforce stricter safety mandates.</p>

          <p>A growing number of women, particularly from Millennial and Gen Z generations, are turning to financial education startups like Dow Janes to improve their financial literacy. The trend is fueled by a recognized gap in financial education, as many women were not taught wealth-building strategies from a young age. Amid economic uncertainty, these platforms use accessible social media content and structured courses to demystify investing, budgeting, and saving, aiming to empower women to take control of their finances.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The surprisingly restrained reactions from China and Russia to the recent military strikes on Iran suggest that the so-called "anti-American axis" is less cohesive than often portrayed. Instead of a robust defense of their partner, both Beijing and Moscow prioritized caution and called for diplomacy, highlighting their own economic and strategic interests. This analysis suggests that while the three nations are united by antagonism toward the West, this alliance is transactional and may crumble when tested by direct military confrontation that threatens global stability.</p>

Despite the clear victory, Paul was met with boos from the crowd. The fight continues the trend of Paul facing aging or seemingly unmotivated opponents, raising ongoing questions about his legitimacy within professional boxing.</p>
