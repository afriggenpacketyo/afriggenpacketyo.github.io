        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Stanford study indicates that artificial intelligence is increasingly displacing entry-level workers, particularly in fields like software engineering and customer service, where early-career employment has seen a 13% drop since 2022. The research, utilizing ADP payroll data, highlights that AI's capabilities often overlap with the initial "book learning" acquired by younger professionals, making their roles more susceptible to automation. Conversely, more experienced workers, possessing tacit knowledge and "soft skills," appear less affected, suggesting a significant shift in the labor market. This article emphasizes the need for young workers to adapt by learning to leverage AI tools to enhance their productivity.</p>

Expert tips include selecting Chelsea's Robert Sanchez as goalkeeper and Marc Cucurella in defense, alongside Nottingham Forest's Nikola Milenkovic and Brentford's Sepp van den Berg. Mohamed Salah is suggested as captain, despite a tough fixture against Arsenal, due to Liverpool's attacking form. Midfield recommendations feature Manchester United's Bruno Fernandes and Newcastle's Harvey Barnes, while Chris Wood, Joao Pedro, and Jean-Philippe Mateta are highlighted as strong forward options for the upcoming matches.</p>

          <p>A "one-in-a-million" photograph of Jasmine Paolini at the US Open has garnered widespread acclaim, hailed as potentially "the picture of the year" in tennis. Photographer Ray Giubilo captured the whimsical and humorous image by fluke, attributing its perfection to Paolini being momentarily off-balance during her forehand stroke. The article details Giubilo's long career and dedication to sports photography, emphasizing the blend of patience, creative flair, and technical skill required to seize such unique moments. Paolini herself expressed admiration for the shot, highlighting its extraordinary nature and the photographer's achievement.</p>

Nvidia, a U.S.-listed firm, reported strong sales growth above 50% due to the AI boom, though its shares dipped on data center revenue concerns and future China sales. French spirits giant Pernod Ricard reported a 3% sales decline, affected by weak Chinese consumer sentiment.

          <h2>UK Car Exports to US Increase After New Tariff Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 03:14:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sales of British-made cars to the United States saw a 6.8% rise in July, following the implementation of a new UK-US tariff deal that lowered import taxes from 25% to 10% on the first 100,000 vehicles. This increase reverses a three-month decline and underscores the US's importance as the largest single national market for British cars, despite the European Union remaining a larger overall market. While the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) noted the positive impact of the deal, it also highlighted ongoing struggles in UK car manufacturing, attributing a broader slump to higher labor costs, international competition, and Brexit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widespread emotional reactions to Taylor Swift's engagement news have brought the concept of "parasocial relationships" into focus, where fans develop strong, one-sided feelings of intimacy with celebrities. The article explains that the constant exposure to celebrities' private lives through social media and reality shows creates an illusion of closeness, fulfilling a human need for connection. While such relationships can foster a sense of community and offer distraction, experts caution that they cannot replace reciprocal, real-life friendships. This article emphasizes that despite the emotional investment, celebrities like Swift do not reciprocate individual fan affection, likening these connections to "fast food" without nutritional content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The value of small packages shipped from China to the UK, exempt from import tax due to their low value, more than doubled last year to £3 billion, according to HMRC data. This surge is largely attributed to the popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms like Shein and Temu. The UK government is now reviewing the £135 customs duty exemption, facing pressure from domestic retailers who argue it creates unfair competition and exposes consumers to potentially unsafe goods. While businesses call for swifter action, some analysts warn that removing the exemption could disproportionately affect lower-income consumers and small importers. (not investment advice)</p>

The BOK upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%. While expecting favorable export movements, the bank warned of a gradual slowdown due to expanding US tariffs.
