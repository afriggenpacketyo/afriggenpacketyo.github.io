          <p>The UK government is expanding the Warm Home Discount scheme, providing ¬£150 off energy bills to millions more households this winter. The changes will eliminate the property-based qualification, allowing anyone on means-tested benefits to receive the discount automatically. While energy companies will cover the cost, it could potentially lead to a slight increase in all customer bills through the standing charge. The government aims to offset this increase through savings by cutting energy companies' expenditure and addressing problem debt. </p>

          <p>In an era marked by heightened offense-taking, Arthur C. Brooks explores strategies for managing personal reactions to provocation. Drawing on psychological research, he outlines a three-stage process of offense-taking and emphasizes the role of the brain's limbic system and prefrontal cortex in managing emotional responses. Brooks suggests practical techniques such as using humor, activating the prefrontal cortex through practices like meditation, and tuning out offense-making media. He also cautions against mistaking offense-taking for reliable evidence of true offensiveness, noting that it may be a manipulative tactic. </p>

          <p>Edith Edmunds, a 99-year-old quilter, celebrates Juneteenth by reflecting on the potential role of quilts in conveying coded messages to runaway enslaved people along the Underground Railroad. Edmunds learned that quilts with coded messages could have been hung outside to convey messages to those seeking freedom. While some academics question the historical evidence, Edmunds draws inspiration from the oral history and symbols of West African cultures. Edmunds hopes to educate younger generations about the struggles and bravery of those who sought freedom through the Underground Railroad. </p>

          <p>In Los Angeles' Thai Town, red strawberry Fanta is a common offering at spirit houses, small shrines honoring spirits' claim to the land. This practice stems from animistic and Brahmanistic beliefs mixed with Buddhism, where spirits are appeased with food and drink. Red Fanta has replaced blood offerings and is believed to be loved by ghosts for its sickly sweetness. Though Buddhism is the leading religion in Thailand, the spirit houses and offerings are part of a tradition aimed at protecting homes and ensuring good fortune. </p>

          <p>Honda is recalling approximately 260,000 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal pivot pin. The affected models include Acura TLX, Acura MDX, and Honda Pilot vehicles manufactured between 2021 and 2025. The defect can cause the brake pedal to move laterally, potentially impairing the driver's ability to stop safely. Owners of affected vehicles will be notified and instructed to take their vehicles to a dealer for a brake pedal replacement, if necessary. </p>

          <h2>Airbus Dominates Paris Air Show as Boeing Takes a Backseat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airbus has dominated the Paris Air Show with significant orders and new model announcements, while Boeing has maintained a low profile due to ongoing issues. Airbus secured nearly $21 billion in orders, including deals with AviLease, ANA, and LOT. Boeing, facing challenges with quality control and delivery delays, has refrained from major promotional activities. Despite Boeing's subdued presence, overall demand in the aviation sector remains strong, with both Airbus and Boeing holding substantial aircraft backlogs. </p>
