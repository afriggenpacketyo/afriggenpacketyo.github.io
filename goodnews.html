          <p>Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna acknowledged that former President Joe Biden made a mistake in running for a second term, admitting he was wrong to defend Biden's mental and physical fitness during the 2024 campaign. Khanna stated that Biden's advisors owe an explanation but defended Biden's accomplishments, including the CHIPS Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, while reiterating his stance that seeking another four years in the White House was a misjudgment. Khanna also expressed his focus on regaining the House and promoting a working-class economic agenda, referring to it as "economic patriotism."</p>

          <p>A sketch on Saturday Night Live featuring Scarlett Johansson and Bad Bunny explored the gap between perceived machismo and the reality of relationship struggles. Two couples at a bar argue over a table, but the non-Spanish speakers misinterpret the conversation, casting the men as macho Latino figures. In reality, the men are commiserating about their difficult relationships, revealing a nuanced dynamic lost in translation. The sketch highlights the challenges of discerning truth from a distance, whether across a bar table or a language barrier.</p>
