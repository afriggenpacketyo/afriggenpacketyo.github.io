          <p>As she aims for a third consecutive European Championship title, England women's football manager Sarina Wiegman reflects on how her approach has evolved over her four years with the team. Wiegman notes that while her core values of honesty and clarity remain, she has learned to worry less and let some issues resolve themselves organically. She emphasizes giving players clear context rather than being blunt and fosters a professional environment built on common sense instead of strict rules, balancing her caring nature with the need to make difficult decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With average credit card APRs exceeding 21%, many Americans find do-it-yourself debt payoff strategies insufficient. This article outlines five key signs that it may be time to seek professional debt relief. These red flags include being unable to pay more than the minimum balance despite trying, having a credit utilization ratio over 50%, and using credit cards to cover essential living expenses. Other indicators are a debt-to-income ratio surpassing 40% and being unable to qualify for affordable debt consolidation loans, signaling that the debt has become unmanageable alone.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill scored a monumental 269, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, to put his team in a dominant position in the second Test at Edgbaston. India amassed a total of 587 before their bowlers made early breakthroughs, leaving England struggling at 77-3 by the close of day two. After losing the first Test, India has taken firm control of the match, presenting England with an extremely difficult challenge to avoid a series-leveling defeat. Akash Deep was particularly effective, taking two key wickets in consecutive deliveries.</p>

Working just 18 hours a week, she receives benefits like a rent stipend and paid vacations, enabling her to save up to $1,000 a month and pursue personal hobbies, something she couldn't do in America.</p>

          <p>Williams Formula 1 driver Alex Albon discusses his strong 2024 season, where he has decisively outperformed his highly-rated teammate, Carlos Sainz. Albon attributes his success to feeling more comfortable with the car, a factor he believes is often underestimated in F1, and to his improved mental preparation, which he works on with his partner, professional golfer 'Lily' Muni He. He remains realistic about the team's progress, stating that while Williams is on an upward trajectory, he doesn't expect to be fighting for wins until at least 2028.</p>

          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow $150,000, this article compares the costs of a home equity loan versus a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, resulting in very similar monthly payments. However, the key difference lies in their rate structures: home equity loans have a fixed rate, providing predictable payments, while HELOCs have a variable rate that can change over time. This means a HELOC could become cheaper if rates fall but more expensive if they rise, introducing long-term cost uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Five Common Mistakes That Can Significantly Increase the Cost of Carrying Credit Card Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 13:50:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card interest rates at historic highs, this article highlights five costly mistakes that can worsen a person's debt situation. These include making only the minimum payment, which prolongs repayment and maximizes interest charges, and ignoring the expiration dates of 0% APR promotional offers, which can lead to a sudden spike in rates. Other pitfalls are using high-fee cash advances that accrue interest immediately, closing old credit cards, which can hurt your credit score, and making late payments, which trigger fees and penalty APRs.

          <p>A recent survey reveals that nearly two-thirds of Germans believe the legal age for supervised drinking should be raised from 14. In Germany, teenagers aged 14 and 15 can legally consume beer or wine if accompanied by a guardian. Furthermore, just over half of those surveyed support increasing the purchasing age for beer and wine from 16 to 18, aligning it with the age for hard liquor. The findings come as German health ministers and medical associations advocate for stricter health policies to reduce alcohol consumption, particularly among young people.</p>

The tech sector, led by a record-breaking performance from Nvidia, powered the gains. The market rally was supported by a resilient U.S. jobs report, which showed more hiring than expected, and progress on a major legislative package in Washington. Despite the positive economic signs, the strength of the labor market may temper arguments for immediate interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>
