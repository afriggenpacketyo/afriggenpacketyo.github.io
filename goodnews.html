          <p>China's GJ-11 "Sharp Sword" uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) is being adapted for crucial roles in intelligent warfare, with a new variant, possibly the naval GJ-21, featuring folding hinges for potential deployment on aircraft carriers or amphibious assault ships. This advanced drone, numbered 21 on its fuselage, suggests it could be the world's first operational ship-based stealth combat drone. Recent images resembling the drone's wing profile appeared on the emblem of China's first Type 076 amphibious landing ship, informally known as a "drone carrier," equipped with an electromagnetic catapult.

          <p>Australia's Reserve Bank Governor, Michele Bullock, stated that the central bank remains vigilant regarding potential shifts in the economic outlook, though recent data largely aligns with expectations. The article highlights that while recent rate cuts are intended to boost household and business spending, the global economic environment introduces considerable uncertainty. The RBA has pursued a gradual approach to policy easing, having cut rates three times this year, and future adjustments will depend on incoming data. Investors are currently paring back expectations for further immediate rate cuts following stronger-than-expected economic growth and a spike in inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the People's Bank of China maintained its one-year and five-year LPRs at 3.0% and 3.5% respectively. The article notes varied regional performance, with Japan's Nikkei 225 rising significantly, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index experienced a slight dip.

          <p>Research on over 200 parent-child relationships reveals nine key practices by parents who raise children with exceptional social skills. The article emphasizes that strong social abilities stem from an emotionally safe home environment where authentic connection is modeled. These parents openly discuss feelings, demonstrate empathy, foster genuine confidence, teach conflict resolution, and validate their children's emotions. They also help kids recognize social cues, allow them to resolve minor conflicts independently, treat mistakes as learning opportunities, and prioritize listening over lecturing. This approach helps children develop resilience, compassion, and the capacity for healthy, lasting relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>On Nantucket, scientists are pioneering a novel approach to reduce Lyme disease transmission by genetically engineering wild white-footed mice to be immune to the bacteria. This article explains that since mice are the primary hosts for Lyme, making them immune would prevent ticks from becoming infected and breaking the disease cycle. Researchers at MIT's Sculpting Evolution lab, led by Kevin Esvelt, are using CRISPR technology to introduce an antibody gene into mouse embryos, which is then passed on to offspring. The project, "Mice Against Ticks," seeks community buy-in before potential field trials, addressing ecological concerns.</p>
