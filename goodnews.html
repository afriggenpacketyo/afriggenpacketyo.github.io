          <p>President Donald Trump announced a "Full and Complete" trade deal with South Korea, setting a 15% tariff on their exports to the U.S., down from a threatened 25%. South Korea will invest $350 billion in U.S. industries like shipbuilding and semiconductors, with $150 billion specifically for shipbuilding cooperation. Additionally, Seoul agreed to purchase $100 billion in U.S. energy products. This agreement, which ensures no U.S. goods are tariffed, follows a similar deal Japan struck with the Trump administration, aiming for mutually beneficial outcomes and strengthened alliance.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami warnings across the Pacific, including Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. While initial alerts caused evacuations and minor flooding in Hawaii, the U.S. and Japan largely saw the risk pass with minimal damage. However, South American Pacific coastlines, including Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador, faced heightened warnings and evacuations due to lingering wave effects. The event underscored the global reach of tsunamis and the importance of rapid warning systems.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3% in the second quarter, a notable turnaround from a 0.5% decline in the first quarter. This surge was largely driven by a substantial decrease in imports following the implementation of President Trump's tariffs, which economists note can skew GDP calculations. While the headline figure is strong, underlying demand indicators like "final sales to private domestic purchasers" suggest a weakening trend. Experts predict a slower growth rate for the rest of the year as inflationary pressures rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies have reportedly acquired All-Star closer Jhoan Duran from the Minnesota Twins in a major move before the MLB trade deadline. The Phillies sent top prospects Mick Abel and Eduardo Tait to the Twins for Duran, who has 16 saves this season and is under team control until 2028. This acquisition significantly bolsters Philadelphia's bullpen, aiming to enhance their chances for a World Series run after recent postseason disappointments. Duran's triple-digit fastball and splitter are expected to provide a crucial late-game advantage.</p>

          <p>U.S. authorities are warning consumers that some Celsius Astro Vibe Blue Razz energy drink cans were mistakenly filled with vodka seltzer due to a packaging supplier error. The mix-up occurred when empty Celsius cans were shipped to High Noon, a vodka seltzer company. High Noon is also recalling some of its Beach Variety packs from the same production line. No illnesses or adverse events have been reported, but consumers are advised to dispose of affected Celsius cans due to the unintended alcohol content.</p>

          <h2>Expert Analysis Explains Minimal Damage from Massive Russian Earthquake and Tsunami</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite an 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, one of the strongest ever recorded, the resulting tsunami caused surprisingly little damage outside the immediate epicenter. Experts explain that the tsunami's energy was largely directed into the open Pacific Ocean, dissipating before reaching more populated areas like the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii. Factors like the lower tide during impact and improved deep ocean pressure sensors also contributed to the mitigated effects. This event highlights the importance of location, directionality, and advanced warning systems in tsunami impact.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported better-than-expected second-quarter revenue and reinstated its full-year guidance, anticipating a net $2 billion impact from President Trump's auto tariffs. The automaker had suspended its outlook in May due to tariff uncertainty. While tariffs are now estimated to be a $3 billion hit, Ford expects to offset $1 billion through mitigation efforts. CEO Jim Farley noted ongoing "constructive conversations" with the Trump administration regarding steel and aluminum tariffs. The company's EV business continued to incur losses, while its commercial "Pro" segment showed strong growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An article explores the rising popularity of "stressful" TV shows like "The Bear" and "The Pitt," arguing that audiences are increasingly drawn to hyperrealistic, anxiety-inducing narratives over traditional comfort or escapist programming. These shows immerse viewers in visceral, high-stakes everyday situations, triggering a "vicarious stress" response that is satisfying due to its zero-risk nature. Experts suggest this trend reflects a societal shift where viewers, particularly younger generations, seek realism and catharsis in acknowledging day-to-day anxieties, especially amid economic turmoil and industry disruptions.</p>
