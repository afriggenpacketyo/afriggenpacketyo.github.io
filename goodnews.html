          <p>The Reserve Bank of India has maintained its key policy rate at 5.5%, a decision that was widely anticipated by economists. This move follows a significant rate cut in the previous meeting and comes as India faces potential new tariffs from the United States. While the central bank noted that domestic growth is resilient, it acknowledged that ongoing geopolitical tensions and global trade uncertainties continue to pose risks to the economic outlook. The RBI also lowered its inflation forecast for the fiscal year, citing a more benign near-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC secured a 2-1 victory over Tigres UANL in the Leagues Cup, largely thanks to a standout performance from 19-year-old Venezuelan player David Martínez. Martínez scored both of LAFC's goals, including the decisive one from a remarkable individual play where he regained possession at midfield and skillfully finished. The loss leaves the Mexican club, Tigres, on the brink of elimination from the tournament, dependent on an unlikely combination of other match results. Despite the win, LAFC's own chances of advancing to the next phase remain slim.</p>

The Sparks' offense was led by Kelsey Plum and Rickea Jackson, who both scored 25 points, showcasing the team's depth now that their roster is fully healthy.

          <p>The NFL and ESPN have entered into a nonbinding agreement that outlines a major media partnership, a deal that has been discussed for years. Under the proposed terms, ESPN would acquire the NFL Network and other assets like NFL Fantasy, while the league would receive a 10% equity stake in ESPN. This arrangement is expected to significantly bolster ESPN's upcoming direct-to-consumer streaming service by adding more valuable NFL content. The deal still requires negotiation of a final agreement and approval from both NFL owners and government regulators before it can be finalized.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the Norco state prison in Riverside County by fall 2026. The decision is driven by a significant decline in the state's overall prison population and is expected to save the state $150 million annually. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates, will not release anyone early; instead, inmates will be transferred to other prisons. The future of the site, which was originally a luxury resort in the 1920s, is uncertain, though local officials hope it can be restored.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Economists Debate Including Household Consumption Targets in National Economic Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 22:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists and policy advisors about whether to include specific, measurable targets for household consumption in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents argue that setting a goal for the household consumption rate, which was a relatively low 39.6% of GDP in 2023, is crucial for the national strategy of expanding domestic demand. However, other influential thinkers are skeptical, questioning whether such a metric is practical or operationally feasible as a formal policy objective. The discussion highlights the ongoing focus on rebalancing China's economy toward consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a difficult start to his MLB career and a subsequent shoulder injury, Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is finally showing signs of progress. The highly anticipated Japanese phenom is now throwing again and is scheduled for a simulated game, with a potential minor-league rehab assignment to follow. The Dodgers have been encouraged by adjustments he has made to his delivery and his addition of a new two-seam fastball. While his role is uncertain, a healthy and effective Sasaki could provide valuable pitching depth for the team's postseason ambitions later this year.</p>

          <p>Meta has announced that its messaging platform, WhatsApp, took down over 6.8 million accounts associated with scams during the first six months of the year. Many of these accounts were linked to criminal scam centers in Southeast Asia, which often use forced labor to target people globally with fraudulent schemes. The announcement coincided with WhatsApp rolling out new security features to alert users of suspicious activity, such as being added to a group by an unknown contact. The company is working to proactively detect and disable these accounts before they can be used for scams.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster relief funds. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that the states were likely to succeed in their argument and that transferring the funds could cause 'irreparable harm' to communities needing the money for flood mitigation and other disaster preparedness projects. The administration is now blocked from repurposing the funds while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>A massive copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned MCC, is reportedly making significant progress toward starting extraction this year after a 17-year delay. The Mes Aynak mine, which holds one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, was stalled for years due to security issues, archaeological sites, and lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government announced last year that the project would switch to underground mining to better protect ancient relics at the site. The company stated it is ready to begin production if remaining government procedures are completed smoothly.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% drop in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, murders fell by 14.9% and motor vehicle thefts saw a record one-year drop of 18.6%. While experts note the positive trend, they also point out that aggravated assaults remain higher than pre-pandemic levels and that many crimes go unreported.</p>
