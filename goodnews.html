        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United achieved a vital 3-2 victory against Burnley thanks to a last-minute penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing some relief for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the win was overshadowed by persistent and critical errors from the team's goalkeepers, including mistakes from both Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana in recent matches. These recurring issues have fueled speculation about the club's interest in acquiring Royal Antwerp's goalkeeper, Senne Lammens, before the transfer deadline. The team is also facing potential injury setbacks for key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the challenges ahead.</p>

Met with boos from the home crowd, Portnoy took the opportunity to taunt the rival fanbase and their head coach, Ryan Day. He suggested that another loss to Michigan could jeopardize Day's job, labeling the coach as "soft" and claiming that the repeated victories by the Wolverines have "broken him." Michigan has defeated Ohio State in their last four encounters, a significant streak in the historic college football rivalry.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Davina Perrin scored a historic century for the Northern Superchargers, leading her team into The Hundred final with a remarkable 101 runs from just 43 balls. Her 42-ball hundred is the fastest ever by an English woman in T20 cricket and has drawn widespread acclaim. Perrin, a graduate of the ACE programme aimed at increasing Black representation in cricket, is the first Black British woman to score a professional T20 century. While her explosive talent is celebrated, analysts note that she is still working to build consistency in her overall performance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a lack of uniform international rules, a consensus among health experts suggests that parents should cautiously manage their children's screen time based on developmental stages. The general recommendation is to be screen-free until age three, as young children need to explore their physical environment to develop motor skills and attention control. For preschool children, a maximum of 30 minutes is advised to encourage imagination and social interaction. As children enter elementary school and adolescence, supervised screen time can be gradually increased, but the focus should remain on quality content and open communication to avoid potential online dangers.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish has experienced a career revitalization since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, delivering consecutive man-of-the-match performances. After providing two assists against Brighton, he repeated the feat in a 3-2 win over Wolves, showcasing the creative spark that had been less visible during his time on the City bench. Despite his excellent form, Grealish was omitted from the latest England squad by manager Thomas Tuchel. His resurgence at Everton has intensified the debate over whether he can still force his way into the national team's plans for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Chef Gordon Ramsay announced on Instagram that he was recently diagnosed with Basal cell carcinoma, a common type of skin cancer. The 58-year-old shared a photo of his face bandaged near his ear, thanking his medical team for quickly removing the carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma is typically caused by long-term exposure to UV radiation from the sun and often appears on sun-exposed areas like the face and neck. Ramsay used the announcement to urge his followers to be vigilant about sun protection, writing, "Please don't forget your sunscreen this weekend."</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump was seen in public for the first time since unfounded rumors of his death circulated widely on social media. The 79-year-old was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia, effectively quashing the viral hoax. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to assume the presidency in the event of a tragedy. The appearance also came after public concern over a visible bruise on Trump's hand, which the White House physician attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use.</p>

The new beverage combines the spicy, smoky notes of the condiment with a classic 6.5% alcohol beer. The creation is being marketed as the ultimate fusion of two beloved Hamburg culinary staples.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared that the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem is over, three weeks after the last new case was identified. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new measures to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and expanding the health department's inspection capacity.</p>

          <p>A new stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence could significantly speed up the diagnosis of serious heart conditions, according to a British study. The device analyzes heartbeat and blood flow sounds that are undetectable to the human ear and uses an AI algorithm to identify signs of heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. In a study involving over 200 GP surgeries, the AI stethoscope was found to be substantially more effective at detecting these conditions compared to traditional methods. Researchers believe the tool could be a "game-changer," allowing for earlier treatment and better patient outcomes.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult film "The Toxic Avenger" stars Peter Dinklage as the titular mutant hero, offering a well-made and surprisingly sincere version of the Troma classic. Directed by Macon Blair, the film pits its hero against a villainous pharmaceutical CEO played by Kevin Bacon, retaining the original's gory violence and crude humor but with a higher production value. This updated version grounds its story in an emotional core, as Dinklage's character is a janitor and widower trying to raise his stepson. While entertaining, the film's polished nature may feel disconnected from the deliberately cheap and offensive style that defined the original.</p>

Kidjo's powerful stage presence transformed classics from Gershwin and Ravel, while Ma's cello provided a complementary, often subtle, accompaniment. A particularly poignant moment was their performance of a Philip Glass composition based on a David Bowie song, a piece that uniquely bridged the musical worlds of both artists.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines the rules for collecting Social Security survivor benefits, which are available to eligible spouses, ex-spouses, and children of a deceased worker. Generally, a widow or widower must be at least 60 years old (or 50 with a disability) to claim these benefits, though there are exceptions for those caring for young or disabled children. A key strategy discussed is the ability to claim survivor benefits first while allowing one's own retirement benefit to grow, potentially switching to the higher personal benefit at age 70. The article advises consulting a financial professional to navigate the complexities. (not investment advice)</p>
