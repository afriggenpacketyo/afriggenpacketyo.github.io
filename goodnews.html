          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms covering much of southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales.

In addition to heavy rainfall, the weather agency cautioned about frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds.

          <p>WorldPride 2025 is concluding its first celebration in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade that began Saturday in a historic gay neighborhood and ended at the U.S. Capitol. This marks the first time D.C. has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its start in Rome in 2000, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C. Despite the usual scale of Pride festivities, organizers note a dampening effect due to the current political climate and executive orders perceived as limiting the rights of trans people. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park during the weekend also sparked controversy. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that over half of large-scale rice producers in Japan believe store prices for rice are "too high," mirroring consumer concerns. With rice prices doubling in the past year, more than 40% of respondents fear consumers may reduce their rice consumption. The government has begun selling rice stockpiles directly to retailers to curb prices, which average 4,200 yen per 5 kilograms. There is a lack of consensus on the appropriate price level, with some suggesting 3,000 yen per 5 kg as reasonable. </p>
