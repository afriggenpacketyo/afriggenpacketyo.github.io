          <p>The Trump administration expresses confidence in securing investors for the Alaska LNG project, despite its $40 billion price tag, emphasizing its national priority and potential to reduce trade deficits by selling energy to allies like Japan and South Korea. Energy Secretary Chris Wright highlights the project's staged construction, initially serving domestic demand, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum notes Department of Defense support through offtake agreements for Alaskan bases. However, energy analysts remain skeptical about the project's commercial viability, citing decades of planning without significant support. The administration's optimism contrasts with industry doubts about the project's economic logic. Optimism rests on securing commercial agreements and leveraging geopolitical factors.

          <p>The San Diego County Water Authority and the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California have settled a 15-year legal battle over water costs, establishing a fixed price for water delivery. The agreement aims to foster greater collaboration between the agencies, improving finances and water distribution across Southern California. The dispute centered on the price the Water Authority pays MWD for Colorado River water supplies secured through deals with the Imperial Irrigation District. This settlement provides greater fiscal certainty, new opportunities for water movement, and stabilization of water rates for San Diego County residents, benefiting the entire region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to close eight U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offices in California, following pressure from Democratic lawmakers. The lawmakers argued that the closures would hinder the USDA's ability to support California's agricultural sector, which received nearly $59.4 billion in cash receipts in 2023. While eight of the nine planned closures have been rescinded, the office in Mt. Shasta remains under discussion. The administration says it supports optimizing building capacity and consolidating underutilized offices to reduce inefficiencies.</p>

The Port Authority hired additional crews to work around the clock and coordinated with contractors to expedite timelines. The runway was milled, paved, and outfitted with updated lighting and airfield signs, and the FAA is working to certify it for arriving flights as well.</p>

The plan is to simplify the process of moving data into Snowflake with the new service so clients can more easily run queries on a larger supply of data, according to Christian Kleinerman, executive vice president of product at Snowflake.
