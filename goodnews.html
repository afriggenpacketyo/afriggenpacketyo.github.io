          <p>England's rugby team clinched a 2-0 series victory against Argentina with a dramatic 22-17 win in San Juan. The match was tightly contested, remaining tied at 17-17 for most of the second half after a high-scoring first half. The decisive moment came in the final seconds when replacement Jack van Poortvliet scored a try, securing the win for the visitors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence is often blamed for exacerbating China's population decline by reducing the need for traditional family structures, some experts argue this shift may have positive aspects. As AI technology advances, it increasingly fulfills roles like emotional companionship and elderly care, which traditionally fell to family members. This allows individuals to choose a single life without the societal pressure to marry or have children for support in old age. The article explores the idea that AI could redefine societal norms around family and care, making population concerns obsolete.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Twins outfielder Byron Buxton achieved a rare feat in baseball by hitting for the cycle during a game against the Pittsburgh Pirates. The accomplishment occurred on his own bobblehead promotion day at Target Field, adding to the special occasion for fans. Buxton secured the cycle with a dramatic home run in the seventh inning, having already hit a single, triple, and double earlier in the game. This was the first cycle ever hit at Target Field and highlights a strong, healthy season for the two-time All-Star.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek's dominant 6-0, 6-0 victory in the Wimbledon final was a surprising triumph on what was considered her weakest surface.

The article analyzes her journey, noting a recent dip in form and a one-month ban had lowered expectations, allowing her to play with less pressure.
