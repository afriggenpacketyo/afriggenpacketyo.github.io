          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated to Rwanda. The refugees, mostly women and children, were transported across the border by the U.N. refugee agency after Rwandan-backed rebels seized parts of the region. The returnees will receive emergency assistance and support for reintegration, marking the end of a long exile for many who fled Rwanda after the state-sponsored genocide. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR, with over 101,000 refugees already repatriated.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Kateryna is Ukraine's only female combat pilot, facing both the dangers of war and persistent sexism within the military. Despite the military's efforts to recruit more women due to soldier shortages, stereotypes and marginalization remain common. Kateryna, who flies helicopter missions against Russian troops, is an inspiration to other women but often finds her abilities doubted by male colleagues. She remains determined to encourage more women to join the air force and break down gender barriers in the armed forces.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving toward renewed cooperation, spurred by President Trump's shifting global policies. A summit is planned to announce a defense and security agreement, aiming to bolster military security in Europe as the U.S. reduces its commitment. Despite past disagreements over fishing rights and youth travel, both sides recognize the need to collaborate in an increasingly uncertain geopolitical landscape. While Britain seeks to ease trade controls imposed by Brexit, political opposition and economic realities may limit the scope of this rapprochement.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fiber-optic gyroscope that promises enhanced stability for navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, offers a more reliable way to measure orientation and turning rates. Unlike traditional gyroscopes with moving parts, this fiber-optic gyroscope uses light in optical fibers, making it immune to external interference. This technology is vital for military and civilian applications, including aerospace, weapons systems, and autonomous vehicles.</p>

          <p>The demand for live shows in China is fueling a tourism spending spree, with fans traveling across the country to attend concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings. This strategy aims to boost domestic consumption, which is a key economic goal for Beijing amid trade tensions. For instance, Shily Zhou, a Shanghai resident, traveled to Chengdu to see a concert and received a discount to visit Qingchengshan, a famed Taoist mountain.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform community service, such as filling potholes and cleaning bins, to provide more meaningful punishment outside of prison. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood aims to expand unpaid work programs, collaborating with local councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders. The earnings from this work would be directed to a fund for victim's groups. The initiative comes as prisons face overcrowding, prompting the need for alternative forms of punishment that benefit the community.</p>
