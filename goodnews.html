          <h2>Chinese Rust-Belt City of Hegang to Build New Airport in Bid for Economic Revival</h2>

          <p>The declining Chinese city of Hegang, located in the country's rust-belt region, is investing approximately 1.2 billion yuan to construct a new airport, scheduled to open in 2027. This infrastructure project is a key part of the city's strategy to reverse its economic stagnation, which has been marked by industrial decline and a significant population decrease. Officials hope the Luobei Airport, along with increased trade with Russia, will stimulate growth and improve connectivity. The airport is projected to handle 450,000 passengers and 1,600 tonnes of cargo annually.</p>

          <p>Despite facing years of stringent U.S. trade restrictions, Chinese technology giant Huawei has emerged as a formidable leader across China's artificial intelligence landscape. The company has diversified from its telecom roots into numerous complex sectors, including AI chips, data centers, and large language models, positioning itself as a key competitor to American firms like Nvidia. This strategic pivot, partly a response to external pressures, has turned Huawei into a national champion for Beijing's technological ambitions. The company's comprehensive "full-stack" approach now spans the entire AI value chain, from hardware to industrial applications.</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious Ecuadorean gang leader known as "Fito," has been extradited to the U.S. to face drug and arms trafficking charges. Fito, leader of the powerful Los Choneros gang, was recaptured in June after a year-long escape from a high-security prison. His gang is linked to a surge in violence that has plagued Ecuador and is also suspected in the 2023 assassination of a presidential candidate. The extradition follows a referendum in which Ecuadoreans approved the measure as part of President Daniel Noboa's crackdown on crime.</p>

          <p>A growing body of evidence suggests that GLP-1 agonists, a class of drugs including Ozempic and Wegovy, could be a breakthrough treatment for polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Women with PCOS, a common hormonal disorder, have reported significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and weight gain after using these drugs. Researchers believe the drugs' ability to improve insulin sensitivity and promote weight loss indirectly helps rebalance hormones. While more extensive clinical trials are needed, these findings offer hope for a condition that currently lacks a standard treatment.</p>

More recently, she revealed that UFC President Dana White, a supporter of Donald Trump, made her promise not to speak ill of Trump due to his historical support for the UFC. While honoring that promise, Rousey continues to encourage all citizens to get informed and participate in the democratic process by voting.</p>

          <p>Despite conventional wisdom suggesting market volatility ahead of tariff deadlines, some analysts argue that numerous positive factors are supporting stocks. Provisions within President Trump's "big beautiful bill," such as the extension of tax cuts and new deductions, are expected to inject billions into the economy and boost consumer spending. Other tailwinds include strong corporate earnings, tax relief for businesses, and a potential boom in sectors like energy and aerospace. This perspective suggests that pro-business policies could create economic growth that outweighs the negative impact of trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler's victory at The Open has solidified his status as the most dominant force in men's golf, sparking frequent comparisons to Tiger Woods during his peak. Having won four major championships in just over three years, Scheffler's consistent, machine-like performance has been described by his peers as "Tiger-like." While Scheffler himself calls the comparisons "silly," his ability to convert leads into victories and his statistical superiority from tee to green are undeniable. An improved putting game has been credited with elevating his performance to this new, commanding level.</p>
