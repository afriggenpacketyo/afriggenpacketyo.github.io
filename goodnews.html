          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in sales growth for its namesake brand in the fiscal second quarter, yet the success of its teen-focused Hollister brand significantly bolstered overall performance, leading to a 7% sales climb. Hollister achieved its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth, with a 19% increase. The company narrowly surpassed Wall Street expectations and subsequently raised its full-year revenue outlook, despite facing increased tariff costs, nearly doubling previous anticipations. CEO Fran Horowitz expressed confidence in the company's trajectory, highlighting strategic investments in new categories and partnerships, such as with the NFL, to drive future growth and maintain relevance in a competitive retail landscape.

          <p>China has significantly increased its funding for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with investments and construction contracts reaching $124 billion in the first half of 2025, already surpassing the total for all of 2024. This surge indicates a strategic shift, as funding has diminished in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East, while Central Asia, particularly Kazakhstan, has become a primary destination for Chinese capital. Kazakhstan received $23 billion, including a major $12 billion aluminum complex, reflecting internal economic pressures and shifting global trade dynamics.

          <p>A landmark federal ruling is imminent regarding Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with a significant portion going to Apple. While Google risks losing some search traffic, analysts suggest this could ultimately benefit the company by freeing it from costly deals and allowing redirection of funds towards AI and cloud development. The article highlights that despite the potential financial hit for Apple, Google's search dominance is robust, as evidenced by its market share in Europe even after regulatory changes. This situation presents an opportunity for Google to pivot its strategy towards its generative AI platform, Gemini, and redefine its position in the evolving search landscape.

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's earnings and revenue expectations for its fiscal second quarter, despite a decline in overall sales. The department store narrowed its full-year sales guidance, reflecting the higher end of its previous range, and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to economic pressures on lower- and middle-income customers but highlighted efforts to revitalize the brand, including reintroducing popular sections and overhauling discount strategies. This article notes that Kohl's is focusing on regaining customer traffic and improving inventory management, with sales trends showing improvement throughout the quarter, particularly in July.

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved a new voluntary military service bill aimed at significantly boosting the Bundeswehr's personnel to 260,000 active soldiers and 200,000 reservists by the early 2030s. This initiative, driven by growing threats and NATO commitments, includes a mandatory questionnaire for all 18-year-old men and offers incentives like free accommodation, healthcare, and travel for recruits. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius hailed the law as a "giant step forward," despite skepticism from conservatives who advocate for a return to compulsory conscription. This article highlights the government's efforts to address chronic under-recruitment and enhance national security capabilities, while acknowledging logistical challenges and mixed public opinion among young people.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canada Goose surged nearly 15% after reports emerged that its controlling shareholder, private equity firm Bain Capital, has received bids to take the winter-clothing maker private. Sources indicate that Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, though Bain Capital is awaiting further bids. This article notes that Goldman Sachs is advising on the potential sale, which could represent significant returns for Bain Capital from its 2013 investment of $250 million. The news reflects strong private equity interest in the brand, despite its current valuation being lower than its 2018 peak, signaling potential for a new ownership structure and strategic direction for the company.

          <h2>CBS News Analysis Shows Decline in D.C. Violent Crime Amid Federal Deployments</h2>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of D.C. crime data reveals a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime during the nearly three weeks since President Trump deployed federal troops and law enforcement agents to Washington. Burglaries and car thefts also saw significant drops, although local police data indicated a downward trend before the federal intervention. The analysis found that federal forces were primarily deployed in high-crime areas, with a concentration of overall crime incidents nearly three times higher than the citywide average near deployment locations. However, some local leaders, like D.C. Council member Brianne Nadeau, argue the deployments are scaring residents and businesses. The White House reports over 1,000 arrests and 115 firearms seized, while Trump continues to assert that D.C. crime data is "phony."</p>

          <p>The Department of Transportation (DOT) announced it will reclaim full management control of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, a major transit hub, from various lease agreements. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated this move is necessary to "help make this city safe and beautiful," aligning with the Trump administration's broader anti-crime crackdown in Washington. Union Station has been a focal point of this federal intervention, with a significant National Guard presence and visits from high-ranking officials. This article highlights that the DOT aims to reinvest income from the station, such as parking revenue, directly into capital improvements like security, lighting, and elevators, expecting renewed control by September to enhance the station's condition and public safety.</p>

          <p>A key indicator of commercial real estate activity, JLL's global Bid Intensity Index, improved in July for the first time this year, signaling a potential rebound after a period of uncertainty. The index, which measures bidding activity and competitiveness, shows stabilizing "bidder dynamics" and narrowing bid-ask spreads across multiple sectors, particularly in multifamily apartments. While industrial and retail sectors face challenges from tariffs and supply chain issues, the office market is also showing improvement, with more bidders and lenders. This article suggests investors are increasingly accepting uncertainty as the new normal and moving into a "risk-on" mode, expecting gradual momentum through the second half of the year.
