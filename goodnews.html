          <p>American tennis player Coco Gauff has advanced to the last 16 of the US Open for the fourth consecutive year after a convincing 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech. After two tense opening matches and recent changes to her coaching team to address serving issues, Gauff displayed renewed confidence and control on the court. She dominated the match with a more consistent serve and aggressive baseline play, overcoming a brief mid-set challenge from Frech. Gauff's performance signals a return to form as she prepares to face tougher competition in the second week of her home Grand Slam tournament.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump made a public appearance for a family golf outing, effectively ending viral social media rumors about his death. The speculation began after his running mate, J.D. Vance, made comments about being prepared to step in if a tragedy occurred, sparking concern over the 79-year-old's health. Trump was photographed at the White House and later at his Virginia golf course, appearing to be in good spirits. The incident follows other recent health concerns, including visible bruising on his hand, which the White House attributed to frequent handshaking and a common blood thinner.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has increased its bid for Crystal Palace defender Marc Guehi to £35 million, now including a 10% sell-on clause. Crystal Palace has countered, seeking an additional £5 million in bonuses, and talks between the two clubs are ongoing ahead of the transfer deadline. Guehi has indicated he will not sign a new contract, making a transfer likely as his current deal expires next summer. Palace is actively trying to sign two replacement central defenders, which could pave the way for Guehi's move to Anfield to be finalized.</p>

          <p>Over 1,000 famous Hollywood props and costumes, including Darth Vader's lightsaber from "Star Wars," are set to be sold at an upcoming auction hosted by Propstore. The lightsaber, which has a presale estimate of $3 million, was authenticated by tracing its origins to a modified vintage camera flash part. Other high-profile items include Indiana Jones' bullwhip and a medallion from "Pirates of the Caribbean." The auction, held in Los Angeles, will offer items at various price points, with some starting bids as low as $200, making memorabilia accessible to a wider range of collectors.</p>

          <p>New York City's deadly Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem has been declared over after three weeks with no new cases. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Health officials traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams announced new proposals to prevent future clusters, including more frequent testing of cooling towers and increased inspection capacity for the health department.</p>

          <h2>AI-Powered Stethoscope Shows Promise in Rapidly Detecting Major Heart Conditions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 12:50:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence that can detect heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms in seconds. The device records an ECG and analyzes heart sounds imperceptible to the human ear, sending the data to an AI trained on thousands of patients for an almost instant diagnosis. A large-scale study in UK GP surgeries found that patients examined with the AI stethoscope were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with these conditions, allowing for earlier treatment. This innovation is being hailed as a potential "game-changer" for cardiovascular care, upgrading a 200-year-old medical tool for the 21st century.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger" offers a well-made, if less grimy, tribute to the Troma original. Starring Peter Dinklage as the janitor-turned-mutant-hero, the film retains the gratuitous gore and blunt parody but with a higher production value and a more sincere emotional core. The plot centers on Winston Goose's transformation into "Toxie" after being exposed to chemical sludge, leading him to seek revenge on a villainous pharmaceutical CEO played by Kevin Bacon. While diverting and fun, the review suggests its polished nature makes it a less authentic Troma experience, accessible even to mainstream audiences.</p>

          <h2>Drought Reveals 40 Ancient Tombs as Water Levels Recede in Iraq's Largest Reservoir</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists in northern Iraq have discovered approximately 40 ancient tombs, believed to be over 2,300 years old, that were exposed by receding water levels in the Mosul Dam reservoir. The severe drought plaguing the country for five consecutive years has lowered the water to a point where excavation of the Hellenistic-period tombs is possible. While the drought has had a devastating impact on agriculture and daily life, it has provided a rare opportunity for archaeological discovery. The team is working quickly to excavate and preserve the artifacts before the area is submerged again when water levels eventually rise.</p>
