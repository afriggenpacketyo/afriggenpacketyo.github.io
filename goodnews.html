          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his sixth Grand Slam title and the world number one ranking at the US Open, defeating rival Jannik Sinner with a performance his coach lauded as "perfect." The 22-year-old Spaniard demonstrated remarkable consistency throughout the tournament, dropping only one set and being broken just three times across 22 sets, even against formidable opponents like Sinner and Djokovic. Alcaraz attributed his success to studying his Wimbledon loss to Sinner and diligently improving his serve, which became a crucial foundation for his naturally flamboyant, big-hitting game. This victory extends his impressive winning streak to 13 matches, solidifying his position as a dominant force in men's tennis and marking what he considers his career-best tournament.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are expected to open higher, with investor attention keenly focused on France's imminent confidence vote for Prime Minister Francois Bayrou later today. Bayrou is widely anticipated to lose the vote due to ongoing political wrangling over significant budget cuts totaling €44 billion, which aim to reduce France's deficit but face strong opposition. His potential ousting could compel President Emmanuel Macron to appoint the country's fifth prime minister in less than two years, signaling political instability. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific markets traded mostly higher following Japan's Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, and U.S. stock futures remained stable ahead of critical inflation reports expected this week.

          <p>David Baltimore, a Nobel Prize-winning scientist and former Caltech president, has died at 87, concluding an illustrious career that profoundly shaped molecular biology. Awarded the Nobel Prize in 1975 for discovering reverse transcriptase, his groundbreaking work was crucial to understanding viruses like HIV and how genes modify cells, turning normal cells into cancer cells. Baltimore also played a leading role in national debates on genetic engineering and AIDS research, advocating for ethical boundaries and federal funding. Despite facing a high-profile scientific misconduct investigation from which he was eventually exonerated, he went on to successfully lead Caltech, leaving a lasting legacy as a visionary scientist and influential public figure.</p>

          <p>Japanese markets reacted positively to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, with the benchmark Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix climbing to a record high. Ishiba's departure comes after weeks of mounting pressure following his national election defeat late last year. Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae are emerging as key contenders to succeed him, with Takaichi, known for favoring deregulation and opposing interest rate hikes, seen as a potential driver of growth. Despite this initial market optimism, analysts from BMI anticipate a period of extended political uncertainty for Japan, influencing bond yields and contributing to a weakening yen.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz celebrated his US Open title as the "best tournament" of his career, defeating rival Jannik Sinner 6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4 to win his sixth Grand Slam title. The 22-year-old Spaniard showcased exceptional efficiency and consistency, dropping only one set and losing his serve just three times throughout the entire tournament, a significant improvement he had been working on. This victory also saw Alcaraz reclaim the world number one ATP ranking, a key goal for his season, after Sinner had held it for 65 consecutive weeks. Sinner, reflecting on his second Grand Slam final loss to Alcaraz this year, acknowledged his own "very predictable" play and expressed plans to make significant changes to his game.</p>

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has revealed that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This discovery is surprising because Mars, given its expected cooling rate, was not anticipated to have formed a solid inner core yet, making it only the third celestial body after Earth and the moon with such a feature. The finding suggests a similar proportion to Earth’s inner core and could revive the long-debated idea that Earth was not the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics. This breakthrough provides significant new insights into planetary evolution and the internal structure of rocky planets.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz defeated Jannik Sinner to win his second U.S. Open title, but the match was notably delayed by President Trump's attendance, causing long lines and mixed crowd reactions. Trump, attending in Rolex's luxury box, made an on-camera appearance during the national anthem, which broadcasters were reportedly advised to edit for crowd reaction. His presence, the first by a sitting president at the U.S. Open in over two decades, sparked controversy, especially given recent U.S. tariffs on Swiss products from Rolex's home country. The event highlighted the unusual intersection of high-profile sports and political presence, drawing significant attention beyond the championship match itself.</p>
