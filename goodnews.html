          <p>South Korea's new progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious stance on Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with China. This marks a potential shift from his predecessor's emphasis on trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan. During his campaign, Lee faced criticism for describing US Forces Korea as "occupation forces," indicating a potentially less aligned approach with the United States. However, continuity in military cooperation with the US and Japan is also anticipated, suggesting a balanced approach to foreign policy. </p>

          <p>Facing public discontent over rising rice prices, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is planning to overhaul the country's rice policy. The aim is to increase rice production and counter opposition parties' calls for a consumption tax cut. Ishiba has long advocated for reforming the rice policy, but faces challenges including the risk of oversupply and price plunges. The government has released reserve rice to lower prices and is considering boosting rice exports. (not investment advice)</p>
