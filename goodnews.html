          <p>Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka, two dominant figures in women's tennis, are set to face off in the French Open semi-final. This highly anticipated match marks their first encounter at the clay-court Grand Slam and their first competitive meeting since the Cincinnati Open last August. Swiatek, seeded fifth, is aiming for her fourth consecutive title, while Sabalenka seeks her first crown. Swiatek holds a head-to-head advantage with eight wins from 12 matches, including five of six on clay, but questions linger over her current form.

          <p>The British government announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 pupils in England from September 2026. Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, saving parents ¬£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029, with an additional ¬£13 million pledged to food charities. While the change has been largely welcomed, some argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective in reducing child poverty. The total number of children registered for free school meals in England is about 2.1 million, or 24.6% of the total pupil population.</p>

          <p>The UK's medicines regulator has warned women using weight-loss jabs to use effective contraception, citing concerns about potential harm to unborn babies. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss jabs may make the contraceptive pill less likely to work in those who are overweight or obese, the MHRA says. The agency has received reports of unintended pregnancies and emphasizes the importance of consulting with prescribers about the risks and benefits of these medications.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were defused in Cologne, Germany, after the city's largest evacuation since the war. More than 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center after the bombs were unearthed during road construction. Experts defused the bombs within about an hour, city authorities said in a statement. Unexploded bombs are frequently found in Germany, requiring large-scale precautionary evacuations, but the location this time was unusually prominent, just across the Rhine River from Cologne's historic center.</p>

The Thunder are favored due to their fearsome defense and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's performance, while the Pacers need strong performances from Siakam and Haliburton. The coaching advantage is debated, with some favoring Carlisle's experience and others Daigneault's adaptability. Jalen Williams and Alex Caruso are unheralded players to watch, and Gilgeous-Alexander is predicted to be the Finals MVP.

          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions to support retired police dogs, citing their vital service and subsequent medical needs. Each year, 50 to 70 dogs retire and are adopted, often with chronic health issues and injuries from their service. Laura Meller, who has adopted three former service animals, estimates she has spent ¬£12,000 on their care. Concerns are rising that high vet costs could deter potential adopters, potentially leading to euthanasia for older dogs.
