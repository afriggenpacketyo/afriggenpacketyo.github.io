        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's US$12.7 trillion stock market is experiencing a sustained rally, primarily fueled by a substantial shift of household savings into equities. Data from the People's Bank of China indicates a significant increase in deposits at non-banking financial institutions, totaling over 3.3 trillion yuan across July and August, suggesting further room for growth. This movement is largely driven by prevailing low-interest-rate policies, which are diminishing returns from traditional banking deposits and encouraging investors to seek higher yields in the capital market. The attractive 5.5% earnings yield of major Chinese listed companies, significantly surpassing government bonds and demand deposit rates, underscores the current appeal and potential for continued investment.

          <p>The UK and US have unveiled the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, a landmark agreement designed to accelerate nuclear power development and bolster energy security. This ambitious initiative is projected to generate thousands of jobs and unlock billions in private investment, aiming to position both nations at the forefront of global innovation. A key component involves streamlining regulatory approvals, significantly reducing the average licensing period for nuclear projects from up to four years to just two. The partnership also seeks to increase commercial collaborations between British and American firms, with specific projects already in discussion, promising stable energy prices for consumers.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is actively considering a "coal-to-nuclear" (C2N) initiative, proposing the conversion of existing coal-fired power plants into advanced nuclear facilities, primarily utilizing fourth-generation reactors. This strategic move aims to achieve significant decarbonization of the energy sector while efficiently repurposing valuable infrastructure, particularly in the nation's coastal areas. Researchers involved in the project suggest that these advanced reactors could offer enhanced site safety and foster greater public acceptance compared to older nuclear technologies. With over 1.19 terawatts of coal-fired capacity and roughly 100 gigawatts expected to retire by 2030, this plan represents a direct pathway for China to meet its ambitious climate goals and bolster energy sustainability.</p>

          <p>The UK and US governments are solidifying a series of transatlantic agreements to significantly expand the construction of modular nuclear reactors in Britain, providing a major boost to Labour's ambitious energy plans. This partnership will notably fast-track safety checks, nearly halving the licensing time for nuclear projects to approximately two years, while aiming to generate thousands of high-value jobs and substantial economic growth. Among the key projects, Centrica and US firm X-energy plan to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool, with the capacity to power 1.5 million homes. Further ventures include Holtec, EDF Energy, and Tritax developing data centers powered by small modular reactors, and Last Energy partnering with DP World for a micro modular plant at London Gateway port.</p>

          <p>The Atlanta Falcons secured their first victory of the season, dominating the Minnesota Vikings 22-6 in a low-scoring home opener where offensive struggles were evident for both teams. Vikings rookie quarterback J.J. McCarthy endured a challenging second NFL start, completing just 11 of 21 passes for 158 yards, throwing two interceptions, and suffering six sacks. While Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr. also had an inefficient performance, star running back Bijan Robinson carried the team with an impressive 143 rushing yards on 22 carries. The game evolved into a field goal contest, with Falcons kicker Parker Romo successfully converting all five of his attempts, including a long 54-yard kick, ultimately spoiling the Vikings' home opener.</p>

          <p>Jeff Hiller's unexpected Emmy win for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for HBO's "Somebody Somewhere" profoundly resonated within Hollywood, embodying the industry's often arduous and lengthy journey. His visibly stunned reaction and poignant acceptance speech, where he humorously recounted his 25-year struggle to gain recognition, powerfully underscored the persistent "slog" many actors endure. Hiller also commended "Somebody Somewhere" for its central themes of connection and love in a world increasingly perceived as lacking compassion, themes that are integral to his character's narrative. This victory highlighted that even critically adored shows and seasoned character actors can achieve significant breakthrough recognition against formidable odds, offering a moment of collective acknowledgment for the industry's unsung heroes.</p>

          <p>Netflix's drama "Adolescence" achieved a significant Emmy sweep, lauded for its unique one-take filming technique across its hour-long episodes, which created an immersive viewing experience.

Co-created by Stephen Graham, who was inspired by real-life teen stabbings, the show's success hinged on breakout star Owen Cooper's performance. "Adolescence" not only dominated the news agenda and became Netflix's second most-watched English-language series, but also spurred real-world impact, with the government supporting its availability in schools to address societal issues.</p>

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, publicly commending his "courage, urgency and optimism" as essential qualities for leading New York City through its current challenges. Despite acknowledging previous disagreements, Hochul highlighted Mamdani's shared commitment to ensuring children grow up safe, expanding economic opportunity, and making the city affordable. She also underscored their mutual resolve to fearlessly confront President Donald Trump's agenda, asserting that New York City must never be subjected to Trump's control. This endorsement from a moderate governor for a democratic socialist candidate is particularly noteworthy, especially given Mamdani's recent efforts to moderate his image, including an apology for past controversial statements regarding the NYPD.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index soared to a record high of 3,420.23, extending its winning streak to ten consecutive sessions, following Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol's announcement that the government would abandon its prior plan to raise taxes on stock investments. This robust market performance unfolded as broader Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading, with investors closely monitoring ongoing high-level US-China trade discussions in Madrid and evaluating a recent slate of Chinese economic data. The Kospi's strong upward trajectory stands in contrast to China's CSI 300, which registered only a modest advance despite reports of August's economic slowdown and a worsening real estate investment contraction. Meanwhile, US equity futures remained largely unchanged, as investors awaited the Federal Reserve's crucial meeting later in the week. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's Legislature has successfully passed Senate Bill 627, known as the "No Secret Police Act," which enacts a ban on most local and federal law enforcement officers from covering their faces during operations, including immigration enforcement. Introduced by Democratic state Senators Scott Wiener and Jesse Arreguin, the bill's primary objective is to enhance transparency and foster greater public trust, especially in light of intensified federal immigration operations. While specific exemptions exist for SWAT teams, approved undercover assignments, and medical or protective masks, the legislation broadly aims to prevent officers from evading discovery, recognition, or identification. Supporters additionally contend that the bill will help deter individuals from impersonating law enforcement officers. The measure now awaits Governor Gavin Newsom's signature for final approval.</p>
