          <p>China is restructuring its national laboratory system to create more focused and centralized research institutions aimed at advancing its technological ambitions. With approximately 500 labs now approved under the new model, the focus has shifted to clear mandates and direct accountability to Beijing's strategic agenda. A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, attended by the Minister of Science and Technology, underscored the program's goal of integrating the city's innovation sector into national development plans. This move reflects a broader strategy to streamline research efforts for geopolitical and economic competition.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has addressed the controversy surrounding the cover art for her new album, "Man's Best Friend." The original image, which depicts her on her knees at a man's feet, drew criticism for appearing submissive, though some fans interpreted it as satire. In a recent interview, Carpenter stated she was shocked by the backlash and that her interpretation is about being "in on the control" and exploring power dynamics. Amid the debate, she released an alternative, less provocative cover, but she continues to defend her artistic intentions for the original piece.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new crime comedy, "Caught Stealing," is set in 1998 New York City and stars Austin Butler as a bartender caught in a case of mistaken identity. The film successfully evokes the grungy, anything-goes atmosphere of the era but struggles to develop its characters beyond cartoonish outlines. Despite a strong cast including Zoë Kravitz and Regina King, the pulpy thriller prioritizes style over substance, resulting in a story with low stakes and underdeveloped motivations. The article suggests that while the film aims to be a sexy, gritty thriller for adults, it ultimately feels like a disposable rental from the period it depicts.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1 billion after no grand prize winner emerged from Wednesday's drawing. The new total, which has a cash value of $453.1 million, marks the sixth time the game's top prize has reached the billion-dollar threshold. No one has won the Powerball jackpot since May 31, allowing the prize to grow over successive drawings. The odds of winning the grand prize remain exceptionally slim at approximately 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

Raducanu suggested that the world's best players seem to have "a point to prove" when they play against her, consistently raising their game. This defeat follows similar losses to other top-ranked opponents in this year's Grand Slams.

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The five-day protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA), which he attributes to inaction by state Republicans. SEPTA is facing a massive operating deficit, leading to service reductions that impact students, workers, and elderly residents. Kenyatta's march is a symbolic act intended to highlight the growing crisis and pressure the legislature to approve one of several bipartisan proposals to fund mass transit.</p>

The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, finding that the administration likely acted unlawfully. The judges ruled that the TPS statute, as written by Congress, does not permit the Homeland Security Secretary to simply vacate a prior extension of the status. This decision provides temporary relief for TPS holders who were facing the loss of their permission to live and work in the U.S.</p>

Shelton was leading by two sets to one when the injury occurred, leading to a tearful concession that allowed Mannarino to advance to the last 16 at the US Open for the first time.</p>
