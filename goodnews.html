          <p>Kim Jong-un's decision to skip Russia's Victory Day parade signals a complex diplomatic strategy, as his attendance would have been a rare opportunity for a North Korean leader to participate in a high-profile international event. Instead, Kim's absence conveys restraint, retreat, and defiance, avoiding an awkward spotlight alongside Chinese President Xi Jinping and public alignment with Putin that could strain ties with China. Kim instead visited the Russian embassy in Pyongyang, reaffirming the "blood-sealed" alliance with Russia while managing relations with Beijing. The article suggests Kim's choice reflects a nuanced approach to international relations amid geopolitical complexities.</p>

          <p>A bear sighting on a golf course in central Japan led to the cancellation of the final round of the Twinfields Ladies tournament, marking the second time in less than two weeks that wild animals disrupted a pro golf tournament. Reina Maeda, who was leading after the second round, was declared the winner of the tournament. The incident highlights the increasing encounters between humans and bears in Japan, attributed to climate change affecting food sources and hibernation times, as well as depopulation in rural areas. The Japanese government has approved a bill allowing hunters to shoot bears in populated areas as a result.</p>

          <p>UK ministers are considering scrapping the two-child benefit cap, a policy that prevents most families from claiming means-tested benefits for any third or additional children born after April 2017. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson acknowledges that the policy has pushed people into poverty, but warns that removing the cap would be costly. The government is expected to announce its decision in the autumn, alongside its child poverty strategy, with Phillipson emphasizing that the "cost of inaction" is also incredibly high due to its impact on children's life chances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Politicians are trying to boost manufacturing in the U.S. due to the belief that these jobs are special, and this article explores whether that belief is justified. Research suggests that manufacturing jobs pay a premium, especially for workers without a college education, although this premium varies by subsector. The reasons for this premium may include a history of unionization, the need to compensate for potentially unpleasant working conditions, and the need for skilled workers to handle expensive machinery. The article concludes that manufacturing continues to offer good jobs, particularly in advanced manufacturing, but that focus should also be placed on creating good jobs in the service sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China, the world‚Äôs largest greenhouse gas emitter, has experienced a decline in overall emissions for the first time, even as energy demand and economic activity increased. This shift is attributed to China's aggressive deployment of wind, solar, and nuclear power, outpacing electricity demand growth and reducing reliance on coal and gas. The decline puts China ahead of schedule in meeting its climate targets, including peaking emissions before 2030. The article suggests that China's investments in clean energy, both domestically and through exports, are contributing to global climate goals, although concerns remain about emissions of other greenhouse gases and the potential for future increases.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the possibility of delaying or eliminating menopause, challenging long-held assumptions about the female reproductive cycle. New treatments, including medications and procedures, aim to slow down ovarian aging and mitigate the hormonal changes associated with midlife. While delaying menopause could potentially reduce the risk of certain illnesses, some experts raise concerns about the ethical implications of treating women's aging as a condition that needs to be cured. The article explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of these new treatments, balancing medical advancements with the social and emotional aspects of aging.</p>

          <p>England goalkeeper Mary Earps has announced her retirement from international football, just weeks before the Lionesses are set to defend their European Championship title. The 32-year-old played a key role in England's Euro 2022 victory but had recently lost her starting position to Hannah Hampton. Earps made 53 senior appearances for England over eight years, also winning the 2023 Women's Finalissima and reaching the final of the 2023 Women's World Cup. England manager Sarina Wiegman expressed disappointment, while Earps stated that it was the right time to give younger players an opportunity.</p>

          <p>Shipments of iPhones from India to the U.S. rose 76% in April year on year, while shipments from China fell about 76%, indicating Apple's shift in manufacturing strategy. The surge comes as Apple accelerates its "made in India" plans in response to Washington's tariffs against China. Analysts expect this growth to slow due to India's limited manufacturing capacity, and that protectionist measures from Washington and Beijing could also curb expansion. Despite the shift in final assembly, a vast majority of the sub-assemblies are still in China. (not investment advice)</p>

The author argues that pronatalist policies, aimed at increasing birth rates, are insufficient without robust support systems like affordable maternity care, parental leave, and childcare.

Japan's limited room for maneuver in tariff negotiations with the U.S. and its reliance on the U.S. for security make the situation particularly challenging.

          <p>A new study suggests that Hells Canyon, the deepest river gorge in the United States, was rapidly carved around 2.1 million years ago, when a shifting landscape in Idaho caused a giant lake to overflow. Researchers analyzed ancient river sediments found inside the canyon's caves, which now lie high above the Snake River. The findings indicate that the canyon is younger than the Grand Canyon and emerged when a huge lake drained away, leading to a "fill and spill" episode that carved out Hells Canyon.</p>
