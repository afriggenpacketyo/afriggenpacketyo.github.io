          <p>Chinese shipping firm SeaLegend Line has initiated a new express service to Europe via the Arctic's Northern Sea Route, aiming to serve the cross-border e-commerce market. The vessel Istanbul Bridge departed from Qingdao and is expected to reach Gdansk, Poland, in about a month, with stops in the UK, Netherlands, and Germany. This route offers a significantly shorter transit time compared to the traditional Suez Canal path, though at a higher cost per container. The service targets customers with time-sensitive and high-value cargo, positioning its pricing between standard sea freight and the faster China-Europe Railway Express.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook has stated that the price hikes for the new iPhone 17 Pro models are not a result of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Speaking from a New York City store during the global launch, Cook was clear that tariffs did not factor into the new pricing structure, which saw a $100 increase for the Pro model. To mitigate tariff impacts, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, shifting some production to countries like India and Vietnam. Despite these efforts, the company reported an $800 million hit from tariff-related costs in the previous quarter, and it continues to face questions about its AI strategy and competition in key markets like China.</p>

Hunt edged out Jamaican champion Shericka Jackson for second place with a time of 22.14 seconds. The race was won by American Melissa Jefferson-Wooden, who completed a sprint sweep after also winning the 100m title. This achievement represents a significant breakthrough for Hunt, who previously won a 4x100m relay silver at the Paris Olympics and is now establishing herself as a top contender on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Reports circulating on Chinese social media that Poland officially sent troops to Ukraine are false, stemming from a misinterpretation of comments made by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy had mentioned that Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk agreed to send military representatives to Ukraine to advise on drone defense. However, the Polish Ministry of Defense clarified that any joint training or expert cooperation would occur exclusively on Polish territory. Despite this clarification, content farms and some online outlets continued to spread the inaccurate narrative, often combining it with unrelated news of Polish military drills to create a sensationalized and misleading story.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict the storm will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open water for the next several days. The current forecast track shows Gabrielle moving north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island.</p>

In a notable statement, Pakistan's defense minister confirmed that his country's nuclear capabilities would be made available to Saudi Arabia if required under the pact.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping held a call to finalize a deal aimed at keeping the social media platform TikTok operational in the United States. The discussion follows a "framework" agreement reached earlier in the week to address U.S. national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. A federal law had given ByteDance an ultimatum to either sell its U.S. operations or face a ban. President Trump, who has expressed his support for the app, has extended the deadline for divestment multiple times, with the current deadline set for December 16.</p>

A labor economist from ZipRecruiter suggests this trend is due to a better alignment between job seekers' goals and employers' needs, with both sides prioritizing stability.

          <p>Neel Kashkari, President of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, has expressed his support for two more interest rate cuts this year, following the quarter-point reduction approved this week. He argued that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs is likely to be a temporary, one-time effect, which, combined with a weakening labor market, creates room for more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari, who does not have a vote on the policy-setting committee this year, stated his belief that inflation expectations remain contained. His view suggests a more dovish stance, even as core inflation currently runs above the Fed's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a supply chain strategy known as B2B2C (business-to-business-to-consumer) to reduce the impact of tariffs and avoid raising prices for customers. This model involves routing online sales through a middleman company that acts as a U.S. merchant of record, purchasing the product at a wholesale price from the retailer. The middleman then pays the U.S. tariff on the lower wholesale value rather than the full retail price, which can cut the tariff cost by 30% to 60%. This "tariff arbitrage" allows brands to absorb the financial pressure from the ongoing trade war without passing the entire cost increase on to consumers.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has defended his decision to formally recognize a Palestinian state, asserting that it is a necessary step to isolate Hamas and advance a peace plan. Responding to criticism from U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who called the move "reckless," Macron argued that Hamas's goal is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a Palestinian state. Therefore, he believes that pursuing a two-state solution through recognition is a precondition for stopping the war and countering the extremist group's narrative. France plans to formalize its decision at the upcoming United Nations General Assembly, a move that puts it at odds with current U.S. policy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article questions the validity of drastic projections suggesting a severe decline in China's population by the end of the century. The author points out that such forecasts often lack clear justification when compared to projections for other countries, like the expected population growth in the United States. In contrast, research from prominent Chinese universities, such as Renmin and Peking University, presents a more moderate scenario where China's population could be around 1.12 billion. The piece suggests that pessimistic demographic forecasts for China should be viewed with skepticism amid a global environment of increasing confrontation and complex migration trends.</p>
