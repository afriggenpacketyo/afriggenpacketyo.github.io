          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 08:47:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>JPMorgan Chase announced second-quarter financial results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in fixed income trading and investment banking. The bank reported earnings of $5.24 per share on $45.68 billion in revenue, topping estimates despite a 17% decline in net income compared to the previous year, which had been inflated by a gain on Visa shares. CEO Jamie Dimon highlighted the U.S. economy's resilience but also reiterated warnings about risks from trade policy, geopolitical conditions, and high fiscal deficits. The bank's trading operations capitalized on market turbulence, with fixed income trading revenue jumping 14%.</p>

          <p>Citigroup reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter earnings, with revenue from its markets and banking divisions showing significant growth. The bank posted earnings of $1.96 per share on $21.67 billion in revenue, surpassing analyst forecasts and reflecting a 25% increase in net income from the same period last year. CEO Jane Fraser highlighted that the markets division had its best second quarter since 2020, while banking revenues rose 18%. However, the bank also increased its allowance for credit losses, citing a deterioration in the economic outlook compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology company Baidu has formed a multi-year partnership with Uber to deploy its Apollo Go autonomous vehicles on the ride-hailing platform in markets outside the U.S. and mainland China. The collaboration is set to begin later this year in Asia and the Middle East, eventually involving thousands of Baidu's driverless cars on Uber's global network. For Baidu, this deal facilitates the international expansion of its autonomous driving business, which already operates as a robotaxi service in several Chinese cities. For Uber, it provides a strategic partnership with a proven autonomous vehicle company to compete globally.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of people from Afghanistan. The administration had intended to end the deportation protections and work permits, arguing that the security situation in Afghanistan had improved. However, advocacy groups sued, contending that the country remains unsafe and that the decision was part of a broader anti-immigrant agenda. The 4th Circuit Court of Appeals' ruling provides a one-week pause, giving both sides time to file briefs on the case, which affects approximately 11,700 Afghans currently enrolled in the program.</p>

The initiative, part of Chancellor Rachel Reeves's broader financial services reforms, aims to help savers achieve better returns while boosting the UK economy. The plan also includes a review of risk warnings on investment products to ensure they help people accurately assess risk levels, though it may raise concerns about potential fraud.</p>

          <p>In a high-level meeting, China's top leadership declared a fundamental shift in the nation's urban development model, moving away from large-scale expansion to focus on optimizing existing urban resources. With 67% of its population now in urban areas, officials stated that city planning must adapt to changing circumstances by prioritizing human well-being, efficiency, and governance. The new framework also aims to reform the beleaguered property sector, with an emphasis on renovating urban villages and repairing dilapidated housing. The government has also pledged to provide more urban citizenship benefits to migrant workers as part of this strategic transformation.</p>

          <p>To encourage the transition away from petrol and diesel vehicles, the UK government is introducing a grant scheme that will offer discounts of up to £3,750 on new electric cars. The grants, funded by a £650 million scheme available for three years, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000. Carmakers can apply for funding, and the discount will be applied directly at the dealership, simplifying the process for consumers. This initiative is part of the government's push to meet its 2030 ban on the sale of new fossil fuel-powered cars, though some critics argue the country still lacks sufficient charging infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review in The Atlantic explores Norwegian author Linn Ullmann's latest novel, "Girl, 1983," which challenges traditional memoir conventions by centering on the act of forgetting. The book's narrator attempts to reconstruct a painful adolescent memory of a relationship with an older photographer, but finds the story is composed more of absences than clear recollections. The article notes the novel's strong autobiographical parallels to Ullmann's own life as the daughter of Ingmar Bergman and Liv Ullmann. By labeling the deeply personal work a novel, Ullmann subverts genre expectations and suggests that all autobiography is a form of fiction shaped by the unreliable nature of memory.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang confirmed the decision, stating that licenses will be granted and shipments could begin soon, a move seen as vital for American companies to compete in the dynamic Chinese market. This decision comes after a previous ban on such sales announced in April and follows lobbying efforts by tech leaders who argued the restrictions hindered U.S. competitiveness.
