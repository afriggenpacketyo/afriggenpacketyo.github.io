          <h2>Trump Hints at Forthcoming Trade Deals Amid Ongoing Negotiations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump indicated that new trade deals could be announced soon, as his administration faces pressure to finalize agreements before a pause on reciprocal tariffs ends. The U.S. has been in negotiations with several countries, including Canada, Italy, India, Japan, and the United Kingdom. While no specific details have been released, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that deals could be announced this week. China is notably absent from active trade talks, though Bessent is scheduled to meet with a Chinese delegation in Switzerland. Experts anticipate that any potential agreements would likely be nonbinding 'gentlemen's agreements'.</p>

          <p>Casey Johnston, a writer, transformed her relationship with her body after discovering weightlifting. After years of running and dieting, she found weightlifting through a Reddit post. Johnston had previously seen exercise as a means to achieve the goal of not being fat, absorbing the cultural message that its purpose was to make her as small as possible. Johnston's new book details how lifting weights helped her build emotional strength, repair disordered eating, and enjoy food. She learned that her body could feel good, powerful, and capable of doing things, shifting her attitude from denial to embracing movement, rest, and eating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the perception of a fully MAGA White House in Trump's second term, certain establishment figures are regaining influence, particularly in economic and foreign policy. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, initially appearing hapless, has convinced Trump to pause tariffs and is leading trade negotiations. Marco Rubio, named secretary of state, has also gained prominence, securing key foreign policy jobs. While hardliners remain ascendant in areas like immigration, a tug of war exists in economic and foreign policy, with Trump favoring establishment figures to clean up messes when things get too chaotic. The establishment has learned to work within Trump's decision-making framework, convincing him to make better choices rather than directly opposing him.</p>

The UK was spared the higher tariffs but still hit with a baseline levy. A spokesperson for the office of the U.K. Prime Minister said that talks on a deal between the countries have been continuing at pace and the Prime Minister will update later today.</p>

          <p>An interim report states that the root cause of a fire that led to the shutdown of Heathrow Airport remains unknown. The airport was closed to all flights for much of March 21st after a fire at a nearby electrical substation caused a power outage. The National Energy System Operator (Neso) said a transformer disconnected and caught fire at the substation. While power was restored within hours, flights did not resume until later in the day after safety checks. The Metropolitan Police's counter-terrorism unit found no evidence to suggest the incident was suspicious.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump briefly announced a 100% tariff on movies made outside America, causing concern in Hollywood before the White House retracted the statement. While Hollywood remains a dominant moviemaking industry with high film exports, it faces challenges such as fewer movies being made in Los Angeles due to cheaper labor and tax credits offered overseas. Trump's proposed tariff aimed to bring moviemaking back to America, but filmmakers argued it would halt production and potentially backfire due to retaliatory levies from other countries. The industry prefers tax credits as an incentive to lure moviemakers back to America.</p>

          <p>The United States and Britain are expected to announce a trade deal that will lower the burden of President Trump's tariffs and potentially deliver a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.

A major goal of British negotiators has been to reduce or lift the U.S. import tax on U.K. cars and steel. Britain has also sought tariff exemptions for pharmaceuticals, while the U.S. wants greater access to the British market for agriculture products.</p>

The technology allows for rapid vaccine development and has potential for treating diseases like cancer and cystic fibrosis. The article addresses common concerns about mRNA vaccines, clarifying that they cannot affect DNA. While the COVID-19 vaccine can cause side effects, the risks are outweighed by the benefits of protection against the virus.</p>

          <p>The US and the UK are expected to announce a deal to reduce tariffs, though it will not be a comprehensive trade agreement. President Trump does not have the authority to sign such an agreement, which would require Congressional approval. The deal is likely to include exemptions or lowering of tariffs on specific goods, but most goods imported from the UK to the US will still face a 10% tariff. Cars are an important part of the deal, and the UK could see a lowering of the 25% tariff or a quota system. The agreement could also address steel and aluminum tariffs and the UK's digital services tax on US firms.</p>
