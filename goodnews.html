          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper secured his place in the next round of Wimbledon after his opponent, Sebastian Baez of Argentina, retired due to an injury. Draper was comfortably leading the match 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could not continue after slipping on the baseline. As the new British number one following Andy Murray's retirement, Draper carries the nation's hopes but acknowledged it was not the ideal way to win. He will face 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic in the second round.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel announced that the bureau will be moving its headquarters from the aging J. Edgar Hoover Building to the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C. The move, touted as a more cost-effective and modern solution, ends nearly two decades of debate over a new location for the FBI. President Donald Trump praised the decision, stating the FBI will finally have a building that reflects its status as a premier law enforcement agency. The transition will occur in phases to ensure security and technology requirements are met.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks experienced a significant rally after a proposed tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of the Republican spending bill. The provision would have imposed a heavy tax on projects using components from foreign entities of concern, primarily China, adding a potential $7 billion burden to the industry. While industry groups were relieved by the removal of the punitive tax, they remain critical of the overall bill, which still phases out key investment tax credits that have supported the growth of renewable energy in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare has announced it will now block artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly affect how AI models are trained. Website owners using Cloudflare's services will now have to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their content, and a new 'pay per crawl' model will allow them to charge for access. This change aims to restore power to content creators, who have seen their traffic and ad revenue decline as AI models use their work without compensation or attribution. The decision puts pressure on AI developers to find new, consensual ways to gather training data.</p>

          <p>French player Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard made Wimbledon history by hitting a 153 mph serve, the fastest ever recorded at the tournament, during his first-round match against Taylor Fritz. Despite this incredible feat and hitting 37 aces, the 21-year-old ultimately lost the grueling five-set match to the American fifth seed. The record-breaking serve surpassed the previous best of 148 mph set by Taylor Dent. While Mpetshi Perricard's raw power was on full display, Fritz's consistency and experience prevailed in the end, highlighting that sheer speed is not always enough to secure a victory.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is investing billions in recruiting top-tier artificial intelligence talent, a move that could add an estimated $1 billion in annual expenses, yet Wall Street remains supportive. Investors appear to view the high costs as a necessary investment to compete in the transformative field of AI, with potential long-term payoffs in both cost savings and new revenue streams. The spending spree includes the high-profile hiring of Scale AI's former CEO and poaching researchers from rivals like OpenAI and Google. As long as Meta demonstrates progress, particularly in improving its Llama language model, the market seems willing to tolerate the significant expenditure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A financial report suggests that homeowners can strategically use their accumulated home equity, even in a high-interest-rate environment. With home equity loan and HELOC rates averaging around 8%, they offer a more affordable borrowing option compared to credit cards, which have rates above 21%. The article outlines five smart uses for a $100,000 equity loan: paying off high-interest debt, funding strategic home renovations to boost value, investing in a diversified portfolio, starting a business, or financing education. However, it cautions that this strategy turns equity into secured debt, putting the home at risk if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan to implement mass layoffs and a major reorganization at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 Democratic attorneys general, who argued the plan would cause 'devastating consequences' to public health services. The judge found 'no rational basis' for the administration's plan, which included laying off some 10,000 employees and restructuring agencies like the CDC and FDA. The court order blocks HHS from proceeding with the overhaul, stating the executive branch lacks the authority for such wholesale changes without Congressional action.</p>
