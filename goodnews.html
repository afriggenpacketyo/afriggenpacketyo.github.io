          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the country defend itself against Russia's ongoing aggression. This decision reverses a temporary pause on some weapon shipments, which was reportedly part of a broader review of U.S. military stockpiles. The Pentagon confirmed the move, stating it aligns with America First defense priorities aimed at securing a lasting peace. The announcement followed recent calls between Trump, Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, and Russian President Putin, with Trump expressing disappointment in his conversation with Putin.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Chinese students are choosing Singapore over the United States for their higher education, citing cultural similarities and safety concerns. Difficulties in cultural adjustment and parental worries about security in the U.S. are prompting this shift. Singapore is seen as an attractive alternative due to its high economic and diplomatic openness, warm climate, and familiar cultural environment. Industry experts predict this trend will continue, with Singapore likely to see an increase in applications from Chinese students seeking overseas education.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has begun phasing out the mandatory shoe removal rule for passengers in standard security lines at several U.S. airports. The change, confirmed by sources, is initially being implemented at airports including Baltimore/Washington International and Fort Lauderdale International, though travelers at other major hubs have also reported not having to remove their shoes. This adjustment relaxes a post-9/11 security measure that was officially adopted nationwide in 2006 following the attempted "shoe bomber" plot. Travelers with TSA PreCheck were already exempt from this requirement.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has voted to advance a permanent ordinance aimed at preventing "renovictions," where landlords evict tenants under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The new rule would prohibit landlords from using a remodel as a just cause for eviction unless they have a specific Government Agency Order to vacate the unit for safety reasons. The city is also developing regulations that would require landlords to provide relocation assistance or comparable temporary housing for tenants during legitimate renovations. This move aims to protect renters while still allowing for necessary property upgrades.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has issued a temporary restraining order preventing a provision in a new law from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The organization had sued the Trump administration, arguing that the provision, which targets providers of abortion services, was an unconstitutional attempt to punish them for legal activities. The law would have blocked Medicaid reimbursements for non-abortion services for one year, which Planned Parenthood stated would devastate its clinics and the over one million Medicaid patients they serve. The judge's order preserves funding for 14 days pending a further hearing.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stimulate its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This major policy shift has already led to a substantial increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings. The move is designed to make travel to China less cumbersome and more appealing for international tourists and business people. While most visitors are still from visa-free regions in Europe and Asia, the policy is expected to attract a broader range of global travelers.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will sever ties with online course provider Simplilearn after settling a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partnership misled students. The lawsuit claimed a cybersecurity bootcamp was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students. Caltech also announced it will create a new faculty oversight committee to review its other professional education programs, a move seen as a win for consumer protection advocates.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs announced it has abandoned a previously planned reduction-in-force (RIF) that could have resulted in tens of thousands of layoffs in August. The VA stated that it is on track to reduce its workforce by about 30,000 employees by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a hiring freeze, making a large-scale RIF unnecessary. The initial plan would have cut the workforce by up to 80,000 to return to 2019 staffing levels. The reversal follows a department-wide review aimed at improving services for veterans.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career achievements, came as a surprise to Kershaw, who has made only nine starts this season after returning from surgery. He expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor," acknowledging that his performance this season alone might not have warranted the selection. This special designation has previously been used for other future Hall of Famers like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera toward the end of their careers.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have decided not to prosecute individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade in late June, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was fueled by Budapest's mayor declaring it an official municipal event, potentially exempting it from the ban. Despite the government's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda and threats of fines, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people. The mayor, however, still faces a police investigation for organizing a prohibited gathering.</p>
