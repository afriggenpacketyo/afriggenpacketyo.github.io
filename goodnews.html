          <p>Federal Reserve officials are expected to maintain current interest rates at this week's policy meeting, but their updated economic forecasts will likely influence market sentiment. Investors will closely examine the "dot plot," a grid of individual members' rate expectations, to gauge the likelihood of future rate cuts. The committee previously indicated two quarter-percentage-point reductions this year, aligning with current market pricing. However, geopolitical factors, including tariffs and Middle East tensions, add complexity to the Fed's decision-making process, as President Trump continues to urge the Fed to lower rates.

          <p>The Messiah Falcons, an NCAA Division III baseball team, shifted their focus from winning to serving Christ, leading them to an unexpected run to the World Series championship game.

Coach Phillip Shallenberger even had his players carry 250-pound crosses as a workout. Players added scripture to their play-call wristbands, reminding them to show love to Jesus and others, no matter their performance.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill that establishes federal guidelines for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creates a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill mandates full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. While praised by some as a milestone for the crypto industry, others criticize it as enabling President Trump to profit personally from digital assets, as the Trump family has ventures including the controversial $TRUMP meme coin, a $2.5 billion bitcoin Treasury and proposed bitcoin and ether ETFs via Truth.Fi, and a newly launched mining firm called American Bitcoin. The bill now moves to the House for consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming Democratic mayoral primary, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and the second-choice votes are then counted. This system has led to unusual alliances, such as state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani and city comptroller Brad Lander cross-endorsing each other to prevent former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from winning. The election board expects to provide preliminary totals for voters' first-choice votes on June 24 after polls close, and then run the ranked-choice tabulation on July 1.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer explained that he quickly picked up papers dropped by US President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit to prevent White House security from intervening. Starmer feared that anyone else approaching the president in that situation could face unwanted consequences. The incident occurred during a discussion about the newly signed UK-US trade deal, which Starmer described as a "huge relief" for workers at Jaguar Land Rover. The deal removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and reduces levies on cars exported from the UK to the US.</p>
