        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng have experienced a significant rally, gaining nearly 80% this year, fueled by strong sales and expectations of profitability. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled, driven by robust vehicle deliveries, which in turn narrowed its net loss and improved its gross margin. Analysts predict that Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, attributing this to its strong sales momentum and pipeline of new models. UOB Kay Hian maintains a buy rating on the stock, projecting a substantial upside from its current price. </p>

          <p>The New York Knicks suffered a painful defeat in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Indiana Pacers, squandering a substantial double-digit lead in the fourth quarter. The Pacers mounted a comeback, fueled by Aaron Nesmith's six consecutive three-pointers and Tyrese Haliburton's clutch performance, ultimately forcing overtime. Despite a strong performance from Jalen Brunson, the Knicks were unable to secure the victory, losing 138-135. The series is a rematch of last year's second round, adding to the intensity of the rivalry. </p>
