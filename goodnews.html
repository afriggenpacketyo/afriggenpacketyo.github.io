          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, reported missing after failing to return from a surf, has been safely rescued. He was found on North Solitary Island, an uninhabited island approximately seven miles off the coast of New South Wales, after spending a night stranded. A large-scale land and water search was initiated by police after his family raised the alarm. The rescue was hailed as a "one in a million miracle" by his father, and the teenager is now receiving medical attention.</p>

          <p>More than 30 construction workers were successfully rescued after a partial collapse in a large industrial tunnel being built under Los Angeles. The workers, who were about 400 feet underground, were trapped between the cave-in and the tunnel's entrance but managed to navigate over the debris to a boring machine for extraction. No major injuries were reported, and officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, praised the first responders and the workers' composure. The $700 million project is now on hold pending an investigation.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo is experiencing a period of optimism driven by both political and sporting developments. A recent peace deal with neighboring Rwanda, if it holds, could bring stability to a region plagued by decades of conflict. This potential for peace coincides with the men's national football team leading their qualification group for the 2026 World Cup. Analysts suggest that stability and World Cup qualification could attract investment, foster development, and provide positive opportunities for the nation's youth.</p>

          <p>A journalist recounts taking his nine-year-old neurodivergent son to his first professional soccer match, a Club World Cup semi-final between Chelsea and Fluminense. Initially, the overwhelming noise, lights, and pyrotechnics of the event caused the boy significant distress. However, empathetic stadium staff provided noise-canceling headphones and moved the family to a quieter, more accessible seating area. This act of kindness transformed the experience, allowing the child to watch the game comfortably, highlighting a moment of humanity amidst the commercialized spectacle of modern sports.</p>

          <p>Owen Farrell has been selected for the bench for the British and Irish Lions' upcoming tour match against an Australia/New Zealand Invitational side. This marks a potential return to high-level rugby for Farrell, who has been sidelined for over two months due to a concussion and previously stepped away from international play. The match is the final fixture before the Test series against Australia, and Farrell's inclusion as a replacement could signal a remarkable comeback.

          <p>The UK and France are reportedly close to a new agreement aimed at curbing illegal migration across the English Channel. The deal would involve France taking back a certain number of migrants who cross, in exchange for the UK accepting a similar number of asylum seekers with legitimate claims from France. However, the effectiveness of this "one-in-one-out" pilot scheme is being questioned, as its initial scale may be too small to act as a significant deterrent. The ultimate test of the policy will be whether it leads to a noticeable reduction in the number of people attempting the dangerous journey.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, is reportedly shifting the hero's focus from American exceptionalism to a more global "universal morality." The film presents a battered Superman who stands for kindness and protects the weak worldwide, a concept rooted in the character's origin as an immigrant refugee. This thematic direction has sparked debate among commentators, with some right-wing figures criticizing it as "woke." The article explores how superhero narratives often reflect contemporary political and cultural divisions.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have developed a robot that performed a realistic gallbladder removal surgery with what they described as 100% accuracy. The machine, which uses a machine learning system similar to ChatGPT, was trained on surgical videos and was able to operate with the skill of an expert human surgeon. In a significant advance, the robot could adapt to unexpected situations and respond to voice commands from the research team. This breakthrough marks a major step toward creating clinically viable autonomous systems for use in real-world operating rooms.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, traditionally a role held by the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc. The argument is based on China's low inflation, large foreign reserves, and the currency's recent stability during periods of global stress. This perspective contributes to the ongoing debate about the internationalization of the yuan, especially as confidence in the U.S. dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist trade policies.

          <p>The market for weight-loss medication in China is rapidly expanding, with projections valuing it at US$150 billion as dozens of domestic producers enter the field. This growth mirrors the trend in Western countries, driven by the introduction of more effective drugs and increasing obesity rates. The article explains that Innovent Biologics was the first Chinese company to receive approval to market a new-generation weight-loss drug in the country. This positions the domestic pharmaceutical industry to compete in a highly lucrative and burgeoning market.</p>

          <p>Vienna is often highlighted as a "renters' utopia" due to its successful housing policies, which are rooted in a large and stable social-housing sector. This sector, comprising about 43% of the city's housing units, is accessible to a wide range of income levels, not just the poor. The system keeps rent levels significantly lower than the private market and helps to moderate private rental prices as well. While not without challenges, such as a complex allocation system, Vienna's long-term political commitment to treating housing as a basic need offers a powerful example for other cities.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Beijing Institute of Technology have successfully created a "cyborg bee" by equipping it with the world's lightest insect brain controller. The device, weighing only 74 milligrams, is attached to the bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses to its brain. These pulses can create illusions that command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of accuracy. This breakthrough in bio-robotics could have significant implications for various fields, including remote sensing and rescue operations.</p>
