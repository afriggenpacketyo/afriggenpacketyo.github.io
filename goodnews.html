          <p>The Natural History Museum in London will display a newly identified dinosaur species, Enigmacursor mollyborthwickae, which lived approximately 150 million years ago. Originally misclassified as a Nanosaurus, scientists now recognize it as a distinct species due to unique features in its leg bones. The discovery sheds light on the evolutionary history of small dinosaurs and their transformation into larger, more complex animals. The fossilized remains are the most complete of any in the world for early small dinosaurs, making this discovery essential for understanding dinosaur diversity.</p>

While advocates claim it can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and land use, critics argue that its environmental benefits are overstated and that it is an ultra-processed food controlled by multinational companies. The science behind lab-grown meat involves growing cells from farm animals in vats, but the process requires significant energy and resources.

          <p>This article examines the changing attitudes of voters toward political scandals, noting that scandals no longer serve as simple disqualifiers. Politicians now seem able to survive scandals, with voters and politicians treating them as just another factor in a cost-benefit analysis. The article cites examples such as Andrew Cuomo and Donald Trump, discussing how factors like scandal fatigue and partisan polarization influence voter behavior. The author suggests that while scandals can still hurt a politician, voters are often willing to overlook them if they believe the candidate is more electable or if they strongly oppose the rival's worldview.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, announcing it had achieved its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and aims to reduce costs by another $1 billion in the next fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with a 10% rise in U.S. ground home delivery volume. While FedEx's stock dropped slightly in after-hours trading, the company's long-term cost-cutting initiative, the DRIVE program, is expected to improve profitability. The company forecasts flat to 2% year-over-year revenue growth for its fiscal first quarter of 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency prices, including Bitcoin, experienced a surge following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, alongside the unveiling of a significant crypto bill in the Senate. Bitcoin surpassed $105,000, Ether climbed above $2,400, and XRP reached $2.19. Republican senators introduced legislation aimed at setting regulatory guidelines for crypto, defining when crypto is a commodity or security and reducing SEC regulation. This follows the Senate's passage of a stablecoin bill, marking a legislative win for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Sam Altman Dismisses Trademark Lawsuit as 'Silly'</h2>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticized a lawsuit filed by hardware startup Iyo, accusing OpenAI of trademark infringement related to its acquisition of Jony Ive's AI startup io. Altman stated that Iyo's CEO had persistently sought investment from OpenAI, and is now suing over the name, which he considers "silly, disappointing and wrong." OpenAI removed the blog post about the deal from its website after a judge granted Iyo's request for a temporary restraining order. Altman shared emails suggesting Iyo sought investment and acquisition by OpenAI, while Iyo argues there are many other names OpenAI could have chosen.</p>
