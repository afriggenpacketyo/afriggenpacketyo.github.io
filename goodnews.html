          <p>A volunteer-run nonprofit, Dog Coalition Los Angeles, is tackling the city's animal shelter overpopulation crisis by providing comprehensive support for fostering large dogs. The program matches shelter dogs with foster homes and offers training, resources, and a strong peer community to improve adoption success rates. By focusing on education and building relationships between fosters, the coalition not only saves animals but also creates human connections among participants. This innovative approach makes fostering more accessible and helps ensure successful, lasting adoptions for dogs in need.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Museum of Art is showcasing "Realms of the Dharma: Buddhist Art Across Asia," a major exhibition featuring 180 sculptures and paintings from its permanent collection. These significant works have been largely unavailable to the public for nearly eight years due to the museum's campus reconstruction and a pandemic-disrupted tour. The exhibition presents a chronological and geographical survey of Buddhist art, from early symbolic representations to diverse figurative forms across Asia. While celebrated for its artistic splendor, the presentation also raises questions about its curatorial approach and the provenance of certain sacred objects.</p>

          <h2>Proposed Change to Federal Law Could Lower Housing Costs by Reforming Manufactured Homes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A simple legislative change to a 50-year-old federal law could help alleviate the U.S. housing crisis by making manufactured homes more affordable and accessible. The proposal involves removing the "permanent chassis" mandate, a requirement that forces these homes to be built on a steel trailer frame, even when installed permanently. This rule increases costs, limits design flexibility, and provides a pretext for exclusionary zoning laws that stigmatize the homes as "mobile." Advocates argue that eliminating the mandate could significantly scale up production, offering a cost-effective solution for first-time buyers and those seeking to downsize.</p>

          <p>The UK government is reviving its Pensions Commission to address warnings that future generations will be worse off in retirement than today's pensioners. According to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), almost half of working-age adults are not contributing to a private pension, with significant gaps among the self-employed, low earners, women, and some ethnic minorities. The commission, which previously led to the creation of automatic enrollment, will investigate barriers to saving and aim to build a national consensus on a new strategy. Without action, people retiring in 2050 are projected to be about 8% worse off annually. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>WNBA players are publicly demanding higher pay, highlighting the disparity between their compensation and the league's growing financial success. Players argue they receive less than 10% of league revenue, a tiny figure for a professional sports organization, while the WNBA's broadcast rights and team valuations are soaring. The debate comes as the league and players' union failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. While the league has historically reported financial losses, critics point to opaque accounting practices and argue that rising attendance, viewership, and revenue justify a larger share for the athletes driving the sport's popularity.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills aimed at strengthening federal oversight of the cosmetics industry. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous chemicals like formaldehyde and phthalates from personal care products, which have been linked to cancer and reproductive harm. The bills also propose greater transparency in ingredient labeling and would provide funding for research into safer alternatives, particularly for products marketed to women of color and salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed. This legislative push addresses gaps left by previous regulations and aims to align U.S. standards more closely with stricter rules in the European Union.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the notorious leader of the "Los Choneros" drug gang known as "Fito," to the United States. Fito, who was recaptured in June after a prison escape, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His gang is accused of using hitmen, bribes, and military-grade weapons smuggled from the U.S. to control trafficking routes and violently target officials and civilians. The extradition marks a significant step in the bilateral effort to combat the powerful criminal organizations that have plunged Ecuador into unprecedented levels of violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China and Singapore has developed an innovative nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal tests. The bioinspired approach targets cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and spread, by using a specialized delivery system. The vaccine works by presenting antigens from these stem cells to the immune system, training it to recognize and eliminate them. This method holds significant potential for developing personalized cancer vaccines that could prevent tumors from returning after initial treatment, addressing a major challenge in oncology.</p>

          <h2>Venture Capitalists Rely on 'Power Law' to Identify High-Return Startups</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 03:48:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often use a principle known as the "power law" to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive, outlier returns. This strategy acknowledges that most startups in a portfolio may fail or yield modest results, but one or two huge successes can generate the vast majority of the fund's profits. According to investor Peter Specht, this means VCs seek founders who can pitch a compelling vision for why their company can become a category-defining entity like Spotify or Klarna. Founders are advised to demonstrate "outsized-outcome potential" and visionary storytelling to attract investment. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, as American companies rushed to secure supplies following a preliminary trade deal. Beijing had previously placed export restrictions on these critical components, which are essential for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other advanced technologies. The recent easing of these controls, part of a broader trade framework, highlights U.S. reliance on China, which dominates an estimated 90% of the global market for rare-earth magnet production. The situation has prompted efforts to develop alternative U.S. supply chains, though experts say this could take years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will hold a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The clash, which took place on June 18, 1984, involved thousands of police officers and striking miners outside a coking plant in Rotherham. The inquiry will examine the events of the day and their aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners and allegations of falsified police evidence. Campaigners, who have sought an inquiry for over a decade, welcomed the announcement as a long-awaited step toward truth and justice.</p>
