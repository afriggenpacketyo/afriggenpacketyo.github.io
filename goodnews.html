          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 12:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two significant European clinical trials suggest that a specific cannabis oil, incorporating THC and CBD, provides superior relief for low back pain compared to both a placebo and traditional opioids. These studies, published in Nature Medicine, also noted fewer gastrointestinal side effects with cannabis. Experts consider these results groundbreaking, underscoring cannabis's potential as a safer alternative in pain management, particularly given concerns around opioid addiction and overdose. While the German manufacturer, Vertanical, anticipates European market approval soon, the article highlights that US FDA approval could be years away due to cannabis's Schedule 1 status, frustrating patient advocates.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) experienced a widespread outage originating from its US-East-1 region, impacting numerous major websites and critical internal Amazon systems. The core issue was identified as a Domain Name System (DNS) problem affecting DynamoDB, a foundational database service, which prevented services from locating their data. While AWS reported significant recovery after mitigating the DNS fault and continued to investigate its EC2 internal network, the incident underscored the internet's profound dependency on a limited number of major cloud infrastructure providers. This disruption, affecting platforms from social media to banking and government services, serves as a potent reminder of the fragility of centralized digital infrastructure.</p>

He expressed strong optimism for Boeing, whose shares climbed after official approval to raise 737 MAX production to 42 per month, anticipating improved free cash flow. Cramer also enthusiastically recommended Starbucks, forecasting a "very good year" in 2026 due to turnaround efforts and a higher-than-expected valuation of its China business. The article also covered Cramer's top takeaways from recent CEO meetings on AI and economic trends, reinforcing a generally bullish stance on select equities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cleveland-Cliffs' stock rallied significantly after its CEO, Lourenco Goncalves, revealed plans to expand into rare earth mineral mining, identifying potential sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This strategic move is intended to bolster the US national strategy for critical material independence, reducing reliance on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain for these essential minerals. Rare earths are vital for key industries, including defense, electric vehicles, and batteries, making their domestic supply a critical geopolitical and economic concern. The article notes that this development follows the Trump administration's efforts to invest in US mining companies to counter China's export controls, signaling a long-term shift in supply chain dynamics.

          <p>China's Communist Party is charting a new five-year economic plan, balancing efforts to stimulate domestic consumption with a strong focus on developing high-tech industries. The article highlights that while consumer spending has been neglected, Beijing prioritizes industrial policy to achieve technological resilience, particularly in semiconductors, amidst geopolitical competition with the US. This emphasis on hard power and manufacturing means fewer resources are allocated to boosting household disposable income, despite calls from some Chinese think tanks to significantly increase consumption's share of GDP. The government has introduced some consumer subsidies and social security improvements, but major shifts are costly and secondary to national tech sovereignty. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Rangers Football Club has concluded its extensive search for a new head coach by appointing Danny Rohl, previously manager of Sheffield Wednesday, to a two-and-a-half-year deal.

The article notes his success in helping Sheffield Wednesday avoid relegation twice, a key factor in his selection. Rangers chairman Andrew Cavenagh believes Rohl's elite-level experience and vision will restore pride and success to the team, which currently sits sixth in the Scottish Premiership.</p>

          <p>Japan has made a landmark decision by approving the first over-the-counter sales of an emergency contraceptive pill, Norlevo, which its manufacturer, ASKA Pharmaceutical, states will "empower Japanese women in the area of reproductive health." Although a specific sale date has not yet been announced, the pill will be designated as "medicine requiring guidance," meaning it must be dispensed in the presence of a pharmacist. This approval brings Japan in line with over 90 other nations where the "morning-after" pill is accessible without a prescription. The article highlights that this development is a victory for rights groups who have long campaigned against prescription requirements, arguing they created barriers for younger women and victims of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>An executive coach and human behavior professor outlines five practical strategies for employees to effectively navigate working with a "control freak" boss, aiming to conserve energy and foster a more productive environment. The advice includes presenting rough drafts early to solicit input, strategically using phrases that reinforce the boss's ultimate authority, and proactively oversharing weekly updates to satisfy their desire for oversight. Additionally, the article recommends anticipating criticism by asking for initial thoughts on plans and employing the "yes, and…" technique to acknowledge feedback while subtly asserting one's own perspectives. Finally, employees are encouraged to directly request positive reinforcement to ensure a balanced performance discussion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) typically experience a faster rate of depreciation compared to traditional gasoline-powered cars, with some models losing as much as 13% more value over a five-year period, according to iSeeCars data. This accelerated depreciation is primarily linked to past heavy incentives that reduce resale values and the rapid evolution of EV technology, especially regarding battery range, which quickly renders older models less competitive. The article highlights that the EV market's relatively small share also contributes to limited marketability for used vehicles. However, an anticipated surge in the availability of more affordable used EVs, including new models from major manufacturers like Ford and Chevy, is expected to transform market dynamics and potentially stabilize depreciation rates, broadening their appeal to a wider consumer base.
