        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a widely used muscle-boosting supplement, is increasingly being explored for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in alleviating "brain fog" and enhancing short-term memory and focus. Historically popular among athletes, growing evidence suggests creatine may help the brain increase its energy stores, similar to its impact on muscle performance. The article highlights individuals like Katie Mansell, who attributes an improvement in her perimenopausal brain fog to creatine, alongside other treatments. Experts note that while more research is necessary, especially concerning female biology, creatine may offer benefits for those experiencing stress or dietary deficiencies, though it is not a "wonder drug" and potential side effects warrant caution.</p>

          <p>The UK Labour government, under Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, has announced its recognition of a Palestinian state, marking a significant shift in British foreign policy. This decision, timed with the UN General Assembly, comes amidst intense pressure from Labour MPs and international partners due to the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza. While conditioned on Israel agreeing to a ceasefire and a long-term two-state solution, the move has drawn criticism as "political posturing" and has been condemned by Israel as rewarding Hamas's actions. This article highlights the complex interplay of domestic political pressures, international diplomacy, and the ongoing conflict in Gaza that shaped this momentous decision.</p>
