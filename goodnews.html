          <p>Emma Hayes, the head coach of the United States women's national soccer team, has been inducted into the National Football Museum's Hall of Fame. The former Chelsea manager described her transition to international football as thoroughly enjoyable, comparing it to being a grandparent who sees players for short periods before they return to their clubs. Hayes, who led the U.S. to an Olympic gold medal just months after taking the role, feels the position allows her to focus more on long-term strategy. She expressed that she was ready for a change from the relentless pace of club football.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The world transfer record in women's football has been broken five times in 2025, highlighting the sport's rapid financial growth, primarily driven by leagues in England and the USA. While escalating fees indicate a healthier ecosystem with more investment, experts warn it is widening the gap between elite clubs and the rest of the world. Leagues like Germany's Bundesliga are struggling to compete financially, with broadcasting and sponsorship deals lagging significantly behind their English and American counterparts. This financial disparity risks creating a permanent elite tier, leaving many clubs and leagues unable to afford top talent.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed on Wednesday, showing a relatively muted response to the U.S. government shutdown as investors digested various regional economic data. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 fell, marking its fourth consecutive day of losses, after the Bank of Japan's Tankan survey showed slightly lower-than-expected business optimism among large manufacturers. Meanwhile, India's Nifty 50 and Sensex indices rose after the Reserve Bank of India held its interest rates steady. Markets in mainland China and Hong Kong were closed for a public holiday, while gold prices reached a new record high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New Zealand all-rounder Melie Kerr expresses confidence in her team's ability to compete at the highest level for the next decade, heading into the 50-over World Cup. The White Ferns are entering the tournament as the reigning T20 World Cup champions, a surprise victory that broke a long trophy drought. Despite their recent T20 success, New Zealand is not considered a favorite for the ODI World Cup, a status Kerr says the team can use to its advantage. The team's coach, Ben Sawyer, acknowledges that Australia, India, and England are top contenders but believes New Zealand can defeat any team on their day.</p>

          <p>India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India, has decided to keep its key policy rate unchanged at 5.5%, aligning with economists' expectations. The bank is assessing the impact of previous rate cuts while acknowledging that inflation has moderated in the first quarter. Governor Sanjay Malhotra noted that global trade uncertainties could slow growth in the latter half of the fiscal year. The RBI projects the economy will grow by 6.8% in fiscal year 2026, though it has slightly lowered its estimates for the third quarter and beyond due to trade-related challenges.

          <p>Starting Wednesday, retailers in England are banned from offering multibuy promotions, such as "buy one, get one free," on food and drink products classified as unhealthy. The new restrictions, which apply to supermarkets and other large stores, are part of a government effort to combat rising obesity rates, particularly among children. The measure had been delayed due to the cost-of-living crisis, but ministers and public health officials argue it is a crucial step. Critics of the promotions say they do not save consumers money and instead encourage impulsive and excessive purchasing of junk food.</p>

          <p>China has achieved a significant milestone in its offshore energy infrastructure, with its network of subsea pipelines now extending over 10,000 kilometers (6,213 miles). This was accomplished with the final installation of a deep-sea pipeline in Bohai Bay, one of the country's largest offshore oil production bases. The expanding network is a key part of China's strategy to enhance its energy security by exploring more offshore resources. Officials plan to extend the network to over 13,000 kilometers by 2030, with new pipelines designed to transport greener fuels like hydrogen in the future.</p>

          <p>In his first year as NATO's Secretary General, Mark Rutte has focused on navigating the alliance's precarious relationship with the United States under a re-elected Donald Trump. Foreign policy experts largely view his performance positively, crediting him with keeping the U.S. committed to the alliance and persuading members to increase defense spending. Rutte's diplomatic approach, sometimes criticized as overly flattering to Trump, is seen as a necessary strategy to buy time for European allies to bolster their own security. However, he now faces new challenges, including managing NATO's response to direct threats like Russian drone incursions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As of today, every general practitioner (GP) practice in England must provide patients with the ability to book appointments online throughout the entire workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. This government-mandated change aims to eliminate the frantic "8am scramble" for appointments over the phone and give patients more convenience. In addition to booking non-urgent slots, patients can use the online systems to describe symptoms and request callbacks. While many practices already offered this service, the new rule makes it a universal requirement, intended to free up phone lines for more urgent cases.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a dominant 10-5 victory over the Cincinnati Reds in the first game of their wild-card series, showcasing a powerful offense that tied a club postseason record with five home runs. Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández each hit two homers, and starter Blake Snell delivered a strong performance with nine strikeouts over seven innings. However, the team's persistent bullpen issues were on display when three relievers struggled in the eighth inning, allowing three runs and turning a comfortable lead into a tense situation. Despite the late-game disorder, the Dodgers are now one win away from advancing.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 00:28:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing to pursue skilled trades like electricians and plumbers over traditional four-year college degrees. This shift is driven by concerns over high student loan debt and the increasing threat of artificial intelligence automating white-collar, entry-level jobs. A recent survey found that over half of Gen Z is worried about college debt, and 77% want a career that is difficult to automate. As a result, professions in the trades are losing their stigma and are increasingly seen as a secure and financially viable career path, offering opportunities for entrepreneurship and independence.</p>
