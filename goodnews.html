        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously voted to restrict commercial tour buses from entering the Pacific Palisades fire zone and any future disaster areas. The move comes after reports of "disaster tourism," where tour operators were found profiting from showing visitors the devastation caused by the January firestorm that killed 12 people and destroyed over 6,000 structures. Officials condemned the practice as exploitative and dangerous, as it could interfere with ongoing debris-clearing operations. The ban will remain in effect for the duration of the emergency response.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his massive tax and spending bill during a rally in Iowa, calling it a "phenomenal victory" and the "best birthday present for America." He touted the bill as containing the largest tax and spending cuts in U.S. history and praised its border security investments. During the rally, Trump also previewed plans for next year's "America 250" celebration, announcing events like a UFC fight on the White House lawn and a National Garden of American Heroes. He emphasized that the bill passed without any Democratic support.</p>

          <p>A previously lost, handwritten letter by Thomas Jefferson from 1783 has been discovered and is being offered for sale. In the letter, written to Virginia's governor shortly after the Revolutionary War, Jefferson discusses the right of citizens to bear arms in a revolutionary cause, referencing an uprising in the Dutch states. He notes that the momentum in Europe is shifting towards democracy and away from royalty. The document, valued at around $90,000, offers a rare glimpse into Jefferson's thoughts on democratic movements and citizen armament during a pivotal moment in American history.</p>

          <p>In the early 1990s, the Walt Disney Company planned an ambitious and controversial theme park called "Disney's America," intended to explore U.S. history, including its most painful aspects. The project, championed by then-CEO Michael Eisner, proposed attractions that would simulate experiences like being a Civil War soldier or a slave escaping via the Underground Railroad. This concept ignited a fierce culture war, drawing opposition from historians concerned about the "Disneyfication" of history and the park's proximity to the Manassas battlefield. After intense public backlash and congressional hearings, Disney ultimately abandoned the project in 1994.</p>

          <p>A North Korean man has successfully crossed the heavily militarized land border into South Korea and is now in custody. The civilian managed to traverse the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), one of the world's most heavily mined areas. South Korea's military detected the man and conducted a 20-hour surveillance and guidance operation to safely secure him, navigating dense vegetation and landmine risks. This type of defection is relatively rare, as most North Koreans escape through China, and the man will now be investigated by relevant authorities.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the Club World Cup's group stage and last-16 reveals mixed results for the tournament. While official attendance averaged a solid 35,000 per game, this only utilized 51% of the large stadiums' capacities, with weekday and evening games struggling the most. Oppressive heat was a major factor, with an average heat index of 85°F and some games played in "very uncomfortable" or "oppressive" conditions. On the field, data supports the perception of strong performances from South American teams, who earned a win or draw in 77% of their matches against other confederations.</p>

          <p>A major archaeological discovery in China's Yunnan province has unearthed dozens of wooden artifacts dating back 300,000 years, providing the first strong evidence of a sophisticated 'Wood Age' in East Asia. The study, published in the journal Science, details the findings from the Gantangqing site, which challenge previous assumptions about early hominid tool use in the region. Because wood decomposes easily, direct evidence of such tools has been scarce. This world-class discovery fills a significant gap in understanding the technological capabilities of ancient human relatives in the Palaeolithic era.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which created a bright orange glow and a loud bang, was observed by dozens of people in the Scottish Highlands and captured on security cameras. UKMON calculated that the space rock, originating from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, traveled through the atmosphere before pieces likely scattered over a wide area. Hillwalkers are being asked to look out for the meteorites, though finding them will be challenging.</p>

The new deal reportedly increases his release clause by 50%, making a future transfer significantly more expensive. Williams, a product of Bilbao's youth academy, stated that his heart was the biggest factor in his decision to remain at his hometown club.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to hydration multiplier products, but experts advise caution. While these supplements can be useful for replenishing electrolytes lost during strenuous exercise, plain water remains the gold standard for hydration and should not be replaced. Doctors recommend checking product labels for high levels of sugar and caffeine, which can be counterproductive. Individuals with chronic conditions such as kidney disease or high blood pressure should consult their physician before using these products, as they can significantly alter electrolyte and fluid balance in the body.</p>

          <p>A historical feature contrasts two of Southern California's bygone seaside amusement parks: the long-lasting but seedy Pike in Long Beach and the short-lived but beloved Pacific Ocean Park (POP) in Santa Monica. The Pike, which operated from 1902 to 1979, was known for its rowdy atmosphere, catering to sailors and hosting notorious sideshows. In contrast, POP, which opened in 1958, was a futuristic, family-friendly park that succumbed to competition from Disneyland and high maintenance costs within a decade. The article explores the different factors that contributed to the divergent fates of these two coastal entertainment landmarks.</p>
