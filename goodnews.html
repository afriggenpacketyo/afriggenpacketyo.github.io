          <p>The Federal Reserve has decided to keep its benchmark interest rate unchanged, maintaining the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision came despite significant pressure from President Trump to implement cuts and revealed a rare division within the committee, with two governors dissenting in favor of easing rates. The Fed's statement noted a moderation in economic growth and continued uncertainty, signaling a cautious approach while markets anticipate a potential rate cut in September.

          <p>The beverage company High Noon is recalling two lots of its vodka seltzer variety packs because some cans were incorrectly packaged as non-alcoholic Celsius energy drinks. This mislabeling poses a risk of unintended alcohol consumption, particularly as the affected cans look like the "Sparkling Blue Razz Edition" of Celsius. The recall affects products shipped to eight states, and consumers are advised to dispose of the cans and contact High Noon for a refund. No illnesses have been reported.</p>

          <p>Legislation aimed at prohibiting members of Congress and their spouses from owning or trading individual stocks has advanced out of a Senate committee with bipartisan support. Republican Senator Josh Hawley joined all committee Democrats in an 8-7 vote to move the bill forward, which is informally named the PELOSI Act. The measure faces an uncertain future for a full Senate vote but reflects growing public pressure for stricter ethics rules for lawmakers, though some Republicans on the panel defended the use of blind trusts.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields rose after the Federal Reserve announced it would hold interest rates steady and a new report showed stronger-than-expected economic growth. The 10-year Treasury yield increased by about two basis points to 4.35%, as investors reacted to the combination of stable policy and robust economic data. The second-quarter GDP grew at a 3% annualized rate, surpassing estimates and reinforcing the Fed's decision to maintain its current stance despite some internal dissent favoring a rate cut.

          <p>As Americans struggle with record-high credit card balances, credit card debt forgiveness programs offer a potential solution for some, potentially reducing debt by 30% to 50%. This article explains that those most likely to qualify are borrowers experiencing verifiable financial hardship, such as job loss or major medical expenses, and those with significant unsecured debt, often $10,000 or more. Borrowers who have already fallen behind on payments may also have more leverage, as creditors prefer recovering a partial amount over a total loss from bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent underwater expedition has revealed extensive communities of tubeworms and mollusks flourishing at depths over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean's deep-sea trenches. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the limits of life, as these creatures exist in an environment of extreme pressure and no sunlight. Scientists theorize these organisms survive not on nutrients trickling down, but by capitalizing on chemical energy produced by microbes from carbon accumulated in the trench floor, suggesting such ecosystems may be more widespread than previously thought.</p>

          <p>This article examines the role of annuities for retirees who already have a steady income from Social Security. While both provide regular payments, an annuity can offer an additional, diversified income stream, acting as a hedge against outliving one's savings, especially for those with long life expectancies or low risk tolerance. However, annuities require a significant upfront investment, which reduces liquidity, and can come with complex fees and terms, making them unsuitable for everyone. The decision depends on individual financial goals. (not investment advice)</p>
