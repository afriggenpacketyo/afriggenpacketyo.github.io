          <p>Tattoos have become increasingly prevalent in American culture, with a third of adults now having at least one, reflecting a broader societal shift towards individuality and self-expression. While the art form is gaining recognition, with exhibits now featuring tattoo artists, some societal stigma remains, as studies show that people with tattoos may still face negative assumptions in professional settings. Despite this, tattoos are most popular among millennials, and their prevalence is similar across different political affiliations.</p>

          <p>A Georgia school district is observing positive outcomes from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day at institutions like Lakeside High School. Teachers report that the policy has created a better learning environment by reducing distractions and increasing student engagement, leading to a significant decrease in disciplinary issues. This local initiative is stricter than a new statewide law in Georgia, reflecting a growing national trend of regulating phone use in schools.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have committed to providing post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, which could include an international force on land, sea, and air. The announcement came after a Paris summit aimed at securing U.S. support for Kyiv's long-term security. Macron stated the force would not be on the frontline but would serve to "prevent any new major aggression," a move Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed as a serious, concrete step forward.</p>

          <p>The parents of Chloe Childress, an 18-year-old counselor who died in a devastating flash flood at Camp Mystic in Texas, have successfully championed new state safety laws for campgrounds. The legislation, prompted by the deaths of more than two dozen campers and staff, will prohibit cabins in flood zones, mandate warning systems, and require emergency training. The Childress family hopes these new regulations will prevent similar preventable tragedies and serve as a model for other states.</p>

          <p>A spokeswoman for former President Joe Biden has confirmed that he recently underwent Mohs surgery, a procedure used to treat skin cancer. The confirmation came after Biden was seen with a wound on his head in recent photographs. This is not his first encounter with the disease; in 2023, he had a cancerous basal cell carcinoma lesion successfully removed from his chest. Mohs surgery is a precise technique that removes skin layer by layer to ensure all cancerous tissue is excised.</p>

          <p>A previously unknown final project by David Bowie, an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered in his personal archives, which are being donated to the V&A Museum. Notes found in his locked New York study reveal his fascination with the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 18th-century London. The materials, which were left undisturbed until after his death in 2016, offer a new glimpse into the artist's creative ambitions in his final months.</p>

This generation, many of whom began their careers remotely during the pandemic, is bringing a different set of values and expectations to the workplace. Their approach includes more casual dress, intentional networking to compensate for fewer senior colleagues being present, and blurring the lines between professional and personal interactions.</p>

Proponents argue it is a critical health and safety issue, while landlord associations express concern over the potential costs for building upgrades and higher utility bills.</p>
