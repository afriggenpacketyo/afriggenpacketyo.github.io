          <p>Progressive groups across the U.S. are planning over 1,500 "No Kings Day" events to protest the Trump administration and counter the military parade in Washington, D.C., which marks the U.S. Army‚Äôs 250th birthday. Indivisible, a major organizing group, stated that the parade is a "made-for-TV display of dominance" for Trump's birthday, which also falls on June 14. The group has also criticized the White House for overreach against courts and actions that have hurt civil rights. The protests aim to convey that the country doesn't belong to a king and to oppose the use of taxpayer dollars for the parade, emphasizing the importance of democracy and the power of the people.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts caution that dirty hummingbird feeders can harm or kill the birds they are intended to help. Sugar water left out too long can spoil, attracting harmful microbes that cause infections, such as candida, which can swell a hummingbird's tongue and lead to starvation. Regular cleaning of feeders is crucial, requiring a change of nectar every one to three days, and thorough scrubbing with vinegar and water if mold is present. Planting native hummingbird-friendly wildflowers is also recommended as a healthy alternative to feeders.</p>
