          <p>President Trump plans to host a White House event to rally Republican support for his "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a major tax and spending package. The push comes despite a significant setback in the Senate, where the parliamentarian rejected key Medicaid provisions intended to cut costs. The White House remains insistent that it expects Congress to resolve any issues and pass the legislation for the president to sign by the July Fourth holiday.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt affirmed that the administration remains in communication with Iranian intermediaries, with the goal of securing a non-enrichment civil nuclear program. The administration is reportedly considering various incentives, including sanctions relief and financial assistance from allies, to bring Iran back to the negotiating table.</p>

          <p>The British government is reportedly set to announce a significant compromise on its proposed welfare reforms after facing a major rebellion from over 100 of its own backbench MPs. The expected deal with Labour rebels would protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) from cuts.

This suggests a potential softening of the administration's hardline stance, providing more time for trade negotiations. White House officials stated that if deals are not reached, the president could unilaterally impose a "reciprocal tariff rate" he deems advantageous, providing some relief to markets concerned about an escalating trade war.
