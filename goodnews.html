          <p>A contestant on "Wheel of Fortune" has made show history by winning a total of $1,035,155, the largest prize ever awarded on the program. Christina Derevjanik from Stamford, Connecticut, reached the bonus round and correctly solved the puzzle "PACK OF COYOTES," revealing the million-dollar prize envelope. This marks the fourth million-dollar win in the show's history but the first since Ryan Seacrest took over as host. Seacrest, who had previously expressed a goal of giving away a million dollars in 2025, celebrated the record-breaking moment on the show.</p>

          <p>A 20-story residential building in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx experienced a partial collapse following an explosion in its boiler room. The blast tore away an entire corner of the New York City Housing Authority building, sending a cascade of debris onto the street below. Despite the extensive structural damage, Mayor Eric Adams confirmed that there were miraculously no reported injuries or fatalities. Firefighters and emergency crews conducted thorough searches of the rubble to ensure no one was trapped, while officials began evacuating affected apartments and inspecting the building's structural integrity.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook can remain in her role while her lawsuit against President Trump's attempt to fire her proceeds. The court deferred the administration's request to remove her, scheduling oral arguments for January 2026. President Trump has sought to oust Cook, citing allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies and for which she has not been charged. The case is considered a significant test of the Federal Reserve's traditional independence from political interference, as the removal attempt followed months of pressure from the president to cut interest rates.</p>

          <p>Australia launched its ICC Women's Cricket World Cup title defense with an 89-run victory against New Zealand in Indore. All-rounder Ash Gardner was instrumental in the win, scoring a powerful 115 runs from just 83 balls to help Australia recover from a precarious position and post a total of 326. New Zealand captain Sophie Devine mounted a strong challenge with a century of her own, but her dismissal triggered a late-game collapse. Australian bowler Annabel Sutherland took three key wickets in a single over, quickly ending New Zealand's chances and securing the win for the defending champions.</p>

          <p>German prosecutors have announced the arrest of three men suspected of being Hamas operatives who were allegedly preparing attacks on Israeli and Jewish institutions within Germany. The suspects, two German nationals and one Lebanese national, were reportedly involved in acquiring firearms and ammunition for planned acts of violence. Authorities intercepted the men during a weapons exchange meeting in Berlin, where they discovered functional firearms, including an AK-47 and several pistols. The arrests followed an anti-terrorism investigation, and searches were conducted in Leipzig and Oberhausen in connection with the operation.</p>

          <p>Global Infrastructure Partners (GIP), the infrastructure fund manager owned by BlackRock, is reportedly in advanced talks to acquire renewable power company AES for approximately $38 billion. This potential deal would be one of the largest infrastructure takeovers in history and would position BlackRock to capitalize on the surging energy demand driven by the artificial intelligence boom. AES operates power plants globally and supplies energy to major tech companies building power-intensive data centers. The acquisition would significantly expand BlackRock's presence in the high-growth infrastructure sector, a key strategic focus for the asset management giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an 8% increase in U.S. auto sales for the third quarter, largely driven by record-breaking sales of electric vehicles. Consumers appeared to rush to purchase EVs before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive at the end of September. GM's EV sales more than doubled compared to the previous year, while Ford's increased by 30%, helping GM maintain its position as the top U.S. automaker by sales. Industry analysts expect overall EV sales to hit a record for the quarter, though some automakers anticipate a temporary slowdown now that the federal credits have ended. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has launched a new private-label grocery brand named "Amazon Grocery," aimed at price-conscious consumers with most of its products priced under $5.

The move is designed to help customers stretch their grocery budgets during a period of heightened price sensitivity. This expansion of its private-label lineup comes as Amazon continues to adjust its broader grocery strategy, which includes streamlining its physical stores while expanding same-day delivery services.</p>

          <p>Internet and communication services have been restored across Afghanistan following a 48-hour nationwide blackout ordered by the Taliban government.

The blackout was particularly concerning for women and girls, who rely on the internet for education and connection since being barred from schools. While the Taliban has not given an official reason, citizens expressed relief and joy as connectivity returned, allowing them to reconnect with relatives and resume daily activities.</p>

          <p>President Trump's threat to impose tariffs on pharmaceuticals has been significantly softened following a new drug pricing agreement with Pfizer. The deal includes a voluntary commitment from Pfizer to lower U.S. drug prices and invest $70 billion in domestic manufacturing in exchange for a three-year exemption from any pharma-specific tariffs. This agreement sets a precedent for other major drugmakers, many of whom are now expected to seek similar pacts, thereby avoiding the threatened levies. The move provides clarity and relief to the pharmaceutical industry, shifting the administration's focus from punitive tariffs to negotiated pricing deals.</p>

The BLS is responsible for producing key economic data, including monthly jobs and inflation reports. The nomination was made after the president abruptly fired the previous commissioner over a jobs report he claimed was manipulated, a charge that was unsubstantiated.</p>

The move aligns with a broader industry trend and increased federal scrutiny of food additives.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the cost of borrowing through a home equity loan has become slightly more affordable for homeowners. A $30,000 home equity loan with a 10-year repayment term would now have an approximate monthly payment of $369, while a 15-year term would cost around $290 per month. These payments are marginally lower than they were earlier in the year, reflecting the modest drop in interest rates. The article advises homeowners to compare these fixed-rate loan costs with variable-rate options like a home equity line of credit (HELOC) to determine the most suitable financial product.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve has contributed to a drop in mortgage rates, making homeownership more affordable for borrowers. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest point in three years. For a $600,000 mortgage, this translates to a monthly principal and interest payment of approximately $3,648, which is about $360 less per month than it would have been at the start of 2025. This reduction in borrowing costs provides significant potential savings for new homebuyers and current homeowners who may be considering refinancing their existing higher-rate mortgages.
