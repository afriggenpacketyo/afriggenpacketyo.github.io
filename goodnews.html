          <h2>UK Government to Legally Extend Bereavement Leave for Early-Stage Miscarriages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:30:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to grant parents who experience a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy the legal right to bereavement leave. Currently, this right is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change aims to give people necessary time to grieve without resorting to sick leave. The exact length of the leave and eligibility details will be determined following a public consultation, a move praised by advocates as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 06:00:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Sheffield in the UK have developed tiny robots, called "Pipebots," designed to navigate inside water mains to find and fix leaks without disruptive excavation. These small robots use cameras and acoustic sensors to identify cracks in aging infrastructure, a significant issue in the UK where old pipes waste millions of gallons of water daily. The initiative is part of a larger effort, supported by the UK's water regulator, to modernize infrastructure management. The technology aims to make maintenance more efficient and affordable, reducing the need for costly and inconvenient roadwork.</p>

          <p>A small but dedicated community of professional remote control (RC) car racers competes in events like the Dirt Nitro Challenge, earning a living through sponsorships and prize money. Unlike hobbyists, these elite drivers travel the country with pit crews, racing high-speed, gas-powered buggies that can exceed 60 mph. The article profiles several pro racers, including Ryan Cavalieri and Adam Drake, who have built careers in the sport since they were teenagers. It explores the skill, engineering, and financial dynamics of this niche sport, where top competitors can earn six-figure incomes and dedicate their lives to perfecting their miniature racing machines.</p>

          <p>Representative Robert Garcia, a formerly undocumented immigrant from Peru, has quickly risen in Democratic leadership, recently becoming the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee. The article portrays him as a key figure pushing back against the Trump administration's policies, particularly its aggressive immigration enforcement and alleged self-enrichment. Garcia emphasizes his commitment to accountability, vowing to investigate figures like Stephen Miller and Elon Musk if Democrats regain a majority. His story is framed as an embodiment of the American dream and a symbol of a new generation of Democratic leaders who are unafraid to confront the administration directly.</p>

          <p>UCLA and UC Berkeley are publicly sparring over which campus is the number one public university in the nation, using social media to stake their claims. The rivalry ignited after U.S. News & World Report released its global rankings, placing Berkeley as the top public institution, prompting celebratory posts from the campus. UCLA quickly countered by highlighting its own number one spot on a separate U.S. News national ranking for public universities, a title it has held for several years. The playful but competitive banter reflects the long-standing rivalry between the two top-tier California schools and highlights the differing methodologies of various college ranking systems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Charlotte Runcie's debut novel, "Bring the House Down," offers a satirical look at the arts criticism world through the story of a harsh theater critic, Alex Lyons, whose life unravels at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. After giving a one-star review to a show, he sleeps with its creator, who then transforms her performance into a public takedown of him. The story is narrated by his junior colleague, Sophie, who becomes entangled in the drama. The review praises the novel as a delightfully snackable read but notes that the charisma of the main characters is sometimes told rather than shown, leaving some deeper questions about criticism unexplored.</p>

          <p>Comedian Nate Jackson, known for his viral crowd-work clips on TikTok, has released his debut Netflix special, "Nate Jackson: Super Funny." In an interview, he discusses how he honed his improvisational and roasting skills, from hosting a weekly show in Tacoma to his time on MTV's "Wild 'N Out." Jackson explains that while crowd work is a major part of his act, it's a structured and layered process designed to connect with the audience, not just simple roasting. He views his interactive style as an evolution of stand-up, making each show a unique experience and turning audience members into stars of the show.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses the dilemma of choosing between a contemplative life of inactivity and an active life dedicated to doing good in the world. Using the example of Buddhist monk Matthieu Ricard, the column argues that the two goals are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Contemplative practice can enhance one's ability to act altruistically, while engagement with the world's suffering can deepen spiritual growth. The writer suggests pursuing a career of service while intentionally scheduling periods for deep contemplation, such as retreats, to avoid the potential regret of not putting compassion into concrete action.</p>

          <p>President Trump is scheduled to meet with the presidents of Gabon, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mauritania, and Senegal, signaling a shift in focus towards Africa's commercial opportunities and strategic importance. While the administration has cut foreign aid, it now emphasizes trade, investment in critical minerals, and security cooperation, particularly concerning migration and drug routes. Analysts note that while these five nations are not major economic partners, they are strategically located and possess significant natural resources. The meeting is seen by some as a diplomatic opportunity for the African leaders, despite facing internal governance and rule-of-law challenges at home.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to its large homeless population and related substance use issues, Los Angeles County is embracing harm reduction principles, a contrast to the tougher, more punitive approaches being adopted elsewhere. A new Skid Row Care Campus offers services like clean syringes, drug testing strips, and naloxone, alongside traditional addiction treatment and housing support. This approach aims to prevent overdose deaths and the spread of disease by meeting individuals where they are, without requiring immediate sobriety. While proponents say it saves lives and builds trust, the strategy is controversial and stands in opposition to the federal administration's focus on forced treatment.</p>

          <p>A significant national effort, backed by billions in federal funding, is underway to find and plug potentially millions of abandoned "orphan" oil and gas wells across the United States. These unplugged wells, many of which are undocumented, pose environmental risks by leaking methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and other toxins into the air and water. Experts are using historical records, drone technology, and fieldwork to locate these relics of past oil booms. However, the process is complex, as determining responsibility for plugging the wells is often difficult, and the total cost of remediation far exceeds current funding.</p>

          <p>Biosphere 2, the massive glass facility in the Arizona desert once famous for its 1990s self-sustainability experiment, has transformed into a vital scientific playground for climate change research. Now operated by the University of Arizona, scientists use its contained ecosystems—including a rainforest, ocean, and desert—to conduct large-scale experiments. Current projects include testing the heat tolerance of coffee and cacao trees, creating a refuge for endangered pupfish, and developing methods to restore coral reefs. The facility has evolved from a pop-culture punchline into a unique laboratory for understanding and adapting to the environmental challenges facing Earth.</p>

          <p>The debate over whether seed oils like canola and soybean oil are unhealthy has intensified, with critics linking them to inflammation and obesity. However, many nutrition researchers argue these claims are overstated and that the science is being misrepresented. While seed oils are high in omega-6 fatty acids, which can theoretically promote inflammation, human studies have not shown this to be a significant issue and instead link them to better heart health outcomes. Experts suggest the real problem is the overconsumption of ultra-processed foods, where these oils are prevalent, rather than the oils themselves when used in a balanced diet.</p>
