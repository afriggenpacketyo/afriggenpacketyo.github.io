          <p>With one year remaining until the FIFA World Cup 2026, organizers are grappling with numerous logistical challenges, including transportation, security, and visa issues, as the event is set to be hosted across the United States, Mexico, and Canada. The tournament is expected to draw over six million fans and generate a substantial economic impact, but uncertainties surrounding visa processing, especially in light of recent travel bans, are causing concern. Los Angeles, set to host the U.S. team's first match, is working to ensure a positive experience for attendees despite potential disruptions from immigration-related unrest. The FIFA is bearing the financial risks of the tournament, leaving host cities responsible for public services and stadium operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States on imports from China, Beijing has taken measures to help Chinese exporters sell their products domestically, including encouraging the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs). A letter of credit is a financial tool that serves as a guarantee to the seller that the agreed amount of money, services or goods will be paid by the buyer in time. The domestic version has similar functions, helping to ensure payment security and enhance credit, both major concerns for many Chinese firms. While international L/Cs can only be used in transactions involving physical goods, domestic ones can also be used in the trade in services. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>"Mononoke the Movie: The Ashes of Rage" has been officially selected for screening at the Shanghai International Film Festival and the Fantasia International Film Festival. The Shanghai International Film Festival marks the film's debut screening in China, while the Fantasia International Film Festival, held in Montreal, Canada, is particularly noteworthy as the first chapter of the series previously won two awards there. Director Kenji Nakamura states that "Mononoke the Movie" consciously incorporates colors with a global audience in mind, recognizing that color perception varies among different ethnicities, the team has made efforts to create colors that are visually appealing to non-Asian viewers as well, such as increasing color saturation. The film's unique blend of traditional Japanese cultural elements and cutting-edge 3DCG animation has garnered strong support from international audiences.</p>

          <p>The Brit School in Croydon, a renowned arts school, has received government funding to address poor building conditions, including a recent ceiling collapse that forced the closure of a classroom and changing rooms. The funding will be used to replace the majority of the main building's roof and to carry out fire safety works, with construction expected to begin over the summer holidays. The school, known for its famous alumni, houses five buildings dating from 1909 to 2012, some of which regularly face repair challenges. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized that the investment demonstrates a commitment to education and the futures of the children.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to develop its domestic rare earth reserves in response to China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have caused shortages worldwide. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require significant public and private investment in the sector. The move comes after India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's export pause a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative. China currently dominates the rare earth element market, producing roughly 60% of the world's supply and processing almost 90%.</p>

          <p>An expert with the World Gold Council stated that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist and head of research at the association, emphasized that long-term demand for gold remains strong amid concerns over US dollar assets and geopolitical tensions. Reade pointed out that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He expressed his wish that proponents of digital assets would stop marketing them as 'gold 2.0', when they clearly have different characteristics.</p>

The revamped tournament has faced controversy due to concerns about an already congested calendar and sluggish ticket sales, prompting FIFA to slash prices. The tournament represents FIFA's ambitious attempt to introduce a more global club tournament, but it has drawn criticism from players and FIFPRO, the union representing players worldwide, arguing that it contributes to an "oversaturated international football calendar."</p>
