        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has proposed that veterinary practices be required to publish their prices to increase transparency for pet owners. An investigation found that vet prices have risen at nearly twice the rate of inflation, and owners are often not given upfront cost estimates for treatments. The recommendations aim to help consumers shop around for better deals and address concerns that large corporate groups, which charge significantly more on average, are driving up costs. The proposals also include capping prescription fees and revealing practice ownership structures.</p>

          <p>Semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML has sought to reassure investors by stating it does not expect its 2026 net sales to fall below 2025 levels, despite forecasting a "significant" decline in sales to China. The Dutch firm, a key player in the global chip industry, maintained its 15% sales growth forecast for the current year, buoyed by strong demand from the AI sector. However, the company's outlook is tempered by geopolitical tensions and tightening U.S. export restrictions targeting China, which will impact a key market. The announcement caused the company's shares to rise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region posted gains, bucking the downward trend seen on Wall Street, which was affected by a renewed trade dispute between the U.S. and China. The positive performance in Asia came after President Trump criticized China for not purchasing soybeans and threatened further retribution. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and mainland China all saw notable increases. This divergence occurred as investors processed new Chinese economic data and comments from the Federal Reserve suggesting a potential halt to bond holding reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

Fisher stated on social media that he was questioned by border officials who were unhappy he intended to work while visiting on what was reportedly an incorrect type of visa. As a result, his scheduled appearances in Perth and Sydney have been canceled, and he is awaiting deportation from a detention hotel. The Australian Border Force declined to comment on the individual case.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will soon be permitted to generate sexual content, including erotica, for users who are verified as adults. This policy change is part of a principle to "treat adult users like adults" and follows a period where the chatbot's capabilities were made more restrictive to address mental health concerns. The company plans to roll out a new version that is more "human-like" after implementing new tools to mitigate potential harm. The move aims to restore some of the creativity users felt was lost in previous updates.</p>

          <p>Scottish track cyclist Jack Carlin, who has won four Olympic medals for Team GB, has announced his retirement from the sport at the age of 28. The two-time silver and two-time bronze medalist cited a dwindling motivation and inability to "ignite that spark again" following the Paris Olympics. After a period of reflection, Carlin decided he could no longer give the 100% commitment required for elite competition. He expressed contentment with his career achievements and is now looking forward to discovering a new identity beyond being "Jack the cyclist."</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' potent postseason offense has been notably driven by the bottom half of their lineup, which has consistently outperformed the team's top stars. Players batting in the sixth through ninth positions have been instrumental in the team's success, creating pressure and delivering key hits and RBIs. This depth was highlighted in their recent 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers, where hitters like Teoscar Hernández and Kiké Hernández provided the crucial offense. The article suggests this lineup depth is a key factor in their commanding playoff position.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him intact. Jones was ordered to pay the sum to the families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for falsely claiming the tragedy was a hoax. He had argued that he was wrongly found liable without a full trial, but the lower court had issued a default ruling due to his repeated failure to provide evidence. A lawyer for the families stated they will now move forward with enforcing the historic verdict.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scholars Suggest U.S. Trade Pressure Could Strengthen China's National Unity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As trade tensions between the U.S. and China escalate with new sanctions and port fees, some Chinese scholars are suggesting that the external pressure could ultimately foster greater national unity and motivation. According to one senior researcher, it is a national characteristic for China to transform external pressure into a driving force. This perspective suggests that instead of yielding, Beijing may double down on its long-term economic strategy, a sentiment that could set the tone for the upcoming plenum of the Communist Party's Central Committee.
