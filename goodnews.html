          <p>The Japanese government has allocated 388.1 billion yen from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer, aiming to counter the economic impact of U.S. tariffs. Separately, Japan lodged a protest with China over unnotified maritime scientific research within its exclusive economic zone, after a Chinese survey vessel appeared to drop a cable near Okinotori Island. Additionally, the government plans to spread soil from near the Fukushima nuclear plant on government grounds to demonstrate its safety for public works projects. The article also notes Japan has lost its status as the world's top creditor for the first time in 34 years.</p>

Industrial profits among larger firms increased by 3% year-on-year, up from 2.6% in March, with private enterprises showing the highest growth rate. While the April data provided an initial glimpse into the health of China's industrial profits amid trade war escalations, uncertainty remains regarding the trade relationship between China and the US. The growth trend is expected to continue through the first half of the year, but the future is less clear. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Trainer David Hayes expresses optimism about Chateauneuf's chances in the Class Three Seine Handicap at Happy Valley, despite a wide draw. Chateauneuf recently won a race, and Hayes believes the horse's trackwork indicates it has maintained its form. Hayes is hopeful that jockey Luke Ferraris can secure a good position early in the race to overcome the unfavorable draw.

          <p>Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who won the Palme d'Or at Cannes for 'It Was Just Accident,' has returned home to Tehran. Panahi's win sparked a diplomatic row between French and Iranian officials after the French Foreign Minister praised the film as a gesture of resistance. Panahi, who has been imprisoned multiple times in Iran, made his first Cannes appearance in 15 years due to a travel ban. His winning film depicts torture in Iranian jails, and Panahi dedicated the award to the freedom of his country.</p>
