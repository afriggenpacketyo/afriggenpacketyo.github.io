          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 05:01:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ofgem, the UK's energy regulator, has confirmed a price cap fall that will reduce the typical gas and electricity bill by ¬£11 a month starting in July, urging households to explore fixed-rate energy deals for potential annual savings of up to ¬£200. Tim Jarvis of Ofgem acknowledges that while the price drop reflects a fall in wholesale gas prices, energy costs remain high, and many households continue to struggle. Dame Clare Moriarty from Citizens Advice notes the price cap announcement provides little comfort to those burdened by debt, advocating for targeted support and energy efficiency measures. Gillian Roberts from Salford highlights the ongoing struggle to manage energy costs, while Prime Minister Starmer has signaled a partial U-turn on cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Army will implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards emphasizing readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT consists of five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Sgt. Maj. Christopher Mullinax states that the AFT is designed to improve soldier readiness and ensure physical standards, while experts note that the test is challenging but achievable for individuals with a basic fitness foundation. Scoring requirements are more demanding, with combat roles held to the highest standards, and combat standards are sex-neutral for the 21 direct combat roles, a change designed to ensure fairness and operational readiness.</p>

          <p>The article explores some of the more unusual clauses found in NFL player contracts, such as performance escalators, homework clauses, weight clauses, and even an "end of the world" clause. Kyler Murray's contract with the Cardinals initially included a clause mandating four hours of independent film study per week, while Dez Bryant had a "security agreement" with strict rules to curb off-the-field issues. Offensive linemen like Trent Brown and running backs like Eddie Lacy have had weight-related bonuses, and Akili Smith missed out on significant incentives due to poor performance. Rick Mirer's contract even included a clause ensuring payment until "the end of the world."</p>

          <p>General Stephen Whiting, head of US Space Command, has warned that China's expanding arsenal of anti-satellite weapons is forcing Washington to accelerate defenses in orbit. The ambitious defence system known as the Golden Dome is a response to how China had spent the past three decades preparing to target American space infrastructure. Whiting said Beijing‚Äôs strategy included deploying weapons in orbit, developing jamming systems and fielding kinetic anti-satellite missiles ‚Äì all with the explicit aim of blinding and disrupting US military operations during a crisis. Unveiled this week with an initial US$25 billion investment, the Golden Dome is a sweeping plan to build a layered missile defence architecture to protect the US from long-range and hypersonic threats.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Republicans are aiming to punish states that provide health insurance to unauthorized immigrants by slashing federal Medicaid reimbursements. The proposed legislation, titled the "One Big Beautiful Bill," targets 14 states, mainly Democratic-led, that offer such coverage, potentially costing California $3 billion annually. The bill's passage would pose political and economic challenges for affected states, with some having "trigger" laws that could terminate Medicaid expansions if federal funding is reduced. Critics argue the measure is hostile to immigrants, while supporters claim it disincentivizes unauthorized border crossings, though the Affordable Care Act already prohibits the use of federal funds for unauthorized immigrants' healthcare, except for emergencies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen, China's top exporting city, experienced a 2.9% year-on-year decline in exports in April, despite an 8.1% national export growth. This decline is attributed to ongoing trade tensions with the US. Peng Peng of the Guangdong Society of Reform noted the volatility in Shenzhen's export performance, suggesting the city's trade remains susceptible to global tensions. The drop was primarily driven by an 8.3% decrease in general trade, although bonded logistics saw a 15.5% increase. As a city with relatively high dependence on foreign trade, Shenzhen‚Äôs economy is inevitably facing a degree of unpredictability and limited room for policy manoeuvres.</p>

Amnesty International warns that failure to renew the embargo could worsen the human rights situation, citing reports of armed Ugandan soldiers and military equipment deployed in South Sudan. Despite the embargo, violations persist, raising concerns about its effectiveness, while some citizens question the impact of UN peacekeeping efforts. The UN insists it is doing all it can to stop the conflict, with the mandate of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) recently extended for 12 months.</p>
