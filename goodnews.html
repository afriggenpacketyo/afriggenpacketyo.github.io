          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in the movement against Atlanta's police training center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated Marsicano's constitutional right to a speedy trial by intentionally delaying an indictment for over two years. This decision marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including RICO conspiracy indictments. Marsicano's attorney argued the state was using the prolonged legal process as a form of punishment, which has professionally impacted the defendant, a law school graduate awaiting a license.</p>

The seven-time world champion achieved the perfect frame during his Saudi Arabia Masters semi-final match against Chris Wakelin in Jeddah. This marks the 16th maximum break of O'Sullivan's illustrious career, his first in competition since 2018, and reinforces his status as one of the sport's all-time greats.

          <p>Universal Music Group CEO Lucian Grainge has forcefully responded to a lawsuit from the artist Drake, calling it "groundless and indeed ridiculous." Drake is suing the music giant, which is the parent company for both his and Kendrick Lamar's labels, alleging defamation and that UMG intentionally damaged his career by promoting Lamar's hit diss track "Not Like Us." In a court declaration, Grainge stated that the accusation makes no sense given UMG's massive financial investment in Drake's career, including a reported $400 million deal. UMG's legal team further argued that the lawsuit is based on the "absurd" premise of a secret corporate conspiracy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zach Cregger's new horror film, "Weapons," is being praised as a standout movie that successfully balances thrilling catharsis with lingering dread. The plot centers on the mysterious disappearance of a third-grade class and the community's subsequent search for answers, which leads to a supernatural villain. The review highlights the film's daring choice to provide clear answers to its central mystery, culminating in a satisfying but brutal confrontation. However, the article also notes that the movie subverts traditional happy endings by emphasizing that vanquishing the evil does not erase the trauma it caused, leaving the audience with a complex mix of satisfaction and sorrow.</p>

          <p>The health care sector emerged as the week's top performer in the stock market, buoyed by strong performance from companies like Eli Lilly and a newly revealed Berkshire Hathaway stake in UnitedHealth Group. In a counter-trend week where value stocks outperformed momentum-based companies, the technology, consumer staples, and utilities sectors all posted negative returns. The weakness in consumer staples was partly driven by grocery-related stocks reacting to Amazon's expansion of its same-day delivery service. Investors are now looking ahead to the Federal Reserve's Jackson Hole symposium for signals on future interest rate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new film "East of Wall," directed by Kate Beecroft, is reviewed as a worthy modern western that blends documentary and fiction to tell a compelling story of female resilience. The movie centers on a struggling ranch matriarch and her rodeo-star daughter in South Dakota, with the real-life mother and daughter playing versions of themselves. While the review notes that the film's docu-fiction approach is not as seamless as in similar works like "The Rider," it praises the authentic grit and lived-in warmth of the performances. The film is commended for its portrayal of women forging their own path in a harsh environment.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Reveals Trump's Claims About Washington, D.C. Crime Are Misleading</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of President Trump's recent statements about "out of control" crime in Washington, D.C. finds the claims to be misleading. While the city did have a high murder rate in 2023 compared to U.S. states, it was not the highest among major U.S. cities, and more recent 2024 and 2025 data show a significant decrease in both homicides and overall violent crime. The president used the crime statistics to justify a federal takeover of the city's police force, but failed to mention the current downward trend, which is in line with national statistics showing a reduction in crime across the U.S.</p>

          <h2>A Reappraisal of Muriel Spark's Literary Genius and Moral Complexity</h2>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic explores the literary style and thematic depth of Scottish author Muriel Spark, prompted by a new biography. The analysis focuses on her most famous work, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie," examining her use of narrative omniscience and irony to explore the moral education of young women. Spark, a Catholic convert, often imbued her work with theological questions, portraying the influential teacher Jean Brodie as a god-like figure to her students. The article highlights how Spark realistically portrays the lasting impact of a powerful mentor on an impressionable mind, even after the mentee has forged their own path.</p>
