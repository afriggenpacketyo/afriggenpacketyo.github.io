          <p>Jim Cramer explains that rising bond yields influenced Tuesday's market activity as Wall Street awaits a federal budget bill. He notes that stocks tied to fickle consumers and banks are particularly vulnerable to bond market fluctuations. Cramer highlights Home Depot as an example, initially rising after earnings but declining as the session progressed due to concerns that higher bond yields could slow the housing market.
