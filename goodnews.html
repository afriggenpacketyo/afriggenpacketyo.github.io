          <p>Warren Buffett has dismissed media reports claiming that Berkshire Hathaway's BNSF railroad was collaborating with Goldman Sachs on a potential takeover of a rival. The billionaire investor stated that neither he nor his successor, Greg Abel, had been in contact with Goldman Sachs regarding any such deal. Buffett reiterated his long-held skepticism of using external bankers for deal-making, emphasizing his preference for handling such matters internally. The reports had emerged after rival railroad Union Pacific showed interest in acquiring Norfolk Southern. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations, though the company's performance was significantly affected by U.S. auto tariffs. The automaker affirmed its full-year guidance, which includes an estimated $4 billion to $5 billion impact from the levies, with CFO Paul Jacobson noting tariffs cost the company $1.1 billion in Q2 alone. CEO Mary Barra stated that GM is actively working to mitigate these costs through manufacturing adjustments and other initiatives to reduce its exposure to the ongoing trade policies.

          <p>In a decision hailed as a victory by climate activists, Italy's highest court has ruled that a lawsuit against the energy company ENI can move forward. The case was brought by Greenpeace, ReCommon, and a dozen citizens who are seeking damages from ENI and its government shareholders for their alleged role in climate change. The court rejected ENI's motion to dismiss the case on jurisdictional grounds, allowing it to be heard on its merits in a lower tribunal. This ruling aligns Italy with other European nations where climate litigation against corporations is advancing.</p>
