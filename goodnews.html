          <p>Hong Kong is launching a "silver economy" drive to boost consumption among its aging population. Chief Executive John Lee announced a working group that will unveil five measures to cater to the needs of the elderly market, stimulating Hong Kong's economy. The policy areas include bolstering elderly consumption, developing industries that cater to older people, promoting quality assurance in related products, establishing financial safeguards, and unleashing productivity among older individuals. With the elderly expected to comprise over a third of the city's population by 2043, the silver economy represents a consumer market with significant potential.</p>

          <p>The ultra-wealthy are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to rising economic and geopolitical uncertainties. A six-story facility in Singapore, known as "The Reserve," has seen an 88% increase in orders for gold and silver storage from the start of the year to April. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, attracting high-net-worth clients seeking to protect their assets. The shift towards physical gold bars is driven by concerns about counterparty and geopolitical risks, as investors seek more secure ownership of their assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Twenty companies applied to purchase a combined 110,000 tons of government stockpiled rice in Japan, following a revision to provide rice through direct contracts to curb soaring prices. The amount represents over 30% of the 300,000 tons planned for release via direct sales, bypassing earlier auction systems. The average supermarket price of rice has doubled year-over-year despite government efforts to lower prices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have challenged Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be passed on through generations without DNA changes. A study published in *Cell* showed that rice plants exposed to cold stress passed on cold tolerance for five generations through DNA methylation changes. This research revives the theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who proposed that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The findings suggest that epigenetics play a role in evolution, requiring a reconciliation with core Darwinian principles. The team showed that rice varieties from China's frosty northeast exhibited these stable, non-genetic adaptations.</p>

Some analysts believe the industry is nearing a stabilization point between LGDs and mined diamonds.
