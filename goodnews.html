          <p>The 2025 Summer Davos forum in Tianjin, China, underscored a shift towards a world less reliant on the U.S., emphasizing trade and connections among Global South countries. Attendees noted increased collaboration between less developed economies, particularly in Southeast Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East, with China playing a key role in fostering these relationships. Chinese Premier Li Qiang advocated for greater trade to reshape the world order, signaling a move towards a pluralistic economic landscape. The forum saw renewed interest, with leaders from Singapore, Vietnam, and Ecuador attending, reflecting a wake-up call for the Global South to diversify amid U.S.-China tensions. </p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang, speaking at the World Economic Forum's annual conference in Tianjin, called on countries to collaborate on trade and avoid turning it into a political or security issue. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and engaging in the international economy is a way of reshaping the rules and order. Adam Tooze, a professor at Columbia University, interpreted Li's comments as signaling a move towards a pluralization of global economic processes. Li's address did not specifically mention U.S. trade tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict, focusing instead on the need for collaborative trade practices. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The ongoing debate over the origins of COVID-19, specifically the 'lab leak' theory, is not merely a right-wing conspiracy but a symptom of deep-seated public distrust in science. While some scientists confidently assert evidence supporting natural origins, others remain unconvinced due to limited data and a lack of transparency. The controversy is fueled by anxieties over virus research, particularly gain-of-function studies, and a perception that scientists have failed to address public concerns adequately. Building trust requires transparency, accountability, humility, and relationship-building within the scientific community. </p>

          <p>China and India are reducing imports of Indonesian thermal coal in favor of higher-energy grades from other countries due to a global price drop making higher-quality coal more competitive. This shift is driven by the desire for coal that yields more energy per ton, with Mongolia and South Africa benefiting from increased market share. China and India have also increased purchases from Tanzania, Kazakhstan, Colombia, and Mozambique. Overall coal imports to China and India have decreased, but Indonesian exports have been particularly affected by this trend. </p>

Metsola has sought to normalize relations with Beijing after four years of estrangement, initiating constructive parliamentary relations. Previously unseen correspondence reveals the extent of the detente, which has not been universally welcomed. The effort aims to re-establish legislative dialogue between the European Parliament and the National People‚Äôs Congress. </p>

          <p>California leaders reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion budget, contingent on the Legislature passing housing reform. The deal reflects resistance to proposed cuts, citing financial uncertainty. The budget relies on borrowing, reserves, and shifting funds. Cuts include reducing healthcare expansion for undocumented immigrants and reinstating asset limits for Medi-Cal enrollees.  (not investment advice)</p>

When Mr Bracy ran against Thompson in a Democratic primary in 2024, Ms Bracy Davis endorsed the family friend over her brother. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is developing more ways for foreign institutions to use the yuan, as international confidence in the U.S. dollar falters. The moves aim at challenging the greenback, even as the U.S. dollar remains by far the world's predominant currency. The timing is favorable as the U.S. dollar index has tumbled more than 9% this year. In a sign of growing resolve in Beijing to lure the world away from the dollar, People's Bank of China Governor Pan Gongsheng in a speech last week at the high-profile Lujiazui Forum discussed "how to weaken excessive reliance on a single sovereign currency."
