          <h2>Oil Prices Drop After Iran Strike on U.S. Base in Qatar Causes No Casualties</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the absence of casualties raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent decreased by 7.18% to $71.48, reaching the lowest levels since Israel began bombing Iran on June 13. Energy Secretary Chris Wright told CNBC that the market selloff reflects investors' belief that the conflict will de-escalate following the U.S. strikes on Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, resulting in no casualties. Optimism for a quick resolution to the conflict has led to a more stable outlook for oil prices.

          <p>Super Micro Computer's stock price decreased by approximately 6% after the company announced plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes, maturing in 2030. The offering's proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including funding working capital for growth and business expansion, with $200 million allocated for stock repurchase from note issuers. Despite the recent drop, Super Micro shares have increased by nearly 40% in 2025, driven by strong demand for Nvidia's AI processors, solidifying the company's position as a leader in AI-optimized infrastructure. Investors had previously expressed concerns regarding tariffs and AI chip uncertainty, leading to a reduction in the company's fiscal 2025 guidance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has banned staffers from using Meta's WhatsApp due to concerns over data privacy and security. The Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) cited a lack of transparency in WhatsApp's data practices, instructing staff to remove the app from government devices. Meta has responded, disagreeing with the CAO's characterization and emphasizing WhatsApp's encrypted nature, which provides a higher level of security than many approved apps. Acceptable alternatives include Microsoft Teams, Signal, and Apple's iMessage, as recommended by the CAO. The decision comes amid ongoing antitrust scrutiny of Meta's acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are taking a gradual and cautious approach to Shohei Ohtani's pitching build-up following his return to the mound after Tommy John surgery. Ohtani has made two starts, throwing one inning in each outing, and the team is focused on establishing a strong foundation before increasing his workload. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the importance of erring on the side of caution and not rushing the process. The team will monitor Ohtani's performance with the bat and adjust his role as needed, potentially altering his place in the batting order on days he pitches. The Dodgers aim to balance Ohtani's pitching and hitting duties to maximize his overall contribution.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling more than 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to a door latch issue that could trap passengers inside, particularly children. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announced the recall, citing that if the car's battery level drops too low, the door latches may remain locked. Ford is issuing a software update to address the recall and will notify owners of the safety risk. The company is not aware of any injuries or accidents associated with the faulty door latches. This recall follows a previous recall of over 1 million Ford and Lincoln vehicles due to a software glitch with the rearview camera.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 14:24:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With summer 2025 officially underway, homeowners should consider strategic moves regarding their home equity to manage expenses and improve financial health. Understanding the differences between a home equity loan and a HELOC (home equity line of credit) is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed interest rates, while HELOCs function as revolving credit lines with variable rates. Shopping around for rates and terms can lead to lower rates, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon. Using home equity for financially sound purposes, such as paying off high-rate debt, is advisable, while avoiding uses like vacations is recommended. Prudent use of home equity can improve financial standing during the summer season. (not investment advice)</p>

Google‚Äôs Gemini Workspace for Sheets, Docs, and Gmail appears to be the most similar to what xAI is reportedly building, but it only works within Google‚Äôs ecosystem.
