          <h2>TSA Ends Two-Decade-Old Requirement for Shoe Removal at US Airport Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 18:54:23 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has officially lifted the requirement for passengers to remove their shoes during security screenings at all U.S. airports. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the immediate policy change, citing significant advancements in security technology over the past two decades. The unpopular rule was first implemented nationwide in 2006 following an attempted bombing by Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber." While passengers must still remove laptops and liquids from bags, this change aims to streamline the screening process and improve the travel experience for millions.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has appointed Sarah Mahin to direct its new Department of Homeless Services and Housing. Mahin, who has two decades of experience in the field, will lead the agency as it takes over hundreds of millions of dollars in funding previously managed by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA). The move follows audits critical of LAHSA's oversight. Mahin currently leads the county's Housing for Health program, which is seen as a model for the new department's approach to providing housing and comprehensive support.</p>

          <p>Brazilian forward João Pedro scored two spectacular goals for Chelsea in his first start during the Club World Cup semi-final against his former club, Fluminense. His performance has already sparked discussion that he could be the effective striker the team has been seeking. The 23-year-old, who recently joined from Brighton for a significant transfer fee, demonstrated not only goal-scoring prowess but also strong all-around play. Analysts noted his ability to link up play and his work rate across the pitch, suggesting he has made a strong case for a regular starting position.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised that investors could consider a position in online used car retailer Carvana, citing a belief in its long-term potential despite the stock's volatility. He praised the company's convenient sales model and its position to gain market share in a fragmented industry. Cramer also noted that potential interest rate cuts and tariffs on foreign automakers could make Carvana's offerings more attractive to consumers. He suggested starting with a small position and buying more only if the stock price pulls back. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to study the creation of a transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific port of Chancay. The proposed 4,500-kilometer project would run from Ilhéus, Brazil, to the Peruvian coast, potentially reshaping South America's trade logistics. If constructed, the railway could significantly shorten shipping times to Asia by bypassing the Panama Canal. The current agreement is for a five-year study to assess the technical, environmental, and economic viability of the ambitious infrastructure project, which has an estimated cost exceeding $70 billion.</p>

          <p>A new tax and spending bill signed by President Trump provides tax relief for seniors but does not eliminate federal income taxes on Social Security benefits as some claims suggested. The legislation introduces a new temporary deduction of up to $6,000 for individuals aged 65 and older with incomes below $75,000, or $12,000 for couples below $150,000. Policy experts clarify this deduction applies to a senior's total income, not just their benefits, and will not benefit low-income seniors who already pay no federal tax. Critics also note it could increase pressure on Social Security's long-term finances. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, resting on the seafloor in the Solomon Islands. The bow was torn from the heavy cruiser by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the ship's crew heroically kept it afloat and sailed to Australia for temporary repairs. The discovery, made during seafloor mapping operations, offers a tangible connection to the sacrifice of the ship's crew during one of the U.S. Navy's most difficult nights in World War II.</p>

Her neighbors, friends, and local politicians organized a letter-writing campaign that brought her case to the attention of top officials. Kashanian, who has no criminal record and had regularly checked in with immigration, was previously denied permanent residency due to a sham marriage in her youth.</p>
