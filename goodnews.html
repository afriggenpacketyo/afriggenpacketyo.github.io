          <p>A plow driver testified in the Karen Read trial that he did not see a body on the lawn of the residence where Boston Police Officer John O'Keefe was found dead, potentially bolstering the defense's case. Brian "Lucky" Loughran stated he made multiple passes by the address during a blizzard in January 2022 and saw nothing. This contradicts the prosecution's timeline, which alleges O'Keefe's body remained unmoved from around 12:30 a.m. until first responders arrived around 6 a.m. Loughran's testimony, along with other evidence, aims to cast reasonable doubt on the prosecution's claim that Read left her boyfriend to die in the snow.</p>

          <p>Italians are set to vote in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum presents a rare opportunity to make the country's bureaucracy more benevolent amid tightening citizenship rules. Prime Minister Meloni and other high-profile ministers have encouraged people to skip the referendum, hoping it will not reach quorum. The outcome of the vote could significantly impact the lives of many immigrants and reflect on Italy's national identity.</p>
