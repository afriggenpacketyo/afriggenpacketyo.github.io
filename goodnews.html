          <p>Rachel Reeves, the UK chancellor, announced that the UK economy is showing signs of recovery, with a 0.7% growth in the first three months of the year, surpassing forecasts. This growth is attributed to increased consumer spending and business investment, marking a significant milestone for the Labour government's economic strategy. However, analysts caution that this growth rate may not be sustainable due to impending US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes. Despite challenges, Reeves remains optimistic, citing the UK as potentially the fastest-growing economy in the G7 for the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>
