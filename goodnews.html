          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 13:32:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a series of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, rates for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have become more affordable, dropping to an average of 7.84%. This makes HELOCs a relatively inexpensive borrowing option compared to credit cards and personal loans. The article advises that a "good" rate is at or below this average, but notes that this benchmark could change if the central bank continues its rate-cutting trend. Homeowners are encouraged to maintain a strong credit score and shop around with various lenders to secure the most competitive rates available. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article breaks down the current monthly cost of a $15,000 Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC), which ranges from approximately $142 to $181 depending on the repayment term. It highlights that HELOCs are an affordable borrowing option due to falling interest rates, and payments could decrease further if rates continue to drop. Unlike a home equity loan, HELOCs often allow for interest-only payments during the initial draw period, making initial costs even lower. The article suggests that a smaller HELOC is manageable and less likely to jeopardize the required 20% equity buffer in a home. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company has filed a federal lawsuit against grocery chain Trader Joe's, accusing it of trademark infringement over its crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Smucker's alleges that the Trader Joe's product imitates the distinctive round, crimped design and packaging of its popular Uncrustables brand. The lawsuit claims this mimicry is an "obvious attempt" to capitalize on Uncrustables' brand recognition and has caused consumer confusion. Smucker's is seeking a court order to halt the sale of the Trader Joe's product and is demanding financial compensation for damages and profits gained from the alleged infringement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him. Jones was ordered to pay the damages to families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims for falsely claiming the 2012 massacre was a hoax. In his appeal, Jones argued the judgment was a "financial death penalty" that violated his First Amendment rights. The court's denial, issued without explanation, means Jones remains liable for the full amount, and legal pressure continues to mount for him to liquidate his assets, including his Infowars media company.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as "quantitative tightening," could end in the coming months. In a speech, Powell explained that the Fed is monitoring indicators that suggest bank liquidity is tightening, nearing the goal of maintaining "ample" reserves. The Fed has been shrinking its balance sheet from a peak of nearly $9 trillion by allowing securities to mature without replacement. Powell's comments suggest this phase of monetary tightening is nearing its conclusion, though he offered no new guidance on the future direction of interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
