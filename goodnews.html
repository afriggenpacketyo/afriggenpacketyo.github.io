          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba stated that Japan seeks progress in tariff negotiations with the United States but will not compromise national interests for a quick agreement. Ishiba's remarks precede a potential meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump during the Group of Seven leaders' summit in Canada. Japan has been urging the U.S. to reconsider its tariff policy and pursue a mutually beneficial deal, emphasizing increased Japanese investment to create U.S. jobs. Ishiba stressed the importance of a deal that benefits both nations, rather than prioritizing speed at the expense of Japan's interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, signaling a move towards easing tensions between the two nations. The decision, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, aims to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. This action follows South Korea's resumption of broadcasts last year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloon campaign. While North Korea has not yet commented, South Korea hopes this gesture will lead to improved relations, though prospects for immediate dialogue remain uncertain due to ongoing nuclear disagreements and North Korea's strengthened ties with Russia.</p>

          <p>The UK Aids Memorial Quilt, a collection of 42 quilts and 23 textile panels representing nearly 400 people who died from HIV/Aids, is being displayed at the Tate Modern in London. Created in 1994, the quilt serves as a reminder of those who lost their lives during the epidemic, with many panels made by loved ones as a way to cope with their grief. The exhibition, initiated by author Charlie Porter, aims to provide a space for remembrance and grieving, especially for those who were unable to properly mourn due to the stigma surrounding HIV at the time. The quilt includes tributes to notable figures such as novelist Bruce Chatwin and actor Ian Charleston.</p>

          <p>Japan has strongly urged China to prevent a recurrence after a Chinese military aircraft and a Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force patrol plane were involved in a near miss over international waters in the Pacific. Japan conveyed its "serious concern" to China over the incident, which could have led to a collision, emphasizing the need for continued communication at various levels. A Chinese J-15 warplane flew as close as 45 meters to the MSDF P-3C patrol plane, and also passed in front of it at a distance of around 900 meters. Japan remains alert for increased Chinese military activity, including simultaneous operations by China's aircraft carriers.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced a Spending Review that allocates an extra ¬£29 billion per year to the NHS in England, along with increased funding for defense and housing. The review aims to "renew Britain" through investments in artificial intelligence and transport projects, while some departments, including the Foreign Office and the environment department, face budget cuts. The government hopes that increased spending in key areas will reassure voters, though many departments will need to manage frugal day-to-day spending allocations. The review also includes measures to end the use of hotels for asylum seekers by 2029.</p>

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded detailed observations of a new star, now confirmed to be a nova, providing valuable insights for modern astronomers. The rediscovered memorial from Hanlin Academy scholar Hu Guang describes the star's size, brightness, and color, confirming it was a slow, temporary brightening caused by a dying star. The unprecedented details have helped researchers narrow down the star's possible position. This discovery, reported in The Astronomical Journal, settles a long-standing debate about the nature of the 1408 event and highlights the historical contributions of Chinese astronomy.</p>
