          <p>Bank of America is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts projecting positive results. Expectations are for earnings of 86 cents per share on $26.72 billion in revenue, driven by anticipated growth in net interest income and trading revenues. This report follows strong performances from competitors like JPMorgan Chase, suggesting a favorable environment for the banking sector. The bank's performance in investment banking fees will be closely watched, as it could signal a broader rebound in market activity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alternative asset manager Blackstone has been actively acquiring rental housing properties across the United States, including apartment complexes and single-family homes. The company's strategy focuses on regions with significant job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states, and it now holds an interest in over 274,000 rental units. Despite its large investments, Blackstone states it owns less than 1% of the total U.S. rental market. Analysts suggest this move positions the company to benefit from a market where buying existing properties is often cheaper than new construction, supporting rent growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer Miley Cyrus has revealed that she has no intention of touring, citing the challenges of maintaining her sobriety and mental health while on the road. Despite her physical ability and numerous opportunities, the artist feels there is inadequate support for performers during grueling tour schedules. This announcement comes just weeks after the release of her ninth album and marks over a decade since her last major tour for the album "Bangerz." Her decision highlights a growing conversation around the mental and physical toll that extensive touring can take on musicians.</p>

          <p>A deacon at a Michigan church is being praised for his heroic actions after he used his pickup truck to ram a gunman who was attempting to attack the congregation. Richard Pryor saw the armed man advancing on the church and realized there was no time to wait for police, deciding to intervene directly. His actions, which drew gunfire towards his vehicle, temporarily stopped the attacker and allowed the church's armed security team to neutralize the threat. More than 100 people, including children, were inside the church at the time of the thwarted attack.</p>

          <p>A new messaging app called Bitchat, developed by a team including Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, allows users to communicate without an internet connection. The app functions by creating a decentralized mesh network using Bluetooth, enabling direct device-to-device messaging or communication within topic-based chat rooms. It prioritizes privacy by not requiring user IDs like emails or phone numbers and not collecting personal data. Currently in its early testing phase, Bitchat aims to solve connectivity issues in areas with poor service or government restrictions, offering a potential lifeline during emergencies or network outages.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that cognitive functions like memory and processing speed naturally decline after age 40, but these changes are not always signs of disease. Scientists are studying "exceptional" brain performers to identify lifestyle factors that contribute to sustained cognitive health. Early findings from projects like MindCrowd emphasize the importance of high-quality sleep, cardiovascular health, regular exercise, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol. Experts stress that managing vascular risk factors such as blood pressure and cholesterol can result in a "younger-looking brain," preserving its structure and function in later life.</p>

          <p>The Democratic primary for California governor is in a state of suspended animation as candidates and donors await a decision from former Vice President Kamala Harris on whether she will enter the race. Her potential candidacy is causing current contenders to develop contingency plans and some major donors to withhold significant contributions. While Harris's entry could upend the race due to her high profile, she would also face scrutiny over her past presidential campaigns. Meanwhile, other declared candidates are working to build support, navigating an uncertain political landscape defined by this single, pivotal choice.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has surpassed a $4 trillion market capitalization, making it the world's most valuable company and the first to reach this milestone. The chip maker's extraordinary growth is fueled by the global boom in artificial intelligence, as its powerful chips are essential for running AI applications like ChatGPT and self-driving cars. The company's stock received another boost after the U.S. government approved the sale of some of its AI chips in China. While Nvidia currently dominates the market, it faces future challenges from geopolitical trade tensions and increasing competition from other tech giants. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's Tom Curry is expected to be named as a starting flanker for the British and Irish Lions' first Test match against Australia, reportedly being chosen over Wales' Jac Morgan. In the midfield, an all-Scottish combination is anticipated, with Sione Tuipulotu set to start at inside centre alongside his Glasgow club-mate Huw Jones and fly-half Finn Russell. This would mark the first time a single nation has provided the 10-12-13 axis for the Lions since 1993. The final team selection, to be confirmed by coach Andy Farrell, is eagerly awaited by rugby fans.</p>

          <p>Despite a high level of interest in entrepreneurship among young Germans, few actually start their own companies, revealing a significant untapped potential of 1.6 million startups. A key barrier is financial insecurity, with studies showing that basic income security in the initial phase is a primary motivator for taking the plunge. Experts and young entrepreneurs, like the founders of the successful EdTech app Knowunity, are calling for systemic changes. They advocate for better social safety nets for founders, more entrepreneurship education in schools, and the development of regional startup hubs to nurture innovation.</p>

          <p>In a major blow to the Sinaloa cartel's financial operations, U.S. law enforcement has seized over $10 million in cryptocurrency. The seizure was part of a nationwide series of raids that also netted vast quantities of illicit drugs, including 44 million fentanyl pills and thousands of pounds of fentanyl powder and methamphetamine. This action highlights the increasing use of digital assets by transnational criminal organizations for money laundering and other illicit activities. The operation underscores the U.S. government's focus on dismantling the financial networks of cartels designated as terrorist organizations.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is poised to report its second-quarter earnings, with analysts expecting strong results driven by market volatility and a rebound in investment banking. Wall Street forecasts earnings of $9.53 per share on $13.47 billion in revenue, as the firm likely benefited from increased trading activity in bonds, currencies, and stocks due to global tariff policies. The performance of its trading desks and a recovery in asset values are seen as key tailwinds. These results will provide further insight into the health of Wall Street following positive reports from other major banks. (not investment advice)</p>
