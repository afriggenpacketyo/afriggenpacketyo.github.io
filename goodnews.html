          <p>Global sales of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles saw a 24% year-over-year increase in June, reaching 1.8 million units. This growth was primarily driven by strong demand in China, which accounted for 60% of the total, and a 23% rise in Europe. In contrast, North American sales declined by 9%, positioning the US as a laggard in the electric transition for the first half of 2025. Market analysts expect Chinese subsidies to continue, sustaining this momentum despite some reports of funding depletion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the 2025 MLB All-Star Game after the contest ended in a 6-6 tie, triggering a historic home run derby-style swing-off to determine the winner. The NL built an early 6-0 lead, but the AL rallied to tie the game in the ninth inning. Philadelphia's Kyle Schwarber was named MVP for his performance in the tiebreaker. The game also featured the debut of the Automated Ball-Strike System, which was successfully challenged by players from both leagues, marking a significant technological step for the sport.</p>

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw, attending his 11th All-Star Game as a special "Legend Pick," delivered a poignant pregame speech and had a memorable on-field moment during the National League's victory. Before the game, he reminded his fellow All-Stars of their responsibility to the sport, emphasizing the game's importance. During a brief, mic'd-up appearance in the second inning, he retired two batters and received a loud ovation from the Atlanta crowd. The appearance, potentially his last at a Midsummer Classic, was celebrated by fellow players and fans as a fitting tribute to his career.</p>

The seat was left vacant by the death of Rep. Raúl Grijalva, Adelita's father and a long-serving progressive leader. Grijalva, endorsed by prominent progressives, secured the Democratic nomination over several challengers in the heavily Democratic district. Butierez, who previously ran against Raúl Grijalva, won the GOP nomination and will face Adelita Grijalva in the special general election on September 23.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows a House subcommittee's advancement of the "SCORE Act," which aims to create a federal framework for student-athlete compensation, superseding varied state laws. The NIL rules, enacted in 2021, have transformed college sports by allowing athletes to earn significant income from endorsements and other activities. The executive order represents a major federal intervention into the rapidly evolving and often contentious landscape of collegiate athletics.</p>

This trend supports local mining industries and helps formalize the small-scale mining sector, though it also carries risks related to refining standards and supply chain ethics.
