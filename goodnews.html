          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a productive phone call with Chinese Premier Xi Jinping, where they reportedly approved a deal for TikTok's US operations, though Beijing's official news agency offered a more cautious "welcomes negotiations" statement. Trump indicated the deal, which could involve US firms like Oracle licensing TikTok's algorithm, still needs to be signed, but would ensure "very tight control" over the app. This comes after Trump repeatedly delayed a ban on TikTok, which he now views as crucial for his 2024 campaign. Concerns persist among US lawmakers about ByteDance's links to the Chinese Communist Party, despite efforts to resolve the national security implications.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters anticipate Gabrielle will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday, remaining over open waters initially. Its current forecast track shows it moving north of the Caribbean islands and away from land, but it could pass to the east of Bermuda next week, with "little change in strength" expected in the next 48 hours before gradual intensification. While hurricane activity this season has been quieter than initially predicted, NOAA had forecast a busier-than-average year. This article provides crucial updates on the storm's trajectory and potential impacts, urging continued vigilance for affected regions.</p>

Despite societal expectations and family encouragement to continue in basketball, the 24-year-old felt a strong calling to help others, a dream he kept mostly to himself. He is now training at a police academy in Kemah, Texas, where Chief Raymond Garivey is making accommodations for his height, including finding a suitable patrol car and uniform. Wilmore states he would even turn down an NBA offer to remain in law enforcement, embodying a unique dedication to public service.

          <h2>Federal Judge Dismisses Trump's $15 Billion Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, citing the complaint's "decidedly improper and impermissible" language. Judge Steven Merryday ruled that the 85-page lawsuit was too long and contained "tedious and burdensome" rhetoric irrelevant to its legal merits, describing it as a "megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally." While the judge did not rule on the case's merits, he granted Trump's lawyers 28 days to refile an amended complaint, emphasizing the need for a professional and dignified approach. The newspaper welcomed the ruling, calling the original complaint a political document rather than a serious legal filing aimed at stifling independent reporting.</p>

          <p>The UK has seen significant investment from US tech giants, including Microsoft and Google, signaling a "tech bromance" aimed at bolstering the UK economy and its AI superpower ambitions. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed surprise at Britain's self-image, declaring the UK an AI superpower due to its research history. Microsoft announced a £22bn investment, extending its Stargate AI plan to the UK, while Google invested £5bn in data centers and Deepmind. Despite this optimism, former Deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg criticized the UK for "clinging on to the coattails of Uncle Sam." The article suggests this flood of US capital, coupled with a "pro-growth" regulatory approach, could define the UK's economy for decades, making it a tech laboratory and deepening its alliance with the US in the global AI race.</p>

He expressed optimism for AutoZone, a cautious view on Micron's stock despite liking the company, and predicted potential "upside surprise" for Cintas.
