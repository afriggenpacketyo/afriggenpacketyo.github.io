          <p>As the price of gold approaches record highs, potentially nearing $4,000 per ounce, beginner investors may feel priced out of the market. However, this article outlines several strategic approaches to enter the market without paying top dollar. These methods include exploring various investment vehicles like gold ETFs and stocks, considering fractional gold options for smaller, more affordable purchases, and employing a dollar-cost averaging strategy to build a position over time. The key takeaway is that while prompt action is advised, there are accessible entry points for those new to investing in the precious metal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nearly 600 economists, including several Nobel laureates, have co-signed an open letter defending the independence of the Federal Reserve and supporting Governor Lisa Cook. The letter comes in response to President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Cook from her position on the Fed's Board of Governors, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The signatories argue that such political pressure undermines the credibility of the central bank, which is designed to be insulated from day-to-day politics. They emphasize that the institutional safeguards protecting the Fed are crucial for maintaining American economic strength and stability.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Jessica Pegula has secured her spot in the US Open semi-finals for the second consecutive year after a commanding 6-3, 6-3 victory over Barbora Krejcikova. The fourth seed delivered an impressive performance, dominating baseline exchanges and maintaining her composure to win without dropping a single set in the tournament so far. Pegula expressed surprise and satisfaction with her comfort level on one of tennis's biggest stages, overcoming a previously poor record in Grand Slam quarter-final matches.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin experienced a modest price increase, reclaiming the $111,000 level, while the broader stock market faced a sell-off and gold surged to a new record high of around $3,500 per ounce. The market divergence was influenced by concerns over the legality of President Trump's global tariffs, which drove investors towards safe-haven assets. While gold benefited from its traditional role as a hedge against uncertainty, Bitcoin's performance was also affected by a recent rotation of capital into Ethereum. Analysts note that crypto assets are increasingly competing with traditional safe havens, with future movements potentially tied to the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision.

          <h2>Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Cut in September May Have Muted Impact on Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:08:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve prepares for its first interest rate cut of 2025, expectations for a significant drop in mortgage rates should be tempered. The anticipated cut is only 25 basis points, a marginal step that is unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in the mortgage climate. Furthermore, many lenders may have already priced this expected reduction into their current rate offerings, meaning borrowers might not see a noticeable difference after the official announcement. It is also important to remember that mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's policy, including the 10-year Treasury yield, which also plays a major role.

          <p>In an effort to win back customers affected by inflation, McDonald's is bringing back its "Extra Value Meals" with deals like a $5 sausage and egg McMuffin meal. The move comes as the fast-food giant has seen a decline in traffic among low-income customers and sluggish breakfast sales. CEO Chris Kempczinski has attributed these trends to the financial pressures facing consumers. This focus on value follows the recent reintroduction of the Snack Wrap and the launch of the McValue menu earlier in the year, signaling a broader strategy to appeal to diners who have pulled back on spending.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has officially announced that she will not seek a third term in 2026, opening up a competitive race for her seat. Ernst, the first female combat veteran to serve in the Senate, stated that the decision was made after significant prayer and reflection. Her announcement follows recent criticism from both Democrats and Republicans over her policy stances. While Democrats are hopeful to make inroads in the state, they face a challenging environment in Iowa, which has not elected a Democratic senator since 2008 and voted for Donald Trump by a wide margin in 2024.</p>

          <p>Defender Marc Guehi's anticipated £35 million transfer from Crystal Palace to Liverpool fell through on deadline day, leaving the player's future uncertain. The collapse reportedly occurred after Palace failed to secure a suitable replacement defender, a key condition for sanctioning the move. While frustrating for Guehi, who missed out on joining the Premier League champions, the situation presents a new opportunity. As he is in the final year of his contract, he can now sign with a new club as a free agent in the summer, which will significantly increase his personal earning power and give him full control over his next career move.</p>

          <p>Walmart is enhancing its Walmart+ subscription service by adding NBCUniversal's Peacock as a streaming option, in a direct move to better compete with Amazon Prime. Starting September 15, members can choose between ad-supported versions of Peacock Premium or Paramount+ as part of their $98 annual membership, with the ability to switch between the two services every 90 days. This expansion of streaming content aims to add value for consumers without increasing the subscription price. Unlike Amazon, which invests heavily in original content, Walmart's strategy focuses on bundling existing popular streaming platforms to attract and retain subscribers.</p>

Alissa is now finding new homes for the art by selling or gifting the pieces to friends and strangers.

          <p>Home Depot's recent $18 billion acquisition of SRS Distribution is a strategic move to capture a larger share of the professional contractor market, particularly those working on complex, high-value projects. A key, yet understated, benefit of the deal is SRS's trade credit program, which allows contractors to buy supplies and pay for them later, effectively making Home Depot a financier for their projects. This service, which has already led to a double-digit spending lift among pros who use it, is seen by analysts as a massive unlock for growth. The strategy aims to build deeper relationships with steady professional customers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts highlight a "golden opportunity" for investors to potentially pay a 0% tax rate on long-term capital gains, thanks to new deductions in President Trump's recent tax legislation. For 2025, individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 and married couples filing jointly with income up to $96,700 qualify for this 0% rate. The increased standard deduction and other new tax breaks could allow more investors to fall within this bracket. This creates a window for strategies like "tax-gain harvesting," where profitable assets are sold tax-free during lower-income years to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis.

          <p>To combat financial pressures and avoid closures or acquisitions by larger systems, independent rural hospitals are increasingly forming "clinically integrated networks." These collaborations allow them to remain autonomous while pooling resources to negotiate better prices for services like mobile MRI units and share specialists. By combining their patient populations, these hospitals can also better participate in value-based care contracts, which reward quality of care over quantity. This model, seen in states like North Dakota and Colorado, offers a survival strategy that helps preserve local healthcare access and jobs in rural communities.</p>
