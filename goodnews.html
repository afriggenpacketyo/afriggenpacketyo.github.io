          <p>Warby Parker's stock experienced a significant surge after Google unveiled a partnership to develop smart glasses at its I/O developer conference. Google has committed up to $150 million to the project, with an initial $75 million already invested in product development and an additional $75 million contingent on Warby Parker meeting collaboration milestones. The glasses, built on Google's Android XR operating system and featuring the Gemini AI assistant, are slated for release after 2025. This alliance positions Warby Parker and Google as rivals to the Meta-EssilorLuxottica partnership in the smart glasses market, promising users helpful information directly within their line of sight or earshot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several newspapers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, mistakenly published a syndicated summer reading list that included fictitious books by well-known authors. The list, provided by King Features, contained only five real titles out of fifteen, and writer Marco Buscaglia admitted that it was partially generated by Artificial Intelligence. The error has sparked outrage among readers and writers, raising concerns about the integrity of syndicated content and the impact of AI on the media landscape. This incident highlights the challenges of maintaining accuracy and quality in the face of increasing reliance on AI-generated content, particularly as news organizations grapple with financial constraints and staff reductions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The narrative surrounding President Biden's age and fitness for office continues to dominate Washington discussions, fueled by a new book detailing his alleged cognitive decline. The book, titled 'Original Sin,' portrays Biden as frail and self-deluded, with anecdotes of him forgetting names and struggling with basic tasks. While the White House has attempted to downplay these concerns, the author of this article argues that Biden's condition is evident to anyone paying attention. The article suggests that the constant focus on Biden's age is becoming tiresome, especially given the inherent cynicism of political spin and the public's existing perceptions of his infirmity.</p>

This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The agency is urging vaccine makers to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials, especially in adults aged 50-64, to better assess the balance of benefits and risks. The FDA's new leadership criticized the previous "one-size-fits-all" approach and cited the poor uptake of past annual COVID-19 booster shots as justification for the change.</p>

          <p>The Senate voted to advance the GENIUS Act, a bill aimed at regulating stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of another asset. The bill establishes rules for stablecoin issuers, including a mandate that firms hold a reserve of assets underlying the cryptocurrency. Supporters hail the bill as a means of protecting consumers and setting industry standards, while critics warn that it fails to address conflict-of-interest concerns and risks endangering consumers with a weak set of rules.</p>
