          <p>The UK is preparing for President Donald Trump's state visit, which is widely anticipated to offer a welcome distraction from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's mounting domestic political challenges. Starmer recently faced high-profile resignations and a cabinet reshuffle, alongside significant public protests over immigration figures. The visit aims to leverage Britain's "soft power" and strengthen the "special relationship" through ceremonial events and crucial trade discussions, including efforts to secure lower tariffs on steel and aluminum. Despite political differences, Trump's apparent rapport with Starmer and his fondness for the UK are seen as potentially beneficial during this turbulent period for the British government.</p>

          <p>Women's rugby teams are increasingly tracking players' menstrual cycles to optimize performance and health, recognizing it as the "fifth vital sign" for female athletes. Symptoms like fatigue, cramps, and hormonal fluctuations can significantly impact strength, endurance, and recovery, with a 2024 study showing 88% of elite British sportswomen reported performance being affected. Teams utilize daily questionnaires, apps, and even "cramp cocktails" to monitor cycles, allowing for tailored training and nutrition adjustments. This proactive and informed approach aims to maximize player potential and support overall well-being, acknowledging the unique physiological needs of female athletes.</p>

In an article published in the ruling Communist Party's leading theoretical journal, Xi outlined six key tasks, prioritizing measures to combat excessive and cutthroat competition. He stressed that industry associations should guide companies towards improving product quality over price, and actively oppose the proliferation of low-quality offerings. This initiative reflects a strategic push to streamline internal economic dynamics and strengthen China's position on the international stage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US and China have reportedly reached a "framework" agreement regarding the American operations of TikTok, potentially paving the way for US ownership. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the deal from talks in Madrid, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize it on Friday. This development comes ahead of a looming September 17 deadline for TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its US business or face a ban. While specific details remain sparse, the deal aims to address long-standing US national security concerns over data access and algorithmic control, which have been major sticking points in ongoing trade negotiations between the two global powers.</p>

President Andrew Friedman expressed frustration with the current rule, which he believes disincentivizes two-way players.
