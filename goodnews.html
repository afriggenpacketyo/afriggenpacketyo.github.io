          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, including the "WNBA on Ion" studio show, which is dedicated to WNBA coverage. While the deal's financial details remain undisclosed, reports estimate the original agreement at $13 million annually, expiring at the end of the 2025 season. This new agreement follows substantial viewership growth on Ion, with a 133% year-over-year increase, reaching over 23 million unique viewers, as the league gains popularity due to stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert emphasized the partnership's role in expanding the league's reach, and this deal complements the 11-year media rights agreement with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal. This expansion of media rights highlights the increasing interest and investment in women's sports. The new partnership solidifies ION's position as the premier Friday night destination for WNBA action for years to come, which is a testament to the flourishing partnership and the league's rising demand.</p>

          <p>The University of Michigan's Surveys of Consumers indicates a significant rebound in consumer sentiment in early June, with the headline index jumping to 60.5, surpassing expectations. This improvement reflects a less pessimistic outlook on the economy and inflation, coinciding with a softening in rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Respondents also sharply reduced their near-term inflation outlook, and the one-year estimate slid to 5.1%, a 1.5 percentage point drop, while the five-year view edged lower to 4.1%. Despite these positive shifts, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels due to ongoing concerns about the impact of tariffs and geopolitical issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to attend the opening day of the Iowa State Fair in August, marking a return to a key presidential campaign ritual in a state that previously boosted his White House bid. The visit, scheduled for August 7, is intended to rally support in farm country for Republicans and celebrate the nation's 250th anniversary. Vice President JD Vance is also expected to attend the fair on a separate day, and Trump has expressed interest in hosting a year-long exhibition at the Iowa State Fairgrounds for the 2026 semiquincentennial. Trump last visited the fair in August 2023, where he drew large crowds and won the Iowa caucuses in January 2024 by a significant margin.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, driven by optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. This surge in shopper attitudes ended six consecutive months of declining sentiment, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was seen across various demographics, and the recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China, along with pauses on "Liberation Day" tariffs, contributed to this positive shift. However, concerns remain about potential price increases from tariffs, with retailers like Walmart and Best Buy voicing alarm, and the OECD expecting U.S. inflation to reach 4% by the end of 2025.

Amazon Health Services will be divided into pillars focused on One Medical Clinical Care Delivery, Clinical Operations and Performance, Strategic Growth and Network Development, AHS Store, Tech and Marketing, AHS Compliance, and AHS Pharmacy Services. The reorganization comes after senior health leaders, including Dr. Vin Gupta and Trent Green, left the company, and the company has been working to expand its One Medical chain and pharmacy business.

          <p>Pollen levels are forecast to be high or very high in many parts of the UK, causing significant distress for hay fever sufferers. Symptoms include itchy eyes, sneezing, runny noses, and headaches, and the warm weather has created ideal conditions for birch tree pollen, a major trigger. Allergy expert Professor Stephen Till recommends a "cocktail approach" of antihistamine tablets or drops, a steroid nasal spray, and eye drops for relief, while pharmacist Ashley Cohen advises good hygiene practices. Avoiding triggers such as cut grass, fresh flowers, and smoking is also essential, and immunotherapy treatment might be available for the worst affected.</p>
