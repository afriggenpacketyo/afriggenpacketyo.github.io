          <h2>Japan's Craft Gin Industry Booms with Local Ingredients and Unique Flavors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 20:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Yudai Matsuzaki's vision to create craft gin in Japan stemmed from a desire to utilize a local forest, leading him to plant conifers for juniper berries. He is among a growing number of small-scale distillers in Japan who are using homegrown ingredients to produce craft gins, resulting in a domestic gin boom. Domestic shipments of gin have increased significantly since 2019, with major manufacturers like Suntory and Asahi entering the market with sugar-free canned gin products. The fact that distillation equipment for whiskey and shochu can be converted to produce gin, which does not typically require aging, has been a boon to the industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of rocket launches, particularly those of SpaceX, to understand and mitigate the increasing noise pollution affecting communities near launch sites. With the growing frequency of launches, especially SpaceX's Falcon 9, the sonic booms generated by returning rocket boosters are causing disturbances such as shaking windows and waking residents. Kent Gee at Brigham Young University is leading research to analyze the unique three-part sonic boom produced by Falcon 9 boosters, aiming to develop strategies for reducing noise disruptions before the problem becomes widespread with the advent of larger rockets like Starship. The best time to address rocket noise is before problems become pervasive and entrenched.</p>

          <p>Senators Ted Cruz and Ben Ray Lujan have introduced a bipartisan bill aimed at streamlining the presidential permitting process for international bridges and land ports of entry along the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. The bill expands on previous legislation written by Cruz that expedited permits for specific bridge projects in South Texas. The goal is to boost economic activity in border communities by facilitating trade, business, and tourism. The legislation also prevents future administrations from considering environmental documents created under the National Environmental Policy Act.</p>

          <p>Japan has lost its position as the world's top creditor to Germany for the first time in 34 years, according to the Finance Ministry, although its net external assets rose to a record high. Japan's gross external assets increased by 12.9% to 533.05 trillion yen, but this was below Germany's 569.65 trillion yen. The yen's depreciation increased the value of Japan's foreign-currency assets, while Germany benefited from a large current account surplus. Japan remains the second-largest holder of net external assets, followed by China, while the United States has a significant net external liability.</p>
