          <p>Ukrainian anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme. The plot allegedly involved inflating the prices of state contracts for military drones and electronic warfare systems by up to 30 percent. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed a "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, especially during wartime. The arrests come shortly after the independence of the country's anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests.</p>

The article traces its journey from a small group of developers to a platform used by major corporations for tokenized assets and funds. While founder Vitalik Buterin celebrates the growth, he also warns of risks like centralization.

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, along with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, is launching a new left-wing political party in the UK but has yet to decide on a name. Instead of choosing a name themselves, they are asking their reported 600,000 registered supporters to help select one that encapsulates the party's essence. The article discusses the strategic importance of a party's name for branding and voter recognition. The new party cannot field candidates in elections until it is officially registered with the Electoral Commission.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially committed to Luka Doncic as their franchise cornerstone, signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. The team's public display of support for the 26-year-old star signals a clear shift in focus. This move intensifies speculation about the future of LeBron James, who is under contract for only one more season and has historically been the central figure on his teams. With the franchise now building around Doncic, it remains unclear how the 40-year-old James will adapt to a changing role.</p>

          <h2>Meta Signals More Cautious Approach to Open-Source AI Amid China's Rapid Advances</h2>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a leading advocate for open-source AI with its Llama models, has indicated it will be more careful with its open-source strategy in the future. This shift in stance contrasts with China's vigorous embrace of open-source AI, which some experts believe could help the country surpass the U.S. in the field. Chinese tech giants like Alibaba have recently released powerful new open-source models. The move suggests a potential strategic realignment in the global AI landscape as companies weigh the benefits of open collaboration against competitive and security concerns.</p>
