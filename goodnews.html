          <p>Robinhood's stock surged to an all-time high after the company announced it will offer tokenized shares of private companies like OpenAI and SpaceX to its European users. This move, part of a broader crypto expansion, makes private equity accessible to regular investors in the EU, bypassing accredited investor rules that exist in the U.S. The company is promoting the launch with a giveaway of tokens to new users, signaling a significant step in democratizing access to pre-IPO companies through blockchain technology.

The tax, which would have retroactively targeted revenues from companies like Google and Meta, was canceled to bring the U.S. back to the table for a critical trade deal.

          <p>President Trump has indicated his administration is considering a "temporary pass" system to shield key industries like agriculture and hospitality from the negative impacts of intensified immigration enforcement. He expressed concern that removing long-term, non-criminal workers could be destructive to these businesses, which often struggle to find labor for demanding jobs. This potential policy shift aims to balance a hardline immigration stance with the economic needs of vital sectors, though it remains in the planning stages. The president reiterated that removing criminals remains the top priority.</p>

          <p>In a landmark case for British law enforcement, a 92-year-old man has been convicted of the sexual assault and murder of a 75-year-old woman in 1967. Ryland Headley was found guilty of killing Louisa Dunne in her home, solving one of the U.K.'s longest-running cold cases after 58 years. The breakthrough came when investigators re-examined evidence, including Dunne's skirt, using modern forensic techniques. DNA found on the clothing matched Headley's profile, which had been added to a national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident.</p>

The decision to suspend access to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data had alarmed scientists, who warned it could set forecasting back decades. A new notice from NOAA indicates the move was intended to mitigate a "significant cybersecurity risk" and was postponed at the request of NASA.
