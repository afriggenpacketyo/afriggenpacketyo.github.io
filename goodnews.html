        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced a partnership with Indian artisans after facing backlash for selling sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The move came after social media outcry and calls from the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce to acknowledge the design's Indian heritage. This collaboration is seen as a potential model for respectful engagement between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities. The Chamber also plans to patent the Kolhapuri chappal design to prevent future copyright issues.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting immigration raids across seven Southern California counties. The ruling found "a mountain of evidence" that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting people based on race or ethnicity without reasonable suspicion. The order, part of a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups, also requires that detainees be given immediate access to legal counsel. This decision represents a significant legal setback for the administration's intensified immigration enforcement tactics.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has permitted a lawsuit by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo to move forward on claims of breach of contract and deceptive practices. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices to create AI clones without their consent, after they were hired for what they were told were internal or research purposes. While a claim of federal copyright over their voices was dismissed, the case will continue, marking a significant development in the legal battles between creatives and AI companies over the use of personal likeness and work.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are significantly increasing their international presence, driven by a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies expanding abroad. The number of overseas offices for Chinese firms has grown by 70 percent since 2018, as businesses prefer legal support from trusted domestic lawyers. While they are successfully serving Chinese clients, these firms face challenges in attracting non-Chinese clients amid rising geopolitical tensions. This global expansion reflects a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry as it adapts to a changing global landscape.</p>

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This "talent acquisition" includes licensing fees for some of Windsurf's technology but is not a full acquisition of the company, which remains independent. The move is the latest in an escalating AI talent war among major tech companies, with Google aiming to bolster its DeepMind division. The deal occurred after Windsurf had reportedly been in acquisition talks with competitor OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova. While Swiatek has more major final experience, she has historically been less comfortable on grass, whereas Anisimova is playing with the freedom of an underdog. Anisimova's aggressive, powerful style could challenge Swiatek, who has adjusted her court positioning to give herself more time for her signature topspin forehand. The outcome will likely hinge on which player better manages the nerves of the occasion, with the match promising to crown a first-time Wimbledon champion.</p>

          <p>Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is steering the country's foreign policy with a new "Australia first" doctrine, aiming to assert national sovereignty amid the growing tug-of-war between the US and China. Referencing wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need to act based on strategic reality rather than just tradition, maintaining the US alliance while also engaging with Beijing. This recalibration seeks to find strength in Australia's unique geopolitical position. The approach comes as his government navigates domestic debate over the costs and risks of the AUKUS security pact.</p>
