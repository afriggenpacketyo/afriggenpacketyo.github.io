          <p>WWE star Gunther defeated Pat McAfee at Backlash after a physically intense match. The rivalry began when Gunther attacked commentator Michael Cole, leading to McAfee stepping in. Gunther dominated much of the match, delivering numerous chops to McAfee's chest, eventually winning by putting McAfee to sleep. McAfee later posted a photo on X showing the severe redness on his chest, acknowledging the match's intensity. Cole pleaded with McAfee to give up during the match. Gunther is looking to get back into contention for the World Heavyweight Championship after losing it to Jey Uso at WrestleMania.</p>

          <p>The first group of White South Africans, known as Afrikaners, who were granted refugee status by the U.S., departed from Johannesburg for Washington, D.C. The group of 49, mainly families, is being resettled under an executive order issued by President Trump, who claimed they face "government-sponsored race-based discrimination." The South African government denies any racially motivated discrimination or land confiscations. This initiative contrasts with the Trump administration's general ban on most other refugees entering the U.S., and the processing of these applications has been unusually fast.</p>
