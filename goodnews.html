        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House passed a bipartisan measure to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force in Iraq from 1991 and 2003. Proponents from both parties argued that these decades-old authorizations are obsolete and risk being abused by presidents to justify military actions without contemporary congressional approval. The amendment, attached to the annual defense spending bill, passed with a vote of 261 to 167, including support from 49 Republicans. This move represents a significant effort by Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over declaring war, a power lawmakers feel has been eroded over time.</p>

          <p>For the first time since the pandemic began, COVID-19 is no longer among the top 10 causes of death in the United States, according to preliminary data from the CDC for 2024. After peaking as the third leading cause of death in 2021, it has steadily declined, though it remains a significant health concern. Overall death rates in the U.S. have decreased for the third consecutive year, with heart disease and cancer remaining the top two causes. Public health experts note this shift signifies success in managing infectious diseases, turning focus towards the more complex challenge of preventing chronic illnesses.</p>

          <p>South Africa's cricket team secured a 14-run victory over England in the first T20 match of their series, which was heavily impacted by rain in Cardiff. The game was first reduced to nine overs per side, during which South Africa scored 97-5 before another weather delay. England was then set a revised target of 69 runs from just five overs. Despite a quick 25 runs from Jos Buttler, England's chase faltered as they lost key wickets early, ultimately finishing with a score of 54-5. The series is set to continue at Old Trafford, where more rain is forecasted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Germantown Dam in Ohio, built in 1922 following the Great Flood of 1913, is currently undergoing a $1.5 million repair project to address severe deterioration in its concrete tunnels. The dam is one of five structures that protect cities in the Miami Valley from flooding, and it recently proved its continued utility by storing water during a major rain event in April 2025. Officials from the Miami Conservatory District state that the repairs, funded by local property taxes, are crucial for public safety. Successful maintenance of the dam could also lead to lower flood insurance rates for nearby homeowners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school while his legal case proceeds. The state had sought to enforce a policy that ties school funding to restricting students to bathrooms corresponding with their sex assigned at birth. The court's unsigned order is not a final ruling on the merits of the case but allows a lower appellate court's injunction to remain in place for the student. Civil rights advocates praised the decision as a reaffirmation of the student's dignity and right to education.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service has reversed its long-standing policy and will now provide N95 masks to federal firefighters to protect them from harmful smoke inhalation. For decades, the agency had banned their use, citing concerns about heat exhaustion, a stance contrary to practices in other wildfire-prone countries like Canada and Australia. The policy change follows reports detailing the health risks firefighters face, including a higher likelihood of cancer diagnoses, and pressure from lawmakers. The move is seen as an implicit acknowledgment of the serious health hazards posed by prolonged exposure to wildfire smoke.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly overtook Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest person after a massive surge in Oracle's stock price pushed his net worth to an estimated $393 billion. The jump was driven by a more than 40% increase in the company's shares, following a highly optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure business and a surge in AI-related deals. However, the stock's gains moderated by the end of the trading day, allowing Musk to reclaim the top spot. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, has also been involved in potential media acquisitions, including TikTok.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was famously based on her leadership style.

She recalled that while people in the fashion industry were initially concerned about her portrayal, she felt Streep's performance was fantastic.

          <p>Oracle's stock saw a nearly 36% increase, its best single-day performance since 1992, adding approximately $244 billion to its market value. This dramatic rise was fueled by the company's announcement of a massive $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. The surge highlights Oracle's successful positioning within the booming artificial intelligence sector, as its cloud infrastructure is in high demand for running large AI workloads. The impressive financial forecast overshadowed a quarterly report that otherwise missed revenue and earnings estimates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has collected a rock sample on Mars that contains what scientists are calling "potential biosignatures," the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the red planet. The sample, taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater, exhibits mineral patterns and textures that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While researchers cannot completely rule out non-biological origins, the finding has generated significant excitement. The next crucial step is the ambitious and costly Mars Sample Return mission to bring the rock to Earth for definitive analysis.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, has launched a petition against FIFA's use of "dynamic pricing" for the 2026 World Cup, calling it an "affront to the game." He argues the practice, which allows ticket prices to fluctuate with demand, will make attending matches unaffordable for many fans and prioritizes profit over the sport's accessibility. The petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and for 15% of tickets to be set aside for local residents. Mamdani contrasted current prices with the 1994 World Cup, where some tickets cost as little as $25.</p>
