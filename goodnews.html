          <p>The U.K. and European Union finally agreed to reset relations Monday, sources told CNBC, after Britain's acrimonious exit from the bloc in 2020. U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and other senior officials in London for a much-anticipated summit which is taking place against a backdrop of unpredictable global dynamics ‚Äî led by the U.S. The Trump administration's recent shift toward U.S. isolationism when it comes to global affairs, and particularly those more acutely affecting Europe, such as the war in Ukraine, make the case for an ambitious reset.</p>

NJ Transit President Kris Kolluri and BLET General Chairman Tom Haas also spoke about the deal, but they did not get into the specifics of the agreement, which will be up for a union ratification vote in the coming days.
