          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:35:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their equity face a complex decision between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC) due to the current financial climate. Experts suggest that home equity loans offer stability with a fixed interest rate, which is appealing during times of market uncertainty. Conversely, HELOCs provide flexibility with a variable rate that could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates, making them suitable for phased expenses. The best choice ultimately depends on an individual's financial needs, risk tolerance, and plans for the borrowed funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sauli Niinistö, the former president of Finland, shared his insights on former President Trump's diplomatic strategy concerning Russia and its leader, Vladimir Putin. Niinistö recounted advising Trump that Putin respects strength and that one must be cautious with his proposals, as he often introduces significant ideas modestly. He believes Trump will continue his direct diplomatic engagement with Putin and urges Europe to remain involved in these discussions. Niinistö also credited Trump's previous presidency with acting as a "wake-up call" for Europe, prompting increased military investment and a renewed focus on continental security.</p>

          <p>Virtual Private Network (VPN) applications have surged to the top of Apple's App Store charts in the United Kingdom after new age verification rules took effect. The Online Safety Act now requires platforms with adult content, such as PornHub and Reddit, to implement robust age checks, prompting many users to turn to VPNs to bypass these requirements by masking their location. One VPN provider reported an 1,800% increase in daily sign-ups from the UK over the weekend. Cybersecurity experts warn that many free VPN services may pose significant security and privacy risks to users.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United has reportedly started talks with Southampton to acquire goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The negotiations are in the early stages, with Newcastle exploring either a loan or a permanent transfer for the England international. Southampton, which was relegated from the Premier League last season, is said to prefer a permanent sale. The move follows Newcastle's recent attempt to sign another goalkeeper, which fell through, and would reunite Ramsdale with his former manager, Eddie Howe, as the club seeks to strengthen its squad for the upcoming Champions League season.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Cambridge University have discovered a remarkably complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact. The print was found pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a ceramic model of a building placed in tombs, likely left by the craftsperson who made it between 2055 and 1650 B.C.E. Egyptologists have described the discovery as rare and exciting, offering a direct and personal connection to an individual from the ancient world. The soul house, along with its unique handprint, will be a featured item in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum focusing on ancient Egyptian craftspeople.</p>

          <p>The WNBA is facing a pivotal moment as its players, now household names, are publicly campaigning for a greater share of the league's rapidly growing revenue. Despite claims of unprofitability, the WNBA's value is soaring, evidenced by a new media rights deal worth over $2 billion, rising franchise valuations, and record-breaking viewership and merchandise sales. Players currently receive just over 9% of league revenue, a figure starkly lower than the roughly 50% share seen in men's professional sports leagues.

          <p>A real estate expert with over a decade of experience advises that homebuyers can negotiate many aspects of a purchase beyond the initial price, potentially saving thousands. Strategic negotiations can include asking for seller concessions to cover closing costs, securing funds for a mortgage rate buydown, or requesting that personal property like furniture be included in the sale. Other negotiable items include pre-closing repairs for issues found during inspection, such as a faulty septic system, which could save a buyer up to $50,000. These tactics give buyers more leverage, especially as the number of property listings increases. (not investment advice)</p>

The venture failed within a month because, as he quickly learned, nobody wanted to buy his product despite his pitch that it was a cost-effective alternative. Cuban says the experience taught him a valuable lesson: it doesn't matter how many times you fail, as you only need to be right once.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for becoming more influential and likable at work. She emphasizes that successful communication involves more than just hearing; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking thoughtful follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This "superhero move" shows competence, empathy, and a willingness to learn, which builds trust and makes a person more likable to colleagues and superiors. Research co-authored by Wood Brooks confirms that asking more questions is directly correlated with higher likability.</p>
