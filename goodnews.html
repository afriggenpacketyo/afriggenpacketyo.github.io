        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following another cruciate ligament tear for German footballer Lena Oberdorf, this article explains the common sports injury, which disproportionately affects female athletes. The cruciate ligaments stabilize the knee joint, and ruptures often occur from non-contact movements like sudden stops or changes in direction. Treatment can be surgical or conservative, but both require extensive rehabilitation, typically lasting six to nine months before a return to competitive sports. The injury carries long-term risks, such as osteoarthritis, due to altered joint mechanics.</p>

          <p>A 49-year-old man was arrested at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after his family alerted police to his social media posts threatening a mass shooting. The suspect, identified as a felon with mental health issues, was taken into custody unarmed inside the terminal. Police later found an AR-15 rifle with ammunition in his truck parked outside, stating they believe he was returning to retrieve it when he was apprehended. Authorities credited the family's quick action and inter-agency collaboration with preventing a tragedy at the world's busiest airport.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi, a 64-year-old staunch conservative, has been elected as Japan's first female prime minister by the country's parliament. As leader of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), she secured a majority after a last-minute deal with an opposition party. Takaichi, an admirer of Margaret Thatcher, takes office at a time of economic difficulty, including rising living costs and public frustration with the LDP. Her appointment is seen as historic, though some are skeptical of her traditional views on issues like same-sex marriage.</p>

          <p>Myanmar's military conducted a major raid on KK Park, a well-known cybercrime hub near the Thai border, detaining 2,198 individuals. These centers are infamous for luring workers under false pretenses and forcing them into online scam operations that target people globally. During the operation, authorities also seized dozens of unlicensed Starlink satellite internet terminals used by the facility. The military government has accused the Karen National Union, an armed ethnic group, of involvement in the scam operations, a claim the group denies.</p>

          <p>The recent massive Amazon Web Services (AWS) outage that affected thousands of companies was caused by a Domain Name System (DNS) error. DNS acts as the internet's address book, translating domain names into IP addresses, and when it fails, traffic cannot be directed to websites and services. The issue originated in AWS's oldest and largest data center in northern Virginia. Experts note that this common but disruptive error illustrates the risks of the internet's heavy reliance on a few dominant cloud service providers like AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.</p>
