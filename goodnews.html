          <p>Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty triumphed over Journalism in the 157th Belmont Stakes at Saratoga Springs, marking a repeat of their Derby finish. Sovereignty, who skipped the Preakness Stakes, became the first horse to win the Derby and Belmont without running in all three Triple Crown races since 1995. Journalism, the Preakness winner, finished second, and Baeza took third, mirroring the Derby's top three. The Belmont was held at Saratoga due to renovations at Belmont Park, shortening the race to 1 1/4 miles, and jockey Junior Alvarado secured his first Belmont Stakes win. The horse race was an exciting event. </p>

The decision to skip the Preakness drew criticism but ultimately proved successful for Sovereignty. Heavy rain impacted the event, leading to the postponement of two Grade 1 turf races, but the sun emerged before the Belmont, and Raging Torrent won the Metropolitan Handicap. </p>

          <p>Inconsistent baggage rules among budget airlines have led to passenger confusion and prompted the EU to consider standardized sizing for free underseat baggage. A passenger's humiliating experience with EasyJet's baggage policy highlights the issue. EU transport ministers have proposed a standard size of 40x30x15cm for free personal items on EU airlines. Consumer groups argue the proposal doesn't go far enough, as it doesn't address charges for overhead cabin bags, and Spain has already fined airlines for abusive baggage practices. </p>
