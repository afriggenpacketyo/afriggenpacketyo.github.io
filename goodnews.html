          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and television presenter Lauren Sanchez celebrated their wedding with a lavish, multi-day event in Venice, attracting numerous A-list celebrities, reality stars, and royals. The festivities, estimated to cost between $20 million and $50 million, included a ceremony on the island of San Giorgio and a large party planned at a former medieval shipyard. The high-profile event also drew protests from various groups in Venice, ranging from locals concerned about over-tourism to climate change activists.</p>

          <p>The New York Islanders selected 17-year-old defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the first overall pick in the NHL draft during a poignant ceremony. Schaefer, an exceptional puck-moving blueliner from the Erie Otters, endured the death of his mother from cancer just 16 months ago. In an emotional moment, he kissed a pink ribbon patch the Islanders had added to his jersey in her honor. The selection marks a significant moment for both the player, who is lauded for his on-ice talent and personal resilience, and the franchise, which used its first No. 1 pick since 2009.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a decisive 54-7 win against the Western Force in Perth, scoring eight tries in front of a record crowd. Despite a competitive first half where the Force controlled possession, the Lions' clinical finishing gave them a 21-7 lead at halftime. The tourists dominated the second half, though the victory was marred by a worrying hamstring injury to scrum-half Tomos Williams, who had scored two tries. The comprehensive win provides a strong start, but Williams' potential absence is a significant concern for the team.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Zohran Mamdani's Mayoral Primary Victory Is Attributed to the Palestinian Protest Movement</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary was significantly fueled by the grassroots Palestinian liberation movement. The author contends that Mamdani's unapologetic support for Palestine, once a political liability, has become a central issue in domestic politics due to widespread activism and shifting public opinion. The campaign's success is credited not just to a progressive platform, but to the organized efforts of activists and groups like Jewish Voice for Peace. It suggests the win is a referendum on the Democratic establishment's pro-Israel stance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stablecoins are transitioning from a niche cryptocurrency segment to a mainstream financial tool, with major corporations like Visa, Mastercard, and JPMorgan launching their own tokens. These firms see stablecoins as a way to significantly reduce transaction fees and enable instantaneous, 24/7 payment settlements. This corporate adoption is supported by growing regulatory clarity, such as the Senate's GENIUS Act, which provides a framework for consumer protection and reserve requirements. The trend indicates a broader "utility phase" for blockchain technology, where it becomes an underlying infrastructure layer for moving value in the global economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP), a local coalition, is working to uncover and memorialize the history of racial lynchings in their region. The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. By collecting soil from lynching sites and placing markers, the EKRP aims to confront a painful and often ignored part of local history. The project is seen by its members as a vital act of remembrance and resistance, especially amid current political climates.</p>

          <p>In an unusual business move, Trader Joe's has opened a new, larger store in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, located directly across the street from one of its existing, smaller locations. The original plan was to close the older store, which has been open since 1973, but the company ultimately decided to keep both operating. The new store is about 40% bigger and features a spacious underground parking garage, a major draw for customers. While some customers have quickly switched, others remain loyal to the "cozier" original store.</p>

          <p>In a historic reversal of its post-World War II stance, Germany is planning a massive increase in defense spending with the goal of creating Europe's strongest military. Spurred by a new Trump presidency and the war in Ukraine, the German government will amend its constitution to allow for significant borrowing to fund the military, aiming to spend 3.5% of its GDP on defense. This dramatic policy shift, which will involve nearly $400 billion in defense spending through 2029, is seen as a response to demands from NATO partners and a new sense of urgency regarding European security.</p>
