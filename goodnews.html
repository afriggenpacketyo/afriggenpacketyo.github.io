          <h2>Trump Announces Plans to Lower Drug Costs by Matching International Prices</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced an executive order to lower medication costs in the U.S. by tying them to the lowest prices paid by other economically advanced countries, an idea he dubs the "most favored nation" pricing model. This plan, aimed at Medicare medications administered in doctor's offices, seeks to address the longstanding issue of high drug prices in the U.S. compared to other nations. However, the proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could stifle innovation and research. The industry unsuccessfully fought a similar effort during Trump's first term, and legal challenges are anticipated, though Trump insists he will do the right thing.</p>

          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Geneva, reporting "substantial progress" in easing trade tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng both indicated positive outcomes, with plans for a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials from both countries. This meeting is the first since President Trump escalated tariffs on Chinese imports, leading to retaliatory measures. While details remain scarce, the talks have raised investors' hopes for a reduction in tariffs, though analysts caution against over-optimism, emphasizing that significant details are still needed before any decisions are made.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to the spread of the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the decision, citing the need to protect the U.S. livestock industry. The USDA said the screwworm has been detected in remote farms in Mexico, approximately 700 miles from the U.S. border. The suspension will continue on a month-to-month basis until containment is achieved, with the USDA emphasizing that the measure is about food and animal safety, not politics.</p>

Yao also highlights potential demands from the U.S. in negotiations, such as China buying more American goods, including farm products and Boeing planes. He underscores that confrontation is not the goal, but rather a means to return to serious negotiations and address economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally recognized for its affordability and support for a long-lived population, faces serious strain from a shrinking workforce and aging demographics. This system, which ensures affordable medical care for all residents through capped out-of-pocket costs, is now entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the healthcare system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust, emphasizing the need for measured, long-term debate rather than rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures.

This decision, driven by secret deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers, will force many Americans to switch medications.

          <p>A head-to-head trial comparing the weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy has revealed that Mounjaro is more effective. The trial, involving 750 obese people, showed that Mounjaro led to a 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks, compared to 14% with Wegovy. Researchers suggest that both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those with significant weight to lose. Mounjaro mimics two hormones related to appetite, while Wegovy mimics only one, potentially explaining the difference in effectiveness.</p>

          <p>President Trump confirmed that Hamas will release Israeli American hostage Edan Alexander, hailing it as "monumental news" and "a step taken in good faith". The announcement comes as the U.S. administration works towards a potential ceasefire in Gaza. Trump did not provide any timing on when Alexander is expected to be released. The White House also announced a trade deal with China, though China has yet to confirm.</p>

          <h2>U.S. Suspends Importation of Live Cattle from Mexico Due to Screwworm Pest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 19:38:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States will suspend imports of live cattle through ports along the southern border with Mexico for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy in the fight against the screwworm. Secretary Brooke Rollins said the screwworm was recently detected in remote farms about 700 miles away from the U.S. border. The U.S. restricted Mexican cattle shipments in late November but lifted the ban in February after protocols were put in place to evaluate the animals prior to entry into the country. The recent announcement comes after an "unacceptable northward advancement" of the screwworm.</p>
