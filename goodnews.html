          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead flourishing in Asia. He argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. In his view, while the U.S. appears to be withdrawing, globalisation is becoming more regional and fragmented, with Asia at its center. Goldin also emphasizes that the benefits of interconnectedness are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also manifestations of a globalized world and must be managed accordingly.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz captured his second US Open championship and sixth major title overall by defeating rival Jannik Sinner in a four-set final. The 22-year-old Spaniard's dominant performance included brilliant serving and a varied offensive strategy that kept the world No. 1 off balance. With this victory, Alcaraz will reclaim the top ranking from Sinner and becomes the second-youngest man in the Open era to win six Grand Slam titles. The match, delayed due to security for President Trump's attendance, concluded a season where the two players faced each other in three of the four major finals, with Alcaraz now leading their head-to-head series.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that while President Donald Trump dominates the news cycle, his actions have been largely irrelevant for long-term stock market investors. He points to the weak August jobs report as an event wrongly attributed to Trump, suggesting that factors like the winding down of government stimulus and the administration's culture wars are more significant drivers of employment trends. Cramer notes that while tariffs create winners and losers among retailers, they haven't spurred job growth. He concludes that investors are better served by focusing on company fundamentals and conference calls rather than reacting to the president's daily pronouncements. (not investment advice)</p>

The plan includes five new Defence Growth Deals targeting specific regions, such as making Plymouth a center for marine autonomy and South Yorkshire a hub for advanced materials. The government anticipates that this long-term investment could create up to 50,000 new skilled jobs by 2035. The strategy is also a response to evolving global threats, aiming to enhance the UK's industrial capacity and national security as defense spending is projected to increase.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong is experiencing a significant economic comeback, marked by a surge in tourism, bustling conventions, and a booming IPO market. The city appears to be benefiting from its unique position between China and the West, attracting diverse events like a recent Bitcoin conference featuring Eric Trump. However, to sustain this momentum, Hong Kong must navigate the challenge of integrating with mainland China's economy while preserving its distinct international financial identity. The author suggests Beijing should encourage foreign engagement and support the city's role as a hub for multilateral institutions to cement its global standing.</p>

          <p>California is experiencing an unusual weather pattern, with temperatures expected to drop 5 to 15 degrees below normal across much of the state. Coastal areas, including Los Angeles and the Bay Area, are forecast to see chilly breezes, thick fog, and a chance of scattered showers this week. This cool spell is a stark contrast to the typical post-Labor Day heat and follows the Bay Area's coldest summer in decades. The shift is caused by an upper-level low-pressure system from the Pacific, while far Northern California continues to face monsoonal conditions that have sparked lightning-induced wildfires.</p>

Germany's performance improved significantly after halftime, with Nadiem Amiri changing the game's tempo and Florian Wirtz sealing the win with a world-class free kick.

          <p>A total lunar eclipse captivated observers around the world, creating a phenomenon commonly known as a "Blood Moon." This celestial event occurs when the Moon passes directly through the Earth's darkest shadow, or umbra, causing it to take on a distinct reddish hue. The coloration is the result of sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere and refracting onto the lunar surface. The full eclipse was visible in its entirety from numerous countries, providing a striking and widely observed astronomical display for sky-gazers.</p>

          <p>Young English cricketer Jacob Bethell scored his first professional century in a one-day international against South Africa, a milestone that may complicate selection decisions for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia. Despite being highly rated, the 21-year-old's lack of a hundred was a notable gap in his resume. Bethell's aggressive, free-scoring style is well-suited for Australian pitches, but some analysts, including former captain Alastair Cook, remain unconvinced of his red-ball credentials. While England's management has shown faith by keeping him with the senior squad, his recent performance in white-ball cricket strengthens his case for a spot in the Test team.</p>

Hassett emphasized that history shows political control over central banks often leads to inflation and economic misery. This discussion occurs amid concerns about White House influence over the Fed, as President Trump has frequently pressured current Chair Jerome Powell to cut interest rates and has sought to place close aides on the board of governors.

The team's decision to restore the original order, despite Piastri's initial confusion, was praised as an example of the fair and principled culture instilled by team principal Andrea Stella. Although the strategy that created the situation was questionable, both drivers ultimately accepted the outcome, emphasizing their commitment to the team's long-term success over individual gain in their ongoing title fight.
