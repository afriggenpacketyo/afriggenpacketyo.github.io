        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, securing access to valuable oil assets in Guyana. The deal proceeded after an International Chamber of Commerce ruling defeated Exxon Mobil's claim of first refusal rights over Hess's stake in the Stabroek Block. Chevron CEO Mike Wirth expressed satisfaction with the outcome, which affirms that asset-level rights do not typically apply to corporate mergers. The acquisition had faced uncertainty, and its completion is seen as a major strategic victory for Chevron in the energy sector.</p>

          <p>Dr. Scott Jensen, a former Minnesota state senator, has announced he will again seek the Republican nomination for governor. Jensen previously lost the 2022 gubernatorial race to the incumbent Democrat, Governor Tim Walz. In his campaign announcement, Jensen criticized the effects of what he termed "liberal policies" on the state's economy and safety. Governor Walz is eligible to run for a third term, as Minnesota does not have gubernatorial term limits, setting the stage for a potential rematch.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest University of Michigan Survey of Consumers indicates that consumer expectations for inflation have fallen to their lowest levels since before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5% in the previous month, while the five-year forecast also declined. This suggests that consumers believe the price increases caused by tariffs will be temporary. Despite this improved outlook, overall consumer sentiment remains below its long-term average, reflecting continued wariness about the economy's future direction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite leading the National League, the Los Angeles Dodgers confront significant challenges as they begin the second half of the season. Key questions revolve around the health of their pitching staff, particularly the ability to keep starters like Tyler Glasnow and Blake Snell on the field. Another major uncertainty is how the team will manage Shohei Ohtani's return to pitching and whether he can handle a full starter's workload. The team also needs its star hitters, Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, to overcome recent slumps to ensure the offense performs at its full potential.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores how retirees on fixed Social Security incomes can qualify for credit card debt relief. While being on Social Security does not disqualify individuals, options may differ from those for wage earners due to the nature of their income. Debt management plans, which consolidate payments and lower interest rates, are often a suitable choice. Other options like debt settlement or credit card hardship programs may also be viable, though debt consolidation loans can be harder to secure. The key is finding a strategy that aligns with a fixed income to manage debt without risking essential benefits.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are distinguishing themselves from other carriers, capturing over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. airlines last year. Analysts attribute their success to strong networks and a strategic focus on premium travel and loyalty programs, which provide a buffer against market challenges like falling domestic airfares. While the industry faces headwinds from overcapacity in coach class, both airlines have pointed to the strength of their premium cabins and international routes. This segmentation allows them to maintain profitability even as competitors struggle in a difficult market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the life and work of Andrea Gibson, the late poet laureate of Colorado, who passed away on Monday. Gibson was celebrated for their intensely confessional and emotional spoken-word poetry, which they shared widely online and on platforms like Instagram. Their work often focused on themes of love, anxiety, and queerness with a straightforward and accessible style that resonated with a broad audience beyond traditional poetry readers. By prioritizing a direct connection with listeners, Gibson built a large following and used their platform to spread a message of empathy and gentleness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office has reduced its spending on hotels for asylum seekers by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. This cost saving is attributed to moving asylum seekers into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and renegotiating contracts. An increase in room-sharing within the remaining hotels has also helped lower the per-person cost. However, an expert from the Migration Observatory warns that a recent surge in small boat crossings could reverse this trend and lead to a renewed need for hotel placements.</p>

          <p>Following a significant 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, analysts are coming to its defense, with Jefferies upgrading the stock to a "buy" rating. The sell-off was triggered by a slight reduction in the company's growth outlook, which analysts and the CEO have called an "overreaction." They argue the headwind, related to a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business in China, is temporary. The consensus among these analysts is that the company's fundamentals remain strong, with potential for accelerated growth in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have identified a previously unknown type of cell in the intestines of Burmese pythons that enables them to completely digest the bones of their prey. This discovery explains how the invasive snakes can consume large animals, such as deer, and leave no skeletal remains behind. The specialized cells manage the massive influx of calcium from the bones, preventing it from overwhelming the snake's system. This unique biological adaptation has also been found in other constrictor snakes and the Gila monster, offering new insights into the physiology of these reptiles.</p>

          <p>A 55-year-old woman from Corby, England, discovered she had a brain tumor after a routine eye test revealed vision problems not caused by an issue within the eye itself. An MRI scan confirmed a meningioma was pressing on her optic nerve. During follow-up testing just months later, she received a second shocking diagnosis of breast cancer. After successfully undergoing a mastectomy and radiotherapy, she had surgery to remove the non-cancerous brain tumor. Her story highlights the critical importance of regular health screenings, as they can lead to the early detection of serious underlying conditions.</p>
