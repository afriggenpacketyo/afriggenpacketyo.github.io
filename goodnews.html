          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not raised during recent talks with U.S. officials in Washington. Trump announced the tariff increase on social media, citing national security, and the new rate is set to take effect on Wednesday. Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to discuss the outcome of the talks and was instructed to continue negotiations with the U.S. with the goal of reaching an agreement. The Japanese government is closely monitoring the specific details of the measures to be revealed by the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese research team has identified Yunnan province as a key origin point for the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies a long-speculated hypothesis about the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. Scientists analyzed genetic data and found that a portion of the Tibetan Plateau population's genetic makeup originates from an archaeological site in central Yunnan. This discovery fills a crucial gap in understanding the prehistoric populations of East and Southeast Asia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the need to fight for a new social contract that lifts from the bottom of society, drawing lessons from past poor people's movements. It highlights the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), led by poor Black women. The NWRO championed "welfare as a right" and demanded a "guaranteed adequate income," challenging the notion that a person's value is tied to their ability to work. The article suggests that the Johnnie Tillmon model of grassroots organizing can transform growing indignation into lasting power.</p>

While airplane windows block most UVB rays, they don't fully block UVA rays, which can cause premature aging and skin cancer.
