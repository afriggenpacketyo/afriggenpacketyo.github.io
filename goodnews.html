          <p>Germany is set to establish a parliamentary commission to review its government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, aiming to rebuild public trust and learn lessons for future crises. The inquiry comes as former Health Minister Jens Spahn faces scrutiny for allegedly misusing public funds in a large-scale face mask procurement, potentially costing taxpayers billions. Lawmakers and health professionals support the review, hoping to examine the scientific advisory process, coordination between federal and state governments, and the immense strain placed on healthcare workers. The commission is expected to begin its work after the summer break.</p>

          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three "Rust" crew members against the film's producers, including Alec Baldwin, following the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins. The plaintiffs sought compensation for emotional distress, alleging that producers failed to adhere to industry safety protocols. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. This civil case is separate from the criminal proceedings, which saw armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed convicted of involuntary manslaughter, while a similar charge against Baldwin was dismissed last year.</p>

Participants, including EU officials and MEPs, marched in solidarity to advocate for diversity, equality, and fundamental human rights. They view the government's stance as an attack on civil liberties and an attempt to marginalize the LGBTQ community under the pretext of protecting family values.</p>

          <p>A real estate broker with a decade of experience suggests that prospective homebuyers use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a house is the right fit. This guideline posits that the ideal home will have 80% of the features you love, 10% of things you can improve over time, and 10% of flaws you can live with. The agent emphasizes that no house is perfect and this framework helps buyers evaluate trade-offs logically. To further aid the process, the agent uses a "L.O.V.E. Framework" focusing on Location, Offerings, Value-add potential, and Exit strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The administration also highlighted a peace deal signed between Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

A recent price spike, driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to be temporary now that a ceasefire is in place. Typically, summer gas prices decline as refineries increase production and demand softens after early travel peaks. According to petroleum analyst Patrick De Haan, prices should resume their slow decline, and when adjusted for inflation, they are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>

The movie focuses on the fictional, underdog APX team and the intense internal rivalry between Pitt's character and his younger teammate, played by Damson Idris. Rather than focusing on well-known brands like Ferrari, the film delves into the human drama and complex strategies of the sport, which the director describes as "chess at 200 miles an hour."
