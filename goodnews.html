          <p>The U.S. Air Force has updated its guidance to centralize and standardize separation boards for personnel who no longer meet military requirements, a change that includes those affected by evolving transgender service policies. According to an internal memo, these boards must recommend separation if a member is found to meet the policy's criteria, aiming to create a more uniform disciplinary process. Supporters argue this move enhances military readiness and consistency, aligning with Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's focus on restoring a "warrior ethos" and enforcing stricter physical and medical standards across the armed forces.</p>

          <p>Following an emergency court hearing, the Department of Justice has agreed to reverse its appointment of a new emergency police chief for Washington D.C. and rewrite a directive concerning local cooperation with federal immigration authorities. The city had filed a lawsuit challenging the Trump administration's move to place the Metropolitan Police Department under federal control, which a federal judge signaled was likely an overreach of executive power. This agreement allows D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith to retain command, marking a significant win for local governance against federal intervention.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a separate condominium from the main property. This development comes a year after the city pioneered legislation to allow such sales, aiming to create more accessible and affordable homeownership opportunities. As ADU construction booms across the state, accounting for a significant portion of new housing growth, this for-sale model is being watched as a potential new frontier for creating starter homes and addressing California's persistent housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common dietary advice for diabetics, two new clinical trials in India suggest that consuming mangoes in moderation may actually improve blood sugar control and metabolic health. The studies found that when substituted for an equivalent amount of carbohydrates like white bread, mangoes produced a lower glycemic response and led to improvements in key health markers over time. Researchers emphasize that this is not a license for unlimited consumption, but rather evidence that the fruit can be safely incorporated into a balanced diet under clinical supervision.</p>
