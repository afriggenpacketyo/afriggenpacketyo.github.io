          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank's program of reducing its bond holdings, known as quantitative tightening, may soon conclude. Speaking at a conference, Powell noted that the Fed is approaching its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks, suggesting the balance sheet runoff could stop in the coming months. He defended the practice of paying interest on bank reserves as crucial for controlling monetary policy. However, Powell remained noncommittal on the future direction of interest rates, citing a softer labor market and the need to navigate risks to both employment and inflation.

          <p>Maggie Kang, the co-director and creator of the animated Netflix hit “KPop Demon Hunters,” has expressed interest in exploring more stories within the film's universe, but strictly in animated form. In a recent interview, Kang stated that while nothing is officially in development, a live-action version would not work because it would feel "too grounded" and lose the unique comedic tone of the original. Co-director Chris Appelhans agreed, emphasizing that the joy of animation is its ability to elevate what's possible with the characters. The film follows a K-pop group that secretly fights demons.</p>

          <p>Former player Kevin Muscat is reportedly the leading candidate to become the new manager of the Scottish Premiership club Rangers, following the departure of Russell Martin. Muscat, an Australian currently managing Shanghai Port in China, has had discussions with the club. If appointed, he would likely not be available until the conclusion of the Chinese league season in late November, with Neil McCann potentially serving as interim manager. Muscat has a successful managerial record, having won league titles in Australia, Japan, and China, and previously played for Rangers during their 2002-03 treble-winning season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones regarding the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. This decision leaves the record-breaking financial penalty in place. Jones was found liable for damages after repeatedly claiming the massacre was a hoax, leading to years of harassment and threats against the victims' families. His lawyers had argued to the court that the massive sum could never be paid, but the court's refusal to hear the case finalizes the judgment from the Connecticut trial.</p>
