          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, a move that further aligns the country with U.S. trade policy amid rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC, along with their subsidiaries, on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List." This action requires domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to these entities. This is likely aimed at reinforcing existing policies and tightening loopholes, as both companies are already on a U.S. trade blacklist and subject to export restrictions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is set to return to the mound Monday against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB pitching appearance since August 2023. Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery following that season and has been focused on his recovery. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed his excitement and said that Ohtani is eager to return to pitching, which has been expedited due to bullpen injuries. This is an exciting development for Dodgers fans, as Ohtani's potential as a two-way player is highly anticipated.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos, an Australian oil and gas producer, surged over 15% following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion by a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer price of AU$8.89 per share represents a significant premium over the company's previous closing price. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend that shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, assuming no superior proposal emerges. This takeover bid comes as XRG, ADNOC's investment arm, seeks deals in the natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive industrial data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers. The government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027. Japanese companies are being prompted to work with partners to exchange cyber threat information and adopt basic practices to improve their cyber defenses. NEC Corp. is using AI to combat cyberattacks and aims to elevate Japan's online safety to a level on par with the United States.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, boosted by government subsidies and online shopping events. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, exceeding analysts' estimates. This growth is attributed to the consumer goods trade-in program, a surge in online shopping, and an increase in foreign tourists. However, industrial output slowed, and property prices continued to decline, which could dampen consumer sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, as gambling with overseas-based betting sites is a crime in Japan. The government is addressing the issue by urging the operators to cut off access to their sites, many of which are provided in Japanese. A police survey estimated that over 3 million people in the country have gambled online. Japan is also expected to enact a law to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites.</p>

          <p>China's economy showed mixed signals in May, with retail sales growing at 6.4% despite the pressure of US tariffs on manufacturing and exports. The retail sales data exceeded expectations, driven by government subsidies and the upcoming June 18 online shopping festival. However, other economic indicators, such as manufacturing and exports, continue to be affected by trade tensions with the United States. Despite the challenges, the retail sales growth suggests that domestic consumption is picking up in China.</p>
