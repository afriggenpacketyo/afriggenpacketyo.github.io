          <p>Shares of Canada Goose surged 20% after the company reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that beat estimates, although it withdrew its fiscal 2026 outlook due to macroeconomic uncertainty. The luxury retailer cited dynamic consumer spending patterns and the unpredictable global trade environment as reasons for not providing a financial outlook. Despite this, Canada Goose expressed confidence in its brand strength, financial position, and ability to adapt to changing conditions. The company's revenue increased by 7.4% year-over-year, with net income attributable to shareholders rising significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving COVID-19 vaccine updates for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require major clinical trials before approving them for wider use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. Vaccine manufacturers will need to conduct randomized, placebo-controlled trials before the FDA approves future applications for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old. This new regulatory framework comes ahead of a key meeting to decide on how to update the strain used in next season's shots.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) indicates that five-day in-office mandates are outdated, highlighting the benefits of telework for productivity, culture, and resilience. The report reveals that telework offers clear advantages when leaders embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking, and available regulatory guidance. Companies ignoring these insights risk talent attrition, rising costs, and reduced agility in an era that demands adaptability. Flexibility is now a key driver for talent acquisition and retention, with remote work removing geographic barriers for candidates facing caregiving, disabilities, or rural isolation.</p>
