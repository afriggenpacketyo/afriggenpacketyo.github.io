          <p>In a symbolic "passing of the torch" moment, Cody Rhodes defeated John Cena in a street fight to reclaim the Undisputed WWE Championship at SummerSlam. The match, held at MetLife Stadium, was a violent and dramatic affair, featuring multiple signature moves and the use of foreign objects. After a grueling back-and-forth battle that saw both competitors push their limits, Rhodes ultimately secured the victory with three Cross Rhodes finishers. The event concluded with Cena acknowledging the crowd, signaling a potential end to his era while cementing Rhodes's position at the top.</p>

          <p>Chinese biotechnology companies Innovent and BeOne are projected to achieve profitability in 2025, marking a significant milestone for the country's biotech startup sector. Innovent, which went public in 2018 under a Hong Kong rule allowing pre-profit companies to list, is expected to see substantial revenue from its new weight-loss drug, mazdutide. This development signals a maturation of the Chinese biotech industry, suggesting that leading firms are becoming financially self-sufficient and are no longer solely reliant on investor funding to operate and grow.

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Propose Drone Upgrade Inspired by Ukraine War Tactics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-03 21:00:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drawing lessons from the war in Ukraine, a team of Chinese aerospace engineers has proposed a new technology to dramatically improve drone survivability against missile attacks. The concept involves fitting small drones with side-mounted rocket boosters that can execute high-G, last-second maneuvers to evade incoming projectiles. According to digital simulations published in a Chinese defense journal, this "terminal evasion" system could increase a drone's survival rate to nearly 90 percent. This innovation reflects a direct response to battlefield data showing that improved air defenses are becoming more effective at neutralizing unmanned aerial vehicles.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Cuba and the UK have initiated a project to save the endangered Polymita tree snails, renowned for their vibrantly colored and intricately patterned shells. This beauty has unfortunately made them a target for the illegal shell trade, which is driving the six known species toward extinction. The conservation effort aims to establish a captive breeding program and conduct genetic research to understand the snails' unique evolutionary traits. While international laws protect the snails, enforcement is difficult, and the illegal collection of their shells remains a primary threat to their survival in their native Cuban forests.</p>

          <p>In a world-first public health initiative, sexual health clinics across the UK have begun administering a vaccine to combat record-high levels of gonorrhoea. The jab, originally developed for meningitis B, is being offered first to high-risk groups, primarily gay and bisexual men with a history of multiple sexual partners. With over 85,000 cases recorded in 2023, health officials hope the vaccine, which is 30-40% effective, will prevent up to 100,000 new infections over the next decade. The move is also aimed at slowing the spread of antibiotic-resistant strains of the bacterial infection.</p>

          <p>Personal finance personality Dave Ramsey recently asserted that people are not broke due to insufficient income, but because they allocate their earnings to others through debt. He identified credit card bills, car payments, and student loans as the primary culprits keeping Americans in a cycle of living paycheck to paycheck. Ramsey's advice is to treat income as the most powerful wealth-building tool by creating a zero-based budget and aggressively eliminating debt. He emphasized that financial freedom is achieved by controlling where money goes, rather than financing a lifestyle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>May Davis Mailman, a longtime insider of the Trump administration, has left her position as deputy assistant to the president and senior policy strategist. Serving through the entire first term and the beginning of the second, Mailman was considered a seasoned official who helped establish the inner workings of the second Trump White House. She is reportedly starting her own government affairs firm but will continue as a special government employee to finalize some policy projects. Her departure marks one of the highest-ranking voluntary exits from the administration's second term so far.</p>

          <h2>Egg Freezing's Growing Popularity Raises Hopes and Questions About Cost and Success</h2>

          <p>The practice of egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity among American women seeking to preserve their fertility, with some viewing it as revolutionary as the birth control pill. The procedure allows women to freeze their eggs at a younger age, providing an "insurance policy" against future fertility decline and reducing the pressure to have children before they are ready. However, the process is expensive, often costing over $12,000 per cycle plus storage fees, and is not a guarantee of a future baby. Bioethicists caution that it is a gamble and raises societal questions about delaying motherhood.</p>

          <p>Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google DeepMind, predicts that artificial intelligence is on an exponential curve of progress and could achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) within the next decade. He believes AI will revolutionize human health, potentially curing all diseases, and could lead to an era of "radical abundance" by eliminating scarcity. Hassabis also acknowledges the significant risks, including misuse by bad actors and the challenge of ensuring advanced AI remains aligned with human values. He stresses the need for international coordination and robust safety guardrails as these powerful systems are developed and integrated into daily life.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing the pilot to declare an emergency. The pilot of the Boeing 787 issued a "mayday, mayday, mayday" call to air traffic control while ascending to 10,000 feet, reporting a failure in the left engine. The aircraft safely returned to Dulles, where it was met by emergency crews. All 219 passengers and 11 crew members deplaned without injury, and the airline arranged for alternate travel to their destination.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume miles into the sky. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful magnitude 8.8 earthquake shook the region. Seismologists suggest the volcanic activity could be linked to the quake, as the seismic waves may have disturbed the magma system of a volcano that was already near eruption. The event prompted an aviation alert, but the sparsely populated area is not under direct threat, and reserve employees have been evacuated as a precaution.</p>

          <p>Following Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, a unique national security agreement gives the U.S. government significant oversight, which President Trump has termed a "golden share." This arrangement, negotiated by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), grants the president veto power over major operational changes, such as factory closures or salary reductions. While not a literal equity stake, it represents an expansion of CFIUS's role into broader economic security, reflecting a trend of increased government intervention in deals with national strategic importance.
