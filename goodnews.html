          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has reaffirmed China's commitment to expanding its advanced manufacturing capabilities, potentially setting the stage for conflict with President Trump's trade agenda. Trump seeks to boost domestic production of high-tech products and address trade imbalances with China, while Xi emphasizes self-reliance in manufacturing. Experts suggest that China is unlikely to scale back its manufacturing-led strategy, which is closely tied to its goal of self-reliance. China's "Made in China 2025" plan aims to transform the country into a leading high-end manufacturer, but it has faced criticism for distorting competition and missing key targets.</p>

The company's data center revenues increased significantly, fueled by the ramp-up of the new Blackwell superchip.

          <p>Harrison Ruffin Tyler, the last living grandson of the 10th U.S. President John Tyler, has passed away at the age of 96, marking the end of a unique connection to a bygone era of American history. President Tyler, born in 1790, served from 1841 to 1845, well before the Civil War, and his descendants lived into the modern age due to late second marriages to younger wives. Harrison Ruffin Tyler co-founded ChemTreat, an industrial water treatment company, and was passionate about preserving history in his native Charles City County, Virginia, including Sherwood Forest, President Tyler's home, and Fort Pocahontas.</p>

He acknowledged the plane is currently being refitted for military standard, though he is uncertain of the costs associated with this process. Trump also criticized Boeing for delays in replacing the current Air Force One jet, leading to the expedited replacement from Qatar.</p>

He mentioned that the company is taking a multibillion-dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed due to the restrictions. Despite the challenges, Nvidia reported strong quarterly results, with 69% year-over-year revenue growth, driven by the demand for its AI chips. The Trump administration had informed Nvidia that its previously approved H20 processor for China would require an export license, effectively cutting off sales.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lifted a key planning restriction requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property, aiming to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon technology. This change, part of the Warm Homes Plan, could make heat pump installations easier for millions of homes in England, particularly terraced houses. Consumer groups, however, caution that the changes will not help renters or leaseholders, and the high upfront costs remain a significant barrier. The government aims to upgrade 300,000 households to improve energy efficiency and lower bills through the Warm Homes Plan.</p>
