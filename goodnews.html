        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to new research from Vanguard, having at least $2,000 in an emergency savings account is the top predictor of financial well-being, increasing it by 21%, compared to a 12% increase from a $500,000 income and 18% from $1 million in assets. The study found that people with $2,000 in emergency savings spend approximately two hours less each week worrying about their finances. Behavioral economist Paulo Costa emphasizes the importance of readily available funds for unexpected expenses, contrasting this with retirement assets that have withdrawal restrictions and penalties. The article notes that saving even small amounts regularly can help build an emergency fund, but also acknowledges that obtaining $2,000 may be difficult for low-income individuals.

The festival also highlights artistic friendships, such as the collaboration between Nils M√∂nkemeyer and William Youn, who commissioned a new piece by Manfred Trojahn for the event. The festival aims to dispel clich√©s, such as the rivalry between Mozart and Salieri, and to explore the role of music as a medium of friendship.</p>

          <p>Hawaii will increase taxes on hotel rooms and vacation rentals to raise funds for addressing the climate crisis, becoming the first government in the U.S. to impose such a levy. The tax is expected to generate nearly $100 million annually, which will be used for projects such as replenishing Waikiki beaches, promoting hurricane clips for roofs, and clearing flammable grasses. The measure adds an additional 0.75% to the daily room rate tax and levies a new 11% tax on cruise ship bills. With the new law, visitors will pay nearly 19% on their accommodations, but the governor believes tourists will welcome committing dollars to protect the environment.</p>

GE Vernova's stock closed at an all-time high for the sixth consecutive session, while Eaton and Vertiv have yet to return to pre-DeepSeek levels. Analyst Julian Mitchell attributes GE Vernova's success to being earlier in a potential upcycle for revenue and orders, with a larger backlog compared to its competitors. Recent deals, such as the $14.2 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia and Trump's support for the U.S. nuclear power industry, have also contributed to GE Vernova's surge. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest pursuing credit card debt forgiveness this June due to high interest rates and the slow decline of credit card rates. With the average credit card interest rate well over 21% and overall balances totaling $1.18 trillion, consumers may find debt forgiveness a viable option. It's recommended to start the process sooner rather than later, as it can take 24 to 48 months to complete, and delaying increases the compounding interest. Credit card debt forgiveness is also considered less damaging to credit scores compared to defaulting or filing for bankruptcy. (not investment advice)</p>
