          <p>Paramount has announced its acquisition of the news site The Free Press and has named its co-founder, Bari Weiss, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Weiss, a former editor at The New York Times and a prominent critic of legacy media, will shape the network's editorial direction as it aims to broaden its appeal. The move is part of a larger strategy by Paramount's new owner, Skydance Media, to embrace a wider range of ideological viewpoints. The Free Press, known for its anti-"woke" stance and pro-Israel views, will retain its brand while Weiss takes on her new role at the major news network.</p>

          <p>Firefly Aerospace has announced its acquisition of defense technology contractor SciTec in a deal valued at $855 million, consisting of cash and stock. The move is intended to bolster Firefly's national security offerings by integrating SciTec's software capabilities, particularly in missile warning, tracking, and defense systems. This acquisition follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test that caused Firefly's stock to dip, though the company's shares gained 5% following the announcement. The deal underscores Firefly's strategy to expand its role in the national security space, building on existing contracts with partners like NASA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Home Equity Requirements for a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-06 15:11:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For senior homeowners, a reverse mortgage can be a way to access funds in retirement, but specific equity requirements apply. Most lenders offering Home Equity Conversion Mortgages (HECMs) require homeowners to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property to qualify. The actual amount that can be borrowed, however, depends on other factors like the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits, not just the equity percentage. For those who don't meet the threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting to build more equity, or considering a HECM for Purchase to downsize into a new home.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from Ghislaine Maxwell, upholding her 20-year prison sentence for sex-trafficking. The court did not provide an explanation for its decision, effectively ending her primary legal path to overturn the conviction. Maxwell was found guilty in 2021 for her role in recruiting and grooming underage girls for abuse by the late financier Jeffrey Epstein between 1994 and 2004. Her legal team expressed disappointment but stated they would continue to explore other legal options, while family members of a victim expressed relief and commitment to ensuring she serves her full sentence.</p>

The article notes that modern AI data centers require significantly more fiber optic content than previous generations, driving strong demand for Corning's products. The company also benefits from a major partnership with Apple, producing cover glass for its devices.

In a post, Feldman said the business has changed significantly since its initial filing a year ago and the company wants to refile with updated financial and strategic information. He noted a recent $1.1 billion funding round at an $8.1 billion valuation, which included new investors not named in the original prospectus. The company has expanded from producing large-scale AI chips to also operating a cloud business for AI models, and it needs to update its filing to reflect this evolution.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in the early stages of discussing a financial aid package of over $10 billion for U.S. farmers. The relief would primarily target soybean farmers, who have been severely impacted by China's boycott of American soybeans amidst ongoing trade disputes. A top White House economic adviser confirmed that meetings have been held to address the situation, promising that "big measures" would be announced soon. In 2024, China purchased $12.6 billion in U.S. soybeans, but as of the current harvest season, it has made no purchases, leaving farmers with full silos and mounting financial pressure.

Under UK takeover regulations, this rejection required Earick's group to either make a formal offer by October 24 or announce they would not proceed. The decision to withdraw was confirmed in a statement to the London Stock Exchange, officially ending the offer period and speculation about a potential sale.</p>
