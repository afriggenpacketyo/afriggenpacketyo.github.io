          <p>An alleged leader of Italy's powerful 'ndrangheta mafia, identified as Giuseppe Palermo, has been arrested in Colombia. Palermo was wanted under an Interpol red notice for allegedly overseeing significant cocaine shipments from Latin America to Europe. The coordinated operation involved Colombian, Italian, and British authorities, along with Europol. This arrest highlights the global reach of the 'ndrangheta and ongoing international efforts to dismantle its extensive drug trafficking networks, which are a primary source of cocaine entering Europe.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek won her first Wimbledon championship in a commanding performance, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This historic win marked the first "double bagel" in a Wimbledon women's final since 1911, showcasing Swiatek's mastery on what was once considered her weakest surface. The victory gives the 24-year-old Polish star her sixth Grand Slam title and makes her the youngest woman since Serena Williams to win majors on all three surfaces. Anisimova, playing in her first Grand Slam final, struggled with nerves throughout the match.</p>

          <p>Two fathers are initiating a judicial review against the UK government's guidance on smartphones in schools, arguing for a complete ban. They contend that the current policy, which allows headteachers to set their own rules, is unlawful and fails to protect children from dangers like cyberbullying and exposure to harmful content. Citing numerous safeguarding incidents reported by schools, the fathers believe a statutory ban is necessary for child safety. The Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to ban phones and points to the Online Safety Act for broader online protection.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has advised investors to "please own it, don't trade it" regarding Nvidia stock, reinforcing his bullish stance. His comment came as the chipmaker's stock continued to climb after becoming the first company to achieve a $4 trillion market capitalization. The company's massive growth has been fueled by the generative AI boom, and its success has persisted despite geopolitical tensions and U.S. export restrictions on its advanced chips to China. For the current quarter, Nvidia has projected revenue of $45 billion, slightly below some analysts' expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Adolfo Macias, the infamous Ecuadorian drug lord known as "Fito," has consented to be extradited to the United States to face charges of cocaine and weapons smuggling. Macias, head of the powerful "Los Choneros" gang, was recaptured in June after a dramatic prison escape last year that triggered a massive wave of gang violence across Ecuador. His escape and the subsequent government crackdown plunged the nation into a state of "internal armed conflict." This extradition marks a significant step in Ecuador's war on criminal gangs and its cooperation with U.S. law enforcement.</p>

The regulator, Ofcom, will enforce age verification measures, with the power to levy heavy fines for non-compliance. However, the article notes that the debate over the rules' effectiveness is ongoing, as they do not cover risks from peer-to-peer messaging, in-app purchases, or the full scope of AI chatbots.

While NASA's Artemis program still leads on paper with a 2027 target for a crewed landing, it faces significant technical hurdles.
