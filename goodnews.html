          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long battle for justice following the 1979 murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights. Catina was killed by her former boyfriend, Steven Burns, on her first day of college after she attempted to break up with him. The family's experience with the parole system led them to advocate for changes in California law, including allowing victim impact statements at sentencing and ensuring children have support when testifying. Despite Burns' repeated attempts at parole, the Salarno family has consistently fought to keep him behind bars, turning their personal tragedy into a catalyst for broader change.</p>

These cuts would drastically reduce work on HIV and other infectious diseases, potentially reversing the progress made in saving lives and building health systems.
