          <h2>New England Turns to Culinary Innovation to Combat Invasive Green Crabs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 07:00:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New England's seafood industry is adopting an "eat them" strategy to control the population of invasive green crabs, which are harming the shellfish industry and ecosystem. Green crabs, introduced from Europe and West Africa in the 1980s, consume various species, including soft-shell clams. Efforts to eradicate the crabs through state-funded programs have faced challenges due to their high reproduction rate and lack of market demand. However, Sharon St. Ours & Company has found a use for the crabs by creating a crab broth powder, which debuted at the Seafood Expo North America trade show and has garnered interest from the culinary world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new CDC study reveals a dramatic decline in RSV hospitalizations among babies due to widespread availability of a vaccine administered during pregnancy and a monoclonal antibody treatment for infants. Hospitalization rates for babies under seven months decreased by up to 56% compared to pre-pandemic seasons, with newborns experiencing a drop as high as 71%. Emergency physician Heather Auerbach notes fewer critically ill children and lower levels of care needed for those hospitalized. The study suggests increased use of these preventatives could further reduce RSV hospitalizations in infants, marking a significant public health breakthrough.</p>

          <p>European relations minister Nick Thomas-Symonds is advocating for a deal that would allow UK passport holders to use EU e-gates at airports to reduce border queues. This initiative is part of broader negotiations ahead of a UK-EU summit in London, with hopes for agreements on youth mobility and lower food prices. While Thomas-Symonds expresses confidence in reaching a deal on food and easing border congestion, Conservative MP Alex Burghart voices concerns about the UK becoming a "rule taker" by aligning with EU standards. The summit aims to address trade, security, and post-Brexit relations between the UK and EU.</p>

These manuscripts were illegally excavated in 1942 and later gifted to the museum. The repatriation followed diplomatic efforts after the Smithsonian adopted a new ethical returns policy, marking a significant cultural heritage achievement for China.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in Southern California have performed the first human bladder transplant, potentially revolutionizing treatment for debilitating bladder conditions. The procedure, conducted by doctors from UCLA and USC, involved a 41-year-old man who had lost bladder capacity due to cancer treatments. The doctors plan further clinical trials to assess outcomes before expanding its use. This breakthrough could offer a better alternative to current treatments that repurpose bowel tissue, which often lead to complications. While risks remain, such as organ rejection, the initial success marks a significant advancement in transplant medicine.</p>
