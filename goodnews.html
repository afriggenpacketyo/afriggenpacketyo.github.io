          <p>As part of a brand revitalization effort, Hooters is planning to make its famous orange waitress shorts less revealing. The new CEO of Hooters Inc., Neil Kiefer, stated the goal is to shift the uniform's image from risqué to a more approachable "athletic" look, reminiscent of 1980s dolphin shorts. This change comes as the original founding company plans to take over locations from Hooters of America, which recently filed for bankruptcy, aiming to make the chain more comfortable for families and a broader clientele.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix in Monza. However, the race was marked by a controversial team order from McLaren, which instructed Oscar Piastri to let his teammate Lando Norris pass for second place. The decision was made after a slow pit stop, caused by a wheel gun fault, cost Norris his track position, prompting the team to intervene to restore the pre-stop order. The incident has sparked debate about fairness in racing, especially as it impacts the close championship battle.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a 26.4-mile open-ocean route from Catalina Island to the California mainland in a kayak he grew from mycelium, the root network of mushrooms. The 12-hour journey marks a significant achievement in exploring sustainable alternatives to plastics used in aquatic recreation. The boat was created by cultivating a fungal network on a hemp substrate inside a mold, resulting in a durable, buoyant, and biodegradable material. Shoemaker hopes his voyage will inspire further innovation.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive study analyzing data from nearly 15 million people across Denmark, Taiwan, and the United States has revealed a consistent trend of couples sharing the same mental health diagnoses. Researchers examined nine disorders, including depression, anxiety, and ADHD, and found that this pattern of "spousal correlation" has persisted for over 50 years. The findings suggest that individuals with similar psychiatric challenges may be drawn to each other, possibly due to shared understanding, similar environments, or social stigma.</p>
