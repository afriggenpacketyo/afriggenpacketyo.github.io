          <p>Grace Chambers, a 97-year-old from Belfast, has set a new European record by completing her 250th 5k Parkrun. Her achievement is particularly remarkable as it comes just four weeks after she underwent heart surgery. Chambers, a former teacher and a local legend at the Ormeau Parkrun, began running in her late 80s and has since become an inspiration to her community. She expressed her joy at finishing and hopes her story encourages others to take up running, regardless of their age.</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold artifact during her very first archaeological excavation in Northumberland, England. The object, believed to have been used by elites for religious or ceremonial purposes, was found near the route of a major Roman road. This find is significant as it follows a similar discovery in 2021, suggesting the area was used by high-status individuals long after the Roman Empire's fall. The artifact will undergo further analysis before potentially being displayed in a local museum.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with murder rates falling to levels not seen in decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy implemented by Mayor Brandon Scott, which focuses on identifying and offering support to individuals most at risk of becoming perpetrators or victims of violence. The program, which combines social services with targeted law enforcement, has shown impressive results, though officials worry that recent federal funding cuts by the Trump administration could jeopardize its continued progress.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that Americans believe age 27 is the ideal time to start saving for retirement, with a target retirement age of 58. However, financial advisors stress the significant advantages of starting even earlier, citing the power of compound interest to grow savings substantially over time. While younger generations like Gen Z and millennials are beginning to save earlier than their predecessors, many Americans still feel they are behind on their retirement goals. Experts emphasize that the sooner one begins saving, even with small amounts, the larger the potential nest egg will be. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a significant increase in homelessness among Americans aged 55 and older, healthcare organizations are stepping in to provide housing solutions. Groups like the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), funded by Medicare and Medicaid, traditionally aim to keep frail seniors in their homes but are now finding they must first secure housing for their clients. This novel approach reflects a growing recognition that stable housing is a prerequisite for good health, as rising living costs push more seniors into precarious living situations.</p>

          <h2>Great Horned Owl's Recovery Uncertain After Rescue from Glue Trap</h2>

          <p>A great horned owl was rescued in Orange County after becoming stuck in a glue trap, a device intended for rodents. A well-meaning individual cut the owl's wings to free it, but this action has severely hampered its rehabilitation, as bird feathers do not regrow when cut. Wildlife experts are now working to remove the remaining glue and hope the owl can regrow its feathers within a year, but its long-term release back into the wild is uncertain. The incident has prompted renewed calls from animal welfare advocates to ban the use of inhumane glue traps.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research on wild chimpanzees in Uganda reveals that young chimps acquire their patterns of combining vocal sounds and visual gestures primarily from their mothers and maternal relatives. The study, published in PLOS Biology, found no similar pattern of learning from paternal relatives. Since young chimps spend their formative years with their mothers, this suggests the communication styles are socially learned rather than genetically inherited. This finding indicates that the capacity for socially acquiring communication may be an ancient trait shared by humans and chimpanzees, dating back to their last common ancestor.</p>
