          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer plans to maintain current pricing levels, despite tariffs, due to its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. Over half of Home Depot's products are sourced from the U.S., and the company has diversified its imports, aiming for no single country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. CEO Ted Decker noted that high interest rates and economic uncertainty have dampened larger home improvement projects, with consumers focusing on smaller tasks. The company expects total sales to grow by 2.8% for the year, with comparable sales rising about 1%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Texas lawmakers are pushing for federal reimbursement of billions spent on border security under the Biden administration, citing a "dereliction of duty" by the federal government. The proposed State Border Security Assistance Act would create funding sources within the Justice Department and Homeland Security Department to reimburse states for border wall construction, law enforcement surveillance, and the apprehension and prosecution of illegal immigrants. Texas officials argue that they had to self-fund Operation Lone Star due to federal inaction, and the reimbursement would ensure the state is repaid for protecting the nation's southern border.</p>
