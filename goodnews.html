          <p>India's central bank exceeded market expectations by cutting its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, marking the third consecutive rate cut since February. Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth amidst global uncertainty as reasons for the move. The decision followed a better-than-expected 7.4% GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, though the RBI maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%. Despite the rate cut, the RBI shifted its monetary policy stance to neutral due to limited room for further support, carefully assessing incoming data to balance growth and inflation.

          <p>The government has implemented new regulations banning six water companies from awarding bonuses to senior executives due to failures in meeting environmental and consumer standards. The ban applies to Anglian Water, Southern Water, Thames Water, United Utilities, Wessex Water, and Yorkshire Water, backdated to April 2024. This action empowers Ofwat to reclaim bonuses already paid or impose enforcement measures, covering both cash and share awards. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized that profiting from pollution is over, while acknowledging the need for water firms to rebuild trust with customers, closely monitoring any attempts to circumvent the ban through base salary increases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is causing producer prices to remain in deflationary territory, leading to a potential "China shock" as the country floods global markets with cheap exports. While this is raising concerns in Asia about local industries being squeezed, economists suggest that it could offer a silver lining for inflation-hit economies by lowering consumer costs. This influx of low-cost Chinese goods may provide central banks some relief as they work to balance reducing living costs with reviving growth amidst rising trade tensions. Nomura predicts that this situation may lead to more rate cuts across Asia, as central banks decouple from the Federal Reserve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>North Korea claims to have successfully refloated a new destroyer that capsized during its launch last month, with plans to move the damaged vessel to a dry dock for repairs. The 5,000-ton warship, intended to be a symbol of North Korea's naval modernization, suffered a launch malfunction that caused the stern to slide prematurely into the water. Leader Kim Jong Un deemed the incident a "criminal act" and ordered swift repairs before the upcoming plenary session of the ruling Workers‚Äô Party. Analysts were surprised by the quick action to refloat the ship, which apparently involved using aerostatic balloons attached to the hull.</p>
