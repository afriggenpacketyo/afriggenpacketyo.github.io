        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery, the parent company of HBO and CNN, will divide into two separate entities by mid-2026, separating its studio and streaming business from its traditional cable television networks. This restructuring arrives as streaming services gain popularity and cable TV audiences decline. The Streaming & Studios division, which includes HBO Max hits like *Succession* and *The White Lotus*, will be led by Mr. Zaslav, while the Global Networks division, encompassing CNN and Discovery, will be headed by Gunnar Wiedenfels. The move aims to provide each division with the focus and flexibility needed to compete effectively in the evolving media landscape.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address the rising prices of the country's staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced that the released rice will be distributed to smaller supermarket operators in addition to major retailers. This move will leave the country with a rice reserve of 100,000 tons. Rice prices have doubled compared to the previous year, prompting the government to take this rare step to lower overall prices.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coastline. This investment is expected to create 10,000 direct jobs and power six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves described the decision as a "landmark" that will kickstart economic growth. The government insists that nuclear power is essential for eliminating fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, although the project will take at least a decade to complete, and faces opposition over costs and environmental concerns.</p>

The training materials advise teachers to use AI to automate routine tasks, allowing them to focus on face-to-face interaction with students. The Department for Education (DfE) emphasizes the importance of transparency and verification of AI-generated results. AI should only be used for low-stakes marking, such as quizzes and homework, and teachers must ensure the accuracy of its outputs.</p>
