          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 16:07:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaching a one-year low, prospective homebuyers can take several steps to secure even better loan terms. Experts recommend focusing on improving one's credit score, as higher scores qualify for significantly lower interest rates over the life of a loan. Additionally, increasing the down payment to 20% or more can reduce the lender's risk and lead to a better rate, while also avoiding private mortgage insurance. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider alternatives to a 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant surge, jumping more than 15% after S&P Global announced its inclusion in the prestigious S&P 500 index. This long-anticipated move, effective September 22, is a major milestone for the company, which went public in 2021. Inclusion in the benchmark index typically leads to increased demand for a company's stock from passive index funds, which are required to hold shares of all S&P 500 constituents. The stock has seen a dramatic rise of over 210% year-to-date, reflecting strong investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new mural by the anonymous street artist Banksy appeared on the Royal Courts of Justice in London, depicting a judge using a gavel to beat a protester. Banksy authenticated the politically charged artwork via his Instagram account, which activists have interpreted as a commentary on the U.K. government's recent ban of the protest group Palestine Action. Despite the attention, authorities quickly covered the piece and announced its removal, citing the building's protected historical status which requires its original character to be maintained.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances where enrollment can be delayed or assistance can be obtained. Individuals who are still working past age 65 and have creditable health insurance through an employer with 20 or more employees can typically delay Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the premium costs. However, skipping Part B enrollment can restrict access to supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

          <p>Retired tennis icon Serena Williams, through her venture capital firm Serena Ventures, has invested in Unrivaled, a women's 3-on-3 basketball league. The investment was part of a funding round that also included soccer star Alex Morgan and was led by Bessemer Venture Partners, valuing the two-year-old league at $340 million. Unrivaled was created to provide WNBA players with a high-paying domestic option during their offseason and claims to offer the highest average salary in women's professional sports league history. The league's next season is scheduled for January 2026.</p>

          <h2>Key Considerations for Savers Deciding Between a CD and a High-Yield Savings Account</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 15:52:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals with a significant amount of cash, such as $40,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account requires careful consideration of current economic conditions. A key factor is the long-term interest potential, as a CD locks in a fixed rate, protecting against future declines, whereas savings account rates are variable. Savers must also assess their ability to leave the funds untouched, as CDs penalize early withdrawals, making high-yield savings a better option for those needing liquidity. Both options, however, offer substantially higher returns than traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that the incumbent center-left Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere, is on track to secure a narrow victory. The left-leaning coalition is expected to win a slim majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament, allowing the minority government to remain in power. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as inflation and public services, but the turbulent international political climate was also a significant factor, with some observers suggesting voters favored the stability of the current government amidst global uncertainty.</p>

          <p>England's national football team manager, Thomas Tuchel, has indicated that the long throw-in could be revived as a key attacking strategy for the upcoming World Cup. This tactic, famously and effectively used by Stoke City's Rory Delap over a decade ago, is seeing a resurgence in the Premier League, with data showing an increase in long throws into the penalty area. Recognizing the limited preparation time for the tournament, Tuchel and his staff see specialized set-piece strategies like the long throw as an efficient way to gain a competitive edge, a view supported by throw-in coaches who argue the technique is an underestimated part of the game.</p>

          <p>An "early season cold front" is set to bring a significant cooldown across California this week, offering relief from recent heatwaves and thunderstorms. A low-pressure system moving down from the Pacific Northwest will cause temperatures to drop by 10 to 20 degrees below average, with the most noticeable change expected on Tuesday. While Northern California and the Bay Area may receive light rain that could help dampen wildfire risks, Southern California is only expected to see some coastal drizzle.

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased homes when rates were near their peak may be considering refinancing. Before proceeding, it is crucial to assess if current rates are low enough to justify the action, with a one-percentage-point drop being a common benchmark for significant savings. Homeowners should also weigh the risk of waiting for even lower rates against the unpredictability of the market, calculate whether the savings will outweigh the closing costs in a reasonable timeframe, and consider their long-term plans for staying in the home.
