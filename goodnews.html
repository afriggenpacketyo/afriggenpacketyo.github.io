          <p>A report from the UK's Education Select Committee has advised against scrapping the current system of education, health and care plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs.

The recommendations come as the government prepares to announce reforms to the special educational needs and disabilities (Send) system, which has faced financial sustainability challenges despite a rising number of students requiring EHCPs.</p>

Netskope's public debut is part of a larger trend of significant dealmaking within the cybersecurity sector, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and an evolving threat landscape.

          <p>Liverpool defeated Atletico Madrid 3-2 in their Champions League group stage match, thanks to a stoppage-time winner from captain Virgil van Dijk. The dramatic victory continued a trend for Liverpool this season of securing wins late in their games. The match also marked the debut of record signing Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs of linking up with his new teammates despite looking rusty. While the team's attacking prowess is evident, their tendency to surrender two-goal leads before mounting a comeback remains a point of concern for head coach Arne Slot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts widely anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to its lowest level in over two years. The decision is influenced by the UK's current inflation rate of 3.8%, which remains significantly above the 2% target, making another immediate cut unlikely. The central bank's decision comes a day after the US Federal Reserve enacted its own rate cut, highlighting different economic pressures facing global policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate by 0.25%, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to maintain their long-term strategies rather than making drastic moves. He argued that the quarter-point cut was widely expected and does not fundamentally alter the major themes driving the market, such as the strength of the technology and AI sectors. Cramer suggested that the mixed market reaction indicates some investors were hoping for a more significant cut. He characterized Fed Chair Jerome Powell's approach as prudent in the face of persistent inflation and a softening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's de facto central bank has cut its base interest rate for the first time in 2025, mirroring the 25-basis-point reduction made by the US Federal Reserve. Due to its currency peg to the US dollar, Hong Kong's monetary policy typically follows that of the Fed. The move is intended to lower the cost of funding for businesses and ease the financial burden on mortgage holders in the city. The US rate cut was prompted by signs of a weakening labor market, according to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>
