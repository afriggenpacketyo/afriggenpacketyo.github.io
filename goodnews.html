          <p>SBI Shinsei Bank has announced its intention to repay the remaining 230 billion yen ($1.6 billion) in public funds by the end of July, resolving a long-standing financial obligation.

SBI Shinsei Bank is now the only major domestic lender to fully repay government bailout funds received during that era. This move signifies a return to financial health and stability for the institution. The repayment symbolizes closure on a past financial crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

The trade sends Georges Niang and a second-round pick to Boston, and Terance Mann and the No. 22 pick to Brooklyn. This move gives Boston more flexibility moving forward and gets them under the second apron. Meanwhile, Kyrie Irving and the Dallas Mavericks have agreed to a $119 million, three-year contract extension. These moves mark significant changes in the NBA landscape.</p>

          <p>A proposal to sell off millions of acres of public lands across Western states, including California, was removed from the Republican's tax and spending bill. The Senate parliamentarian determined that the proposal violated Senate rules. Senator Mike Lee, who advanced the mandate, is attempting to revise the proposal. Environmentalists and public land advocates celebrated the decision. The original proposal would have made over 16 million acres of land in California eligible for sale. This halt is a victory for conservation efforts.</p>
