          <p>Following the split verdict in the Sean "Diddy" Combs trial, an attorney for his ex-girlfriend Cassie Ventura stated that she "paved the way" for the convictions. Douglas Wigdor, Ventura's lawyer, acknowledged the jury did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking her but emphasized her courage in filing the initial civil complaint. He praised her testimony for bringing attention to the misconduct of powerful men in the entertainment industry. Wigdor noted that while they had hoped for convictions on all counts, they are pleased Combs faces substantial jail time for federal crimes.</p>

          <p>A new study published in The Lancet Oncology has found that using a combination of estrogen and progesterone for hormone therapy can increase the risk of breast cancer in women under 55 who have a uterus. Conversely, the research indicated that using estrogen alone, a treatment suitable for women who have had a hysterectomy, actually reduces the risk. This research refines previous understandings from older studies and highlights the importance of the specific type and timing of hormone therapy. Medical experts stress that patients should discuss these findings with their doctors to weigh the risks and benefits for their individual situations.</p>

          <p>Admiral Sir Ben Key, the former head of the UK's Royal Navy, has had his service terminated following an investigation into his personal behavior. The Ministry of Defence stated that his conduct "fell far short of the values and standards expected of service personnel." In a statement, Adm Key expressed deep regret for his actions, which reportedly involved an affair with a junior colleague, and accepted the decision. The dismissal underscores the military's stated commitment to holding all personnel, regardless of rank, accountable to its code of conduct.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new trade deal with Vietnam that imposes a 20% tariff on all Vietnamese imports into the U.S. and a 40% tariff on goods transshipped through Vietnam to avoid other duties. In exchange, the agreement grants the United States tariff-free access to Vietnam's markets for American products. The deal comes ahead of a deadline that could have seen U.S. duties on Vietnamese goods rise to a much higher rate under Trump's reciprocal tariff policy. Critics note that tariffs are typically paid by importers, potentially raising costs for U.S. consumers and businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

In a statement ahead of his 90th birthday, he declared that the responsibility for finding his reincarnation will rest exclusively with a trust he established, which will consult with Tibetan Buddhist leaders. This move directly challenges Beijing, which passed a law in 2007 claiming authority over the selection process. The announcement is politically significant for Tibetans who seek to preserve their religious and cultural identity in the face of Chinese control.</p>

          <p>This commentary piece details how Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass is pushing back against President Trump's immigration crackdown, which she describes as an "all-out assault against Los Angeles." Bass has publicly condemned the federal actions and the Justice Department's lawsuit against the city's sanctuary policies, vowing not to be intimidated. Political analysts note that this confrontational approach is a shift for Bass, who is typically a consensus-builder, but may be a necessary recalibration when dealing with Trump. Her firm stance is seen as unifying many Angelenos and even some state Republicans against what they view as federal overreach.</p>

This move is designed to further incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced chip-making facilities within the United States. The enhanced credit builds upon the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, reflecting a continued bipartisan push to onshore the semiconductor supply chain.

The case involves an MI5 agent who was a neo-Nazi, and the court found that MI5 had lied about its handling of the agent's status.

These digital avatars, like the popular gamer "Bloo," are often "puppeteered" by humans but use AI for everything from voice dubbing to creating thumbnails. The trend, which started in Japan, is now being supercharged by advances in AI that make it easier than ever to produce polished content. While some creators aim for fully autonomous AI personalities, the rise of AI-generated content also fuels concerns about "AI slop" and the difficulty of distinguishing human-made content from synthetic.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Opening a High-Yield CD in July Could Be a Wise Move</h2>

          <p>With the potential for Federal Reserve rate cuts later this year, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time to open a certificate of deposit (CD). By opening a CD in July, savers can lock in current high-interest rates, protecting their earnings from future declines. A $20,000 deposit in a CD with a rate between 4% and 5% can generate significant, predictable interest over its term. This strategy also provides savers with a stable, interest-earning holding pattern, allowing them time to consider their next financial moves amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>
