          <p>Dodger pitcher Roki Sasaki's walkout music, "Báilalo Rocky," has become a viral Latin hit, cementing his appeal among Latino Dodgers fans and boosting the song globally. The infectious dembow-house track, discovered through veteran teammate Miguel Rojas, has become a dugout favorite and a symbol of the unique cultural blend in Los Angeles sports. Sasaki's adoption of the song, despite his modest persona, has helped propel him to become a lights-out reliever in the postseason after an injury-plagued midseason, with his manager praising his "great all-time appearances." This article celebrates the unexpected cultural phenomenon and its positive impact on the team's postseason run.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, millions in the UK experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), a recurring seasonal depression linked to reduced daylight. This article explores coping strategies, particularly for those in northern regions like Orkney and Shetland, which see barely six hours of daylight in winter.

          <p>A group of MPs on the Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue that such cuts are unlikely to achieve the intended effect of promoting an investment culture in the UK, as people are a long way from making well-informed financial decisions. The chancellor is reportedly considering reducing the tax-free amount for cash ISAs from £20,000 to £10,000 to encourage investment in stocks and shares. This article highlights the ongoing debate over fiscal policy and its potential impact on millions of savers, with the committee stressing this is not the right time for such a reduction.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A quiet but significant shift is occurring in UK driving, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatics last year. This trend is largely driven by the upcoming 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars, as electric vehicles are exclusively automatic, presenting a dilemma for new drivers. While passing an automatic test restricts drivers to automatics, many learners face challenges due to a lack of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs. This article explores the evolving choices for new drivers, highlighting accessibility issues for some and the changing perceptions around manual-only licenses in a rapidly electrifying automotive landscape.</p>
