          <p>Russia and Ukraine have exchanged 390 soldiers and civilians each, marking the largest prisoner swap since the start of the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, which was agreed to during direct talks in Istanbul. Both sides returned 270 servicemen and 120 civilians on the Ukrainian border with Belarus, with further swaps expected in the coming days as part of the agreement to exchange 1,000 prisoners. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy announced the return of his people, while the Russian defense ministry said its servicemen and civilians were taken to Belarus for medical checks and treatment.

          <p>President Trump has threatened Apple with a 25% tariff if the company does not manufacture its iPhones in the United States, criticizing their move to shift some production to India. Treasury Secretary Bessent suggested this is part of a broader effort to bring precision manufacturing back to the U.S., particularly in semiconductors, to secure the supply chain. Apple CEO Tim Cook has previously stated that the company already sources components from the U.S., but analysts believe a full relocation is unlikely due to high costs and logistical challenges. Trump's proposed tariffs aim to incentivize domestic manufacturing, but analysts caution that the price of iPhones could dramatically increase as a result. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended the block on the Trump administration's plans to sharply cut jobs and reorganize federal agencies under the DOGE initiative, which is being done with the help of Elon Musk. The preliminary injunction pauses further reductions in force and reorganization of the executive branch for the duration of the lawsuit. The Trump administration has appealed the decision, arguing that Presidents can set policy priorities, but the judge emphasized that Congress creates and funds federal agencies, giving them duties they must carry out. The judge stated that agencies cannot conduct large-scale reorganizations and reductions in force in blatant disregard of Congress's mandates.</p>

          <p>Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, argues that the criticism leveled against Harvard has become excessive, labeling it "Harvard Derangement Syndrome." He acknowledges Harvard has issues but believes the Trump administration's punitive measures, including slashing research funding and banning international students, are disproportionate. Pinker suggests that while Harvard has areas for improvement, such as academic freedom and viewpoint diversity, the blanket condemnation is unwarranted. He advocates for a more nuanced approach, diagnosing and treating specific ailments rather than destroying the institution, and he notes the importance of universities in discovering and transmitting knowledge.</p>

          <p>A new study has found that contrast-enhanced mammography can detect three times as many invasive cancers in dense breast tissue as ultrasound, offering a more accurate screening method. The contrast-enhanced mammography can find tumors that are much smaller than those found by regular mammography. While MRI scans are better at detecting more tumors, contrast-enhanced mammograms are more cost-effective and could be made more widely available. The study, which was published in The Lancet, suggests that contrast-enhanced mammography should become the standard of care for women with dense breasts who are at high risk of developing breast cancer.</p>

The Turkish government now has the opportunity to consolidate peace by offering amnesty to PKK fighters and addressing Kurdish grievances. The group's leaders see this move as a new phase in their movement, focused on building a democratic society, and the new viability of this agreement will depend on what the Turkish government offers the group in exchange for relinquishing its weapons.</p>

          <p>Russia and Ukraine have conducted their largest exchange of prisoners of war since the start of the war, with each side reporting the return of 390 soldiers and civilians. More swaps are expected in the coming days, as both countries have committed to exchanging 1,000 prisoners each. The exchange was agreed upon at negotiations in Istanbul, marking a rare instance of direct talks between the two sides. Despite the ongoing conflict, the exchange of prisoners has remained one of the few areas where communication lines have stayed open.</p>

He believes Tesla is undervalued in the AI market and highlights the potential of the company's Full Self-Driving software. Despite regulatory scrutiny and competition, Ives maintains that Tesla has a competitive edge in the autonomous vehicle market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, reinstating almost all of them after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The new review identified only about 20 books that require removal pending further assessment by a Department of Defense panel. This reversal followed a Pentagon memo that standardized search terms, leading to a significant reduction in the number of books identified as potentially incompatible with the military's core mission. The Navy's initial search used its own terms and identified a broader range of titles.</p>
