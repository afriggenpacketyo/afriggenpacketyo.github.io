Candidates like Toni Atkins praised Newsom's efforts against the Trump administration, while others like Chad Bianco criticized his actions. Xavier Becerra said he would have acted more quickly on issues like high-speed rail and the housing crisis, while Katie Porter lauded Newsom's universal school meals program. The candidates also addressed issues ranging from healthcare and housing costs to online safety and the state's focus on national politics. </p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argues that the current AI boom differs significantly from the dotcom bubble of 2000, citing the financial strength and diverse reputations of today's tech giants. He highlights that companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are capable of absorbing bad investments, unlike the debt-ridden dotcom companies of the past. Cramer acknowledges concerns about Oracle's data center plans, but remains optimistic about the overall success of tech megacaps in the AI space. Despite his confidence, he advises investors to remain skeptical and scrutinize stock moves in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With a potential government shutdown looming, active-duty military personnel and deployed National Guard members may face delayed pay, though they would still be required to perform their duties. Civilian personnel deemed essential would also continue working, while others would be furloughed. While back pay is guaranteed for government employees after a shutdown, active-duty service members may require separate legislation to ensure timely payment.

          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) is implementing new measures to curb the strategic non-ferrous metals sector in response to cutthroat competition. The action plan projects a reduced output growth of 1.5% for primary non-ferrous metals this year, prioritizing industrial structure optimization with a 5% average annual growth rate in value-added output. The plan emphasizes exploration of key resources like copper, aluminum, and lithium, alongside the development of advanced materials and enhanced recycling. This shift aims to address depressed processing fees and improve smelter margins in the sector dominated by state-owned enterprises. (not investment advice)</p>
