          <p>The UK economy experienced a 0.7% expansion in the first three months of the year, surpassing analysts' predictions of 0.6%, according to the Office for National Statistics. The growth was primarily fueled by the services sector, with significant contributions from production as well. Chancellor Rachel Reeves highlighted that the UK's economic growth outpaced that of the US, Canada, France, Italy, and Germany during this period, indicating a robust start to the year for the British economy. The figures reflect the economic state before the US imposed tariffs in April, impacting future trade dynamics.</p>

          <p>A faint, water-stained manuscript held in Harvard Law School's library for 80 years has been identified as an original 1300 version of Magna Carta, one of only seven such documents in existence. Two British academics, David Carpenter and Nicholas Vincent, made the discovery while researching digital images of Harvard's collection. The document, purchased for $27.50 after World War II, is now recognized as a valuable historical artifact, especially relevant given current challenges to institutions from the state. The manuscript was authenticated through ultraviolet light and spectral imaging, techniques that enhanced undetectable aspects of the historical document.</p>

          <p>Denmark's economic growth, boosted by pharmaceutical exports, is expected to moderate in the coming years, according to the International Monetary Fund. While the economy grew by 3.7% in 2024, projections indicate a slowdown to 2.9% this year and 1.8% in 2026 due to anticipated weakness in export growth, particularly in pharmaceuticals. The IMF notes that Denmark is shielded from potential U.S. tariffs on pharmaceutical imports because most Danish drug products are neither produced nor cross its borders. The growth has been significantly driven by Novo Nordisk's diabetes and weight loss medications.</p>

Experts from King's College London and the University of East Anglia confirmed the authenticity based on the document's size and handwriting.

          <p>The Kurdistan Worker's Party (PKK) has announced its dissolution after 41 years of armed conflict against the Turkish state, a move that could significantly alter Turkey's political landscape. Experts suggest this development could lead to a more democratic model for Turkey, but unknowns remain regarding the surrender of weapons, the fate of PKK members, and the potential for a new organization to emerge. The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) may see changes, and the government faces challenges in integrating former fighters and addressing concerns from neighboring nations.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is considering doubling the release of stockpiled rice to address near-record high prices, according to sources familiar with the matter. The government is studying the release of 100,000 tons of reserve rice per month for three months, in addition to the 321,000 tons already auctioned. The move aims to combat a rice shortage caused by a poor harvest and increased consumption due to a surge in foreign tourists.

The recall affects models from 2022 to 2024, and Ford will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge.

The Independent Schools Council (ISC) anticipates a decrease in private school enrollment due to the higher costs. The average termly fee for a day school in January was ¬£7,382, which includes 20% VAT. The Treasury maintains that the fee increases are not solely attributable to VAT, while the ISC cites additional financial pressures from national insurance changes and the end of charitable business rates relief.</p>

          <h2>Harvard's Cut-Price Magna Carta 'Copy' Now Believed to Be Genuine</h2>

          <p>A manuscript acquired by Harvard Law School in 1946 for just $27.50, previously considered a copy of the Magna Carta, is now believed to be a genuine version from 1300. UK academics have concluded that the document is an extraordinarily rare and lost original Magna Carta from the reign of King Edward I, potentially worth millions. The document was catalogued as a copy made in 1327, but detailed analysis revealed its authenticity. The professors believe the document originated from the town of Appleby, Cumbria, and eventually made its way to Harvard.</p>
