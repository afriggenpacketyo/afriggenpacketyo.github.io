          <p>Actor Celia Rose Gooding shared her experience playing a young Nyota Uhura in the series 'Star Trek: Strange New Worlds,' which is set a decade before the original show. Gooding, who comes from a family of 'Trekkies,' spoke about the warm reception she has received from the franchise's devoted fanbase for her interpretation of the iconic linguistics specialist. She explained her deliberate choice to remain unfamiliar with Uhura's future storylines to authentically portray the character's journey without foreknowledge of what lies ahead. The role explores Uhura's early Starfleet career, adding new depth and lighter moments to the well-known character.</p>

          <p>South African authorities have arrested six individuals, including well-known rhinoceros breeder John Hume, in connection with a major international rhino horn trafficking network. The arrests follow a seven-year investigation into a scheme that allegedly smuggled 964 horns, valued at over $14 million, to illegal markets in Southeast Asia. The suspects face charges including fraud, theft, and violations of national biodiversity laws. Conservation groups have praised the arrests as a significant step in disrupting the organized crime that fuels rhino poaching, a practice that has decimated the animal's population across sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily blocking a new Texas law that would have required every public school classroom to display the Ten Commandments. Judge Fred Biery ruled that the law likely violates the First Amendment's Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses by amounting to unconstitutional religious coercion. The lawsuit was filed by a group of families from various religious and nonreligious backgrounds, who argued the state was intruding on their right to guide their children's religious education. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has vowed to appeal the decision, defending the law as a reflection of foundational moral values.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A coalition of 30 major cryptocurrency firms, including Coinbase and Kraken, has sent an open letter to the UK's finance minister, urging the government to establish a proactive national strategy for stablecoins. The group argues that the UK must act now to avoid falling behind the United States and becoming a 'rule-taker' in the digital asset space. They contend that stablecoins should be embraced as a form of financial infrastructure rather than viewed solely as a risk to be contained. A coordinated national strategy, they claim, would strengthen the UK's position as a global financial hub and support demand for government bonds through new digital channels.</p>

          <p>Home improvement retailer Lowe's exceeded Wall Street's earnings expectations for the second quarter, driven by increased demand for home projects. The company also announced a major strategic move to attract more professional contractors, acquiring Foundation Building Materials, a distributor of drywall and other products, for approximately $8.8 billion. While sales to DIY customers have been solid, Lowe's noted that demand for larger projects remains softer due to higher mortgage rates. The acquisition is part of a broader strategy to bolster its offerings for home professionals, a more consistent and lucrative customer base. (not investment advice)</p>

The partnership includes joint military exercises and closer cooperation between defense industries. This strategic alignment is also bolstered by Japan's strong support for Ukraine, contrasting with China's perceived backing of Russia's war efforts.</p>

          <p>The business of securely erasing data from used and discarded IT equipment, known as IT asset disposition (ITAD), is rapidly growing. With global e-waste projected to reach 82 million metric tons by 2030, the risk of sensitive personal and corporate data falling into the wrong hands from improperly handled devices is a major cybersecurity concern. ITAD providers use methods like physical destruction, specialized wiping software, and degaussing to ensure data is permanently removed from old smartphones, computers, and servers. This service is becoming crucial for corporations, governments, and consumers looking to protect their privacy and prevent identity theft.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues AI Conversations Will Usher in a More Profitable Era for Google and Publishers</h2>

          <p>An op-ed by Taboola CEO Adam Singolda argues that generative AI, despite reducing traditional search traffic, will ultimately create a more valuable and richer era for Google and online publishers. The author contends that while 'zero-click searches' will decrease referral traffic, high-value conversations within AI models like Gemini present massive commercial opportunities. These interactions, involving complex planning for travel, finance, or health, are worth far more than a simple search click. The article suggests that publishers can leverage their trusted brands and deep content to host their own AI conversations, shifting from a pageview-driven model to one based on direct, relationship-driven value.</p>

          <p>Savers with large cash reserves can still secure compelling returns with certificates of deposit (CDs), despite rates cooling from their recent peaks. An investment of $125,000 can generate substantial, predictable earnings across various terms in the current interest rate environment. For example, a 1-year CD at 4.30% would earn approximately $5,375, while a 5-year CD at 4.20% could yield around $28,550 in interest. CDs offer a safe and stable option for investors seeking guaranteed returns amid stock market volatility, making them an attractive component of a diversified financial strategy.

          <p>A simple starter of fried plantains has become a standout dish at Chef Adrian Forte's modern Caribbean restaurant, Lucia. The popular recipe features caramelized, crispy plantains served with a distinctive pickled Scotch bonnet aioli. Forte describes the aioli as a versatile 'utility paste' that he uses in a wide variety of dishes, from chili to marinades, likening it to a condiment such as sambal oelek. He notes that the pickling process reduces the heat of the Scotch bonnet peppers, making the flavor more accessible while still providing a unique, spicy kick to complement the sweet plantains.</p>

          <p>Artificial intelligence leader OpenAI achieved its first $1 billion revenue month in July, marking a significant financial milestone for the company behind ChatGPT. Despite this rapid growth, CFO Sarah Friar stated the company is 'constantly under compute,' facing voracious demand for the powerful GPUs needed to train and run its AI models. This pressure is driving massive infrastructure investments, including the 'Stargate' supercomputer project with Microsoft. The company, which recently closed a funding round at a $300 billion valuation, is expected to see its annual revenue triple this year as it continues to expand its enterprise and consumer offerings.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-20 11:03:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of scientists has created a 'superfood' supplement that could help protect honeybees from the growing threats of climate change and habitat loss. During trials, bee colonies that consumed the new food produced up to 15 times more offspring that successfully grew to adulthood. The breakthrough involves a specially engineered yeast that produces all the vital nutrients, particularly lipids called sterols, that bees need to thrive but are often missing from existing supplementary feeds. This development could be crucial for supporting global bee populations, which are vital for pollinating a majority of the world's leading food crops.</p>
