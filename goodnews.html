This year's installation, "In Search of Us," includes 11 projects addressing humanity's impacts, from AI to climate change and war. "Fragile Home" uses mixed reality to recreate a bombarded Ukrainian home, while "Scent" is a cinematic game where the player is a dog guiding souls. "AI & Me: The Confessional and AI Ego" analyzes participants using AI, offering a snarky assessment of their personality and goals, while "Uncharted" combines dance, spoken word, and visualizations of symbols to celebrate pan-African language and storytelling. The exhibits run through June 29.</p>

          <p>Chime, a provider of online banking services, priced its IPO at $27 per share, surpassing expectations and valuing the company at $11.6 billion. The company raised approximately $700 million in the IPO, with existing investors selling an additional $165 million worth of shares. This offering marks a loosening in the fintech IPO pipeline after a long freeze due to rising interest rates and valuation resets.

          <p>The government has rehired over 450 CDC employees who were previously terminated during a widespread restructuring at the Department of Health and Human Services in April. Among the reinstated branches is the National Center for Environmental Health, which oversees a lead prevention program for children. The cuts had previously left schools in Milwaukee without federal assistance for dealing with lead contamination. Lawsuits against HHS's firings, which impacted around 10,000 employees across multiple agencies, are ongoing, and an HHS spokesperson affirmed the commitment to protecting essential public health functions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has stated that he regrets some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump, admitting that "they went too far." This follows Trump's indication of openness to reconciliation in a recent interview, despite their previous public fallout after Musk stepped back from a White House role and criticized Trump's tax bill. Musk had previously claimed, without evidence, that Trump was linked to Jeffrey Epstein in unreleased government files, leading to a heated exchange where Trump threatened to cancel Musk's government contracts. Musk appears to have deleted many of his posts over the weekend.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's activities compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge stated that Khalil's career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled, causing irreparable harm. However, the government can still pursue deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application, though the judge noted that detention for such reasons is rare.</p>

Khalil, who has not been charged with a crime, had been deemed a threat to US foreign policy by secretary of state, Marco Rubio, prompting federal authorities to detain him in March. Despite his latest order, Farbiarz did note that Khalil can still remain in custody on the basis of federal officials‚Äô claims that Khalil inaccurately filled out his green card application.</p>

          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom's address condemning ICE raids and the military presence in California has resonated deeply, framing President Trump's actions as an assault on democracy. Newsom's clear message and unexpected delivery have garnered significant attention, potentially positioning him as a leader against authoritarianism. By calling out the danger of violent protests while advocating for peaceful resistance, Newsom has placed Trump in a challenging position. The success of this strategy depends on whether the military or protesters are perceived as the aggressors in Los Angeles, which could influence public support.</p>

          <p>Egg prices for consumers have fallen to a five-month low in May, dropping 11% from April to $4.55 per dozen, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The price decrease is attributed to the receding effects of a years-long avian flu outbreak and a seasonal softening in demand as people shift to consuming more meat and grilling outdoors. While egg prices have declined for two consecutive months, they remain elevated compared to the previous year. Experts caution that the bird flu outbreak is not yet entirely contained and continues to impact the industry, but consumer relief is likely to continue in the short term.</p>
