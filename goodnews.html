          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have announced a ten-year, A$500 million ($328 million) agreement to bolster security and economic relations between the two nations. The deal, known as the Nakamal agreement, is seen as a strategic move by Australia to counter China's growing influence in the Pacific region. While full details are pending, the pact is expected to fund data centers, climate change resilience, and security enhancements in Vanuatu. Leaders from both countries celebrated the agreement as a "win-win situation" that strengthens their "family" bond and shared destiny.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated there is a "viable chance" for a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine, speaking ahead of a crucial summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Starmer emphasized that any agreement must protect Ukraine's territorial integrity and be supported by credible security guarantees from a "coalition of the willing." The comments came after European leaders held a joint call with President Trump to align their positions, amid concerns that a deal might involve Ukraine ceding territory to Russia to end the conflict.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Viral images of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like facial growths have sparked alarm online, but wildlife officials have clarified the cause. The animals are infected with Shope Papilloma Virus, a disease common in the Midwest that is spread by ticks, fleas, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact. The growths, or papillomas, are generally harmless to the rabbits unless they obstruct their ability to eat, and the virus does not spread to humans or other pets. The disease is not new and is believed to have inspired the myth of the "jackalope," a rabbit with antlers.</p>

          <p>Following their $8-billion takeover, Skydance Media's David Ellison and his new leadership team at Paramount have detailed their plan to rebuild the company. The strategy involves nearly doubling the studio's annual film output to 15-20 movies, focusing on major franchises like "Top Gun," "Star Trek," and "Transformers," and attracting top filmmaking talent. Ellison emphasized a goal of creating entertainment for a broad, depoliticized audience and confirmed that a "Top Gun 3" is a massive priority. The new management aims to restore Paramount's status as a premier Hollywood destination after years of under-investment.</p>

          <p>A new survey indicates that "bleisure" travel, the blending of business and leisure, has become a widespread practice, with 55% of business travelers having family or friends join them on work trips. The trend is even more pronounced among C-suite executives, 73% of whom have done so. Motivations include saving money on personal travel and reclaiming family time that would otherwise be lost to work obligations. While many companies quietly accept the practice, employees often feel it exists in a policy gray area, raising concerns about professionalism, expense reporting, and insurance liability.</p>

          <p>A Texas state judge has ordered the assets of Alex Jones's Infowars to be turned over to a court-appointed receiver, who will liquidate the company to help pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook families. This move could soon force the conspiracy theorist off the air and lead to the sale of the Infowars brand, studio equipment, and other property. The families' lawyers praised the decision as a long-awaited step toward accountability for Jones's cruel harassment campaign. The decision shifts the collection process from federal bankruptcy court to state court, which may expedite the seizure and sale of assets.</p>

          <p>A large-scale study in Sweden suggests that medication for ADHD can provide wider life benefits beyond managing daily symptoms. The research, published in the BMJ, found that individuals who began drug treatment had significantly lower rates of first-time substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminal behavior. The findings were based on data from nearly 150,000 people and could help patients and doctors weigh the benefits of medication against potential side-effects. Researchers believe the drugs help by reducing impulsivity and inattention, which are often linked to these negative outcomes.</p>

          <p>In response to U.S. actions aimed at curbing China's shipbuilding dominance, South Korean firms are increasing their investments in Southeast Asian nations like the Philippines. Companies such as HD Hyundai are reviving defunct shipyards in the region to leverage lower labor costs and expand capacity, which has been a constraint on their competitiveness against Chinese rivals. HD Hyundai plans to invest $550 million in a Philippine shipyard, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and create 7,000 jobs. This strategic shift is seen as a long-term solution to navigate geopolitical trade pressures and domestic labor challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a heartbreaking late collapse and penalty shootout loss to Paris St-Germain in the UEFA Super Cup, Tottenham Hotspur showed promising signs under new manager Thomas Frank. For 85 minutes, the team effectively executed a pragmatic, organized 3-5-2 formation, leading 2-0 with both goals coming from well-drilled set-pieces. This disciplined approach marked a clear departure from the high-risk style of the previous manager. While the final minutes revealed a need to improve game management under pressure, the performance suggested that Frank is implementing a solid tactical foundation for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic examines the ongoing shift in how Americans consume news and establish trust, moving away from traditional institutions toward individual online creators. While social media is rife with misinformation, a growing cohort of "evidence-based creators"—journalists and experts—are using these platforms to provide factual, nuanced information directly to audiences. The author argues that this new media ecosystem is in an "awkward adolescence" and needs new infrastructure, like certification systems and collaborative frameworks, to help credible voices thrive. This would help audiences navigate the digital landscape and support a sustainable model for trustworthy online journalism.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hochman, CEO of Brinker International, reported that the company's Chili's restaurant chain has seen significant growth, with same-store sales up 23.7%. He attributed this success to a major increase in the marketing budget, from $32 million to $137 million, and effective use of social media influencers. Hochman also highlighted the popularity of the standardized $10.99 value meal, which provides a clear and consistent offer to customers without requiring coupons. This growth-focused strategy is helping the company leverage fixed costs and improve margins in an inflationary environment, leading to a strong quarterly report. (not investment advice)</p>
