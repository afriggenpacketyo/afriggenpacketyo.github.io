          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has uncovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime, including propaganda material, within its archives during preparations for a historical museum. The discovered items, believed to be linked to packages that arrived in Buenos Aires in 1941, intended to promote Adolf Hitler's ideology in Argentina. Horacio Rosatti, the president of the Supreme Court, has ordered a thorough analysis and preservation of the material. Argentina, home to Latin America's largest Jewish population, was a destination for Nazis fleeing after World War II.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order mandating that the U.S. pay the same price as the nation with the lowest price for certain medications administered in doctor's offices.

Kennedy Jr. pointed to the high prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic, highlighting the need for price negotiations with drug companies. The proposal is expected to face opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that lower prices could hinder innovation and research efforts.</p>
