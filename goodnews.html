          <p>HSBC's co-CEO, David Liao Yi-chien, highlighted a growing trend of multinational companies increasing their investment allocations in China, particularly in new-economy sectors like high-end manufacturing, healthcare, and pharmaceuticals. This reorientation positions China as a global market driving innovation, consumption, and growth, a sentiment echoed by HSBC's Global Trade Pulse Survey, which found 44% of respondents focused on China. The world's second-largest economy continues to attract international capital due to its vast market, comprehensive industrial facilities, dynamic innovation ecosystem, and abundant talent. Liao emphasized that China's capital markets offer indispensable opportunities for global investors, especially as innovation-driven economic growth draws significant international attention (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, prompted by a new US trade deal that reduces tariffs on Japanese car imports, Japan is set for a significant leadership transition. The incoming leader will face the complex challenge of navigating the often-rocky relationship with China, as analysts anticipate that Tokyo will continue to perceive Beijing as a strategic competitor. The Chinese foreign ministry, choosing not to comment on Japan's internal affairs, underscores the delicate diplomatic balance and potential for shifts in regional dynamics.
