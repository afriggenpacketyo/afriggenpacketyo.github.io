          <p>With America facing a shortage of affordable housing, innovative solutions are emerging, including the refitting of single-family homes into multifamily units. Developer Monte Anderson in Dallas has been converting existing homes into "roommate houses" to address the housing mismatch between large, underused homes and the demand for smaller, more affordable units. Cities and states are also exploring ways to encourage the addition of rental units to existing structures, such as allowing backyard homes and garage conversions. This approach aims to increase housing density in established neighborhoods without causing significant disruption. The article highlights the potential of accessory dwelling units (ADUs) and lot subdivisions as effective strategies for adding housing supply.</p>

Some reviewers have praised the movie as the best Marvel has produced since WandaVision, while others see it as a self-aware step in a new direction for the studio.</p>
