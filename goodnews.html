          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge after President Donald Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon signing a national security agreement with the U.S. government. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over decisions to relocate U.S. Steel's headquarters, move the company outside the U.S., rename the company, transfer production or jobs abroad, and close or idle plants prematurely. While Trump has described the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals have been received, and the transaction is expected to be completed promptly. (not investment advice)</p>

AMD recently unveiled its next-generation artificial intelligence chips, the Instinct MI400 series, including a full-server rack called Helios.

          <p>Google has issued an apology and an incident report for a major outage that caused hours of downtime for over 70 Google cloud services, including Gmail, Google Calendar, and Google Drive. The outage was attributed to flawed updates to the "quota policy checks" feature, which were not adequately tested in real-world situations. The company acknowledged that it did not use feature flags, an industry practice that allows for slow implementation to minimize impact. Google plans to change its architecture to prevent future crashes and improve its communications with customers during such events.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that 67% of newlyweds took on debt to pay for their wedding. Experts recommend paying for the wedding with cash if possible, but if debt is necessary, using a credit card with a 0% introductory offer is a wise option. Personal lines of credit, often referred to as "wedding loans," can also be a good choice for those with good credit, offering lower interest rates and smaller monthly payments. Regardless of the type of debt, experts emphasize the importance of creating a repayment plan that fits within the couple's financial picture after the wedding. (not investment advice)</p>
