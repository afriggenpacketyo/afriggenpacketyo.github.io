          <h2>Trifluoroacetic Acid Found in UK Rivers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by York University found traces of the "forever chemical" trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in nearly all UK rivers sampled.  TFA, a byproduct of other PFAS chemicals, breaks down slowly and accumulates in the environment.  German scientists are pushing for TFA to be classified as toxic for reproduction, raising concerns about long-term, low-level exposure to humans. The UK currently lacks regulations to control TFA levels in water supplies.</p>

          <p>China's consumer spending remains weak due to sluggish income growth, uncertainty about future wealth, and a lack of a robust social safety net.  Disposable income growth has halved since the pandemic, with wage increases lagging behind GDP growth in most sectors.  High youth unemployment and a preference for saving over spending further contribute to the economic slowdown.  Government efforts to boost employment and social welfare are underway, but large-scale cash handouts remain absent.</p>
