        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's Kospi index achieved a record high for the third consecutive day, driven by investor optimism surrounding ongoing trade negotiations with the United States. This positive trend notably contrasted with broader losses observed across other Asia-Pacific markets, which were influenced by escalating fears within the U.S. banking sector and persistent global trade tensions. The Kospi's resilience underscores a favorable outlook on South Korea's economic stability and its strategic international trade partnerships. Concurrently, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports demonstrated a remarkable rebound in September, significantly exceeding forecasts and reversing an earlier decline, indicating robust economic activity in that specific sector despite wider regional challenges.

          <p>Douglas Atwill, a highly regarded regional painter, author, and residential designer, passed away at his Santa Fe home on October 8, 2025, at the age of 92. His death was attributed to complications arising from cancer, heart issues, and advanced macular degeneration. Atwill was celebrated for his consistent dedication to painting New Mexico landscapes and gardens for over four decades, often entertaining friends in his studio. A veteran of the US Army's counter-intelligence branch, he was also fondly remembered for his distinctively calming and warm voice. His life partner, Robert Zygmand, preceded him in death, and memorials are suggested for the Santa Fe Opera or Chamber Music Festival.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) reported a record-breaking 39.1% surge in third-quarter profit compared to last year, substantially exceeding market estimates, primarily fueled by the strong global demand for artificial intelligence chips. The company's revenue also climbed by 30.3% to NT$989.92 billion, marking another successful quarter. TSMC CEO C.C. Wei expressed increased confidence in the AI megatrend, leading the company to raise its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range. Furthermore, TSMC is actively monitoring potential U.S. tariff policies, although its significant investments in American facilities are expected to provide some insulation from adverse impacts.

          <p>Ace Frehley, the original lead guitarist and a founding member of the legendary glam rock band Kiss, passed away peacefully at the age of 74 in Morristown, New Jersey, following a recent fall. His family and former bandmates, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons, expressed profound sadness, acknowledging his essential and irreplaceable contribution to the band's foundational history. Frehley, famously known as "Space Ace" or "The Spaceman," co-founded Kiss in 1973, playing on many classic albums and pioneering their iconic theatrical stage shows with pyrotechnics and distinctive makeup. Despite later leaving the band multiple times and having well-documented feuds, his innovative style profoundly influenced subsequent rock acts.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking long-acting injectable medication for HIV prevention, cabotegravir (CAB-LA), has received approval for use on the NHS in England and Wales, bringing its policy in line with Scotland. This innovative injection, administered just six times a year, provides a more convenient and discreet alternative to daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pills, which some individuals find difficult to adhere to. Health experts are optimistic that this "game-changing" treatment will be a crucial tool in achieving the UK's ambitious goal of ending new HIV transmissions by 2030. The jab will be offered to high-risk adults and adolescents who face challenges with oral PrEP adherence.</p>

          <p>After securing a dominant 3-0 lead against the Milwaukee Brewers in the National League Championship Series with a 3-1 victory, the Los Angeles Dodgers are being lauded as potentially the most dominant postseason team in baseball history. This article highlights the team's exceptional performance, citing their aces-flush pitching rotation, including Tyler Glasnow's impressive outing and the anticipated start of Shohei Ohtani, alongside a deep and versatile batting lineup. The Dodgers' revitalized bullpen and their significant home-field advantage at Dodger Stadium are also identified as crucial elements in their current 8-1 playoff record, suggesting they are poised for a historically dominant and possibly near-undefeated championship run.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers achieved a pivotal 3-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 3 of the National League Championship Series, establishing a commanding 3-0 series lead by strategically capitalizing on opportunities in the sixth inning. Following a tight pitching duel for five innings, the Dodgers broke the stalemate with a crucial two-run rally, exploiting a decrease in pitcher Misiorowski's velocity and the receding shadows. The decisive plays included a single from Will Smith, a carefully drawn walk by Freddie Freeman, and an RBI single from Tommy Edman. An errant pickoff throw by Brewers closer Abner Uribe then allowed Freeman to score, securing a lead that the Dodgers' bullpen expertly defended.</p>

          <p>The article examines a notable cultural shift towards openly discussing sweat and other bodily functions, highlighted by comedian Alan Carr's candid admission of sweating on "The Celebrity Traitors." This growing trend is further evidenced by various public figures, including Hollywood actors and musicians, who have shared their personal experiences with perspiration, sometimes involving medical treatments like Botox. The piece notes the increasing normalization of sweat in fitness culture and even in professional settings, such as business meetings held in saunas, challenging long-standing taboos. While some experts laud this as a positive move towards body positivity, others remain skeptical, warning against potential commercial exploitation by the personal hygiene industry.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld a lower court's order, rejecting the Trump administration's request to deploy National Guard troops in Illinois, citing insufficient evidence of a "rebellion." The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals panel deemed the deployment a "likely violation" of the Tenth Amendment, which safeguards state powers. The court found the administration unlikely to demonstrate that a rebellion against U.S. authority existed or that regular forces were unable to execute federal laws, despite President Trump's characterization of Chicago as a "war zone." This decision maintains the block on federalized Guardsmen within Illinois, emphasizing that political opposition does not equate to a rebellion requiring military intervention.</p>

          <p>Dazzling satellite photographs vividly capture the dramatic transformation of California's landscape after the season's inaugural major atmospheric river storm, showcasing a stark contrast between previously parched, brown mountain peaks and newly brilliant white, snow-capped ranges. This significant influx of moisture has substantially replenished most of the state's major reservoirs, elevating them to or exceeding historical levels for this period. Experts suggest that this abundant precipitation could considerably delay the onset of the fire season in Los Angeles, marking a highly favorable start to the water year and contributing significantly to the region's ongoing drought recovery efforts. The positive environmental impact extends into neighboring Nevada and Utah.</p>
