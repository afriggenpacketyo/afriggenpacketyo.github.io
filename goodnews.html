        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer, which recently faced a public relations crisis. The move comes after the company's CEO and an HR executive resigned when they were filmed in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert. In a short video, Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's Chris Martin, humorously addressed the company's newfound attention without directly mentioning the scandal. The company stated it will now return to focusing on its data workflow automation services for its customers.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that he is involved in mediating an end to the deadly border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia. He claimed to have spoken with leaders from both nations, who he says are seeking an immediate ceasefire to the fighting that has killed at least 33 people. Trump posted on social media that peace seems to be a natural outcome and also tied the successful conclusion of future trade agreements to the cessation of hostilities. The conflict stems from a long-standing territorial dispute over the area surrounding the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 14:31:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>More than two decades after its original release, a sequel to the hit film "Bend It Like Beckham" is being developed, according to director Gurinder Chadha. She announced the news ahead of the Euro 2025 final, stating that the success of England's Lionesses and the changing landscape for women in sports made it a good time to revisit the characters. The original 2002 film, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha hopes to reunite the original cast and aims for a 2027 release to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary.</p>

          <p>India demonstrated strong resistance against England on the fourth day of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, closing at 174-2 and trailing by 137 runs. After an early collapse to 0-2, an unbroken partnership between Shubman Gill (78) and KL Rahul (87) blunted the English attack. Earlier, England captain Ben Stokes scored his first Test century in over two years, a knock of 141 that helped his team to a commanding total of 669. While England remains the favorite to win the match and the series, India's determined batting has kept their hopes of a draw alive.</p>

          <p>A recent advertising campaign by American Eagle featuring actress Sydney Sweeney has coincided with a significant increase in the company's stock value. The article suggests that the campaign's embrace of Sweeney's traditional visual appeal marks a departure from modern advertising's focus on social messaging. This return to a more product-focused, conventional marketing approach is being interpreted by some investors as a profitable strategy, bucking the trend of politically motivated advertising. The market's positive reaction indicates a potential shift back towards prioritizing profit over ideological messaging in corporate branding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant political development, Taiwanese voters have rejected a recall effort targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power. While the DPP won the presidency, the KMT and its allies hold a majority in the legislature, enabling them to resist President Lai Ching-te's agenda. Proponents of the recall had criticized the KMT for passing controversial reforms and being overly favorable to China, while the KMT accused the DPP of political retaliation.</p>

While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, recent studies offer conflicting results on its health impacts. Some research links daily coffee to healthy aging and heart benefits, while other studies suggest a connection to dementia or cardiovascular risk for those with hypertension. Dietitians stress that moderation is key and advise people to be mindful of their own tolerance, stopping if they feel anxious, jittery, or experience sleep disruption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An international team of scientists has discovered that a significant portion of what was once considered "junk" DNA plays a crucial role in gene regulation. The study focused on transposable elements, or "jumping genes," which make up nearly half of the human genome. Researchers found that a specific family of these elements, believed to have originated from an ancient virus, can act as genetic switches that influence gene expression without altering the underlying DNA code. This finding challenges previous assumptions and suggests that these sequences have evolved to become integral parts of our genetic machinery.</p>

Despite being older than most candidates, the 74-year-old was approved for a double-lung transplant at the Cleveland Clinic. After a successful but challenging recovery, Kennedy's lung capacity is now at 98%, allowing him to return to training hospital therapy dogs with a newfound perspective on life.</p>
