          <p>Pep Guardiola has defended his decision to exclude Jack Grealish from Manchester City's squad for their final Premier League game, emphasizing that it wasn't a personal matter. Amid speculation about Grealish's future with the club, Guardiola asserted that he fought for Grealish to join and remain at Man City, dismissing any suggestion of unhappiness with the player. He highlighted that other players were also left out and that future decisions regarding Grealish's career would be handled by the appropriate personnel. City secured a Champions League spot with a 2-0 victory over Fulham, shifting focus to potential squad changes in the summer. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Brazilian photographer and environmentalist Sebasti√£o Salgado, known for his award-winning images of nature and humanity, has died at the age of 81 due to leukemia. Salgado, who traveled the world capturing powerful images, contracted a particular form of malaria in 2010 while working on his project G√©nesis, with complications from this disease leading to his severe leukemia. The Instituto Terra, founded by Salgado and his wife, stated that his lens revealed the world and its contradictions, while his life brought the power of transformative action. Salgado's life and work were portrayed in the documentary "The Salt of the Earth." The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Students at the University of Manchester have withdrawn a motion accusing Israel of committing genocide and ethnic cleansing in Gaza following significant backlash. The motion, lodged by the Friends of Palestine group, was criticized for containing "false and one-sided allegations." Jewish students proposed amendments, including recognizing Hamas as a terrorist organization and calling for the release of hostages, but these were rejected. The UMSU apologized for the length of time it took to consider the motion and stated that it will be reviewing its democratic processes. The University of Manchester said it considered ‚Äúaspects of this motion to be wholly unacceptable‚Äù. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <h2>Emotionally Safe Parenting Described as Top New Style</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-25 13:36:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 kids, one expert suggests that emotionally safe parenting, which focuses on attunement to a child's emotional needs, is the most effective parenting style. The goal is to build emotional resilience, trust, and connection through open and honest conversations. It involves accepting emotions without rushing to fix them, responding without shaming, viewing behavior as a signal rather than defiance, and taking responsibility after conflicts. The style also emphasizes the importance of the parent doing their own inner work to become less reactive and creating an environment where children feel safe expressing themselves. The optimism score is 80.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American tennis player, won his first-round match at the French Open after a rather unusual incident. He explained that his truck was repossessed earlier this month when he changed banks and forgot to properly adjust the automatic payments for his Ford F-150. After discovering the truck was gone via his trainer's security camera footage, Paul took to social media to share the story. Thankfully, he was able to regain the truck, adding a touch of humor to his successful start at the tournament. The optimism score is 80.</p>
