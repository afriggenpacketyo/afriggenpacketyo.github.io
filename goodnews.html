          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has indicated that consumers are likely to see higher prices later this month and in June due to tariffs, even with recent agreements to lower duties on imports from China. Despite this, Walmart reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and maintained its full-year forecast, although revenue fell slightly short of estimates, marking its first quarterly revenue miss since February 2020. The company also achieved a milestone by posting its first profitable quarter for its e-commerce business in the U.S. and globally, driven by higher-margin revenue streams like online advertising.

          <p>A recent aerial engagement between Pakistan and India, where Pakistani forces used Chinese-made J-10 fighter jets with PL-15 missiles to reportedly down Indian Rafale fighter jets, has provided valuable lessons for China's defense industry. This marks a significant milestone as it offers a real-world test of the reliability and effectiveness of Chinese weaponry, something previously lacking due to China's absence from war for over four decades. The incident underscores China's advancements in developing sophisticated weapons systems and modernizing its military, prompting further innovation and development in its defense capabilities. The article suggests that while the J-10's success doesn't guarantee future dominance over the Rafale, it signifies a notable achievement for China's defense technology.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing challenges in filling key government positions, leading to a situation where several officials are simultaneously holding multiple roles. This practice, known as dual-hatting, is exemplified by officials like Todd Blanche, who serves as both the deputy attorney general and acting Librarian of Congress, and Marco Rubio, who is simultaneously the secretary of state, acting administrator of USAID, acting archivist of the United States, and acting national security advisor. The article suggests this reflects the administration's difficulty in attracting qualified candidates or a preference for a small circle of trusted figures, potentially leading to dysfunction and conflicts of interest.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods is set to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its reach and diversify its customer base. While Dick's has been financially strong, it lacks international presence, which Foot Locker offers with its 2,400 stores across 20 countries. However, investors showed concern due to Foot Locker's declining sales and store closures. Together, the retailers will navigate challenges such as new import tariffs and competition from brands selling directly to consumers.</p>

          <p>President Trump made his first publicly known visit to a mosque as president during a trip to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The visit was part of a larger diplomatic tour through the Middle East. Trump's visit to the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque, known for its marble domes and flower inlays, included removing his shoes, as is customary. The visit marks a shift from his earlier stance on Islam, including suggesting mosques should be under surveillance.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing debate over the role of rules and limitations in children's literature, examining whether it should prioritize education, entertainment, or a balance of both. Throughout history, opinions have varied, with some arguing for simplified stories that impart moral lessons and others advocating for exposing children to complex and uncensored works. As children's reading habits decline, the article suggests that a hyperfocus on analytical reading in schools may be diminishing the organic enjoyment and love of books.</p>
