          <h2>New 'Superman' Film Explores Themes of Universal Morality and Kindness Amidst Political Scrutiny</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, portrays the hero as a symbol of universal kindness rather than just American exceptionalism, a choice that has drawn criticism from some right-wing commentators. The article explores the historical context of Superman as a character created by Jewish immigrants to defend the weak, framing him as a "moral immigrant." This interpretation aligns with Gunn's outspoken political views and positions the film within the ongoing cultural debate over the political leanings of superhero franchises.</p>

          <p>All 31 construction workers trapped deep underground were successfully rescued following a partial collapse in a large industrial sanitation tunnel in Los Angeles. The incident occurred about 400 feet below the surface, with the cave-in happening between the workers and the tunnel's entrance. The crew managed to navigate over the debris to a boring machine and were then transported to safety with no major injuries reported, an outcome officials celebrated as a victory.</p>

After Boakai's remarks, Trump asked where he learned to speak so well, to which the Liberian leader replied he learned in his home country. The exchange occurred at a meeting where Trump promised a shift from aid to trade with the African nations present.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the qualities to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's institutional credibility and strong macroeconomic fundamentals like low inflation and large foreign reserves. The assertion comes as confidence in the US dollar is being tested by debt risks and protectionist trade policies. The official noted the yuan has already shown stability and reduced sensitivity to global stress, suggesting it exhibits partial safe-haven characteristics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for weight-loss medication in China is rapidly expanding, with sales projected to reach significant figures as numerous domestic pharmaceutical companies compete for market share. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by new, more effective drugs and increasing obesity rates. Innovent Biologics, a Jiangsu-based firm, became the first domestic company to receive approval to market its weight-loss drug within the country, signaling a new phase in this nascent industry.</p>

          <p>Vienna is often cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its robust social housing system, which comprises about 43% of the city's housing stock and serves a wide range of income levels. This system, originating from the "Red Vienna" era of the 1920s, has kept rent levels significantly lower than in the private market and has remained stable despite privatization pressures seen elsewhere. While the model is lauded for its positive impact on affordability, challenges remain regarding the complexity of the allocation system for newcomers.</p>

          <p>A team of scientists at the Beijing Institute of Technology has successfully created a cyborg bee by equipping it with the world's lightest brain controller. The 74-milligram device, which is lighter than a sack of nectar, uses three needles to send electronic pulses to the bee's brain. This allows researchers to create illusions that command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high rate of success.</p>
