          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner has stated that the club must retain captain Marc Guehi to ensure a successful season, amid transfer interest from Liverpool. Guehi, who has one year left on his contract and scored in a recent victory, has been the subject of a £35 million bid. Glasner emphasized that the club has no replacement lined up and that there was an agreement to only sell the crucial player if a suitable substitute was secured. Despite Guehi indicating he won't sign a new contract, the manager remains firm on keeping the team's key defender as the transfer window deadline approaches.</p>

          <p>In an interview at the Telluride Film Festival, Oscar-winning director Chloé Zhao discussed her latest film, "Hamnet," an adaptation of Maggie O’Farrell’s novel about William Shakespeare's family and the death of their son. Zhao described the period after her Marvel film "Eternals" as a "very painful fire," which led to a profound personal shift and a return to more intimate filmmaking. She explained her initial hesitation to direct a period piece about motherhood and Shakespeare, but ultimately found a deep connection to the story's themes of grief and existence. The film, starring Jessie Buckley and Paul Mescal, received a rapturous reception at its premiere.</p>

This marks the first time in his career that Alcaraz has reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam tournament without losing a single set, showcasing his consistent and dominant form. At 22, he has now become the youngest man in the Open Era to reach 13 Grand Slam quarter-finals, surpassing a record set by Boris Becker in 1990. His performance reinforces his position as a strong contender to continue his impressive run of reaching the final in his last seven events.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles won their third straight men's Hundred title by defeating the Trent Rockets by 26 runs in the final at Lord's. Will Jacks was instrumental in the victory, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls, the highest individual score in a men's Hundred final, to help his team post a total of 168-5. Despite a late rally from the Rockets, led by Marcus Stoinis's 64, their chase fell short. Invincibles' leg-spinner Nathan Sowter delivered a crucial performance, taking three key wickets to dismantle the Rockets' batting lineup and secure the championship.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has issued an emergency order to halt the Trump administration's plan to deport nearly 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a lawsuit arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of their due process rights to seek asylum. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan's order prevents the deportations for at least 14 days, ensuring the children are removed from planes and returned to government facilities while the case proceeds. The government contended it was reuniting children with their parents, a claim disputed by the children's attorneys.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the Trump administration's plan to deport hundreds of unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala, with some flights reportedly already preparing for takeoff. Judge Sparkle Sooknanan's order, which will last 14 days, came after lawyers argued the effort unlawfully circumvented legal protections that allow minors to seek humanitarian relief. The Justice Department claimed it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, but this was disputed by the children's advocates. The judge called the order "extraordinary" but justified it due to the government's hurried actions over a holiday weekend.</p>

          <p>Liverpool defeated Arsenal 1-0 in a tightly contested Premier League match at Anfield, with Dominik Szoboszlai's spectacular late free-kick deciding the outcome. The game was characterized by a cautious and defensive approach from Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta, which ultimately failed to secure a point. The result extends Arsenal's winless streak at Anfield to 13 league games and provides Liverpool with a significant early-season psychological advantage over a key title rival. Despite not being at their best, Liverpool maintained their perfect start to the season with a third consecutive win.</p>

Zirinsky recounts convincing Knoller to join CBS News and highlights his transition into the role of White House radio correspondent, where he became a revered institution. She emphasizes his role as the "unofficial records keeper of presidential statistics," a savant whose detailed logs of every presidential action were an invaluable resource for journalists and even the White House itself. The tribute portrays Knoller not just as a legendary journalist but also as a selfless, warm, and quirky friend who will be deeply missed.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay announced that he was recently diagnosed with skin cancer and has undergone surgery to remove a basal cell carcinoma from the side of his face. He shared photos of the bandage and stitches on Instagram, using the experience to urge his followers to wear sunscreen. Basal cell carcinoma is the most common form of skin cancer and is rarely life-threatening, with a very high cure rate when detected and treated early. This is not the first time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to advocate for safety, having previously promoted helmet use after a serious bicycle accident.</p>

          <p>Despite its price holding steady, market data suggests a potential breakout for Bitcoin as both institutional and retail investors are accumulating the asset at a historic pace. Research from Bitwise indicates that corporate treasuries have added over 140,000 BTC in July and August alone, with institutional demand now outpacing new supply by more than six times. Simultaneously, accumulation across all wallet sizes, from small holders to large whales, has reached its highest level since April. This synchronized buying pressure from different market segments is often seen by analysts as a bullish precursor to significant price increases. (not investment advice)</p>
