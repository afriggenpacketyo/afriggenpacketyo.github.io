          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 01:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sky-watchers across much of the UK are anticipating a stunning total lunar eclipse, known as a "Blood Moon," which will turn the full Moon red as it passes through Earth's shadow. The full eclipse occurs between 18:30 and 19:52, with visibility in the UK depending on location, as eastern parts get the longest view while western regions may only catch a glimpse. Dr. Edward Bloomer of the Royal Observatory Greenwich encourages viewing, highlighting it as a chance to witness the mechanics of the solar system. This reddish appearance is a result of Rayleigh scattering, where light illuminating the Moon passes through Earth's atmosphere, creating an effect similar to a global sunset.</p>

          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy is embarking on his first major music tour in 45 years, a challenge that required him to relearn his own classic hits and even take guitar lessons. The 66-year-old, who achieved pop stardom and acting success in the 1970s, had largely stepped away from performing to focus on a successful career as a television writer and producer. Cassidy, who admits he was never comfortable with the limelight, expressed that his old songs feel new to him after the long hiatus, and he believes his voice is stronger now. The 50-city "The Road to Us Tour" will span his full career, featuring classic hits, new music, and personal stories, kicking off on September 13.</p>

Thomas expressed his deep gratitude for being able to finish his career on home roads, calling it an "amazing way to finish" this significant chapter.

          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders joined New York City mayoral frontrunner Zohran Mamdani at a Brooklyn town hall, emphasizing a collective fight against oligarchic control and advocating for progressive policies. Mamdani, a Democratic socialist, advocates for freezing rent, increasing housing, and raising taxes for the wealthiest 1%, drawing strong support from progressive groups and celebrities like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Sanders hailed Mamdani's campaign as a grassroots movement, contrasting it with billionaire-backed candidates and criticizing mainstream Democrats for their muted support, calling it a "test case of whether democracy is still able to prevail." The event also highlighted concerns over Trump's potential deployment of national guard troops to New York, with Mamdani outlining plans to defend immigrant communities.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans delivered a commanding 59-20 victory over Clay Helton’s Georgia Southern team, showcasing an explosive offense that amassed 755 yards, the most for USC in two decades. Junior quarterback Jayden Maiava led the charge, throwing four touchdowns and shattering his career high with 412 passing yards before the fourth quarter even began. The rushing attack also excelled, gaining 309 yards, the most of the Lincoln Riley era, with Waymond Jordan contributing 167 yards. Despite some defensive breakdowns and six penalties, USC's offensive firepower proved overwhelming, securing a dominant win and providing valuable experience for backup players, though Coach Riley noted the team is "still a long ways off from our best."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint US-China research team has developed an innovative method for launching millimeter-scale robots using the energy from rapidly collapsing vapor bubbles. This novel technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets on the surface around the material to boil, which triggers the formation of vapor bubbles. Once these bubbles grow to a certain point, they suddenly collapse, rapidly releasing energy and creating a strong force capable of launching the tiny jumpers up to 1.5 meters (5 feet) into the air. By controlling the flow of light, scientists can change how and where these jumpers launch from a wet surface and can even get the small pieces of material to swim in water, demonstrating cavitation as an efficient propulsion mechanism.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka secured her second consecutive US Open title, a victory described as deeply significant due to the emotional and strategic challenges she overcame throughout the season. The world number one had dominated the WTA Tour but had previously faltered in Grand Slam finals, leading to questions about her emotional strength and ability to perform under pressure. This article highlights her mature and disciplined performance against Amanda Anisimova, a stark contrast to earlier losses at the Australian and French Opens. Her long-time coach Anton Dubrov and new addition Max Mirnyi helped her evolve her game, focusing on versatility and enhancing her powerful groundstrokes, culminating in a triumph that showcased her inner peace and control on court.</p>

          <p>Schools across the U.S. are increasingly adopting locked magnetic pouches, like those from Yondr, to enforce cellphone bans in classrooms, impacting millions of students in 35 states. This solution aims to reduce distractions and foster a more engaged learning environment, with many educators and parents welcoming the change, as 70% of high school teachers report cellphones are a major distraction. Students place their phones in these pouches upon entering school, which are then locked magnetically and unlocked upon departure. While some students express skepticism or attempt to bypass the system, initial reports from districts like Yonkers suggest benefits such as increased student interaction during lunch, signaling a potential culture shift towards less digital reliance and more in-person engagement.</p>

          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special gifts and met a player after an adult woman controversially took a home run ball from him at a Miami Marlins game, an incident that went viral. Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, whose father initially retrieved it and gave it to him, only for a woman to demand it, claiming it was hers and that it was "in my hands." Following the public outcry, a Marlins staffer promptly gifted the boy a bag of team swag, and Phillies outfielder Harrison Bader, who hit the home run, personally met the young fan and gave him an autographed baseball bat, turning a negative experience into a memorable one.</p>

          <p>Reform UK, a political party largely dominated by its leader Nigel Farage, is actively working to broaden its leadership and promote new candidates ahead of upcoming elections, aiming to shed its "one-man-band" image. The party seeks to significantly increase its electoral footprint in councils and parliaments, necessitating a larger pool of vetted candidates to contest polls in London, Wales, and Scotland next year. The recent conference served as a platform to showcase hopefuls like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, both former Conservatives disillusioned with their old party. While Farage remains central, Reform UK is implementing more rigorous vetting and assessment centers for its expanding "people's army" of volunteers, aiming for 5,000 candidates.</p>

          <p>Former soldier Dr. Bex Bennett, who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, is advocating for greater recognition and support for women who performed dangerous front-line military roles. She co-founded "Sisters in Service," a community interest company that has recruited 160 female veterans working in healthcare across the UK, providing a crucial support network. Dr. Bennett believes many people hold outdated ideas about women's military service, leading to isolation for female veterans who often avoid traditional support spaces like Royal British Legion clubs due to misconceptions. The group aims to create a "cathartic" environment for women to connect, discuss shared experiences, and overcome challenges in civilian life, emphasizing that it's "OK to ask for help" after service.</p>
