          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto of the Los Angeles Dodgers had a tough outing, allowing five runs in five innings, leading to a 5-3 defeat against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Gabriel Moreno's grand slam in the fourth inning and Ketel Marte's solo home run in the fifth contributed to Yamamoto's struggles. Despite Shohei Ohtani hitting his 11th home run of the season in the ninth, it wasn't enough to spark a comeback for the Dodgers, who face increased competition within their division. This article describes Yamamoto's worst performance of the season, impacting the Dodgers' standing in a competitive National League West.</p>

          <p>Chinese government data reveals that exports from China jumped last month, fueled by trade to Southeast Asian countries, even as President Trump‚Äôs tariffs on Chinese goods forced a sharp slowdown in shipments to the United States. Inside China, imports fell as demand continued to weaken. The trade numbers released on Friday capture activity in April, when tensions between the United States and China escalated more rapidly than expected. As a result, Chinese shipments to the United States plunged by 21 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. But Chinese exports to Southeast Asian countries surged by 21 percent.</p>

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which offset a sharp drop in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports jumped 8.1% year-on-year, while shipments to the U.S. plunged over 21%. This shift indicates a redirection of trade, with Southeast Asia becoming a key market for Chinese goods. The surge in overall exports could be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>
