          <p>The newly merged Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, with sources suggesting a potential offer price between $22 and $24 per share. This development comes as Warner Bros. Discovery announced plans to separate its global TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. The potential acquisition could preempt that split, creating a massive media conglomerate with a vast portfolio of networks, sports rights, and two major film studios. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail companies are increasingly using a "B2B2C" business model to reduce the impact of tariffs on consumer prices. This strategy involves routing online sales through a middleman company, which acts as the merchant of record and pays tariffs on the product's lower wholesale price rather than its retail price. While this method, dubbed "tariff hacking," helps companies like Tod's Group and Yours Clothing avoid passing costs to consumers, some logistics experts warn it's a short-term solution that could face future regulatory scrutiny.</p>

The festival continues to evolve, with an increased focus on regional, organic, and vegetarian food options, as well as a sustainability initiative aiming for the event to be climate-neutral by 2028.</p>

The couple, who had lived and run a charity in Afghanistan for decades, were detained in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws, though the specific reasons were never disclosed. Their release was secured through Qatari mediation, and their family expressed immense gratitude to the mediators and the UK government for their diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a $25,000 home equity loan has decreased slightly. For example, a 10-year loan at the current average rate of 8.43% would cost approximately $309 per month, a minor reduction from previous months. While the savings are not substantial, home equity loans remain a more affordable borrowing option compared to high-interest credit cards or personal loans, and further Fed cuts could lead to additional cost reductions.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. During his state visit, Trump advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a method he has employed at the U.S. southern border. However, UK Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the country's military is focused on national defense, while the UK Border Force, which has a working relationship with the navy, is responsible for policing borders.</p>

          <p>Republican pollster Christine Matthews has identified a new potential group of swing voters for the 2026 midterm elections: "weighted vest women." This cohort, comprising about one in six women, is described as being under 45, suburban, well-educated, and politically engaged. While this group narrowly favored President Trump in 2024, they are currently split evenly between Republicans and Democrats in a generic congressional ballot, making them a crucial demographic to watch as both parties vie for control of Congress.</p>

While the iPhone 17 Pro model saw a $100 price increase, Cook clarified that the company has managed to avoid passing tariff costs on to consumers. To achieve this, Apple has been shifting its supply chain, increasingly importing iPhones into the U.S. from countries with lower tariffs, such as India and Vietnam, rather than relying solely on its traditional manufacturing base in China.</p>
