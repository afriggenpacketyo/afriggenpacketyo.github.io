          <p>Intel's stock experienced a significant surge following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a stake in the company to bolster domestic chip manufacturing. This potential government investment aims to support Intel's new factories in Ohio and aligns with a broader strategy of increasing US production of high-tech components. The move comes as Intel faces challenges in its foundry business and has recently scaled back some European and domestic expansion plans. This reflects a trend of increased government intervention in key industries to advance national security and economic interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the earning potential of a high-yield savings account with a $50,000 deposit, highlighting the significant advantage over traditional savings accounts. With current top rates around 4.35%, savers could earn over $2,000 in interest annually, though these variable rates are subject to change. The piece notes the likelihood of future Federal Reserve rate cuts, which could eventually lower these returns. It advises savers to act sooner rather than later to capitalize on the current favorable interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court allowed a Mississippi social media law to take effect, but a concurring opinion from Justice Brett Kavanaugh offers significant insight into the Court's thinking. Kavanaugh suggested the law likely violates the First Amendment but voted with the majority because the challengers had not proven irreparable harm, a standard for emergency relief. This opinion signals that the First Amendment remains largely protected from broad restrictions and clarifies that the 'shadow docket' rules, which the court seemed to relax for the Trump administration, may still apply to other litigants. The analysis suggests a return to stricter standards for most cases seeking emergency intervention.</p>

          <p>David Zervos, a potential candidate to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve chair, has publicly advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts to stimulate the economy. The Jefferies chief market strategist argued for a half-percentage-point cut, stating that current monetary policy is too restrictive and that easing could prevent a labor market slowdown. Zervos, one of nearly a dozen names being considered for the top Fed post, believes more market-savvy individuals are needed in policy-making roles. His position aligns with President Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to lower rates significantly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Welsh wing Louis Rees-Zammit is returning to rugby union, signing with the Bristol Bears for the 2025-26 season after an 18-month stint pursuing an NFL career. The 24-year-old, who previously played for Gloucester, was part of the NFL's International Player Pathway and spent time on the training squads for two teams but did not play a regular-season game. Rees-Zammit, a celebrated player with 32 caps for Wales, stated Bristol's attacking style of play was a key factor in his decision. His return is highly anticipated in the rugby world, with a potential call-up to the Welsh national team this autumn.</p>

          <p>With signs of a weakening job market and potential for reignited inflation, market experts are advising investors to exercise caution and stick to long-term strategies. One analyst warns that this 'is not the environment to be a hero,' suggesting investors should avoid making large, risky bets on speculative assets. The advice emphasizes the importance of maintaining a diversified portfolio and regular rebalancing to manage risk effectively. While some indicators like corporate earnings remain strong, the general sentiment is that economic headwinds warrant a disciplined, rather than an emotional, approach to investing.

          <p>Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are developing advanced AI to enable humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in real-world, human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training robots by collecting data from humans wearing motion-capture sensors, teaching the machines to replicate tasks with human-like precision and force. The goal is to move beyond repetitive industrial robotics and create machines that can safely assist with household chores or in medical settings. The research focuses on making robots adaptable to constantly changing surroundings, a key challenge in bringing AI into the physical world.</p>

          <p>Since its 2020 public debut, AI software company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700%, reaching a market valuation that rivals tech giants with far greater revenue. The company's growth is heavily fueled by government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its first-ever billion-dollar revenue quarter. Despite a massive increase in its stock price, its revenue remains a fraction of its megacap peers, resulting in a very high forward price-to-earnings ratio. This indicates that investors are paying a significant premium based on high expectations for its future in AI. (not investment advice)</p>
