        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The massive electricity requirements of AI data centers are fueling a resurgence in nuclear energy, with public and market perception becoming more favorable towards it. In Michigan, the decommissioned Palisades Nuclear Plant is being revived and will also host the nation's first small modular reactors (SMRs) to meet this demand. Tech giants like Microsoft and Google are investing in restarting old plants and funding new ones to power their operations, with figures like Bill Gates championing the technology. While SMRs promise a scalable solution, experts note regulatory and cost challenges remain, though public support for nuclear power has steadily increased over the past decade.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has won her second WTA 1,000 title by defeating Linda Noskova of the Czech Republic in the China Open final. Anisimova, who has had a strong year with runner-up finishes at Wimbledon and the US Open, won the match with a score of 6-0, 2-6, 6-2. After a dominant first set, Noskova rallied to win the second by adopting a more aggressive strategy. However, Anisimova regained control in the final set to secure the championship, describing the victory as a special moment in an incredible few weeks of competition.</p>

          <p>In his new memoir, singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, widely known as Cat Stevens, delves into his lifelong spiritual quest, his rise to fame, and his controversial departure from the music industry. He discusses how his search for meaning led him to embrace Islam, change his name, and leave his career behind for nearly three decades after being told music was forbidden. Yusuf explains that he later realized this was a misinterpretation and has since returned to performing under the name Yusuf/Cat Stevens, viewing it as a symbol that joins his past and present. The book aims to provide context for his life, including his controversial remarks regarding Salman Rushdie in 1989.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in relationships argues that the most common source of conflict for couples is not money or chores, but rather the tone of voice used during conversations. Research indicates that nonverbal cues, especially tone, carry more emotional weight than the actual words spoken, turning simple questions into perceived accusations. The article advises partners to become self-aware and pause to rephrase their statements if their tone becomes harsh. For those on the receiving end, it is recommended to calmly ask their partner to try again, interrupting the cycle of escalation without becoming defensive, thereby fostering more productive communication.</p>

          <p>As states across the U.S. mandate or consider restrictions on cellphone use in schools, institutions like Jericho High School in New York are observing significant changes in student behavior. Although some students initially experienced 'separation anxiety,' many now report being more engaged in class discussions and finding subjects more interesting without the distraction of their phones. School administrators note that cafeterias have become louder as students talk to each other more, fostering better communication skills. While parents have expressed concerns about safety and contact, schools are emphasizing that they can be reached in an emergency, and the bans are seen as beneficial for students' social and academic development.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the current U.S.-proposed peace plan represents the closest that negotiators have come to securing the release of all hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. While expressing optimism, Rubio cautioned that significant obstacles remain and that key details of the deal still need to be finalized. He emphasized the urgency of the situation, particularly for the first phase involving the return of hostages, stating that the process cannot be allowed to drag on for weeks. U.S. envoys are heading to Cairo to participate in further negotiations, with the hope that most of the agreement can be worked out quickly.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a request from President Trump, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is developing a proposal that could end the requirement for public companies to file quarterly financial reports, shifting instead to a semi-annual schedule. The change aims to reduce costs and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term results. While this could save companies significant time and money, it poses a major threat to the revenue of the 'Big Four' accounting firms that audit these reports. These firms have previously argued that quarterly reporting is crucial for investor transparency and market stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Psychologist Jean Twenge asserts that the single most important rule for parents in a high-tech world is to prohibit electronic devices in their children's bedrooms overnight. This straightforward and cost-free rule is crucial for protecting sleep, which is vital for the physical and mental health of developing children and adolescents. Research shows that late-night device use is a primary cause of insufficient sleep among teens, which in turn is a risk factor for depression and other health issues. Twenge advises parents to establish this rule early, but notes that it is possible, though challenging, to implement it with older children who are already accustomed to having their devices.</p>

          <p>The romance fiction genre has become a dominant force in the publishing industry, largely due to its highly engaged and collaborative community of readers and authors, known as 'Romancelandia.' This 'open-elite network' fosters mutual support, allowing writers to adapt quickly to new technologies and market trends, from self-publishing on Kindle to leveraging platforms like TikTok. Unlike other genres, romance authors often see themselves as entrepreneurs, publishing frequently and interacting directly with their fanbase through social media and book clubs. This business-minded, community-driven approach has made the genre a consistent profit engine and a model that other areas of publishing are now trying to emulate.</p>

The bill also revives a more generous calculation for deducting business loan interest and makes the 20% Qualified Business Income (QBI) deduction permanent.

          <p>This opinion article argues that the European Union should prioritize addressing the expansion of U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum goods over its current trade dispute with China regarding electric vehicles. The author contends that Washington's 'derivative' tariffs, which now apply to hundreds of new items like parts for wind turbines and railcars, pose a more immediate and significant threat to European suppliers and climate policy goals. The piece suggests that Brussels should seek a compromise with Beijing on the EV issue, such as a minimum price framework, to free up political capital to push back against the more damaging U.S. trade measures.</p>

Barrett, who provided a key vote to overturn Roe v.

She emphasized her commitment to her judicial philosophy of originalism, which she says guides her approach to all cases, including those involving President Trump, by focusing on the institution of the presidency rather than the individual.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent tax changes signed into law by President Trump will affect how Americans approach year-end charitable giving. A key provision, effective in 2026, introduces a new deduction for non-itemizers, allowing them to claim up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for joint filers, which may incentivize delaying smaller donations. Conversely, higher earners could see their charitable deduction benefits shrink in 2026 due to a new income-based floor and a cap on the benefit for those in the top tax bracket. Financial experts suggest that these changes encourage a multi-year planning approach, potentially front-loading donations into 2025 using tools like donor-advised funds. (not investment advice)</p>
