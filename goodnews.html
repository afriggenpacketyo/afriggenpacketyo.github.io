          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely rose on Friday, as investors keenly anticipated U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the annual economic symposium for insights into future interest rate decisions. South Korea's Kospi and Japan's Topix posted gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 saw a decline after crossing the 9,000 mark the previous day. The article notes that U.S. stocks fell for a fifth consecutive day, with the S&P 500 sliding, and Fed funds futures indicate a nearly 74% likelihood of a rate cut in September. This global market focus on U.S. monetary policy highlights the interconnectedness of economies and the significant influence of central bank guidance on investor sentiment and regional performance.

          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to cap tariffs on EU pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports at 15%, a significant reduction from his previous threats of up to 250%. This detail emerged from the in-depth release of the US-EU trade deal, initially announced last month. The agreement also links reduced tariffs on European car exports to the EU removing duties on all US industrial goods, a move requiring new legislation. While welcomed by industries like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors, sectors such as wine and spirits expressed disappointment at their exclusion from tariff exemptions. This article details the specific outcomes and conditions of the new trade pact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has revised an earlier order regarding stray dogs in New Delhi, now mandating that captured animals be sterilized and immunized before release, except for rabid or aggressive cases. The court also prohibited public feeding of stray dogs, directing civic bodies to establish designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action for non-compliance. This modification follows widespread protests from animal rights activists against the initial order for mass removals. The court aims to frame a nationwide policy, addressing both public safety concerns regarding dog bite incidents and promoting more humane animal welfare practices across the country.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:39:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate in July cooled to 3.1%, lower than the previous month but still exceeding economists' expectations of 3%. This figure, which excludes fresh food, marks the lowest since March, primarily due to easing rice prices after months of significant increases that had surged past 100%. The Bank of Japan closely monitors inflation, and this persistent above-target reading could influence future monetary policy decisions, with some analysts suggesting a rate hike in September or October. The article highlights the complex inflationary environment in Japan and its potential impact on central bank actions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Controversial former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of charges of insulting the monarchy, which could have resulted in a 15-year jail sentence. The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he commented on the 2014 military coup, alleging palace involvement. Critics argue Thailand's lese majeste law is often used to target political opponents, and the court's literal interpretation of the law, noting he didn't name specific individuals, led to the rare acquittal. This verdict offers relief to the Shinawatra family, whose political influence faces ongoing challenges amidst a shifting political landscape in Thailand.</p>

          <p>The UK government is launching a significant crackdown on individuals wrongly claiming child benefit while residing outside the country, aiming to save £350 million over five years. A new specialist team will utilize travel data to identify claimants who exceed the eight-week eligibility limit for being abroad, unless exceptional circumstances apply, such as medical treatment or family bereavement. This initiative follows a successful pilot program that recovered £17 million from 2,600 incorrect claims in less than a year. The move also seeks to raise awareness of the rules and is part of broader efforts to tackle rising benefit fraud across various government programs.</p>

          <p>Adidas executives have issued a public apology to the Indigenous community of Villa Hidalgo Yalalag in Oaxaca, Mexico, for culturally appropriating their traditional huarache sandal design. The company admitted its 'Oaxaca Slip-On' shoe, created by designer Willy Chavarria, too closely resembled the community's traditional crafts without proper consultation. This apology follows national attention and criticism, including from President Claudia Sheinbaum, who advocated for stronger protections against global brands copying Indigenous designs.
