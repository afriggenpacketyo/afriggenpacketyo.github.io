          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix after an exceptionally turbulent qualifying session marked by a record six red flags. The session, which lasted two hours, saw multiple crashes, including from championship contender Oscar Piastri and Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in the final part of qualifying. Williams' Carlos Sainz will start second, with Racing Bulls' Liam Lawson in third, while title rivals Piastri and Lando Norris will start further down the grid. The frequent interruptions and light rain created unpredictable conditions, challenging drivers and teams throughout the event.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., North Carolina resident John Saunby is building his dream home from the storm's wreckage. After the hurricane demolished homes in the Appalachian Mountains, Saunby began salvaging materials like porch posts and floorboards from the debris, viewing the woods as being "full of treasure." With help from his partner, Appalachian recording artist Jenny Kimmel, he is constructing a unique house featuring Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports. The project represents a story of resilience and creative rebuilding in the face of natural disaster.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne made a triumphant return from concussion, scoring two crucial tries that helped England overcome a determined French side. Despite an early lead, England faced strong resistance and held a narrow 7-5 advantage at halftime before pulling away in the second half with tries from their dominant forward pack. The Red Roses will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Twickenham's Allianz Stadium next weekend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market achieved record highs this week, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq responding positively to the Federal Reserve's decision to cut its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-point. This was the first rate reduction since last December, and central bankers hinted at the possibility of two more cuts in the coming year. In other market news, Nvidia announced a significant partnership with Intel, and Apple launched its new iPhone 17 line, receiving an upgraded price target from JPMorgan. The positive market sentiment was also reflected in trades made by the CNBC Investing Club. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Peter and Barbie Reynolds, an elderly British couple held in Afghanistan for nearly eight months, have been released and have arrived back in the United Kingdom. The couple, aged 80 and 76, had lived in the country for 18 years running a charitable education program and were detained by the Taliban in February for allegedly breaking Afghan laws. Their release was brokered by Qatar and follows months of lobbying by their family, who had expressed grave concerns about their health in detention. Upon their release, the couple expressed a desire to eventually return to Afghanistan to continue their work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to block U.S. Steel from shutting down its plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising new "golden share" rights. These rights, a condition of the company's recent $14.1 billion takeover by Japan's Nippon, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After U.S. Steel informed nearly 800 workers of the planned closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company the administration would not permit it, leading U.S. Steel to reverse its decision. This marks the first use of these national-security-related powers.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, Monica Lewinsky reflected on her journey from being a subject of international scorn in the 1990s to becoming an anti-bullying activist and producer. She explained that a turning point came after learning about the suicide of Tyler Clementi, which inspired her to become a "poster child for having survived shame." Lewinsky discussed how younger generations, unswayed by the political "brainwashing" of the time, helped shift the perception of her story by focusing on the power imbalance. She emphasized the importance of telling one's own story, healing from trauma, and finding humor in adversity.</p>

          <p>A recent phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has raised hopes for improved stability in the bilateral relationship. During the "productive" two-hour conversation, the leaders discussed trade and a deal concerning TikTok, and also planned to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea. Trump also indicated he plans to visit China early next year. Despite these positive signals, analysts remain cautious, pointing to significant friction points such as tensions in the Taiwan Strait and potential U.S. tariffs over China's purchases of Russian oil.</p>

          <p>A growing number of American students are opting to apply to colleges in Europe, the UK, and Asia, driven by rising tuition costs and political turmoil in the United States. Data shows a steady increase in U.S. students studying abroad over the past five years, with consultants noting a particular surge in interest since the 2024 election. For many, the significantly lower tuition fees at many European universities are a primary motivator, offering a path to higher education without incurring substantial debt. Students are also attracted by the opportunity to gain an international perspective and experience different cultures.</p>

          <p>Louisa Serene Schneider, a former Wall Street executive, founded the ear-piercing company Rowan in 2017 after identifying a market gap for a safer, more celebratory piercing experience. She quit her high-paying job to start the business from her attic, initially offering an at-home service with registered nurses. Today, Rowan operates 90 studios across the U.S., employs over 550 nurses, and brought in over $70 million in revenue last year. The company's unique model, which combines medical safety with a retail environment, has proven highly successful and profitable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Adam Friedman, many people are unaware that they can be exposed to harmful UV rays even while indoors. While windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper, accelerate skin aging, and are also associated with skin cancer. He describes UVA as a "silent killer" because the exposure happens without any burning sensation. Dr. Friedman recommends using a "broad-spectrum" sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to protect against both types of rays, and to reapply it if spending extended time outdoors or near windows.</p>
