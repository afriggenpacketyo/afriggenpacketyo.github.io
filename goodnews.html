          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced her concerns regarding potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits for Alaskans in President Trump's proposed reconciliation bill. While she hasn't set any absolute red lines, she has made it clear that cuts harming Alaskan beneficiaries are unacceptable, given the state's high healthcare costs and the significant number of children relying on Medicaid. Murkowski emphasizes the need to address entitlement spending but not at the expense of the most vulnerable, noting that 40% of Alaska's children are on Medicaid. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the bill by July 4, but the deadline is approaching quickly, so the negotiations must be expedited. The senator will communicate her concerns every step of the way.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell more than 2% after President Donald Trump indicated he would delay a decision on striking Iran to allow space for potential negotiations regarding its nuclear program.

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with initial rides in the Model Y expected to begin on June 22. Access to the vehicles will be by invitation only, and rides will occur in a geofenced area of the city, monitored by remote drivers as a backup. Elon Musk stated that robotaxis will operate only in the safest parts of Austin, with remote operations centers providing oversight. Wall Street analysts believe robotaxis could propel Tesla's market capitalization to over $2 trillion by the end of next year, though setbacks are expected.</p>

          <p>Tesla has signed its first deal to construct a grid-scale battery power plant in China, which is expected to be the largest of its kind in the country. The project, valued at 4 billion yuan ($556 million), involves Tesla, the Shanghai local government, and China Kangfu International Leasing. Utility-scale battery energy storage systems help balance electricity supply and demand, particularly with intermittent energy sources like solar and wind. Tesla's Shanghai factory produced over 100 Megapacks in the first quarter, with each Megapack providing up to 1 megawatt of power for four hours, effectively regulating urban electricity and ensuring stable demand.</p>

The Terminally Ill Adults Bill was approved by a vote of 314 to 291, with a majority of 23 MPs. Kim Leadbeater, the Labour MP who shepherded the bill through the Commons, expressed joy at the outcome. Critics argue that the bill risks people being coerced into seeking an assisted death, but Leadbeater said she was "100% confident" that sufficient safeguards were in place.</p>

          <p>The Offer in Compromise (OIC) program allows qualified taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed to the IRS. The IRS evaluates eligibility based on ability to pay, income, expenses, and asset equity, with strict criteria and a thorough evaluation process. Applicants must complete Form 656 and detailed financial statements, and the offer needs to equal or exceed the IRS's calculation of reasonable collection potential. Applying requires substantial paperwork, a non-refundable application fee, and an initial payment, and working with a qualified tax debt professional can improve chances of success.

          <p>Haim's fourth LP, "I Quit," explores the space between a breakup and moving on, reflecting on what was learned from a relationship that didn't work. The album features songs that go in multiple directions, blending various genres and styles, and revisiting familiar comforts. The lyrics delve into nostalgia and personal experiences, with sharp and introspective moments, as in "The Farm," which touches on emotional distance and family support. With contributions from Justin Vernon, the album navigates the complexities of choosing who to leave behind and who to embrace.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Securing Low Student Loan Rates for Fall 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 12:12:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Securing low student loan rates for fall 2025 involves starting with federal loans, as federal undergraduate loan rates will drop to 6.39% for loans disbursed between July 1, 2025, and June 30, 2026. It's important to shop around among private lenders for better rates, optimize your credit profile, and use a cosigner if possible. Taking advantage of rate discounts and incentives and considering shorter repayment terms can also help secure lower rates. Students should compare APRs, fees, and repayment terms to find the most affordable options.</p>

          <h2>Scottish Government to Ban WhatsApp on Government Phones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 12:11:25 EDT</div>

          <p>The Scottish government is ending the use of WhatsApp and other "non-corporate" messaging services for government business on its mobile devices to increase openness and transparency. This decision follows the UK Covid Inquiry, which revealed that officials and ministers had deleted WhatsApp messages exchanged during the pandemic. Deputy First Minister Kate Forbes said the policy would increase "openness and transparency" in government, and ministers and staff should use corporate-approved apps like Teams and email. Opposition MSPs have said the new policy is a "clear admission" from the government that it was wrong to delete messages from during the pandemic.</p>
