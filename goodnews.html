          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a conservative backed by Donald Trump, narrowly won Poland's presidential election against liberal Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, reflecting deep divisions within the country. The outcome suggests Poland will likely pursue a more populist and nationalist direction under Nawrocki's leadership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen expressed confidence in continued EU-Poland cooperation following the election. While most day-to-day power resides with the prime minister, the president influences foreign policy and can veto legislation, potentially hindering Prime Minister Donald Tusk's ability to fulfill electoral promises, made to both voters and the EU, such as loosening abortion laws and reforming the court system.</p>

The 7-Eleven store will receive a $1-million payout for selling the winning ticket. The store manager described the event as the most exciting thing to happen in his years of working there.</p>
