          <p>Donald Trump's attempt to overturn a civil jury verdict finding him liable for sexually assaulting writer E. Jean Carroll in the mid-1990s and defaming her has failed.

Carroll's attorney, Roberta Kaplan, expressed satisfaction with the decision, stating that Trump remains liable for sexual assault and defamation. Trump's legal team indicated they would seek an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>
