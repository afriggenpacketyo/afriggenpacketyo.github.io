          <p>German defense firm Renk is actively recruiting talent from the struggling automotive sector to support its rapid expansion driven by rising geopolitical tensions and increased military spending. The company, a leader in tank gearbox manufacturing, has seen its stock price soar and order book jump significantly. This cross-industry collaboration involves hiring engineers from the automotive industry, leveraging their expertise in areas like continuous improvement and efficiency. While Germany's largest trade union acknowledges the potential for job creation, it cautions against a one-sided industrial policy focused on rearmament and emphasizes the importance of lasting peace over continuous military buildup.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, dealing a major blow to a key component of his economic policies. The Court of International Trade ruled that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not give the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The Manhattan-based court said the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive powers to regulate commerce with other nations and this is not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The ruling gave the White House 10 days to complete the bureaucratic process of halting the tariffs, although most are currently suspended anyway. Global financial markets have been on a rollercoaster ride since Trump announced the sweeping tariffs on 2 April because some measures were reversed or reduced as the White House negotiated with foreign governments.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of the anticipated negative effects of higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. U.S. President Donald Trump imposed an additional 25% tariff on cars produced outside the United States on April 3. For the full business year through March, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit to 3.1 trillion yen ($21 billion) due to Trump's tariff measures and a stronger yen.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Court of International Trade blocked reciprocal tariffs unilaterally imposed by President Donald Trump on numerous countries in April, which aimed to address persistent trade imbalances. This ruling deals a potentially serious blow to the president's economic agenda and ongoing efforts to negotiate trade deals. The court stated that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, invoked by Trump, does not authorize a president to levy universal duties on imports. The Trump administration has been given 10 days to implement the changes, while they are immediately appealing the decision.</p>

          <p>CBS has secured a victory in its legal dispute with Sony Pictures Television, obtaining an appellate court ruling that allows the network to continue distributing "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!" while the court case proceeds. Sony, which owns and produces the shows, had attempted to terminate its distribution deal with CBS, alleging unauthorized licensing deals and insufficient support for the programs. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties, and the appellate panel has granted CBS' request to keep the stay in place, enabling the network to continue its distribution duties during the appeal.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles faces numerous challenges in preparing for the 2028 Summer Olympics, including recovering from devastating wildfires, a potential shortage of workers and supplies, and a projected budget deficit. Concerns also exist about federal funding from the Trump administration and the potential impact of a recession and immigration crackdown on ticket sales. Despite these obstacles, city officials remain confident that the Games will be a success and a boost for the city's recovery. The mayor pointed to the 1984 Olympics as an example of the city's triumph over a serious recession.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from ending legal protections for hundreds of thousands of people who entered the United States through Biden-era programs. The judge, Indira Talwani, ordered the government to restart processing applications for migrants renewing their status, emphasizing the potential for chaos and discord if the programs were terminated. The decision, a victory for civil and immigrant rights groups, applies to Ukrainians, Afghans, military members, and their relatives. The challenge was filed in response to an executive order by President Trump that directed the government to end "all categorical parole programs" set up during the Biden administration.</p>

Despite this strong performance, the company anticipates a $45 billion in sales in the current quarter, which would have been about $8 billion higher if not for a recent export restriction on its China-bound H20 chips. The company's CEO, Jensen Huang, noted that the $50 billion market in China for AI chips is effectively closed to U.S. industry.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has criticized Nigel Farage's Reform UK policies as "fantasy" economics, likening Farage to former PM Liz Truss. Starmer warned that Reform's proposed unfunded tax cuts could trigger an economic meltdown and increase mortgage costs. The prime minister sees Farage as his principal political adversary and criticized his pledge to raise the income tax threshold, which economists have questioned. A Reform spokesperson dismissed Starmer's comments as a "desperate attack" from a party "behind in the polls".</p>
