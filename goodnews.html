          <h2>French Scientists Discover New Blood Type in Guadeloupe Woman</h2>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type, "Gwada negative," in a woman from Guadeloupe, marking the 48th blood group system recognized worldwide. The discovery occurred 15 years after researchers received a blood sample during routine pre-surgery tests, revealing an unusual antibody. High-throughput DNA sequencing in 2019 pinpointed a genetic mutation, confirming the woman as the only known carrier compatible with herself. Scientists hope to find others with the same blood type to improve care for patients with rare blood types, as this discovery underscores the importance of genetic research in medicine.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced a tense and dynamic week influenced by geopolitical events, particularly the intensifying conflict between Israel and Iran, and Federal Reserve updates. Investors closely monitored safe-haven assets like gold and the dollar, as well as risk assets such as oil, amid uncertainty over potential U.S. involvement in the conflict. The Fed kept interest rates unchanged following its policy meeting, citing lackluster economic updates and dueling dynamics regarding inflation and economic growth. The central bank's decision reflects a cautious approach amid uncertainty surrounding tariff impacts, with projections still indicating two rate cuts in 2025 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>As a heatwave approaches the US, experts note that American sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences classify sunscreen as an over-the-counter drug in the US, leading to a lengthy approval process for new UV filters. While US sunscreens effectively block UVB rays, they often lack the advanced ingredients found in sunscreens from Europe and South Korea. Dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and suggest using broad-spectrum sunscreens with an SPF of 30 or higher.</p>

          <p>Photographer Miora Rajaonary's project, Sahy Rano, raises awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women, mainly in Africa. The waterborne infection, spread by parasitic worms, can cause infertility and is often mistaken for STDs, leading to social stigma. The women in the photos wear traditional Malagasy face masks, symbolizing their courage in breaking taboos and speaking about the disease. The backdrop and props, such as laundry ropes and buckets, emphasize water's central role in the women's lives and the spread of the disease.</p>

          <p>Being offended by insults can make a person feel powerless, but there are ways to control our reaction. One simple method is to laugh it off, which allows you to judge the severity of the offense rather than ceding that judgment to an outside arbitrator. This article is part of a newsletter that offers advice for dealing with insults and anger, providing insights into managing emotional responses to uncivil behavior. The goal is to regain control over your experience when feeling insulted.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests couples should take a compatibility test early in their romance to avoid deal-breakers down the road. This test involves creating a list of questions tailored to the couple's specific needs and values, guided by relationship science principles. Key themes to focus on include financial expectations, lifestyle preferences, and family values. By openly communicating about these critical aspects, couples can determine if they are truly compatible and avoid potential conflicts in the future.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Barington Capital is urging Victoria's Secret to replace its board with experienced directors, evaluate CEO Hillary Super, focus on its core brand, and accelerate digital and international growth. Barington, with a history of successful engagements, aims to improve the company's underperformance and unlock shareholder value. The firm cites reasons for the company's dismal underperformance, such as declining revenue, shrinking gross margins, growing inventory, high senior management turnover, a lack of marketing and merchandising focus and an apparent failure to articulate or execute a compelling brand vision. Barington has a strong track record in the retail sector and prefers collaborative engagement over proxy fights, suggesting a constructive approach to working with Victoria's Secret (not investment advice).</p>
