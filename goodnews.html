          <p>A state banquet held at Windsor Castle for President Trump served as a major diplomatic showpiece, emphasizing hospitality to make the visiting leader feel valued. The guest list notably lacked Hollywood celebrities, instead featuring a heavy presence of political figures and technology executives like Apple's Tim Cook and OpenAI's Sam Altman. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales, with other prominent figures from UK and US politics, business, and sports also in attendance for the elaborate affair.</p>

          <p>During a ceremony marking its 75th anniversary, Germany's Central Council of Jews publicly called on the German government to continue its "unconditional" support for Israel. Council President Josef Schuster made the appeal directly to Chancellor Friedrich Merz, who was present at the event. In his remarks, Merz affirmed that while criticism of the Israeli government must be permissible, it should never be used as a pretext for antisemitism, reinforcing Germany's commitment to its Jewish community and to Israel.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume naturally fermented fruit containing low levels of alcohol. Researchers calculated that their daily intake of ethanol is equivalent to what a human would consume in nearly two cocktails. The findings provide direct chemical evidence for the long-held "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that primates' attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots tied to their fruit-based diets. The steady, low-dose consumption does not appear to cause intoxication in the animals.</p>

The decision on borrowing costs will be announced after the U.S. Federal Reserve chose to lower its own rates, highlighting the different economic challenges and inflationary pressures facing the two nations.

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's 0.25% interest rate reduction, CNBC's Jim Cramer cautioned investors against making significant portfolio adjustments based on the decision alone. He argued that the cut was widely anticipated and does not fundamentally change the major themes driving the market, such as the ongoing strength in technology and AI stocks. Cramer suggested the market's subdued reaction indicates that the Fed's prudent, steady approach was ultimately what the economy required, despite some investors hoping for more dramatic action.
