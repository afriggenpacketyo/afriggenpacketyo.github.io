          <p>Following the dismissal of hundreds of employees from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) by the Trump administration, a popular government climate information website was effectively dismantled. The site, climate.gov, was a trusted source for millions seeking data on extreme weather and sea-level rise. In response, the experts who were fired, led by the website's former manager, have launched an independent successor, climate.us, to restore the censored information and continue providing crucial climate data free from political interference. The new nonprofit initiative is being funded by public donations to ensure its mission continues.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite falling to 0-2 after a heartbreaking overtime loss to the Dallas Cowboys, the New York Giants displayed a newfound sense of fight and offensive firepower. Quarterback Russell Wilson had a sensational game, throwing for 450 yards and three touchdowns, largely connecting with star receiver Malik Nabers. While the team was ultimately undone by costly penalties and a last-second field goal, the performance was a stark contrast to their previous efforts. This game suggests that with promising young talent and an exciting offense, the Giants may have finally become a watchable team, offering a glimmer of hope to their fanbase.</p>

          <p>Recent data from China's central bank indicates that the country's stock market rally may have significant room to grow, as households are increasingly moving their savings into equities. In August, deposits at non-banking financial institutions rose by 1.17 trillion yuan, following a 2.15 trillion yuan inflow in July. This shift is driven by low interest rates on traditional bank deposits, which are pushing investors toward the capital market in search of better returns. With the earnings yield of major listed companies at 5.5%, stocks present a more attractive option than government bonds or savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

Stars like Dani Dyer expressed eagerness for the glamorous costumes, while others, such as Vicky Pattison, spoke openly about managing nerves and the pressure to perform on the popular show. The upcoming season follows a period of off-screen controversies, including an investigation into alleged drug use and an unnamed star's arrest on suspicion of sexual assault.

Among the top candidates are digital payments giant Stripe and digital banking unicorn Revolut, both of which have achieved massive private valuations. Other potential contenders include British digital banks Monzo and Starling Bank. The positive market reception for recent fintech listings suggests an opening IPO window, though company leaders remain strategic about the timing and location of a potential stock market debut.

          <h2>China Considers Converting Retiring Coal-Fired Power Plants into Nuclear Facilities</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is exploring a proposal to convert its retiring coal-fired power plants into sites for advanced, fourth-generation nuclear reactors. The initiative, put forward by the state-owned China Energy Engineering Group, aims to accelerate the country's decarbonization goals by repurposing valuable existing infrastructure, particularly in coastal regions. With approximately 100 gigawatts of coal capacity expected to be retired by 2030, this "C2N" (coal-to-nuclear) strategy could offer a direct path to clean energy while potentially gaining greater public acceptance. The plan would leverage the sites of former fossil fuel plants for new, safer nuclear technology.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the United States are set to sign a landmark partnership to accelerate the development of nuclear power, focusing on advanced and small modular reactors (SMRs). The agreement will fast-track safety approvals by allowing each country to recognize the other's assessments, potentially halving licensing times. This deal underpins several major private sector investments, including a plan by Centrica and X-energy to build up to 12 reactors in Hartlepool, creating thousands of jobs. The collaboration aims to bolster energy security, drive economic growth, and eliminate reliance on Russian nuclear materials by 2028.</p>

The decision by Finance Minister Koo Yun-cheol provided a major catalyst for the market, which has been on an upward trend. The positive sentiment in South Korea contrasted with mixed results across other Asia-Pacific markets, which were reacting to a slate of economic data from China. (not investment advice)</p>
