          <h2>WNBA Players Advocate for Higher Pay Amid Questions Over League's Financial Health</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:15 EDT</div>

          <p>WNBA players are publicly campaigning for better pay, wearing warm-up shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us" at the All-Star Game amid stalled labor negotiations. While the league has reported annual losses, players and analysts question these figures, pointing to soaring revenue, broadcast rights, and franchise valuations. Public data shows league revenue has nearly doubled since 2019, and the value of teams like the New York Liberty has skyrocketed. Players currently receive less than 10% of league revenue, a figure they argue is unjustifiably low given the sport's explosive growth and popularity.</p>

          <h2>US Lawmakers Introduce Bills to Ban Toxic Chemicals from Beauty Products</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers has introduced the "Safer Beauty Bill Package," a set of four bills aimed at increasing federal oversight of the cosmetics industry. The legislation seeks to ban hazardous ingredients like formaldehyde and mercury, which have been linked to serious health issues and are found in many personal care products. The bills also aim to enhance transparency in supply chains and provide protections for women of color and salon workers, who are disproportionately exposed to these toxic chemicals. This legislative push follows the 2022 MoCRA law, which advocates say did not go far enough to ensure product safety.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 04:41:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is in Barcelona to complete a season-long loan move to the Spanish club. The 27-year-old received permission from United to travel after the two clubs agreed in principle to a deal that includes an option to buy. This move follows Rashford's declaration in December that he was seeking a new challenge after being dropped by United's head coach. The forward is expected to undergo a medical early this week, potentially joining Barcelona's pre-season tour in Asia, marking his second consecutive loan spell after a stint with Aston Villa last season.</p>

          <p>The Bombay High Court has acquitted all 12 individuals accused in the 2006 Mumbai train bombings, overturning a 2015 trial court verdict that had sentenced five to death and seven to life in prison. The high court panel ruled that the prosecution had "utterly failed to prove the case," citing unreliable witnesses and evidence that did not clearly link the accused to the crime. The seven coordinated bombs killed 189 people and injured over 800. The acquitted individuals, who have spent nearly two decades in prison, are now set to be released, highlighting significant issues within India's overburdened judicial system.</p>

          <p>Ecuador has extradited José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the infamous leader of the "Los Choneros" drug gang known as "Fito," to the United States. Macías, who had previously escaped from an Ecuadorian prison, faces U.S. charges for importing thousands of pounds of cocaine. His organization is accused of smuggling weapons from the U.S. and using violence and bribery to control key trafficking routes in collaboration with Mexican cartels. The extradition proceeded after the U.S. provided guarantees for the protection of his rights, marking a significant step in bilateral efforts to combat transnational organized crime.</p>

          <p>A collaborative team from China and Singapore has developed a novel nanovaccine that has successfully suppressed cancer recurrence and metastasis in animal tests. The research, published in Nature Nanotechnology, details a bio-inspired approach targeting cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for tumor growth and relapse. These CSCs share self-renewal properties with normal stem cells, making them difficult to eliminate with traditional therapies. The new vaccine strategy shows potential for creating personalized cancer treatments that can more effectively prevent the disease from returning after initial treatment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Venture capitalists often rely on a principle known as the "power law" to guide their investment decisions, focusing on startups with the potential for massive returns. This law posits that a very small number of investments will generate the vast majority of a fund's profits, outweighing all losses and smaller successes combined. According to Peter Specht of Creandum, VCs actively seek these outliers, or "massive winners," that can define a new market category. For founders, this means they must effectively pitch not just their product, but a compelling vision for why their company has "outsized-outcome potential" and can achieve enormous scale.

          <p>U.S. imports of rare-earth magnets from China surged by 660% in June compared to the previous month, following a preliminary trade agreement that eased some of Beijing's export controls. These magnets are critical components for technologies like electric vehicles, wind turbines, and military hardware. The spike in shipments reflects a rush by American firms to secure supplies after China, which dominates over 90% of the market, had imposed licensing restrictions. The situation has intensified efforts by the U.S. government and companies like Apple to develop domestic supply chains and recycling facilities to reduce reliance on China.

          <p>A comprehensive review of the water industry in England and Wales has recommended the most significant reforms since privatization, including the abolition of the current regulator, Ofwat. The report by Sir Jon Cunliffe contains 88 recommendations aimed at addressing widespread criticism over leaks, sewage spills, and underinvestment. Key proposals include introducing minimum capital levels to prevent excessive debt and blocking ownership changes that are not in a company's long-term interest. The reforms acknowledge that massive investment is needed to upgrade aging infrastructure, which will require higher consumer bills to fund the necessary improvements. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The British government has announced a national inquiry into the "Battle of Orgreave," one of the most violent confrontations of the 1980s miners' strike. The inquiry will investigate the events of June 18, 1984, when thousands of police officers clashed with striking miners in Rotherham, as well as the aftermath, including the failed prosecutions of 95 miners. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated that those affected have had "unanswered questions for over 40 years." Campaigners, who have long called for an inquiry into allegations of police misconduct and falsified evidence, cautiously welcomed the news.</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are increasingly turning to bond exchange-traded funds (ETFs), pushing the total assets under management in these products past $50 billion. This surge in popularity is driven by a desire for lower-risk, fixed-income assets in an economic environment marked by persistent deflation and supportive government policies for the corporate sector. These ETFs offer advantages like lower costs, diversified holdings, and better liquidity compared to direct bond investments. The fastest-growing segment targets corporate notes, as investors seek higher yields than those available from government debt, which is seen as a crowded trade. (not investment advice)</p>

Similarly, a new and upgraded railway line will connect Algeria's Gara Djebilet mine in the Sahara Desert to Mediterranean ports.
