          <p>President Trump signed an order to implement parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US, with a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. The UK government hopes this will shield British businesses from Trump's tariffs, which were imposed to encourage the purchase of American-made goods. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, and will remove tariffs on certain aerospace products. Business and Trade Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the UK will update parliament on the implementation of quotas on US beef and ethanol under the deal.</p>

          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year, ¬£500 million contract to supply train tracks for Network Rail, securing thousands of jobs at the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract, starting July 1, ensures British Steel will provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs, with other European steelmakers supplying specialist products. The government took control of British Steel in April to prevent the closure of blast furnaces and is exploring both full public ownership and private investment options. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander stated that this contract transforms the outlook for British Steel, demonstrating progress in strengthening domestic manufacturing and supply chains.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival featured contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces, addressing themes of oppression and conflict, with the festival's theme being transformation. The "Queer Passion" focused on the suffering of LGBTQ individuals, while the "Arabian Passion" promoted peace between the West and the Middle East amidst ongoing conflicts. The festival also celebrated the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive, receiving a valuable collection of letters and writings from Bach's sons. Augmented reality was used to bring Bach to life digitally, engaging with audiences in new and innovative ways.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that protect Israel, but building a similar system in the U.S. would be more complex due to America's larger size and the different types of missiles that could be used to attack it. Jeffrey Lewis from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies compares the difference in complexity to that between a kayak and a battleship. The goal of this system is to provide comprehensive missile protection for the entire United States.</p>
