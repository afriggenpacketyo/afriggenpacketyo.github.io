          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales, which fell 5% in Q2, but saw overall company sales climb 7% thanks to a strong 19% surge from its Hollister brand. The company narrowly surpassed Wall Street expectations for revenue and earnings, leading to an increased full-year revenue outlook. Despite facing higher tariff costs, the CEO expressed confidence in the company's trajectory and strategic initiatives, including an NFL partnership and expansion into new categories, aiming for Abercrombie's return to growth by year-end.

          <p>A federal judge's impending ruling could jeopardize Google's lucrative default search contracts, including a $20 billion annual deal with Apple, impacting a quarter of Alphabet's operating income. While this poses an immediate financial risk, some analysts believe Google could benefit long-term by being freed from costly agreements, allowing it to redirect resources into its AI platform, Gemini. This shift could enhance Google's competitive edge in the evolving AI landscape, potentially positioning it as a top-performing stock in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington D.C. crime data indicates a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime in the past three weeks, following President Trump's deployment of federal troops and law enforcement. The analysis found that these federal agents were largely deployed in areas with higher crime rates. While local police data already showed a downward trend, the White House reported over 1,094 arrests and 115 firearms seized, though local officials like Councilmember Brianne Nadeau expressed concerns about the deployments' impact on residents and businesses.</p>

While the company's valuation remains below its 2018 peak, this development signifies a positive financial outcome for Bain Capital and indicates strong market interest in the brand.

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares rose significantly after the company announced it would scrap its controversial new logo and return to its original design. This decision followed widespread criticism from social media users and a direct call from President Donald Trump to revert the change. The initial redesign, which removed the "Uncle Herschel" character and "Old Country Store" phrase, was widely perceived as "generic" and an attempt to go "woke." The company's quick reversal reflects a responsiveness to strong customer feedback.</p>

          <p>Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada, a co-founder of the Sinaloa Cartel, pleaded guilty in a Brooklyn courtroom, confessing to decades of drug smuggling and bribing Mexican officials. This development is seen as a significant victory for the Trump administration's intensified crackdown on cartels, which includes designating them as foreign terrorist organizations. Experts suggest Zambada's plea provides powerful political leverage for more aggressive cross-border operations and increased pressure on Mexico to cooperate with U.S. requests, despite the cartel boss's refusal to cooperate with officials.</p>
