          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang delivered the keynote speech at the Annual Meeting of the New Champions, known as ‚ÄúSummer Davos,‚Äù in Tianjin, addressing a tense global atmosphere. China's economy has largely withstood the tariff war launched by the U.S., but faces external challenges, including the expiration of a trade truce and conflicts in the Middle East. Beijing aims to empower its domestic market and safeguard its position in global supply chains. Top officials have stepped up efforts to attract foreign businesses and investors, with new laws intended to unleash entrepreneurship and drive economic growth.</p>

          <p>Two young bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon in the U.K. and consumed a week's worth of honey before falling asleep. The park reported that the bears posed no threat to the public, and visitors were safely escorted to a secure building as a precaution. Keepers monitored the bears and used recall training to guide them back into their enclosure without intervention. An investigation is underway to determine how the bears escaped, with the park citing an "operational error".</p>

The committee emphasizes that households must benefit from the transition through lower bills and calls for cheaper electricity. While electric car sales are rising and prices are expected to equalize with petrol cars, heat pump sales remain below target despite government grants. The committee suggests reducing electricity costs by removing charges added to support renewable energy projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City Democrats are choosing a nominee for mayor in a race viewed as a proxy war between the left-wing and moderate factions of the party. The primary pits Zohran Mamdani, a democratic socialist assemblyman, against former governor Andrew Cuomo, who resigned amidst a sexual harassment scandal. Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability, including free public buses and universal childcare, while Cuomo emphasizes experience and public safety.

          <p>A U.S. district judge has blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit against the Department of Transportation would likely succeed. The ruling follows the Trump administration's February order to states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the national electric vehicle infrastructure program. The Government Accountability Office previously found that the Trump administration violated the law by withholding the funding.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into how new stars are born. By studying thousands of stars, researchers found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This faster spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to form. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy's star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>

These moves include expanding tradable futures contracts for foreign institutional investors and considering allowing foreign currencies to be used as collateral for trades settled in yuan.
