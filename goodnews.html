        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the use of sexual assault as a plot device in Celine Song's film 'Materialists,' drawing parallels to a similar storyline in Paul Verhoeven's 'Showgirls.' The author reflects on the film's narrative choice to have the protagonist, Lucy, find redemption through a client, Sophie, who has been sexually assaulted by someone Lucy set her up with. The author critiques the potential cynicism of using a character's trauma to facilitate the protagonist's emotional growth, especially in a film marketed as a rom-com. Despite these shortcomings, the author remains eager to see Song's future work, recognizing the director's potential for sharper filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is aggressively investing in artificial intelligence to position Meta at the forefront of the AI revolution. Following a $14.3 billion investment in Scale AI, Meta plans to hire Nat Friedman and Daniel Gross, former executives from GitHub and Safe Superintelligence, respectively. These moves are part of a broader effort to revamp Meta's AI organization, which faces competition from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. The company is embedding AI across its operations, from online advertising to the metaverse, and is aiming to improve its fundamental AI models, especially after the underwhelming reception of Llama 4.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is planning a visit to Japan in late August to discuss a deal for India to adopt Japan's next-generation shinkansen bullet train technology. The high-speed rail project aims to connect Ahmedabad and Mumbai, reducing travel time between the cities to approximately two hours. Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba are also expected to revise the 2008 Joint Declaration on Security Cooperation to expand their security partnership, particularly amid China's increasing maritime influence. The two leaders also intend to strengthen communication before a four-way summit with the United States and Australia under the Quad framework, which New Delhi is set to host in the fall.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is planning to DNA test all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a larger government effort to predict and prevent illness, with ¬£650 million being invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The goal is to shift the NHS from a reactive service to one that proactively identifies and addresses potential health issues. The screening will involve sequencing the complete DNA of newborns using umbilical cord blood samples, looking for gene disorders that develop in early childhood and have effective treatments.</p>

          <p>Dame Esther Rantzen has called on the House of Lords to support a bill that would grant terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to an assisted death. This appeal comes after the bill was passed by MPs in the House of Commons. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, express concerns that the bill could lead to vulnerable individuals being coerced into ending their lives. Rantzen, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the bill includes rigorous safeguards to protect against coercion.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactively building supply chain resilience, positioning itself to better withstand China's export restrictions on rare earth elements. Following a 2010 embargo by China, Japan has invested in non-China rare-earth projects, such as Australia's Lynas, and has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60%. Niron Magnetics CEO Jonathan Rowntree notes that Japan is more prepared this time due to stockpiling, investments in Lynas, and securing Western rare earth supplies. Western officials view Japan's supply chain transformation as a model, but also recognize the difficulty of escaping China's dominance.</p>

          <p>The article critiques the current state of feminist discourse surrounding female celebrities, arguing that it has devolved from meaningful analysis into snide, often paternalistic tellings-off. The author points to recent criticism of celebrities like Sabrina Carpenter, Sydney Sweeney, and Addison Rae, arguing that these critiques often lack historical context and economic awareness. The author urges a return to more nuanced and complex discussions of desire, domination, and the economic forces that shape women's images in popular culture. The author also suggests that policing feminine sexuality under the guise of concern for women's safety is a dangerous and historically ignorant approach.</p>
