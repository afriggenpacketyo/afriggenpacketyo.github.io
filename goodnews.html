          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's efforts to end birthright citizenship, focusing on the authority of lower court judges to issue nationwide injunctions against presidential orders. Justices across the ideological spectrum questioned the scope of lower courts' power and the merits of the birthright citizenship order itself, with the US solicitor general arguing that lower courts overstepped their authority. The New Jersey solicitor general countered that siding with Trump would create a chaotic, patchwork system of citizenship, and protestors gathered outside the court to voice opposition to Trump's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>President Trump made his first publicly known visit to a mosque during his presidency, touring the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque in Abu Dhabi as part of a diplomatic tour through the Middle East. Trump, who removed his shoes as is customary, praised the mosque's beauty and the incredible culture it represents. The visit follows a controversial history with Muslim communities, including suggesting mosques be placed under surveillance during his 2016 campaign and implementing a travel ban from some Muslim-majority countries.</p>

          <h2>Travelers' Rights at the Border: Phone Searches and Passwords</h2>

          <p>Reports of increased U.S. Customs and Border Protection searches have raised concerns about travelers' digital privacy rights. While CBP has the authority to search electronic devices, travelers can take steps to protect their data, including turning off biometrics. U.S. citizens cannot be denied entry for refusing to provide passwords, but their devices may be seized, while non-citizen visa holders might face denial of entry if they refuse to cooperate. It is best practice to enter passwords yourself and to disable biometrics before crossing borders.</p>
