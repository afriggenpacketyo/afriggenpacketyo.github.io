          <p>A decision coach who helps people make choices in single sessions has identified a common myth that hinders effective decision-making: the belief that taking a long time guarantees the best outcome.

This lengthy process adds too many details to the equation, making people acutely aware of what they'd be giving up, ultimately making the decision harder.

          <p>A $300,000 annuity can provide a significant stream of monthly income during retirement, but the exact amount varies based on age, gender, and contract terms. Immediate fixed annuities offer predictable income, with monthly payments increasing for older retirees due to shorter expected lifespans. While annuities offer stability and protection against outliving savings, they lack liquidity and have tax implications. It's essential to consider financial goals, risk tolerance, and other income sources before investing in an annuity, and they work best as part of a diversified strategy (not investment advice).</p>
