        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's cricket team lost to South Africa by 14 runs in the opening T20 match in Cardiff, which was heavily affected by rain. The game was first reduced to nine overs per side due to a delayed start. After South Africa scored 97-5 in 7.5 overs, another rain delay resulted in England facing a revised target of 69 runs in just five overs. Despite an aggressive effort from Jos Buttler, who scored 25 from 11 balls, England's chase fell short as they lost key wickets early and finished with a total of 54-5. The three-match series will continue on Friday at Old Trafford.</p>

          <p>The Germantown Dam, a more than 100-year-old structure in the Miami Valley, is undergoing a $1.5 million repair project to address severe deterioration in its concrete tunnels. The dam is one of five dry dams built after the Great Flood of 1913 to protect regional cities and proved its continued utility by preventing flood waters as recently as April 2025. Officials with the Miami Conservatory District note that the locally funded repairs are crucial for public safety. Successful maintenance of the flood control system could also lead to lower flood insurance rates for nearby homeowners.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has denied an emergency request from South Carolina officials, allowing a transgender male student to continue using the boys' restroom at his school for the time being. The decision lets a federal appeals court ruling that blocked the state's restrictive policy from being enforced against the student remain in effect while the legal challenge proceeds. The court's unsigned order is not a final ruling on the merits of the case, but it represents a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the student and transgender rights advocates. Justices Thomas, Alito, and Gorsuch noted they would have granted the state's request.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Forest Service is reversing its long-standing ban on N95 masks for federal wildland firefighters, a policy it had justified by citing heat exhaustion concerns. The agency will now stockpile and provide the protective masks to crews battling increasingly intense wildfires, aligning with practices in other nations and recommendations from health agencies. The change follows media reports and pressure from lawmakers highlighting the health risks firefighters face from smoke inhalation, which is linked to a higher risk of cancer. Advocates believe the move is an implicit acknowledgment of these dangers and a crucial step toward better protecting firefighter health.</p>

          <p>Gary Lineker has won the award for best TV presenter at the UK's National Television Awards, ending the 23-year winning streak of duo Ant and Dec in a major upset. Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's "Match of the Day" program after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award by referencing his controversial use of social media to speak on political issues. In other notable results, the finale of the popular sitcom "Gavin and Stacey" won for best comedy. The awards are unique in the UK as all categories are decided by a public vote.</p>

          <h2>AT&T CEO Suggests iPhone "Super Cycles" Are Over Unless Apple Delivers on AI</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AT&T CEO John Stankey has stated that the era of massive "super cycles" for iPhone sales may be over unless Apple can deliver significant advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence. Speaking at a technology conference, Stankey argued that smartphones are now primarily software-driven, and incremental software updates are less likely to create the blockbuster demand seen in previous hardware launches. His comments reflect a growing investor concern that Apple is lagging behind competitors like Google and Microsoft in the AI race. Without a compelling AI-driven leap, the next iPhone risks being seen as just a marginal upgrade rather than a revolutionary device.</p>

          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly became the world's wealthiest person, with his net worth surging to $393 billion and surpassing Elon Musk's $385 billion. The shift was driven by a massive rally in Oracle's stock, which jumped over 40% due to a highly optimistic outlook for its cloud infrastructure and artificial intelligence businesses. However, the stock's gains moderated by the end of the trading day, allowing Musk to reclaim the top spot. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Trump, has held his leadership roles at Oracle since co-founding the company in 1977.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour has given her review of the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada," which was based on her leadership style. Wintour called the movie, starring Meryl Streep as the demanding editor Miranda Priestly, a "fair shot" that had "a lot of humor to it." She recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada but being unaware of the film's plot, and was ultimately impressed by Streep's fantastic performance. The comments come as a sequel to the hit film is in production, with a planned release in May 2026.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic 35.95% surge, its best single-day performance since 1992, after the company reported astounding demand for its cloud services. The rally added $244 billion to the company's market capitalization, pushing it toward a valuation of one trillion dollars. The massive jump was fueled by the announcement that Oracle has $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, a key metric for future revenue, which was multiples higher than Wall Street expectations. This performance underscores Oracle's strengthening position as a major beneficiary of the AI boom, which requires massive cloud infrastructure to run. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains "potential biosignatures," representing the closest the agency has come to finding evidence of ancient life on the red planet. The sample, taken from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater, has mineral patterns and textures that on Earth are often byproducts of microbial life consuming organic matter. While researchers cannot yet rule out non-biological origins for these features, they are hopeful. The finding intensifies the push for the Mars Sample Return mission, which would bring the rocks to Earth for more definitive analysis.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic frontrunner for New York City mayor, has launched a petition against FIFA's use of "dynamic pricing" for the 2026 World Cup, calling it an "affront to the game." Mamdani argues that the pricing model, which allows ticket costs to fluctuate with demand, will make attending games unaffordable for many fans and prioritize profit over the sport's accessibility. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and for 15% of tickets to be set aside for local residents. He contrasted the expected high prices with the 1994 World Cup, where tickets were significantly more affordable.</p>

          <p>A planned weekend strike by bus workers in London has been mostly called off after the majority of employees accepted a new pay offer. Unite union members working for London United, which operates numerous routes in northwest and southwest London, voted to accept the deal, canceling their walkout. However, a smaller group of workers from London Transit are still in negotiations, meaning some limited industrial action affecting a handful of routes could still proceed if an agreement is not reached. The resolution comes as a relief to many Londoners who have faced significant travel disruption from a separate, ongoing strike on the London Underground.</p>
