          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have been released by the Taliban after being detained in Afghanistan for over seven months on undisclosed charges. The couple, aged 80 and 75, had lived in the country for 18 years and operated an educational institution in Bamiyan province. A Taliban Foreign Ministry spokesman stated they were released following a judicial process and handed over to Britain's special representative. The release is viewed by some as part of the Taliban's ongoing efforts to gain international recognition four years after regaining power in the country.</p>

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the military should be used to stop asylum seekers crossing the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle clarified that while the Royal Navy has a working relationship with the UK Border Force, the military's primary focus remains on national defense against global threats. The statement came after Trump, during a state visit, advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration. The UK government is currently focused on its "one in, one out" deportation deal with France as its primary deterrent for small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>Apple's new iPhone 17 has gone on sale worldwide, drawing significant crowds from Beijing to London and generating positive initial demand, particularly for the base model. The launch is a critical test for the company as it faces increasing competition in key markets like China from local brands such as Huawei and Xiaomi. Beyond hardware sales, Apple is also under pressure to deliver on its artificial intelligence promises after a previously underwhelming rollout of its AI features. The global reception of the iPhone 17, along with new Apple Watch and AirPods models, will be a key indicator of the company's market position.</p>

          <p>Oregon authorities have identified the remains of a woman, known for nearly 50 years as "Swamp Mountain Jane Doe," as Marion Vinetta Nagle McWhorter, who vanished in 1974 at the age of 21. The breakthrough came after McWhorter's younger sister, Valerie Nagle, submitted her DNA to an ancestry website, which was later matched to a genetic profile created from the remains. McWhorter, an Alaska Native, was last seen at a shopping mall in a Portland suburb. The Linn County Sheriff's Office is now investigating the circumstances of her death, which is not believed to have been voluntary.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 06:00:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish governments have unveiled a new framework to address legacy issues from the Northern Ireland Troubles, aiming to provide "maximum truth, justice and accountability" for victims. The deal will replace the widely opposed Legacy Act of 2023, restoring inquests that were previously halted and establishing new independent bodies for investigation and information retrieval. This includes a dedicated legacy unit within the Irish police and a cross-border commission to receive information from individuals. The agreement is seen as a significant step to heal the political rift created by the previous legislation and requires new laws in both countries.</p>

          <p>The United States is funding a feasibility study for the expansion of a copper and cobalt facility in Zambia in a strategic move to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals. The U.S. Trade and Development Agency will provide a $1.4 million grant to Metalex Africa, a U.S. subsidiary, to explore producing an additional 25,000 metric tonnes of copper and cobalt concentrates annually. These minerals are vital for electric vehicle batteries, electronics, and military hardware, a sector where Chinese companies currently dominate the supply chain. The initiative aims to secure a direct source of these materials for the U.S. and its allies.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old hiker has been released from the hospital after surviving a bear attack while hiking alone on a remote trail in Yellowstone National Park. The man sustained significant injuries to his chest and arm after surprising the bear, which officials believe was likely a grizzly acting in self-defense. The trail has been closed indefinitely, but park officials have stated they will not take any management action against the bear. Bear attacks are exceedingly rare in the park, and this incident serves as a reminder of the potential dangers of recreating in wildlife habitats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ian McEwan's latest novel, "What We Can Know," is a provocative exploration of history and biography, questioning our ability to truly understand the past in a post-truth world. The story follows a 22nd-century academic, Thomas Metcalfe, who attempts to uncover the story behind a lost poem written by a 21st-century literary giant, Francis Blundy. Metcalfe uses a wealth of digital data but, as the novel reveals by rewinding to the past, he grasps the details but completely misunderstands the human motivations. The novel is an elegantly structured argument that raw data and even art can fail to capture the complexities of human nature.</p>

          <p>The secondhand apparel market has grown into a major global business, driven by younger consumers motivated by sustainability, unique style, and affordability. Thrifting promises to reduce waste and carbon emissions from the fashion industry, which is a major polluter. However, the trend is not without its complexities. As major brands enter the resale market, they often use fast-fashion marketing tactics that can encourage overconsumption, undermining the environmental benefits. Experts suggest that for secondhand shopping to be truly sustainable, it must genuinely replace the purchase of new items and be paired with the habit of wearing clothes for longer.</p>

          <p>Getafe manager José Bordalás has become one of Spanish football's most polarizing figures, with critics decrying his team's style as "anti-football" while supporters praise his remarkable success. Despite a modest budget, Bordalás has consistently overachieved by implementing a highly structured, intense, and physical brand of football that prioritizes results over aesthetics. His methods involve demanding training sessions and a high-press, compact defensive system that suffocates opponents. While purists complain, Bordalás has earned the respect of many peers for maximizing the potential of his squads and proving that success in football can take many forms.</p>

          <p>In the small towns of rural Texas, a unique version of Friday night lights known as six-man football has become a vital part of community identity. Played on a smaller field with modified rules, the game is a fast-paced, high-scoring affair for high schools with too few students to field a traditional 11-man team. For communities like Marfa, the games are a central social event that brings together generations of residents, fostering a sense of pride and unity. As rural populations decline, however, some worry about the future of a tradition that is more than just a sport.</p>
