        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of drivers are finding themselves "underwater" on their auto loans, owing more than their vehicles are worth, impacting new car purchases. Edmunds reports that 26.6% of trade-ins for new cars had negative equity in the second quarter of 2025, the highest in four years. The average amount owed on these upside-down loans was $6,754. Factors contributing to this include longer loan terms and smaller down payments. Experts advise consumers in this situation to consider keeping their current vehicle, researching loan options, and understanding their credit score before buying a new car. This trend indicates a potential financial strain on consumers and highlights the importance of careful financial planning when purchasing vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched a Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship to the International Space Station, carrying over 5 tons of supplies. The cargo includes spare parts, research material, crew supplies, and holiday treats. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and successfully landed its first stage back at the station. The Cygnus spacecraft is scheduled to be captured by the station's robot arm on Wednesday. This mission marks the third of at least four SpaceX flights purchased by Northrop Grumman while they develop their own booster, and it's the first flight of the Cygnus XL, designed to carry more cargo.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is requesting $58 million from Congress to enhance security for the executive and judicial branches following the Charlie Kirk shooting. The funds will be directed to the U.S. Marshals Service and include increased protection for Supreme Court justices. The administration also supports increased funding for congressional lawmakers' security, deferring to the legislative branch on those measures. This request comes before a government funding deadline, and follows a new pilot program for House members providing allowances for personal security. House Speaker Mike Johnson has initiated a review of the program, while the Senate considers additional safety precautions.</p>

          <p>British and US companies have announced five new commercial deals in nuclear power, signaling a "golden age" for the industry. The plans include a new nuclear power plant in Hartlepool using advanced modular reactor technology, and data centers powered by mini reactors in Nottinghamshire. The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy aims to expedite nuclear projects by reducing red tape and aligning safety standards. These deals come as governments seek to meet rising electricity demand, support AI development, and boost job growth in former industrial areas.

          <p>Jim Edgar, a two-term former Republican governor of Illinois, has died at the age of 79 due to complications from pancreatic cancer. Edgar, who served as governor in the 1990s, is credited with stabilizing the state's finances during a recession. A moderate Republican, he later distanced himself from the party's shift to the right, even supporting Kamala Harris's presidential bid. During his time in office, Edgar made budget cuts and secured a permanent income tax surcharge for public schools. He will be remembered for his integrity and successful tenure as governor.</p>

          <p>China's Victory Day parade sent a strategic message to middle powers in the Global South, governments seeking military development while avoiding Cold War entanglements. Kim Jong-un's attendance, his first multilateral international appearance since the pandemic, signals that China provides diplomatic lifelines to isolated regimes without requiring reform. The trilateral display of Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong-un projects an image of an axis of the excluded, nations rejecting Western terms of engagement. The parade reassures domestic audiences, offers alternatives to Western partnerships to Global South nations, and signals to Washington the limits of its sanctions regime.</p>

          <p>East Los Angeles held its 79th annual Mexican Independence Day parade, marked by a sense of defiance and pride amid the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. Many felt it was important to show up and stand tall in the face of ongoing immigration raids. The parade included mariachi musicians, Mexican flags, and shouts of “Viva Mexico.” Concerns over immigration policies and recent Supreme Court rulings have led to fear and apprehension within the community, but the parade continued as a celebration of Latino culture and resilience.

Runners-up for the prize were Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery.” The film explores the idea that Shakespeare’s “Hamlet” was influenced by the death of his son, Hamnet, with Shakespeare’s wife, Agnes, at the center of the story. Zhao previously won the award for “Nomadland” in 2020, which went on to win three Academy Awards. The People's Choice Award is often seen as a predictor of success at the Oscars.</p>

          <p>Buy now, pay later (BNPL) plans are gaining popularity among consumers as an alternative to credit cards, allowing purchases to be split into short-term, interest-free installments. An estimated 86.5 million Americans used BNPL loans in 2024, with projections indicating further growth. However, banks and credit card companies are wary of BNPL plans due to the direct challenge they pose to credit card revenue and transaction activity. BNPL loans also create a "giant black hole" in understanding consumer credit quality. As BNPL usage grows, financial institutions are increasingly cautious about the potential risks and disruptions to traditional credit models. (not investment advice)</p>
