          <p>President Trump has officially pardoned reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who were serving time for tax evasion and bank fraud, following appeals from their daughter Savannah Chrisley. Savannah expressed gratitude to Trump for reuniting her family after the couple's sentencing in November 2022 to a combined 19 years in prison and ordered to pay $17.8 million in restitution. The charges against the Chrisleys stemmed from a fifteen-year fraud spree involving false information provided to banks and fabricated bank statements. Savannah Chrisley confirmed that a new reality series is in the works with Lifetime, continuing the family's story in the public eye.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported a 69% increase in revenue, reaching $44.1 billion, despite U.S. government restrictions on AI chip sales to China. The company's net income rose 26% to $18.78 billion, although it fell short of profit predictions. Nvidia projects current-quarter revenue to rise 50% to $45 billion, driven by its new Blackwell AI chip, with CEO Jensen Huang emphasizing the importance of AI to the next industrial revolution. However, the company anticipates a $4.5 billion loss due to the China restrictions, which have reduced its sales in China to 13% of total revenue.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump addressed the term "TACO" (Trump Always Chickens Out), which Financial Times journalist Robert Armstrong coined to describe investors' reaction to his tariff policies. The term refers to stocks plunging when the Trump administration announces new tariffs, then surging when Trump eases up on them. Trump called it a "nasty question" and defended his actions as part of negotiation, citing his decisions to reduce tariffs on China and the European Union. He argued that these moves prompted negotiations and that he usually faces criticism for being too tough.</p>

          <p>China is developing a rapid-response space defense system to intercept suspicious spacecraft and push them away, according to scientist Sun Zhibin. The system would involve deploying small robotic thrusters to latch onto and redirect approaching objects that could interfere with China‚Äôs Tiangong space station. This development follows China's report to the United Nations about having to perform evasive maneuvers to avoid potential collisions with SpaceX‚Äôs Starlink satellites. The scientist said that the response would depend on the intent of the other spacecraft, whether by dodging, adjusting orbit, or redirecting the object.</p>
