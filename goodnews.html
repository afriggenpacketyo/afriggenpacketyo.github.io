          <p>Seattle police have arrested a 29-year-old man in connection with a home invasion and robbery that occurred at the residence of rapper Macklemore in June. During the incident, two men entered the home and used bear spray on the rapper's nanny before stealing thousands of dollars in personal items, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders ring. The arrest was made after law enforcement investigated other high-profile burglaries targeting celebrities, leading them to a jewelry store where stolen items were recovered. The suspect is expected to face criminal charges for his involvement in the robbery.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles County Supervisor Hilda Solis has officially announced her campaign for a U.S. congressional seat, contingent on California voters approving new district maps in a November special election. The former Secretary of Labor and congresswoman is targeting the redrawn 38th District, which would be left without an incumbent. Solis has already secured a formidable list of endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and several sitting members of Congress, signaling strong establishment support. The proposed redistricting is part of a broader Democratic strategy to gain more House seats in California.</p>

          <p>A Texas man has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring 56 years after it slipped off his finger and fell into the water off a Long Island dock in 1969. The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, an electrician who was using a metal detector at a beach in Mt. Sinai, New York. After finding the ring, which was engraved with Al DiStefano's name and graduation year, Orlowski tracked down a former classmate via the internet, who then connected with DiStefano. The remarkable return highlights an act of kindness, as Orlowski chose to find the owner rather than sell the valuable palladium ring.</p>

          <p>A number of cast members, including Heidi Gardner, Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim, are leaving "Saturday Night Live" before its 51st season. The departures come after the show's landmark 50th season, with creator Lorne Michaels indicating a desire to refresh the cast. Gardner, an eight-season veteran, was known for popular characters like Angel and Bailey Gismert. Longfellow, Walker, and Wakim, who joined more recently, also confirmed their exits on social media, expressing gratitude for their time on the show. The shake-up signals a period of transition for the long-running sketch comedy series.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 concluded August with a monthly gain of approximately 2%, marking its fourth consecutive month of advances, although it ended the final week with a slight loss. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the week's downturn. The market was also influenced by the latest PCE inflation data, which showed core inflation rising to 2.9% annually, keeping price pressures a concern for investors. Despite this, market sentiment still favors an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming September meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have revealed a clearer picture of Spicomellus, described as one of the strangest dinosaurs ever found, after the discovery of new fossil remains. This 165-million-year-old creature is the world's oldest known ankylosaur, a group of herbivorous, tank-like dinosaurs. The fossils show that Spicomellus had long, bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any other vertebrate species, living or extinct. This unique and elaborate armor, which has led researchers to dub it the "punk rocker" dinosaur, is causing scientists to reassess theories about how ankylosaur defenses evolved.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won his re-election bid by a wide margin, four years after alleging that White officials locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. The small town, which had not held an election since the 1960s, operated under a system where positions were handed down, resulting in a White-led government despite a majority-Black population. After running unopposed in 2020, Braxton faced a legal battle to take office. This week's election, held under a federal settlement, solidifies his position and marks a significant moment for democratic governance in the town.</p>

Yankovic explains that he took a break from parodies to explore original pastiches and prove he was "more than just the parody guy," performing smaller, more intimate shows. He attributes the parody hiatus partly to the fragmentation of pop culture, making it harder to identify universally known hits. Now, he is re-embracing the full spectacle of his famous act, complete with an expanded band to replicate his intricate arrangements.</p>

Discussions focused on enhancing Europe's "strategic autonomy" in defense, advancing joint military projects, and bridging differences on energy policy, including a notable agreement on nuclear power. Despite the positive atmosphere, significant national interests still diverge, and Macron faces a potential no-confidence vote at home that could undermine the commitments made.</p>

          <p>With mortgage refinancing rates remaining high, seniors have several alternative options to tap into their home equity without altering their current home loans. One key option is a reverse mortgage, available to homeowners aged 62 and older, which converts equity into payments without requiring monthly repayments. Other viable methods include home equity loans, which offer fixed rates that have recently declined, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which provide a flexible credit line. These alternatives allow homeowners to leverage their record-high equity levels while preserving their existing low-rate mortgages. (not investment advice)</p>
