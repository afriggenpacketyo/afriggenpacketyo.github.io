          <p>The United States and China have formally agreed to a framework for a trade deal, aiming to de-escalate economic tensions between the two nations. The agreement reportedly centers on China increasing its approval of rare earth mineral exports, which are vital for U.S. tech and defense industries, in exchange for the U.S. canceling a series of restrictive measures. The deal also addresses China's efforts to control the flow of fentanyl precursors. This development follows a series of high-level talks and aims to stabilize a relationship strained by punitive tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Israel and Iran has prompted a strategic recalibration among Middle Eastern nations, many of whom maintained a position of ambiguity during the fighting. Countries like Jordan and Saudi Arabia publicly condemned Israeli actions but privately took steps to intercept Iranian projectiles, reflecting their complex relationships with Israel and reliance on U.S. security cooperation. The article suggests that Gulf states, seeing a weakened Iran, may now seek a more balanced relationship to ensure regional stability.

The Los Angeles County Department of Public Health confirmed it received its nearly $20 million grant, which had been frozen, averting the termination of contracts with 39 local providers. Advocates had warned that cutting the funds would reverse years of progress and lead to a spike in new HIV infections.

          <p>A contributor argues that President Trump's decision to order a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities was a definitive application of the "America First" foreign policy doctrine. The author contends that this policy is not isolationist but rather a pragmatic, Jacksonian approach that avoids nation-building while remaining willing to use force to defend core U.S. interests. The piece asserts that the strike, which devastated Iran's nuclear program without American casualties, was a great act of statesmanship. It also notes that polling shows overwhelming support for the action among MAGA Republicans, aligning with the goal of stopping a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>

          <p>A review of Charlie English's new book, "The CIA Book Club," praises it as a thrilling account of how literature was used as a weapon during the Cold War. The book focuses primarily on Poland's decades-long fight against Soviet domination, detailing how the CIA funded the smuggling of forbidden books like George Orwell's "1984" behind the Iron Curtain. The reviewer finds the story reads like a spy novel, filled with heroes, traitors, and high-stakes cultural resistance. While the book excels at documenting the Polish underground movement, the review notes it could have explored the program's impact in other Eastern Bloc countries more broadly.</p>

          <p>The recent conflict between Iran and Israel has renewed focus on global energy security, underscoring the vulnerabilities of relying on fossil fuels transported through volatile regions like the Strait of Hormuz. This analysis argues that transitioning to homegrown renewable energy sources is crucial for achieving stable, affordable power amid geopolitical tensions. Experts state that domestic renewables shield countries from price volatility and supply disruptions. While the clean energy transition presents its own challenges, such as mineral dependencies, it is seen as a key strategy for building a more resilient and secure global energy system.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a peace deal in Washington, D.C., facilitated by the United States, to end the prolonged and deadly conflict in eastern Congo. The agreement includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity and the disarmament of non-state armed groups, such as the prominent M23 rebels backed by Rwanda. The conflict has led to a severe humanitarian crisis with over 7 million people displaced. While the deal is seen as a major turning point, the M23 rebel group has suggested it will not be bound by an agreement in which it was not directly involved.</p>

          <p>An initial assessment by the U.S. Army has concluded that President Trump's 2024 military birthday parade caused minimal damage to the streets of Washington, D.C. A spokesman reported that the only identified damage was a single crushed curb, which the Army will repair. This finding alleviates earlier concerns from city officials that the heavy battle tanks used in the parade could cause millions of dollars in damage to local roads and underground infrastructure. The final attendance for the event was reported to be approximately 198,000 people.</p>

          <p>Chinese electronics company Anker Innovations has formed a strategic partnership with battery maker Amperex Technology Limited (ATL), a key supplier for Apple. The move comes after Anker, along with a rival, recalled over 1.2 million power banks due to fire risks from defective battery cells provided by a previous supplier. Anker plans an initial purchase of 45 million lithium-ion batteries from ATL as it works to secure its supply chain and restore consumer confidence in its product safety. The company has ceased doing business with the supplier linked to the defective cells.</p>

          <h2>Tokyo's Nikkei Index Surpasses 40,000 as U.S.-China Tariff Concerns Subside</h2>

          <p>Tokyo's Nikkei Stock Average closed above the 40,000 mark for the first time since January, rising for a fourth consecutive day. The market rally was fueled by easing concerns over steep U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Investors reacted positively to news that the U.S. may extend a pause on tariffs against China, which helped boost heavyweight technology and transportation equipment stocks. The broader Topix index also finished higher, reflecting widespread optimism in the market as immediate trade war fears appeared to recede. (not investment advice)</p>
