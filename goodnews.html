          <p>This article reports on Japan's fiscal year 2024 current account surplus reaching a record high. The details of the factors contributing to this surplus are not provided in the article, however it is a generally positive indicator of the country's economic performance. This financial milestone may have implications for Japan's trade policies and its economic relationships with other nations. The surplus could reflect increased exports, decreased imports, or a combination of both, signalling a strong external financial position for Japan.</p>

          <p>President Trump is prioritizing securing new investments from Gulf states, particularly sovereign wealth funds, to bolster the US economy. Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia is expected to yield agreements integrating the Saudi and US economies, including arms purchases and joint ventures. While the UAE has committed substantial long-term investments, analysts caution against overstating short-term impacts. Discussions will also focus on artificial intelligence, with the Gulf seeking access to US technology, and Saudi Arabia aiming to attract American investment into its Vision 2030 program. This article highlights the economic significance of the Gulf region to Trump's agenda amidst disrupted global trade and a recent fall in US economic output.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent stated that "substantial progress" was made in tariff talks with Chinese officials, though specific details are scarce. The meetings, held in Switzerland, aim to de-escalate trade tensions between the two countries, which have imposed high tariffs on each other's goods. President Trump expressed optimism and a willingness to lower tariffs, while Chinese officials seek the removal of "unilateral" tariffs first. These talks are crucial for stabilizing global markets and businesses affected by the U.S.-China trade standoff. The article notes that the outcome of the Geneva meeting remains uncertain.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has temporarily suspended imports of live cattle from Mexico to address the screwworm pest, a parasite that poses a significant threat to livestock. The decision follows the detection of screwworm in regions closer to the U.S. border, prompting concerns over animal and food safety. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary expressed disagreement with the measure but anticipates a swift resolution. This suspension underscores the importance of safeguarding animal health and the nation's food supply, as screwworm infestations can cause severe damage and fatalities in warm-blooded animals, including humans.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring innovative technologies to help paralyzed individuals regain mobility and bodily functions, such as walking and bladder control. A "digital bridge" developed by French neuroscientist Gregoire Courtine and Swiss neurosurgeon Dr. Jocelyne Bloch, bypasses spinal cord injuries, enabling patients to move limbs using their thoughts. Spinal cord stimulation shows promise for Parkinson's disease patients, improving mobility. The goal is to offer a "menu" of therapies to restore various functions, improving the daily lives of those with spinal cord injuries, with clinical trials underway to ensure safety and efficacy.</p>
