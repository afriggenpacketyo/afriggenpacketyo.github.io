          <p>NJ Transit and the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) are engaged in last-minute negotiations to avert a rail strike that could impact over 300,000 commuters. The union is seeking pay raises, citing a five-year wage freeze, while NJ Transit aims to balance fair wages with cost considerations for fare riders and taxpayers. Gov. Phil Murphy may declare a state of emergency if a strike occurs, and NJ Transit has a contingency plan to accommodate a fraction of daily riders. Commuters express support for the union, emphasizing the importance of fair wages for worker safety and focus.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that ancient horses repeatedly migrated between North America and Eurasia during the late Pleistocene, approximately 50,000 to 13,000 years ago. This migration occurred via the Bering land bridge, which connected the two continents during periods of lower sea levels. The study, published in Science, found genetic exchanges between horse populations in North America and Eurasia. Among the fossils studied were Dalianensis horses, which lived 17,000 years ago in northeastern China and had mixed ancestry from both Eurasian and American populations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Supreme Court justices expressed skepticism regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to limit birthright citizenship, which would deny citizenship to babies born in the U.S. if their parents are not citizens or permanent residents. The court is considering whether the Justice Department's argument to narrow the scope of nationwide injunctions issued by federal judges holds weight. These injunctions, often used to block presidential policies, have been deemed unfairly restrictive by the administration. The legal challenge stems from Trump's executive order, which contradicts the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the United States.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates (UAE) and the United States have signed an agreement for the UAE to construct the largest artificial intelligence (AI) campus outside the U.S., giving the UAE expanded access to advanced AI chips.

The deal reflects the Trump administration's confidence in secure chip management, requiring data centers to be managed by U.S. companies. The AI agreement includes the UAE committing to invest in, build, or finance U.S. data centers at least as large and powerful as those in the UAE.</p>

The PLA Ground Force Service Academy will be based in Hefei, the PLA Information Support Force Engineering University in Wuhan, and the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University in Chongqing. These academies will recruit high school graduates to strengthen their talent pool and train personnel to meet modern and hi-tech warfare needs.

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are set to debate a bill to legalize assisted dying for the first time since significant changes were made to it. The bill passed the first stage of the Commons last November, but since then the details have been pored over and dozens of amendments added by both sides. A vote to pass or reject the bill is not likely to take place on Friday, but rather in June. The government quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>
