          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-01 00:28:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of young Americans are choosing skilled trades like electricians and plumbers over traditional four-year college degrees, driven by high tuition costs and concerns about AI automating white-collar jobs. Surveys indicate that Gen Z values job security against automation, seeing trades as more resilient than fields like software development or accounting. This shift challenges the long-held emphasis on college diplomas, as recent college graduates face rising unemployment while non-college-educated workers in the same age group experience smaller upticks. Companies in sectors like solar installation are observing increased interest in field roles, with young entrepreneurs finding success in these hands-on professions.</p>

          <p>Despite a U.S. government shutdown, the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks, as the program is funded through mandatory spending. However, the Social Security Administration's working budget requires congressional approval, meaning some customer services could be disrupted. The article notes that about 90% of SSA's workforce is deemed essential, but non-critical activities like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacement Medicare cards would be halted. There is also a possibility of delays in the annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) announcement if Labor Department data releases are impacted.</p>

          <p>Global private equity firm KKR has expanded its partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) by acquiring a minority stake in ADNOC Gas Pipeline Assets. This investment, which follows a previous oil pipeline deal, underscores KKR's commitment to the Middle East, a region identified for its strong economic fundamentals and attractive opportunities for global investors. The ADNOC subsidiary operates 38 gas pipelines and two export terminals in the UAE, with ADNOC retaining full ownership and operational control despite KKR's minority stake. This transaction marks another milestone in KKR's over 16-year presence in the region, where it has also invested in data centers.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices saw declines, despite a slight increase in business optimism among large manufacturers according to the Tankan survey. Conversely, South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq, along with the Taiwan Weighted Index, registered gains, particularly in healthcare and tech sectors, with TSMC's stock rising after Nvidia's market cap milestone.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) has finalized a US$1.4 billion deal to invest in and refurbish the Tazara Railway, a critical 1,860km line connecting Zambia’s Copperbelt to Tanzania’s port of Dar es Salaam. This substantial investment, comprising an initial $1.1 billion and a further $238 million reinvestment, aims to upgrade tracks, workshops, and rolling stock, including 34 locomotives and 760 wagons. The revitalization positions China to enhance its access to African copper and cobalt shipments, providing an alternative to congested South African ports and strengthening its influence in key African trading corridors against Western-backed routes.</p>

          <p>Senator Marco Rubio, on behalf of the United States, extended congratulations to the people of China on the 76th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic of China. The message, published on the State Department’s website, wished China health, happiness, prosperity, and peace for the year ahead. This year's timely greeting contrasts with last year's, when Washington's message from then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken was posted after the actual National Day, amidst heightened tensions between the two nations. The article highlights the diplomatic gesture in the context of ongoing U.S.-China relations.</p>

          <p>Bear 32 Chunk, described as the "most dominant brown bear on the river," has won Katmai National Park's annual Fat Bear Week competition, securing victory with 96,350 votes. His triumph is particularly remarkable given he suffered a broken jaw for most of the season, yet still managed to gain immense girth in preparation for winter hibernation. The competition, which celebrates bears' successful foraging for salmon, attracted over 1.5 million public votes, making it the "biggest Fat Bear Week yet." Chunk dethroned two-time champion 128 Grazer, whose cub, 128 Jr, won this year's fattest cub title, forming a "royal family" narrative.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming "super golden week" holiday, extended to eight days due to its overlap with the Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day, is forecast to trigger a significant travel boom both domestically and internationally. Total outbound trips are projected to more than double compared to the previous year, reaching between 8 million and 8.4 million. Demand is particularly surging for visa-free destinations such as Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Russia, which recently introduced visa exemptions. South Korea also implemented visa-free entry for tour groups just before the holiday, further contributing to the anticipated surge in Chinese tourism.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is reportedly close to acquiring Occidental Petroleum's petrochemical unit, OxyChem, for approximately $10 billion, marking its largest deal in three years.

His successor, Greg Abel, has strong expertise in the energy industry. The article notes Occidental's stock fell slightly despite the news, and that Berkshire had previously helped finance Occidental's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum.</p>

          <p>Shares of Lithium Americas surged over 35% after U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright announced the government will take a 5% equity stake in the company and an additional 5% directly in its Thacker Pass project in Nevada. This move, the first such stake in a Canadian company for U.S. mineral supply chain interests, aims to boost the project, which is expected to become one of North America's largest lithium sources. General Motors also holds a minority stake in the mine, projected to begin operations in late 2027. Wright emphasized the deal as "economic common sense" to ensure lithium mining and refining within the United States.</p>

          <p>Steve Coogan discusses the enduring appeal and evolution of his beloved comedy character, Alan Partridge, who is returning in a new TV documentary on mental health. Coogan emphasizes that the show aims to "laugh around mental health, not at it," using Partridge's self-absorbed persona as a "Trojan horse" to address taboo subjects and mock various societal views. The article highlights how the character has become more "three-dimensional" and capable of evoking pathos, particularly with the help of a new writing team. Coogan reflects on his own journey with the character, now embracing Partridge as a visit rather than a burden, and noting the character's relevance to younger audiences.</p>
