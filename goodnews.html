          <h2>Ric Edelman Argues Longevity Makes the Classic 60-40 Portfolio Obsolete</h2>

          <p>Financial planning icon Ric Edelman argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio (60% stocks, 40% bonds) is no longer sufficient for retirement planning due to increasing lifespans. With breakthroughs in health and science, people are living longer, requiring more money invested in the stock market to avoid outliving their savings. Edelman suggests a portfolio with 70% to 80% in equities for many investors, emphasizing the need to plan for living to 100 or beyond. Data from Fidelity Investments suggests a retired couple may need $315,000 saved just to cover healthcare expenses in retirement, further highlighting the inadequacy of traditional retirement plans.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to establish a national center for homeless veterans in West Los Angeles, redirecting funds previously used for housing and services for illegal aliens. The National Center for Warrior Independence aims to house up to 6,000 homeless veterans by 2028, providing care, benefits, and services to promote self-sufficiency through housing, substance abuse treatment, and support for productive work. The order also directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to use vouchers for homeless veterans and instructs the VA to take action against individuals who have committed misconduct.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to announce a "most favored nation" plan to cut Medicare drug prices, tying the cost of some high-cost Medicare drugs to the lowest prices drug manufacturers receive in other countries. This plan, previously attempted during Trump's first term, was blocked by court orders due to procedural issues. HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. hinted at the possibility of the policy returning, pointing to higher prices in Europe for drugs like Ozempic. The Trump administration is continuing to negotiate the cost of Ozempic in Medicare for diabetes treatment, but not for weight loss purposes.</p>

          <p>South Africa has criticized the U.S. over reports that Washington could accept white Afrikaners as refugees, describing the purported move as "politically motivated." The South African authorities said they would not block the departures of those chosen for resettlement, but sought assurances from the U.S. that those selected had been fully vetted and did not have pending criminal charges. In February, Trump described Afrikaners as victims of "racial discrimination," opening up the prospect for them to resettle in the U.S., a claim the South African government denies.</p>

The FIFA Council voted unanimously for the changes that will be in place for the 2035 edition, which is due to be hosted in the United Kingdom. As a result of the increase in teams, the competition will adopt a 12-group format with an additional 40 matches, up from 64 to 104, that will extend the tournament by a week. FIFA president Gianni Infantino said the changes would give more nations to "the chance to benefit from the tournament to develop their women's football structures".</p>

          <p>The FDA approved the use of three color additives from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food, a move that comes amid growing concerns about the health effects of food dyes. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. called on companies to phase out all petroleum-based dyes by the end of next year. The new natural color additive options include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract, and calcium phosphate. While the administration's goal is to replace petroleum-based dyes, the FDA has stopped short of an outright ban.</p>

As TSMC is Nvidia's primary chip supplier, an increase in its sales is generally seen as a positive indicator for Nvidia. Reuters reported that Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of its H20 AI chips for China in the next two months to comply with U.S. export restrictions.
