          <p>China is rapidly advancing its green energy transition, driven by long-term strategic planning and political stability. This includes developing extensive ultra-high-voltage power lines and significantly increasing renewable energy's share in its power grid, aiming for peak carbon emissions before 2030 and carbon neutrality before 2060. This progress is noted by Western media, with some anxiety about contrasting approaches, such as the US focus on fossil fuels. The article highlights China's consistent policy in decarbonization and its substantial investment in clean energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has cautioned McLaren's Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris about Max Verstappen's "cut-throat" nature as they contend for the Formula 1 title. With five races remaining, Verstappen is closing in, and Hamilton, having experienced an intense rivalry with him in 2021, advises the McLaren drivers to be equally ruthless. He notes that being the "hunter" (Verstappen) is easier than being the "defender." Despite McLaren having a faster car, consistency from Verstappen and Red Bull poses a significant challenge, making the championship battle highly unpredictable.</p>
