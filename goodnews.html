          <h2>Lawyer Challenges Trump's Tariffs as Unlawful in Federal Court</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 14:21:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawyer representing small businesses argued in federal court that President Trump's tariffs are an unlawful expansion of executive power under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Jeffrey Schwab of the Liberty Justice Center contended that the trade deficits cited by Trump do not meet the legal standard of a brief and rare emergency. The lawsuit, brought by several small businesses reliant on imports, claims the tariffs would cause irreparable harm. The Department of Justice defends the tariffs, asserting that Congress allows the president to impose them, and Trump's declaration of a national emergency broadens his authority.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, slightly below expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, driven mainly by housing and energy costs. Grocery prices saw a slight decline, particularly for eggs, though egg prices remain high due to bird flu outbreaks. Experts are closely watching for signs that Trump's tariffs are impacting consumer prices, but the effects may not be evident for several months due to front-loading of purchases and recent tariff easing. The Fed is expected to remain cautious about cutting rates until the full impact of trade policies is assessed.</p>
