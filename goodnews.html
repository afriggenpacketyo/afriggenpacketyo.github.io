          <h2>UK Health Review Recommends New Title for Physician Associates to Avoid Patient Confusion</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 06:47:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK review suggests changing the title of "physician associates" to "assistants" to prevent confusion with doctors. The report, commissioned after patient safety concerns and deaths, also recommends standardized uniforms and clarifies that associates should not diagnose patients. This follows growing debate over the roles, with doctors' unions wanting stricter limits and associate unions fearing it could lengthen wait times. The goal is to establish a clearer framework for these roles within the NHS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier-owner Richemont reported a 15% sales decline in Japan as a strengthening yen reduced tourist spending, particularly from Chinese shoppers. This marks an end to a period where a weak yen fueled a luxury shopping spree in the country, benefiting brands like Richemont. Despite the drop in Japan, the company's overall sales grew 6%, driven by strong performance in its high-end jewelry division. The report highlights the sensitivity of the luxury market to currency fluctuations and shifting tourist behaviors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has experienced a significant increase in foreign visitors, with 38 million trips recorded in the first half of 2025, marking a 30% year-on-year rise. The surge is attributed to the country's expanded visa-free travel policies, designed to attract more tourists and business travelers. An official from the immigration administration stated that these facilitation measures have effectively boosted inbound consumption and travel. The policy builds on earlier, more limited transit visa schemes, now covering more nationalities and longer stays.</p>

          <p>The United States and Indonesia have finalized a trade deal that reduces US tariffs on Indonesian goods from 32% to 19%. In return, Indonesia has agreed to provide "full access" for American firms and purchase billions in US energy and agricultural products, as well as Boeing aircraft. The agreement follows a period of intense trade negotiations initiated by the Trump administration's broad tariff threats. While the deal marks a diplomatic resolution, it is one of only a few such agreements to be reached from the administration's widespread tariff campaign. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks that made unauthorized claims about its ability to reduce stress and anxiety. The watchdog ruled that language like "crafted for calm" and suggestions that its ingredients could lower the stress hormone cortisol were not permitted health claims for a food product. The company, which markets itself as a relaxation brand, was also found to have made an inaccurate claim about its sugar content. The ASA has ordered that the ad not appear again in its current form.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by an NHS disciplinary panel after she complained about sharing a changing room with a transgender doctor. Peggie had been suspended after an exchange with the doctor, claiming she felt "embarrassed and intimidated," and subsequently filed an employment tribunal case against the health board. The case highlights the ongoing, intense debate in Scotland over gender identity and single-sex spaces, particularly in light of a recent UK Supreme Court ruling that defined "woman" by biological sex under the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Investment firm Blackstone has been spending billions to acquire rental housing properties across the United States, including apartment complexes and single-family homes. The company's strategy focuses on markets with strong job and population growth, particularly in Sun Belt states and major cities. Despite its large investments, Blackstone owns less than 1% of the total rental homes in the country. Analysts note that with the cost of building new properties remaining high, acquiring existing ones is a favorable strategy that supports rent growth, positioning the firm to benefit from current market dynamics.

          <p>A deacon at a Michigan church is being praised as a hero after he used his pickup truck to stop a potential mass shooting. Richard Pryor saw a man armed with a rifle begin firing in the church parking lot and, realizing there was no time to wait for police, rammed the attacker with his vehicle. This action temporarily disabled the shooter, giving the church's armed security team time to respond and fatally shoot the assailant. Over 100 congregants, including children, were inside at the time, and Pryor's quick thinking is credited with preventing a tragedy.</p>

          <p>In a humorous column, Arwa Mahdawi shares that her four-year-old daughter has become a staunch royalist and penned a letter inviting King Charles III to their home in Philadelphia for ice cream. The author, a self-described republican, reflects on the irony of raising a monarchist in America while gently trying to steer her toward other role models. She wryly notes the contrast between her daughter's innocent admiration for royalty and the political realities of figures like Donald Trump, who also seeks an audience with the king. The piece offers a light-hearted take on parenting and politics.</p>

          <p>Research shows that cognitive functions like memory and processing speed naturally decline after age 40, but certain lifestyle factors can significantly mitigate this process. A large-scale online study identified "exceptional performers" whose brains function like those of people 30 years younger, linking their success to genetics and key habits. Scientists emphasize the importance of high-quality sleep, which allows the brain to cycle through restorative stages, and maintaining cardiovascular health. Avoiding smoking, limiting alcohol, and getting regular exercise are also crucial for preserving brain function later in life.</p>

Her entry would immediately reshape the dynamics, though she would face questions about her past presidential campaigns.
