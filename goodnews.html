          <h2>UK Considers Youth Mobility Scheme as Part of New EU Deal</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. This proposal has faced criticism from Conservative Party leaders who describe it as "free movement through the back door". Starmer insists that the scheme is not a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, as Labour has a "red line in our manifesto about freedom of movement" and that "youth mobility is not freedom of movement". The BBC reports that an agreement in principle is expected at Monday's summit, though the final details are still under negotiation, with the EU pushing for longer stays than the UK is willing to consider.</p>

          <p>The Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) reported record revenues and member payouts for the 2023-24 season, but also saw a significant increase in legal expenses due to lawsuits from Clemson and Florida State. The league's revenue increased to $711.4 million, allowing an average payout of nearly $45 million to its football-playing members. The launch of the ESPN-partnered ACC Network has boosted TV revenue, but legal expenses jumped by 70.2% amid challenges to the league's exit fees. The ACC has revamped its revenue-distribution plan to factor in TV viewership and reward top-draw schools, aiming to generate more revenue amid a growing gap behind the Big Ten and Southeastern conferences.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth," in the Canadian Rockies. The creature, about the length of an index finger, had a circular mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws. The discovery reveals that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts, with a multi-segmented abdomen-like region lined with gills. This find provides insights into the diversity of life on Earth before the Cambrian explosion, showcasing the early evolution of arthropods.</p>
