        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., centered on the theme of youth and the future of cultural traditions. The event showcased a diverse group of artisans, including a Guatemalan painter preserving her Maya identity and Bolivian rappers who integrate indigenous languages like Quechua and Aymara into their hip-hop. Other featured artists were refugee weavers revitalizing an ancient craft and a family of Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for renowned musicians like Dolly Parton. These ensembles, all rooted in the Global South, demonstrated their commitment to passing down their unique cultural heritage to the next generation.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 06:23:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is actively considering additional regulations to enhance online safety for children, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. This comes as new age-verification rules, enforced by the media regulator Ofcom, are set to take effect this month under the Online Safety Act. Alexander stated that these initial measures are a foundation but not the "end of the conversation," with the Technology Secretary exploring further actions to address issues like addictive online habits. Ofcom's chief executive affirmed the regulator's commitment to enforcing the new requirements but acknowledged that future legislation may be needed to address emerging challenges from artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing and homelessness crisis, California is creating its first-ever Cabinet-level agency dedicated exclusively to these issues. The new agency will be formed by splitting the existing Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency, a move supporters say is long overdue to elevate the topic to the highest level of state government. The primary goal is to streamline the state's complex and fragmented network of affordable housing funding programs, which are currently spread across multiple departments. While the reorganization is seen as a crucial first step, experts caution that simply restructuring bureaucracy will not solve the state's deep-seated housing affordability problems.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech's Dabiri Lab are transforming ordinary jellyfish into cyborgs by embedding them with microelectric controllers. These biohybrid robots can be remotely guided to swim and collect environmental data, such as temperature and pressure, from the ocean's depths. The project aims to provide a low-cost, scalable alternative to expensive underwater robots, making ocean research more accessible. Jellyfish are ideal candidates as they lack a central nervous system and pain receptors, and they can heal quickly after the device is removed. Current research focuses on improving the device's durability for deep-sea pressures and adding steering capabilities for more precise navigation.</p>

          <p>Talks are scheduled for next week between UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting and the British Medical Association (BMA) in an effort to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The strike, set to begin on July 25, is over a pay dispute, with doctors rejecting the government's 5.4% increase for this year. The BMA argues that real-terms pay has fallen by about 20% since 2008 and seeks a clear path to pay restoration. While the health secretary has indicated he will not increase the salary offer, he is reportedly open to discussing improvements to working conditions for the doctors.</p>

          <p>Six years after his triumphant victory at the 2019 Open, Irish golfer Shane Lowry is returning to Royal Portrush for the 2025 championship. Lowry reflects on his dominant performance, where he won by six strokes, calling the final holes of the third round the most incredible experience of his career. That year, he entered the tournament under the radar but returns this time as a former champion, which he acknowledges will bring a different level of expectation. Now a more experienced player and two-time Ryder Cup veteran, Lowry aims to manage the pressure and perform well again at the historic venue on the Antrim Coast.</p>

          <p>The third fight between Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano at Madison Square Garden marked a significant moment for women's boxing, not for its chaotic violence, but for its tactical maturity. This article argues that true equality in the sport is not just the right to be thrilling but the right to be strategic, to fight safely, and to win ugly, just as male boxers do. The fight transcended spectacle because it was about winning, not just performing. However, the sport remains filled with contradictions, from disparities in pay to the objectification of ring girls. Ultimately, the bout affirmed a woman's right to risk her body for glory and self-belief, reclaiming it for something more defiant than traditional roles.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of the planet Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is set to be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert in Niger, where it was found in November 2023. Scientific analysis confirmed its Martian origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the 1976 Viking space probe. The rare meteorite represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet and is significantly larger than any previous find.</p>

In a symbolic act, 30 PKK fighters destroyed their weapons in Iraqi Kurdistan, following a call from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan to end the insurgency. The PKK has demanded concessions from Turkey, including Ocalan's release and legal reforms, for full disarmament. While Turkey's government remains cautious, it has called the move an opportunity for peace.

          <p>This article focuses on Warren Buffett's long-standing investment advice for the average person: buy a low-cost S&P 500 index fund, specifically citing the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO). It notes that consistently outperforming the S&P 500 is extremely difficult, with nearly 90% of professional large-cap fund managers failing to do so over the last 15 years. The article illustrates the potential for long-term growth, calculating that a consistent monthly investment of $500 could grow to over $1 million in three decades based on the index's historical annual return of 10.4%. The fund's broad diversification and very low expense ratio are presented as key advantages. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Forty years after its historic broadcast, Live Aid is remembered as a monumental moment of global unity and fundraising for famine relief in Ethiopia, but it is also viewed with a more critical lens today. Conceived by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the 1985 concert featured an unprecedented lineup of rock stars and raised millions. However, in retrospect, the event has been criticized for its lack of diversity, featuring no African performers on the main stages and very few women. While Geldof defends the choices as necessary to maximize donations, critics argue it reinforced a patronizing "white savior" image of Africa, a debate that continues to surround its legacy.</p>

          <p>A campaign is calling for cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English instead of Latin to prevent potentially life-threatening allergic reactions. Currently, companies use the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), a system based on Latin and scientific names, which can make it difficult for consumers to identify allergens like peanut oil or almond oil. MP Becky Gittins, who has a severe nut allergy, is leading the campaign, arguing the current system puts people at risk. While the industry's trade association defends the Latin-based system for providing a universal global standard, allergy sufferers and advocates argue for clearer, more accessible labeling similar to food packaging.</p>
