This continues a trend for the Saints, who have favored rookie punters in recent years. Despite the cutthroat nature of the situation, the two maintain a friendly and supportive rivalry.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a promising performance in his first start since a season-opening shoulder injury, striking out eight batters over five innings. However, his strong return was marred by two home runs from Tampa Bay Rays slugger Yandy Díaz, leading to a 4-0 loss for the Dodgers. Both home runs took advantage of the unusually short right-field wall at the Rays' temporary ballpark. Despite the loss, Snell's sharp pitching provided an encouraging sign for the Dodgers' rotation.</p>

Gad had initially announced he would have to pull out of the three-night run, and John Stamos was slated to replace him. However, after testing negative, Gad confirmed his return for the final performance, much to the delight of fans. The highly anticipated show, also starring Cynthia Erivo and Adam Lambert, has been met with emotional standing ovations.</p>

          <p>Romania is taking steps to formally recognize the genocide of its Sinti and Roma populations during World War II, a topic long suppressed in the nation's public discourse. At a recent commemoration event, Romania's new president, Nicusor Dan, emphasized the need to confront the country's history and combat ongoing racism. During the war, Romania's pro-Nazi regime deported over 25,000 Roma to Transnistria, where most perished from starvation, disease, or violence. This official acknowledgment marks a significant shift from decades of silence toward addressing deep-rooted discrimination.</p>

          <p>A decade after its launch, the Ethereum blockchain has grown from a cypherpunk experiment into a foundational technology for global finance. Initially a bare-bones network, it introduced "programmable money," enabling smart contracts and decentralized applications that now underpin a $420 billion ecosystem. Major financial institutions like BlackRock and Deutsche Bank are now building on Ethereum, using it for tokenized funds and transaction settlement. While creators remain wary of centralization risks, Ethereum has become the invisible backbone for trillions in payments and is increasingly integrated into Wall Street's core infrastructure.</p>

          <p>England faces a formidable chase of 374 runs to win the fifth and final Test against India at The Oval after a challenging third day. India built a strong second-innings total of 396, largely thanks to a sublime century from Yashasvi Jaiswal and surprise fifties from Akash Deep and Washington Sundar. England's bowlers were hindered by six dropped catches, though Josh Tongue managed to claim five wickets. In their reply, England reached 50-1 at the close, but the late dismissal of opener Zak Crawley has given India momentum.</p>

          <p>Toyota is reportedly preparing to enter the booming compact pickup market with a new model aimed at competing directly with the successful Ford Maverick and Hyundai Santa Cruz. The vehicle is expected to launch around 2026 or 2027 and will likely be built on a car-based platform, such as the one used for the RAV4 or Corolla. This strategy targets urban drivers and those seeking a lifestyle vehicle rather than a heavy-duty work truck. The new pickup is anticipated to be hybrid-focused, filling a significant gap in Toyota's current North American lineup.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has partially limited President Trump's sweeping proclamation to shut down the asylum system at the U.S.-Mexico border. The D.C. Circuit Court panel ruled that the administration cannot use the order to summarily deport migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture without a hearing. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system, it affirmed that migrants must be allowed to apply for other mandatory humanitarian protections. The ruling stems from a lawsuit challenging the president's January order.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's ruling that restricts immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming that federal agents cannot base arrests solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that such "roving patrols" conducted by the Trump administration appeared to be predicated on unconstitutional racial profiling. The ruling requires ICE and CBP agents to have reasonable suspicion that an individual is in the country illegally before detaining them. Advocates praised the decision as a crucial protection against indiscriminate enforcement.</p>

          <p>Organizations like Black People Will Swim are working to dismantle the historical barriers that have led to racial disparities in swimming ability in the U.S. The legacy of segregation, where Black Americans were systematically excluded from public pools, has contributed to a reality where 64% of Black children have little to no swimming ability. This lack of access has resulted in significantly higher drowning rates among Black youth. By providing accessible lessons and creating supportive communities, these groups aim to foster a new generation of swimmers and instructors.</p>
