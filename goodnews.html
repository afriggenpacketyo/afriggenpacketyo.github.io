          <p>German companies operating in China are experiencing economic challenges due to the ongoing trade war between the United States and China, primarily through indirect effects on the Chinese economy. A survey by the German Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that Washington‚Äôs tariffs on Chinese goods have had the most significant impact on its members. However, the 'in China for China' strategy, where firms focus on serving Chinese consumers rather than exporting, has helped to insulate them from direct trade disruptions. This localization strategy has proven beneficial in mitigating the adverse effects of the tariffs.</p>

          <p>John Urschel, a former NFL player for the Baltimore Ravens, transitioned to a career in mathematics and is now a faculty member at MIT. Urschel describes how he missed the academic environment and mathematical discussions during his time in the NFL, leading him to pursue a PhD at MIT while still playing football. He reflects on the changes in football since his playing days, including the increased use of analytics, and discusses his current research in linear algebra. Urschel also expresses concern about the uneven quality of education in the United States and the underrepresentation of Black mathematicians, emphasizing the importance of programs that broaden access to mathematical education.</p>

          <p>Many states are considering allowing community colleges to offer bachelor's degrees to fill 'higher education deserts,' particularly in rural areas where access to four-year universities is limited. This initiative aims to provide more affordable and accessible education options for students who may not be able to commute or afford traditional universities. While about half of the states already allow community colleges to offer bachelor's degrees, expansion efforts often face opposition from four-year institutions concerned about competition for students and resources. The goal is to train workers for in-demand fields and help rural workers advance in their careers without relocating.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain current interest rates due to concerns that President Trump's tariffs could lead to increased inflation and slower economic growth. Despite pressure from the president to lower rates, the Fed is expected to keep its benchmark borrowing rate between 4.25% and 4.5%. Trump's recent tariffs on imports have raised concerns about supply chain disruptions and rising prices, potentially creating a dilemma for the Fed between controlling inflation and supporting job growth. The Fed's decision will depend on how tariffs impact both inflation and unemployment rates in the coming months.</p>
