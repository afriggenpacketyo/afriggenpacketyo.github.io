          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 13:21:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article, authored by members of the Trump administration, details a strategy to achieve American energy dominance by aggressively promoting fossil fuels. The plan centers on the National Energy Dominance Council, which aims to cut regulations, expand coal leasing on federal lands, and reduce royalty rates to boost domestic production. The authors argue that these policies will lower energy costs for families, create jobs, and ensure a reliable power grid, contrasting their approach with the previous administration's focus on renewable energy sources. They assert that coal is essential for baseload power and national security.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has launched a fleet of autonomous delivery robots, named 'Dot,' on the streets of the Phoenix metro area. These bots are designed to handle smaller orders more efficiently than cars, capable of carrying up to 30 pounds and traveling at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour on roads, bike lanes, and sidewalks. The company's AI-powered platform determines which deliveries are best suited for the robots. This initiative represents a significant step in the automation of local commerce, aiming to reduce delivery costs and improve efficiency for businesses.</p>

          <p>The Florida Cabinet has given final approval for the construction of Donald Trump's presidential library on a 2.6-acre plot of land in Miami, adjacent to the city's historic Freedom Tower. The land was transferred from Miami Dade College to the state to facilitate the project, which was championed by Governor Ron DeSantis. The decision has drawn criticism and protests from some community members and academics, who argue that placing the library next to the Freedom Tower, a symbol of freedom for Cuban refugees, is inappropriate and blemishes its historical significance.</p>

          <p>Arianna Huffington, founder of Huffington Post and CEO of Thrive Global, is speaking out against the prevalent culture of overwork, calling it a "collective delusion" that burnout is a prerequisite for success. Drawing from her own experience of collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she emphasizes that scientific data proves individuals are more effective and creative when they prioritize rest and self-care. Huffington advocates for adopting "micro steps"—small, incremental changes—to build healthier habits rather than making drastic resolutions, arguing this is a more sustainable path to both well-being and professional achievement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced an agreement with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to voluntarily lower the cost of some of its most popular medications for American consumers. Under the deal, Pfizer will sell existing drugs to Medicaid patients at the lowest price offered in other developed nations and will guarantee similar pricing for new drugs across all payers. In return, Pfizer will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs, contingent on the company investing $70 billion to reshore its manufacturing and research facilities in the United States.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," revisits the groundbreaking all-female touring music festival of the late 1990s, co-founded by Sarah McLachlan. The film serves as a corrective to the mocking caricatures that have since overshadowed the festival's impact, highlighting it as a pragmatic response to an industry that marginalized female artists. It explores how Lilith Fair created an unprecedented sense of community, safety, and empowerment for both performers and audiences, demonstrating the commercial and cultural power of women in music at a time when they were often pitted against each other.</p>

          <p>Despite recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, savers can still earn substantial returns of around $1,000 or more through Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. The article outlines several strategies, such as depositing $24,000 into a 1-year CD at 4.20% or $8,200 into a 3-year CD at 3.95%. As rates are expected to continue falling, it advises savers to act promptly to lock in the current higher rates, suggesting options like CD laddering to maintain flexibility while capitalizing on the favorable interest climate before it diminishes further.
