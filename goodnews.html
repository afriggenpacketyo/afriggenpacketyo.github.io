          <h2>Former Manager Terry Francona Defends Cleveland Guardians' Name Change Amid Political Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 11:02:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former Cleveland manager Terry Francona has voiced his support for the team's name change from the "Indians" to the "Guardians." He stated he was proud of the organization for making a respectful decision, pushing back against recent calls from Donald Trump to revert to the old name. Francona suggested that opposition to the change often comes from a perspective that doesn't consider the feelings of all communities. The team's current management has also dismissed the political pressure, indicating they are focused on building the Guardians brand.</p>

          <p>Utility company Southern California Edison has announced it will establish a voluntary compensation fund for victims of January's destructive Eaton wildfire. The decision comes even though official investigations have not yet concluded whether the company's equipment was responsible for starting the blaze. The program aims to provide victims with expedited financial support for rebuilding, allowing them to avoid potentially lengthy and costly litigation. This move occurs amid multiple lawsuits filed against the utility by families and the city of Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Labubu doll, a Chinese creation from retailer Pop Mart, has become a global sensation, fueling a craze characterized by long queues and online fervor. These "ugly-cute" toys, often sold in "blind boxes," generated over $423 million in sales for Pop Mart last year, with a significant portion coming from outside China. The trend marks one of China's first homegrown global toy megahits, shifting its role from primarily a manufacturer to a creator of popular culture. Collectors are drawn to the thrill of the surprise and the difficulty in acquiring the sought-after figures.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters surged, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The spike in interest appears to be fueled by individual investors on forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, following the announcement of a new ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The stock has significant short interest, making it a target for a "short squeeze" where investors bet against the stock are forced to buy shares to cover their positions. The rally provides a temporary boost for the company's stock, which has otherwise struggled this year.</p>

          <p>The World Boxing Organization (WBO) has officially ordered undisputed heavyweight champion Oleksandr Usyk to begin negotiations for a mandatory title defense against Joseph Parker. Parker, from New Zealand, holds the WBO interim belt and has re-emerged as a top contender after a string of recent victories. The two parties have been given a 30-day window to reach an agreement before the fight is sent to a purse bid. This development sets the stage for a major bout in the heavyweight division following Usyk's recent unification victory.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced a new draft law aimed at guaranteeing the independence of the country's key anti-corruption agencies. This move comes just days after his government passed legislation that curbed the autonomy of these bodies, sparking nationwide protests and criticism from Western partners. The original law placed the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu) and the Specialised Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (Sap) under the control of the presidentially-appointed prosecutor general. Zelensky's reversal appears to be a direct response to the significant domestic and international backlash.</p>

          <p>The International Criminal Court (ICC) has found two former militia leaders from the Central African Republic guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Alfred Yekatom, known as "Rambo," and Patrice-Edouard Ngaissona were convicted for their roles in directing a brutal campaign of murder, torture, and persecution against Muslim civilians in 2013 and 2014. The men were leaders of the predominantly Christian "anti-Balaka" militias. The verdict marks a significant step in holding individuals accountable for the widespread atrocities committed during the country's civil conflict.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to hold its key interest rate steady at 2%, pausing a year-long cycle of rate cuts. The decision was widely expected and comes as policymakers assess the economic impact of potential U.S. trade tariffs and wait for more clarity on the global economic outlook. While inflation has returned to the bank's 2% target, officials noted that the environment remains highly uncertain, particularly due to trade disputes. ECB President Christine Lagarde offered no hints about future moves, emphasizing a "wait and watch" and data-dependent approach.</p>

The criminal group operated in the central State of Mexico, extorting businesses and controlling labor unions across numerous industries. A large-scale security operation involving nearly 3,000 personnel resulted in eight key arrests and the seizure of stolen goods, vehicles, and exotic animals.
