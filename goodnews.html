          <p>Mortgage application volume rose 12.5% last week, reaching a one-month high after adjusting for the Memorial Day holiday, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances increased slightly to 6.93%. Refinance applications rose 16% for the week, while purchase applications increased by 10%, driven by loosening housing inventory. Despite economic uncertainty, homebuyers are taking advantage of increased housing supply in certain markets, though rates have remained in a narrow range for months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Electric vehicle sales in Europe are experiencing a strong recovery in 2025, with registrations up 20% from January to April, driven by battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). The rebound is providing relief to the automotive industry, which faces rising production costs and competition from Chinese EV manufacturers. A key factor is an EU mandate requiring automakers to cut fleet-wide CO2 emissions by 15%, leading to increased corporate sales. While consumer enthusiasm remains mixed, the regulatory pressure is proving effective in boosting EV adoption across Europe.</p>
