          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady, savers have an opportunity to secure high returns through certificates of deposit (CDs). The article suggests that while short-term CD rates are currently higher, long-term CDs can offer substantial earnings over an extended period. It advises savers to determine the maximum amount they can deposit for the longest possible term without impacting their daily budget. Additionally, it recommends using the current period to shop around for the best rates, particularly from online banks, and to re-evaluate where other savings are held to maximize interest earnings.

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from using a fast-track deportation process on migrants who entered the U.S. legally under humanitarian parole. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb could curtail a controversial practice of arresting migrants at their immigration court hearings for expedited removal. The judge found the policy illegal, noting it unfairly targets individuals who have followed legal procedures. This decision provides a temporary reprieve for hundreds of thousands of migrants, including those admitted through the CBP One app and a sponsorship program, though an appeal is expected.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a significant rally over the past year, the price of gold may stagnate in August due to several competing economic factors. The Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady removes a key catalyst for price movement, as rate cuts typically boost gold's appeal. Furthermore, uncertainty surrounding the next inflation report and evolving demand for portfolio diversification could lead to a period of price stability rather than continued growth. Investors are advised to focus on gold's long-term value as a hedge rather than short-term price fluctuations in the current environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Ohio couple has welcomed a baby boy who developed from an embryo that was frozen for more than 30 years, likely setting a new record for the longest storage time resulting in a live birth. The process, known as embryo adoption, involved the couple receiving donated embryos that were created via in-vitro fertilization in 1994. This event highlights the growing practice of donating unused embryos, a concept supported by groups who believe life begins at conception. The birth connects the new parents with the donor, who expressed a desire to be part of the child's life.</p>

Figma's successful public offering is the latest in a series of tech IPOs, signaling a potential revival of the market after a prolonged drought. The company's strong performance comes after a proposed $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was abandoned last year due to regulatory concerns over competition.</p>

          <p>A new study conducted by researchers at Oxford University has found that a common species of European songbird exhibits behavior akin to divorce. The research reveals that pairs of these birds, which are typically monogamous, will sometimes separate from their partners between breeding seasons. This finding provides new insights into the complex social and mating behaviors of birds. The study explores the potential evolutionary drivers behind such separations, contributing to a deeper understanding of animal relationships and reproductive strategies in the wild.</p>

          <p>The NFL is reportedly set to take an equity stake in ESPN, a move that would deepen the relationship between the sports league and the media giant. As part of the deal, ESPN is expected to take over operations of the NFL's media properties, including the NFL Network and the Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership comes as Disney, ESPN's parent company, adapts to the decline of traditional pay-TV and the rise of streaming. The deal would give the NFL a financial interest in its broadcast partner, potentially reshaping future media rights negotiations with other networks.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to revive the Presidential Fitness Test, a standardized set of exercises for schoolchildren that was phased out in 2013. The test, which includes drills like push-ups and a one-mile run, aims to address declining physical fitness and rising obesity rates among American youth. The administration argues that improving physical well-being is crucial for national vitality and military readiness. While some educators support the focus on fitness, others express caution, recalling the test's potential for causing humiliation and its limited effectiveness in promoting lifelong healthy habits.</p>
