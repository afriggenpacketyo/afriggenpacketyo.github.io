          <p>Newly released documents from the UK National Archives show that former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie received significant discounts on designer clothing, totaling tens of thousands of pounds. Between 2001 and 2002, Cherie Blair paid just £31,000 for items valued at over £75,000. The files reveal that Downing Street officials were concerned about the public perception and potential breach of the ministerial code, advising the Blairs to repay a portion of the discounts. It remains unclear from the documents whether this repayment occurred, though the Blairs' institute states that advice was sought and followed.</p>

          <p>Jin, the eldest member of the K-pop group BTS, recently performed solo shows at the Honda Center in Anaheim, demonstrating his unique appeal and deep connection with the group's fanbase. The concert, part of his #RUNSEOKJIN_EP. Tour, was designed as a love letter to existing fans, incorporating elements from his solo music releases and his quirky, humorous personality. After completing his mandatory military service, Jin has focused on his solo career, releasing two EPs. The review praises his vocal performance and ability to create an engaging, minimalist show that prioritizes fan interaction over elaborate choreography, solidifying his individual artistic identity.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Encourage Global Economic Liberalization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they have a potential positive side effect. The tariffs are exposing the self-defeating internal trade barriers that nations like Canada, China, and the European Union have maintained for years. The economic pressure from U.S. tariffs is compelling these countries to confront and dismantle their own long-standing domestic barriers to trade and commerce. This process of internal reform could unlock significant economic potential, potentially offsetting the negative impact of the tariffs and leading to more liberalized and efficient global economies.

          <p>Universal Music Group (UMG), the world's largest music company and home to artists like Taylor Swift and Drake, has filed for a secondary listing on a U.S. stock exchange.

The move is supported by major shareholders like billionaire investor Bill Ackman, who believes a U.S. listing will enhance the company's value and trading liquidity.

          <p>Following the devastating July Fourth floods in Texas, officials have accounted for the vast majority of over 160 people who were initially reported missing along the Guadalupe River. The top executive in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, stated that only three individuals remain unaccounted for. The large initial number of missing persons was primarily composed of tourists who had left the area after the floods without checking in. This sharp revision in numbers is common after large-scale disasters, as initial reports are often chaotic. The flash floods were responsible for at least 135 deaths in the state, with most occurring in Kerr County.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel has provided an update on his health two months after announcing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer said he feels "good" but is still working on his balance, which is affected by the condition. NPH involves a buildup of fluid in the brain and can impact mobility and other functions. The diagnosis forced Joel to cancel a series of concerts for 2025 and 2026 to focus on his health and undergo physical therapy, following a recent surgery.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has launched an investigation into a close call between a SkyWest regional jet and a B-52 military bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The SkyWest pilot had to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid the bomber, which he said appeared on a converging course without any prior warning from air traffic control. The Air Force stated the B-52 was conducting an approved flyover and that the airport's control tower, which is run by a private company and lacks radar, did not advise its crew of the inbound commercial flight. The pilot's calm explanation to passengers after landing safely was recorded and shared widely.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase, which he dubs "PARC"—that he believes will maintain their upward momentum, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these stocks represent a "two-track market," separate from the broader S&P 500, where a handful of names are relentlessly pushed higher by enthusiastic individual buyers. Cramer suggested that while these stocks are trendy, the PARC group stands out due to seemingly solid earnings and analyst attention. He advised that investors can profit from these names but should exercise discipline by taking gains when they occur. (not investment advice)</p>
