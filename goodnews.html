          <p>Nationwide 'No Kings' protests saw millions demonstrate against the Trump administration's policies in cities across the United States. Organizers framed the events as a defense of democracy against perceived authoritarianism, citing concerns over immigration tactics, federal intervention in states, and the expansion of presidential power. The protests were reported as being largely peaceful, featuring a wide range of participants and support from some Democratic politicians. Despite some Republican leaders denouncing the rallies, law enforcement in major cities like New York and Washington D.C. reported no protest-related arrests, highlighting the organized and non-violent nature of the mass demonstrations.</p>

          <p>A long-running investigation, aided by secret filming from the BBC, has culminated in the conviction of 14 people involved in a £28 million timeshare fraud. The scheme, run by a company called Sell My Timeshare (SMT), defrauded over 3,500 victims, most of whom were elderly individuals desperate to exit expensive timeshare contracts. The fraudsters used high-pressure sales tactics to sell useless fake "credits," funding a lavish lifestyle for the company's owners. The criminal proceedings have now concluded, bringing a measure of justice nine years after the BBC's initial exposé helped bring the scam to light.</p>

          <p>The annual Social Security Cost-Of-Living Adjustment (COLA) for 2026 will be determined by changes in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). This index measures inflation across a basket of goods and services, with the final COLA calculation based on data from the third quarter of the year. There is ongoing debate about the fairness of using the CPI-W, as critics argue it does not accurately reflect the spending habits of retirees, particularly concerning higher healthcare and housing costs. However, for now, this remains the established method for adjusting benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China has achieved significant success in its fight against desertification in the Ningxia region, pushing back the Mu Us Desert by more than 20 kilometers over the past several decades. Through extensive sand control and afforestation efforts at the Baijitan National Nature Reserve, authorities have stabilized vast areas of drifting sands that once threatened the provincial capital of Yinchuan and the Yellow River. The project has transformed over 45,000 hectares of desert into vegetated land, serving as a critical environmental barrier. A small portion of the original dunes has been preserved for ongoing research and demonstration purposes.</p>

          <p>Football players across Spain's La Liga staged on-field protests by refusing to move for the first 15 seconds of their matches. This coordinated action, involving high-profile clubs like Barcelona and Atletico Madrid, was a symbolic demonstration against the league's decision to schedule a regular season game in Miami, Florida. The Spanish Footballers' Association (AFE) organized the protest, citing a lack of transparency and dialogue from the league regarding the controversial plan. The move to play games abroad has been met with widespread discontent from players and some coaches, who believe it distorts the competition.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris stated that she believes former President Joe Biden made a "big mistake" by not inviting Tesla CEO Elon Musk to a 2021 White House event focused on electric vehicles. While executives from GM, Ford, and Stellantis attended, Musk's exclusion was widely seen as a nod to the United Auto Workers union, as Tesla's workforce is not unionized. In her new memoir, Harris argues that omitting the nation's leading EV manufacturer did not make sense and likely alienated Musk, who later became a significant financial backer for Donald Trump and the Republican party.</p>

          <p>A Greater Manchester Police sergeant has been awarded the King's Commendation for Bravery for his actions during a violent ambush in July 2023. Bodycam footage shows the moment Jacob Brown attacked Sgt Marc Foster from behind, holding a knife to his neck. Sgt Tim Ansell immediately intervened, grappling with the assailant despite being repeatedly stabbed himself. A third officer, PC Marcus Wolstencroft, ultimately subdued the attacker with a Taser. The actions of the three officers were credited with saving each other's lives and preventing harm to the public during the unprovoked assault.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a significant summer spending spree, Liverpool has experienced a recent slump in form, losing three consecutive matches. A tactical analysis suggests the club is feeling the effects of Trent Alexander-Arnold's departure to Real Madrid more deeply than anticipated. His absence has reportedly created issues in Liverpool's build-up play, particularly in bypassing high-pressure defenses and executing long, switching passes that were a hallmark of their attack. The article explores how the team is adapting, such as using new signing Florian Wirtz in a deeper role, but notes that these changes have yet to fully compensate for the unique skills Alexander-Arnold provided.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss Why Sexual Desire Often Wanes in Long-Term Relationships</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-19 00:56:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>It is common for sexual desire to decrease after the initial passionate phase of a long-term relationship, according to psychologists and sexologists. This shift is partly due to hormonal changes, as the initial cocktail of sex-drive hormones gives way to oxytocin, a hormone that fosters bonding and dampens libido. The article also discusses how factors like communication, unmet sexual needs, and the "orgasm gap" can disproportionately affect women's desire over time. Experts recommend open communication about needs and maintaining physical affection to help sustain intimacy in relationships that have moved beyond the early stages.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rising temperatures and extreme weather events are placing significant stress on some of the United Kingdom's most valued native tree species, such as the oak. In response, Forestry England has released a list of thirty tree species, including both native and non-native varieties like the coast redwood, that are better suited to thrive in the UK's expected future climate. This strategy, known as assisted migration, aims to create more resilient and diverse forests capable of adapting to climate change. The initiative highlights a proactive approach to conservation as trees struggle to migrate and adapt naturally at the rapid pace of human-driven warming.</p>

          <p>Japan is on the verge of appointing its first female Prime Minister, as reports indicate the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) will form a coalition with the Japan Innovation Party. This new alliance will provide the necessary support in parliament for LDP leader Sanae Takaichi to be elected as prime minister. The deal comes after Takaichi's initial path to the premiership was blocked when the LDP's long-term junior coalition partner, Komeito, departed the government. The new agreement signals a resolution to the recent political turmoil and marks a historic moment for Japanese politics.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans' hopes for a College Football Playoff berth took a significant hit after a 34-24 road loss to rival Notre Dame. In a rain-soaked game, USC's offense committed several costly turnovers, including a critical fumble on a trick play in the fourth quarter, and the defense struggled to contain Notre Dame's rushing attack, which amassed 306 yards. Coach Lincoln Riley took responsibility for several "stupid" play calls that put his team in poor positions. With a second loss on their record, the Trojans now have no margin for error for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>UCLA secured its third consecutive victory with a dramatic 20-17 comeback win over Maryland, sealed by a last-second field goal. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava led a game-tying touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter before briefly exiting with a knee injury. After being cleared to play, he returned with only 35 seconds left and orchestrated a rapid drive into field goal range, which was aided by a crucial 35-yard run from reserve running back Anthony Frias II. The victory continues an impressive midseason turnaround for the Bruins under interim coach Tim Skipper.</p>
