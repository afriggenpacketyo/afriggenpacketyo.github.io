          <p>The global fur industry has experienced a dramatic collapse over the past decade, with the number of animals farmed for fur falling from over 140 million in 2014 to just over 20 million in 2024. This steep decline is attributed to a major shift in public perception, successful animal welfare campaigns, and numerous fashion brands adopting fur-free policies. Legislative bans in Europe, coupled with the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mink farms and changing economic conditions in China and Russia, have also significantly contributed to the industry's downfall.</p>

          <p>Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, is taking drastic measures to address its chronic air pollution problem by implementing a phased ban on gas-powered motorbikes and mopeds. Starting in July 2026, these vehicles will be restricted from the city's central ring road, with the ban expanding to other major roads by 2030. As one of the world's most polluted cities, Hanoi hopes this aggressive policy, along with a new ban on single-use plastics, will significantly improve its environmental quality and public health.</p>

          <p>A pit bull is being hailed as a hero in Pittsburgh after it braved a busy street to get a stranger's attention and lead him to its owners, who were unresponsive in a tent encampment. The man who followed the dog, Gary Thynes, called 911, and the two individuals were transported to a hospital for emergency care. Thynes has since agreed to foster the dog while its owners recover, in an act of kindness that has garnered widespread praise alongside the dog's life-saving actions.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Tonight in Jungleland," delves into the creation of Bruce Springsteen's seminal 1975 album, "Born to Run," revealing the immense pressure and perfectionism involved. Among the revelations, the book details how Springsteen was on the verge of being dropped by his label and initially disliked the finished album so much that he threw a copy into a swimming pool. It also highlights the crucial role of co-producer Jon Landau, who helped shape key tracks like "Thunder Road" and pushed Springsteen toward a more streamlined rock sound.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in developing its own aviation supply chain, aiming to reduce its dependence on foreign-made components for its aircraft. A key project is the domestically produced CJ-1000A jet engine, which is reportedly progressing on schedule and intended to power the home-grown C919 airliner. This push for self-sufficiency is a crucial part of Beijing's broader strategy to establish itself as a major, independent force in the global civil aviation industry, from nose to tail.</p>
