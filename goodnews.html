          <h2>Former Supreme Court Justice David Souter Dies at 85</h2>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter passed away at 85 in New Hampshire. Appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990, Souter often sided with liberal justices, frustrating Bush and other Republicans. A notable example was in 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey, where he upheld the right to abortion, a decision later undone by the Supreme Court in 2022. After retiring in 2009, Souter continued to serve as a judge on the U.S Circuit Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit for over a decade.</p>

Raducanu expressed that she doesn't feel entirely comfortable on clay but is slowly finding her feet. She will face Russia's Veronika Kudermetova in the third round.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article explores the preserved SoHo building where conceptual artists Christo and Jeanne-Claude lived and worked for 50 years. The building at 48 Howard Street remains almost exactly as it was when they occupied it, with Christo‚Äôs sketches and art supplies still in place. The couple was known for their massive, site-specific installations, and the foundation is exploring options to open the home to the public, preserving their legacy of creating egalitarian and wonderous art. They financed their own projects and were known for their independence from commercial influence.</p>

          <h2>Apartment Renter Behavior Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 11:54:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC article discusses a striking trend in the apartment rental market: low turnover. Typically, about half of apartment renters in large urban markets move when their leases expire, but that is not happening now. The low turnover is attributed to factors such as an unaffordable for-sale market, lack of rental supply on the coasts, economic uncertainty, the cost of moving, and a shift to suburban apartments. As a result, landlords are getting better pricing from renewals and improving cash flow.</p>
