          <p>President Donald Trump used social media to demand that "everyone" keep oil prices down following U.S. strikes on Iran, warning that higher prices would benefit "the enemy." U.S. crude oil prices subsequently declined slightly. Trump's message comes amid concerns that escalating conflict in the Middle East could disrupt energy supplies and cause global oil prices to spike. He also urged the Department of Energy to increase domestic drilling, although oil production decisions are primarily made by private companies based on market dynamics. The oil market has been relatively stable despite geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>While tech stocks, including Apple, previously acted as a safe haven during market volatility like the COVID-19 pandemic, this role has shifted recently. Apple's underperformance has raised questions about the sector's stability, even as broader tech indices have rebounded. Investors are now diversifying into traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples, indicating a broader approach to managing risk. Experts suggest that investors are increasingly comfortable with market volatility and are focusing on diversified portfolios rather than relying solely on tech as a safe haven.</p>

They also suggest relying on vendors' expertise to find cost-effective solutions and being honest about budget constraints. While asking for cash gifts is common, couples shouldn't depend on it to cover expenses, as funding a wedding requires balancing various priorities and realistic cost assessments.</p>

          <h2>Warning Signs the IRS May Garnish Your Wages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 10:39:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several warning signs indicate that the IRS may be preparing to garnish your wages for unpaid taxes, including multiple notices about unpaid taxes, a Final Notice of Intent to Levy, a federal tax lien, and contact from the IRS to your employer. To avoid wage garnishment, it is important to take action before the garnishment begins, such as requesting a Collection Due Process hearing, setting up a payment plan, exploring hardship options, or working with a tax relief specialist. Proactive communication and good faith efforts to resolve the debt can often lead to a solution that protects your paycheck.</p>

          <h2>Fed Governor Bowman Favors July Interest Rate Cut if Inflation Stays Low</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 10:33:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would support an interest rate cut at the next policy meeting in July, provided inflation pressures remain contained. Bowman's comments align with those of fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting that tariffs are likely to have a temporary and muted impact on prices. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) voted to hold its key interest rate at its last meeting, but Bowman's remarks signal a potential shift towards easing monetary policy. Traders are assigning a low probability to a move at the July meeting but a higher likelihood of a cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A heat wave is forecast to bring several days of record-high temperatures across much of the United States. The National Weather Service has called it "the first significant heat wave this season". More than 150 million Americans are under the highest-level extreme heat alerts. The heat index is what the actual temperature feels like when it's combined with relative humidity, and meteorologists say it's due to a heat dome. The simplest way to way to avoid heat-related illnesses is to stay out of the sun and avoid extended time outdoors in extreme temperatures, experts say.</p>

          <p>Amazon's second batch of Kuiper internet satellites reached low Earth orbit, adding to its plans for a massive constellation and ramping up competition with SpaceX's Starlink. A United Launch Alliance rocket carrying 27 Kuiper satellites lifted off from a launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida. Monday's mission was rescheduled twice, owing to inclement weather and a problem with the rocket booster. This launch marks a significant step for Amazon in its efforts to provide global internet access through its Project Kuiper.</p>
