        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Texas Roadhouse is experiencing strong same-store sales growth, particularly in April, reflecting continued customer demand for quality meals at fair prices. However, the company faces potential challenges due to rising beef costs and tariff impacts, leading to a revised full-year commodity inflation outlook of approximately 4%. While competitors like Darden Restaurants and Bloomin' Brands project lower inflation, Texas Roadhouse acknowledges the impact of tighter cattle supplies and seafood tariffs. Despite these cost pressures, analysts maintain a positive outlook, citing the restaurant chain's value proposition and recent sales performance, while investors are advised to monitor the stock's overbought condition.

          <p>Following MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred's decision to remove Pete Rose from the permanently ineligible list, ESPN's Tony Kornheiser clarified that Rose's Hall of Fame induction is not guaranteed. Kornheiser highlighted that baseball writers, known as "guardians of the game," ultimately decide Hall of Fame eligibility and take violations seriously. He noted that Rose's gambling on games as a manager, similar to Joe Jackson's fixing games, could hinder his chances, and that Barry Bonds, Mark McGwire, and Roger Clemens have not been voted into the Hall of Fame yet either. While Kornheiser personally supports Rose's induction with his sins and accomplishments noted on the plaque, he doesn't see him as a first-ballot Hall of Famer.</p>

          <p>Burberry has announced organizational changes that may lead to a reduction of approximately 1,700 roles globally by 2027, as part of ongoing turnaround efforts. The cost-cutting measures, including procurement and real estate adjustments, are projected to save ¬£60 million, adding to the ¬£40 million in savings announced previously. These cuts will impact around 20% of Burberry's overall headcount, primarily in office-based and store roles, as well as at its Castleford factory. Despite sales declines across all regions, shares jumped 8.5% after the announcement, and the company remains optimistic about future sustainable profitable growth despite macroeconomic challenges.</p>

          <p>Salmon sperm facials, also known as salmon DNA facials, have emerged as a popular skincare trend, promising youthful and smooth skin through microneedling. The procedure involves applying salmon DNA topically to the face after creating channels in the skin via microneedling. Originating from wound healing studies in Italy in the 1980s and gaining popularity in Korea, the treatment uses polynucleotides from salmon sperm to stimulate collagen production and reduce inflammation. While proponents cite scientific evidence supporting its efficacy, some dermatologists remain skeptical, citing potential harm to patients with rosacea and sustainability concerns related to salmon populations.</p>

          <p>Tencent, a Chinese tech giant, reported a 13% year-on-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong performance in its gaming business. Domestic games revenue rose 24% year-on-year, while international gaming revenue increased by 23%. The company's ubiquitous messaging app, WeChat, with over 1.4 billion monthly active users, also contributed to growth through advertising and Mini Programs. While revenue beat expectations, net profit fell short, but the overall performance indicates continued strength in Tencent's core businesses.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will testify before House and Senate committees to discuss the Trump administration's proposed budget and the ongoing restructuring of HHS. The agency has begun laying off approximately 10,000 workers and consolidating institutes, which Kennedy defends as necessary to eliminate wasteful spending. Kennedy's past statements on vaccines, which critics say contradict his support for vaccines, may also be scrutinized. Despite some concerns, Kennedy maintains a productive relationship with Sen. Bill Cassidy, and the secretary is expected to address concerns about how HHS will maintain its critical duties.</p>

          <p>Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to present his agenda in his first address to the Bundestag, focusing on greater efficiency and longer working hours. Merz warned that work-life balance alone won't sustain national prosperity and pledged to cut energy costs and bureaucracy while pushing for a 40-hour workweek with flexible arrangements. He also described his cabinet's lack of federal experience as a "great opportunity" for real change and aims for swift action on growth, migration, and defense.</p>

          <h2>Qatar's Charm Offensive Pays Off with Trump Visit and Potential Jet Donation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 05:03:27 EDT</div>

          <p>Qatar's charm offensive, which includes spending millions on lobbyists, appears to be paying off as President Trump prepares to visit the emirate and may receive a luxury jet as a gift. This marks a significant turnaround from Trump's past criticism of Qatar as a funder of terrorism. Despite objections from Democrats and some MAGA supporters, Trump defends the potential gift, highlighting Qatar's role in mediating the Gaza conflict and its strategic relationship with the United States. The visit underscores Qatar's efforts to compete with regional rivals and solidify its global reputation.</p>
