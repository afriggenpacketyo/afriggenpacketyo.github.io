          <h2>Cheap Chinese Solar Panels Disrupting Pakistan's Energy Market</h2>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should take a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by exporting solar panels, potentially creating a model for the Global South; however, a Chinese energy scholar questions the financial viability. The increasing influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, leading to stranded assets. Pakistan has become the second-largest destination for Chinese solar panels due to a zero tax rate, causing a strategic contradiction where China's solar panels are outcompeting its own power plants. The country has witnessed a rapid transition to distributed solar power generation on rooftops in recent years.</p>

          <p>A Japanese government report reveals that domestic tourism is struggling to reach pre-pandemic levels despite a surge in inbound visitors, encouraging residents to explore their own country's regional attractions. The Japan Tourism Agency is shifting its focus from inbound visitors to domestic travelers, whose numbers are down 8.2 percent compared to 2019. The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that encourages engagement between travelers and locals, moving away from the typical tourist experience, aiming to increase the frequency and duration of domestic trips, while hot spring resorts and local food remain popular trip themes for nearly all age groups.</p>

          <p>Muslim pilgrims have gathered at Mount Arafat for prayers, marking the high point of the annual hajj pilgrimage, with Saudi officials urging participants to avoid being outside during the hottest hours. Thousands of pilgrims congregated around the hill and surrounding plain, where the Prophet Mohammed is believed to have delivered his last sermon. Saudi authorities have implemented heat mitigation efforts to prevent a repeat of last year's hajj, which saw numerous deaths due to extreme temperatures, expanding shaded areas, deploying more medics, and utilizing cooling units. Authorities have also cracked down on unregistered pilgrims to ensure the safety and well-being of all participants.</p>

          <p>Italians will participate in a referendum that includes a proposal to halve the time of legal residency required for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for Italian citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum is considered a rare chance for Italians to make the country‚Äôs bureaucracy slightly more benevolent, as the Italian state has been tightening up its citizenship rules for the past three decades. Prime Minister Meloni and several high-profile ministers are encouraging people to skip the vote, hoping that fewer than 50% of Italians will turn up to the polls. By relaxing the rules on naturalization, Italians would be recognizing the dignity and diversity of millions more of their should-be-compatriots, and enriching their own national story with new protagonists in the process.</p>

          <p>Dinosaur feathers found trapped in Burmese amber have shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. The researchers were able to gain insight into how feathers evolved during this era, dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. While modern birds are the direct descendants of dinosaurs, scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute investigated the earliest stages in our body's colonisation by bacteria, fungi and more, and collected stool samples from 1,082 newborns in the first week of life. One particular early inhabitant of the human body, Bifidobacterium longum, seemed to have a protective effect, and the protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean.</p>
