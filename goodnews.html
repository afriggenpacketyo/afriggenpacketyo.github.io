          <p>Following the departure of Daniel Levy, Vinai Venkatesham has been appointed as the new chief executive of Tottenham Hotspur, marking a significant leadership change for the club. Venkatesham, who previously served as CEO for North London rivals Arsenal, is known for his role in appointing manager Mikel Arteta and for his empathetic leadership during the pandemic. His management style is described as inclusive and understated, and he is expected to rely on the expertise of the club's technical staff for football-related decisions. The move signals a potential shift in Tottenham's boardroom dynamics and negotiation strategies.</p>

          <p>A Massachusetts family is sharing their experience after their one-year-old son, Jonny Terrell, was diagnosed with malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and aggressive cancer. After his parents noticed a persistent series of infections and a suddenly swollen stomach, doctors discovered a large tumor in his liver. Following an intensive treatment plan involving chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation at Massachusetts General Hospital, Jonny is now in remission. His story highlights the emotional and financial struggles families face during such a crisis and underscores the importance of parental intuition when a child's health is in question.</p>

          <p>Scientists at China's premier radar development institute have reported a landmark test flight of an AI-powered radar system that appears to be unjammable. According to a peer-reviewed paper, the AI-enhanced system maintained a target tracking continuity of over 99%, a significant improvement over the 70-80% achieved by conventional radar under the same jamming conditions. The project's lead scientist stated that this technological advancement could represent a "paradigm shift" in radar design philosophy. This development signals a major step forward in China's military electronic warfare capabilities.</p>

          <p>China is designing a "kinetic impact demonstration mission" to test its ability to defend Earth from potential asteroid threats, according to a top space researcher. The plan involves launching both an impactor and an observer spacecraft to target a small asteroid tens of millions of kilometers away. The goal is to alter the asteroid's orbit by a small but measurable amount, between 3 to 5 centimeters. If successful, this mission would make China the second country, after the United States, to demonstrate this planetary defense capability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices surging to record levels this year, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), rather than purchasing physical bullion. ETFs are considered a more liquid, low-cost, and tax-efficient method for investing in gold. Despite the current rally, most financial advisors suggest limiting gold to a small portion of a well-diversified portfolio, typically less than 3 percent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the filmed version of the musical "Hamilton" now in theaters, a cultural analysis re-evaluates its impact a decade after its Broadway debut. The article explores how the show, once seen as emblematic of the hopeful Obama era, feels different in the current political landscape. Initially celebrated for its progressive, immigrant-centric narrative, the musical later faced critiques for its portrayal of the Founding Fathers and its perceived glossing over of issues like slavery. The show's journey from a symbol of unity to a more contested cultural artifact reflects the nation's own political and social shifts over the last ten years.</p>

          <p>The Catholic Church is set to canonize Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, making him the first Millennial saint.

The Church has highlighted his "normality" as a teen who played video games and wore Nikes, presenting him as a relatable model for young Catholics in the digital age. His rapid path to sainthood reflects both a concerted effort by his family and the Church's desire for a modern figure to inspire younger generations.</p>

The honor recognizes the soldiers' extraordinary bravery and service in the face of intense racism within the segregated U.S. military of their time. Because white soldiers refused to serve with them, the regiment fought alongside the French army, where they served for 191 days in the trenches and earned a reputation for their tenacity. The medal, the highest civilian honor from Congress, will be displayed at the Smithsonian Institution.</p>

Other states, like New Mexico, have issued public health orders to maintain pharmacists' ability to administer vaccines.

          <p>Ford has revealed an ambitious plan to produce a new, more affordable electric pickup truck by 2027 with a target price of $30,000. The vehicle will feature a battery that is one-third smaller than current competitors while offering a similar range. The key to the cost reduction is a new "tree" manufacturing model, where large modules are built separately before final assembly, significantly reducing parts, welds, and complexity. This strategy aims to make Ford's struggling EV division profitable and increase the adoption of electric vehicles by making them more accessible to a wider market.</p>
