          <p>Liam Dawson's impressive return to international cricket, marked by four wickets, and Jos Buttler's outstanding 96 runs helped England secure a 21-run victory over West Indies in the first T20 international. Dawson's skillful spin bowling disrupted the West Indies' batting lineup, while Buttler's inventive and destructive batting set a strong foundation for England's total of 188-6. This win extends England's successful start under new captain Harry Brook. The game was played in Chester-le-Street.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the author's experience as a visiting scholar at Harvard University, contrasting it with the idealized image of the institution. The author, who grew up in West Germany, viewed Harvard as a symbol of knowledge and academic excellence. During a visit, the author found Harvard's strength lies in its convening power, bridging differences through academic inquiry. The author also expresses concern over the Trump administration's efforts to eliminate visa programs that facilitate international academic exchange.</p>

          <p>A bull roamed freely through the streets of Birmingham for several hours, causing disruption and excitement among residents. The animal was first spotted near New Bond Street and was later seen near Small Heath railway station. Police and council officials eventually cornered the bull in an old Dunelm building, where animal-welfare officers were called in. The Hillside animal sanctuary in Norfolk offered to rehome the bull, which is believed to have escaped from an abattoir. The situation ended peacefully with the animal being secured.</p>

          <p>Tesla stock climbed after a $152 billion rout fueled by threats and insults between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Analysts suggest that the investor base of Tesla is largely unaffected by external events. There were reports that Trump had scheduled a call with Musk to broker a truce, though White House officials denied the claim. Musk spent several days attacking the president's signature tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination."</p>

          <p>Dilly Dally, a loggerhead turtle who survived a predator attack that led to a front flipper amputation, was released back into the Atlantic Ocean. The turtle was cared for at the Loggerhead Marinelife Center (LMC) in Florida for five months before being released. Dilly Dally will be tracked via satellite to monitor her movements and re-acclimation to the wild. Organizations like the LMC prioritize helping heal and protect sea turtles amid ongoing threats to the endangered creatures' population.</p>
