          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has asserted that major technology companies are "underspending, not overspending" on artificial intelligence, framing the current technological race as a "winner-take-all" situation. He pointed to Alphabet's recent strong earnings and increased capital expenditure as evidence that these investments are both necessary and justified to achieve market dominance. While acknowledging current shortcomings in AI chatbots, Cramer expressed confidence that the technology will improve, particularly with advanced chips from companies like Nvidia. He believes the company with the most accurate AI will ultimately secure a near-monopoly, yielding immense profits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The post-credits scene in Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" officially introduces the iconic villain Doctor Doom into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, setting up future conflicts. The scene depicts a cloaked figure approaching the son of Reed Richards and Sue Storm, hinting at a central role in the upcoming "Avengers: Doomsday" film, where Robert Downey Jr. is slated to portray the character. The film itself is set in an alternate universe, Earth-828, suggesting Doctor Doom's actions may be the catalyst for the team crossing over into the main MCU timeline. This introduction marks a significant pivot in the MCU's overarching narrative.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is poised for a significant contract extension next offseason, following the trend of young star receivers securing lucrative deals. After two standout seasons, Nacua, a former fifth-round draft pick, has become one of the NFL's best bargains and is now eligible for an extension. While Nacua remains focused on his on-field performance, recent contracts for other top receivers, such as Garrett Wilson's $90 million in guarantees, set a high benchmark for his potential earnings. His continued production will be a key factor for the Rams as they manage future contracts for their young core of star players.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson stated he is "very bullish" that Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterm elections, despite historical trends that typically favor the party not holding the presidency. Johnson bases his optimism on the number of Democratic-held districts that President Trump won in 2024 and recent demographic shifts toward the GOP. He also predicted that voters would soon feel the benefits of the recently passed tax cut bill, which he believes will act as "jet fuel" for the economy. He dismissed polling that shows public disapproval of the law, attributing it to misinformation from the media.</p>

          <p>The demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is growing significantly, with AI-related job postings increasing at a much faster rate than the overall job market over the past 15 years. A report from the Brookings Institution shows these listings more than doubled in the last year alone, as more companies in manufacturing and other sectors integrate AI into their operations. These roles, which range from specialized AI engineers to software developers with AI knowledge, also tend to offer higher salaries. While still a small fraction of the total labor market, AI job growth is expanding beyond traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>Alice Bag and Kid Congo Powers, two influential figures from the early Los Angeles punk scene, are continuing their creative partnership with a new project, Juanita y Juan. As Mexican Americans, they were among the many Latino artists who shaped the genre but were often overlooked in historical accounts. Through recent memoirs and their new musical duo, they are sharing their unique perspectives and cultural backgrounds. Their recent performance with the Bob Baker Marionette Theater for an audience of children demonstrates their enduring influence and commitment to inspiring young people to live authentically and embrace their own "weirdness."</p>
