However, she emphasized that over 1,150 political prisoners remain incarcerated and must also be freed. The release coincided with a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg and at least 10 prisoners have been released in total, including the former RFE journalist Ihar Karnei. The released prisoners have been moved to Lithuania, where they are receiving care.</p>

          <p>French scientists have identified a new blood type in a woman from Guadeloupe, named "Gwada negative," marking the 48th blood group system recognized worldwide. The discovery occurred 15 years after researchers received a blood sample from the patient during routine pre-surgery tests. This woman is the only known carrier of this unique blood type, meaning she is only compatible with her own blood. Scientists were able to unravel the mystery in 2019 through ‚Äúhigh-throughput DNA sequencing,‚Äù which highlighted a genetic mutation, and they hope to find others with the same blood group to improve care for patients with rare blood types.</p>

Lehecka secured a crucial break at 5-5, prompting Draper to break his racquet in frustration, and ultimately served out the match. Draper, who was diagnosed with tonsillitis on Friday, stated that he wouldn't have withdrawn from the tournament despite his condition, and he will now rest before preparing for Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>Steve Bannon, a MAGA podcaster, played a significant role in President Trump's decision-making process regarding potential military action against Iran. Bannon advised Trump against attacking an Iranian nuclear facility, citing concerns about the reliability of Israeli intelligence and the potential ineffectiveness of the ‚Äúbunker-buster‚Äù bomb. Despite holding no official government position, Bannon's access to Trump highlights his influence on foreign policy decisions. While other advisors favored military action, Bannon's noninterventionist stance appears to have resonated with Trump, who ultimately decided to hold off on a strike for now.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts are noting that US sunscreens may be less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. The issue stems from regulatory differences, with the FDA not approving new UV-filtering ingredients for over 20 years. While American sunscreens effectively block UVB rays, they often provide weaker UVA protection compared to products in Europe and South Korea. Dermatologists stress the importance of wearing sunscreen and suggest looking for mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for the safest options in the US market.</p>

          <p>A photo exhibit by Miora Rajaonary aims to raise awareness of female genital schistosomiasis (FGS), a neglected tropical disease affecting millions of women and girls, primarily in Africa. The women portrayed in the exhibit wear traditional Malagasy face masks to emphasize their courage in breaking taboos and speaking publicly about the disease. FGS, caused by parasitic worms in contaminated water, can lead to infertility and a higher risk of HIV, and the exhibit highlights the women's strength in facing the disease and its social stigma. The women's stories spoke powerfully to Rajaonary, who has included her portrait in her photo exhibit Sahy Rano.</p>

The court ruled that the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate students who are not Christian.

Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court, and similar laws have been challenged in other states.</p>
