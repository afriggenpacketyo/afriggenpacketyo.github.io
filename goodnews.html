          <p>A growing number of families are selling off large, historic "trophy" ranches that have been in their possession for generations, often due to disagreements among heirs or a lack of interest from the next generation. High-end brokers report a surge in listings for these sprawling properties, fueled by wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle, a trend amplified by the "Yellowstone" effect. Properties like the 7,600-acre Reynolds Ranch in California and the 40,000-acre Antlers Ranch in Wyoming are now on the market for the first time in decades. The generational transfer of wealth is significantly shaping this unique real estate market.</p>

          <p>Americans are projected to legally bet a record $30 billion on the upcoming NFL season, an 8.5% increase from the previous year, according to the American Gaming Association. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for this peak season while facing increased competition and a significant threat from unlicensed offshore operators. In response, law enforcement is intensifying crackdowns on these illegal gambling operations, with prosecutors filing lawsuits and attorneys general urging federal action. States with active enforcement against illegal sites have seen higher growth in their legal betting markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris demonstrated impressive speed by finishing fastest in both Friday practice sessions for the Dutch Grand Prix at Zandvoort, as Formula 1 returned from its summer break. He narrowly edged out Aston Martin's Fernando Alonso in the second session, with his teammate Oscar Piastri also showing strong pace. The sessions were marked by several incidents, including heavy crashes for Aston Martin's Lance Stroll and Williams' Alex Albon, which caused significant damage to their cars. The results suggest a competitive weekend ahead, with McLaren and Aston Martin challenging the usual front-runners.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has reportedly informed confidantes that she will not seek a third term in 2026, with a formal announcement expected soon. Ernst, who has served since 2015 and holds a key leadership position in the Republican conference, has apparently told allies she intended to serve only two terms. Her decision adds to a growing list of Republican senators not running for reelection, creating a potentially competitive open seat in Iowa. Several Democrats have already entered the race for the position.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's stock surged after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter, largely driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division. The growth in cloud services was fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the acceleration in the key cloud unit and improvements in its e-commerce business. The company is balancing heavy investment in AI and instant commerce with maintaining growth in a competitive Chinese market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber had a historic night, becoming the 21st player in MLB history to hit four home runs in a single game. In his final at-bat, he had a chance to be the first ever to hit five, but he popped up against a position player, Atlanta Braves infielder Vidal Bruján. By failing to hit a fifth homer off a non-pitcher lobbing slow pitches, Schwarber inadvertently averted a controversy that would have likely tainted the record. The use of position players in blowout games has become a contentious issue in baseball, with critics arguing it undermines the integrity of statistics.</p>

          <p>Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has evolved into a significant tool for India's soft power and cultural diplomacy on the global stage. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has helped position the practice as a symbol of India's cultural identity and heritage. Analysts view the promotion of yoga as a non-controversial way to build people-to-people ties and enhance India's influence as a civilizational force. However, the practice also faces criticism for its commercialization in the West and for being linked to political and religious agendas within India.</p>

          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, a key inflation metric for the Federal Reserve, showed that the annual inflation rate remained at 2.6% in July, consistent with the previous month. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, rose slightly to 2.9% from 2.8%, its highest level since February. The report also indicated robust consumer spending, which increased by 0.5%, suggesting economic resilience despite uncertainty. These figures may make Fed officials cautious about cutting interest rates, as inflation remains above their 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer window closes, a move that would likely facilitate the sale of Marc Guehi to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million transfer for the England defender, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. Palace is reportedly in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also pursuing an experienced defender.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to expand its list of critical minerals, adding 51 commodities including copper, silicon, and silver. This strategic update aims to secure supply chains for key industries like semiconductors and solar panels, thereby reducing reliance on foreign sources, particularly China. The list guides government investment priorities, such as tax incentives and streamlined permitting for domestic mining and material recovery projects. The selection is based on identifying minerals where supply disruptions would pose the greatest risk to the U.S. economy and national security.</p>
