          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will prioritize long-term growth and investments in AI model training, even if it means operating at a loss for a considerable time. Following the release of GPT-5, Altman emphasized that as long as the models continue to improve significantly, it is rational to focus on spending rather than short-term profitability. This strategy is feasible because OpenAI remains a private company, free from public market pressures, and is currently in talks for a new stock sale at a valuation of around $500 billion.</p>

          <p>While national average rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs) remain modest, many online banks are offering significantly higher yields, particularly for short-term accounts. For example, some one-year CDs offer rates well above 4%, far exceeding the national average of around 2%. The article notes that short-term CDs currently provide better returns than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to compare offerings from different online institutions and consider laddering their CDs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists using the James Webb Space Telescope have found compelling evidence of a giant gas planet in Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to our own. Located just over four light-years away, the potential planet orbits a Sun-like star, making it an exciting discovery. Although the gas giant itself would be uninhabitable, astronomers believe it could have moons capable of sustaining life. The planet was detected once but was not visible in follow-up observations, so further confirmation is needed to prove its existence.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals significant voter indecision in California regarding both the 2026 governor's race and a potential ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, Democrat Katie Porter leads with 18%, but a large 38% of voters remain undecided. Similarly, when asked about a proposed mid-decade redistricting effort, which Democrats are considering to counter GOP moves in other states, 42% of voters were unsure, indicating a lack of public engagement on these key political issues so far.</p>

          <p>Bao Fan, the founder of investment bank China Renaissance, has reportedly been released more than two years after his sudden disappearance, during which he was said to be cooperating with a government investigation. Bao, a prominent figure in China's tech finance sector, vanished in early 2023, a high-profile case in a series of crackdowns on business elites. While he has since resigned from his executive roles, he remains the company's controlling shareholder, and news of his release caused a significant surge in the company's stock price.</p>
