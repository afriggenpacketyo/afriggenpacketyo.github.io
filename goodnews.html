          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham has attracted the attention of the Women of Wrestling (WOW) promotion, co-owned by Jeanie Buss. Cunningham gained notoriety for her on-court physicality, particularly when defending teammate Caitlin Clark, which has been described as having an "enforcer" quality. WOW co-owner Dave McLane praised Cunningham's fierceness and stated he would love to have her join the wrestling organization. The interest highlights Cunningham's growing profile as a tough competitor in the WNBA, extending her reputation beyond basketball.</p>

          <p>Three private seat holders at London's Royal Albert Hall have lost a High Court bid for £500,000 in damages against the venue's operator. The claimants argued that the hall had unlawfully excluded them from more performances than permitted, effectively misusing their property. However, a judge dismissed their request for a summary judgment, ruling that the complex dispute over the historic rights of seat holders requires a full trial. The case highlights the unique ownership structure of the iconic venue, where some seats have been privately owned since its construction in 1871.</p>

          <p>A new law championed by President Trump, known as the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," is expected to provide a significant financial windfall for major technology companies. The legislation permanently restores several key tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including immediate expensing for R&D and 100% bonus depreciation. Analysts estimate these changes could unlock billions in free cash flow for firms like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, which are heavily investing in AI infrastructure, providing them greater flexibility for reinvestment and share repurchases.

The feature, developed with educators, will be available on both free and paid versions of ChatGPT, including the university-focused ChatGPT Edu.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is reportedly in advanced negotiations to acquire the Apple Card portfolio from Goldman Sachs, which is seeking to exit the partnership. If finalized, the deal would transfer Apple's massive credit card business to the nation's largest card issuer, further solidifying JPMorgan's dominance in the sector. For Goldman Sachs, offloading the venture would mark the end of a challenging foray into consumer credit that faced high growth costs and regulatory scrutiny. The move would provide Apple with a more experienced and stable partner for its signature financial product. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Real estate developers are increasingly viewing affordable housing as a more profitable investment opportunity, partly due to new government support. A recently passed bill expanded the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), a key financing tool that developers sell to investors to fund projects for low-income renters. This expansion is expected to help produce or preserve over one million additional affordable rental homes in the next decade. Despite challenges like high interest rates and local opposition (NIMBYism), developers see a clear pathway to building high-quality, profitable housing to address the nation's severe shortage.</p>
