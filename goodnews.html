          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 03:25:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has authorized Royal Mail to cease Saturday deliveries for second-class letters and reduce the frequency to every other weekday. This decision aims to help the postal service manage declining letter volumes and rising operational costs, ensuring its financial sustainability. While first-class mail will continue its six-day delivery schedule, Royal Mail has 12 to 18 months to implement the changes, which also include slightly relaxed delivery targets. The move has been met with criticism from consumer groups who argue it will degrade service without guaranteeing reliability.</p>

          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, reportedly portrays the iconic hero as a symbol of universal kindness rather than just American ideals, sparking debate among cultural commentators. The director's focus on a "battered" but good-hearted Superman who protects the weak globally has drawn criticism from some right-wing figures. This article explores the historical context of Superman as a creation of Jewish immigrants defending the oppressed and examines the ongoing culture war polarization between the DC and Marvel cinematic universes, connecting the hero's alien origin to contemporary immigration debates.</p>

          <p>Thirty-one construction workers were successfully rescued after a section of a large industrial tunnel collapsed deep underground in Los Angeles. The workers were approximately six miles in from the entrance and 400 feet below the surface when the cave-in occurred. They managed to navigate over the debris to a tunnel boring machine, from which they were transported to safety without any major injuries. Officials praised the workers for their calm and professional response to the frightening incident, which occurred during the construction of a wastewater transport project.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the potential to become a safe-haven currency, citing the country's low inflation, large foreign reserves, and commitment to stability. The assertion comes as confidence in the US dollar is tested by debt risks and protectionist trade policies under the Trump administration. The authors of the article contend that the yuan has already demonstrated stability and reduced sensitivity to global risk indicators during recent periods of stress. This analysis contributes to the ongoing debate about the yuan's internationalization and its role in the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The market for weight-loss drugs in China is rapidly expanding, with dozens of producers competing in a sector valued at US$150 billion. This growth mirrors trends in the West, driven by the approval of new, more effective medications and rising obesity rates. Innovent Biologics, a Chinese firm, was the first domestic company to receive approval to market a weight-loss drug in the country. The article notes that this burgeoning market is fueled by a combination of medical need, lifestyle changes, and growing consumer demand for svelteness, creating a significant new frontier for pharmaceutical companies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a model for successful housing policy, largely due to its extensive and stable social-housing sector, which comprises 43% of the city's housing units. This system, which caters to a wide range of income levels, results in significantly lower rent and higher quality housing compared to the private market. The article explains that this success is rooted in a long-term political commitment dating back to the 1920s, funded by mechanisms like a levy on employee salaries. While not without challenges, such as accessibility for newcomers, Vienna's approach demonstrates that prioritizing housing as a basic need can create a more stable urban environment.</p>

          <p>A research team at the Beijing Institute of Technology has successfully created a cyborg bee by developing the world's lightest insect brain controller. Weighing only 74 milligrams, the device is strapped to a bee's back and uses three needles to send electronic pulses into its brain. These pulses create illusions that effectively command the bee's flight, directing it to turn, advance, or retreat with a high degree of success. This technological breakthrough represents a significant step in the field of bio-robotics and remote control of living organisms for potential research and operational applications.</p>

          <p>LAFC defeated the Colorado Rapids 3-0, snapping a four-game winless streak as the team navigates an exceptionally congested schedule. Having played more games than any MLS club over the past two years, LAFC faces a demanding second half of the season but is expected to be active in the upcoming transfer window. The departures of key players Olivier Giroud and Cengiz Under free up significant salary space and designated player spots. General Manager John Thorrington is anticipated to use these resources, along with funds from the FIFA Club World Cup, to reinforce the roster for the playoff push.</p>

          <p>A large section of the iconic Sycamore Gap tree, which was illegally felled in a widely condemned act of vandalism in 2023, has been installed as a permanent public memorial. The trunk is now the centerpiece of an exhibition at The Sill National Landscape Discovery Centre in Northumberland, near where the beloved tree once stood. The installation, created by artist Charlie Whinney, is designed to be interactive, allowing visitors to touch and even hug the trunk. The display is surrounded by benches inscribed with public submissions of sorrow and hope, preserving the tree's memory and cultural significance.</p>

          <p>In an effort to stabilize its labor market amid economic pressures, China has announced a new subsidy for companies that hire unemployed young people. The government will provide a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan (US$209) for each new hire aged 16 to 24 who is given a formal contract and full social insurance benefits for at least three months. This measure, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, will be in effect until the end of the year. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to combat youth unemployment, which has been a persistent challenge due to sluggish growth and intense competition.</p>

          <p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has announced that it recorded the highest number of convert baptisms in any 12-month period in its history between July 2024 and June 2025. Church leadership also noted that the 308,000 people who joined in the 2024 calendar year represented the most in 25 years. This report aligns with broader Pew Research Center findings that suggest the decline of Christianity in the U.S. may be leveling off. However, the data also confirms that younger Americans remain significantly less religious than older generations, with a much higher likelihood of being unaffiliated with any religion.</p>

This acquisition would give the Italian owner of Nutella and TicTac a dominant position in the US breakfast cereal market. WK Kellogg, which has been struggling financially, was split from its international parent company, Kellanova, in 2023. (not investment advice)</p>

To advance, Wales now needs an improbable five-goal victory against reigning champions England in their final group match, along with a favorable result in the other group game.

While the economy has faced headwinds, the Bank of Korea prioritized financial stability over stimulating growth. Analysts expect the bank may cut rates later this year once the new mortgage restrictions take effect and the housing market shows signs of stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>
