          <p>Poland's government is experiencing decreased approval ratings as it faces obstruction from the president regarding its reform initiatives. The upcoming presidential election on May 18 will be crucial in determining whether the current stalemate will persist or conclude. Donald Tusk, the current leader, has chosen to support Rafal Trzaskowski, a left-wing liberal and the mayor of Warsaw, as the presidential candidate. The outcome of the election will significantly impact the government's ability to advance its agenda and implement promised reforms. The other major candidate is Karol Nawrocki, who is backed by the conservative Law and Justice party.</p>

          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey was interviewed by the US Secret Service following an Instagram post that supporters of President Donald Trump interpreted as a veiled threat on the president's life. The post featured seashells arranged to form the shapes "86 47," which some Trump supporters saw as a call to harm the 47th president. Comey stated he was unaware of any violent connotation and removed the post. Despite Comey's explanation, Trump and top administration officials rejected his defense, with Trump labeling Comey a "dirty cop" and claiming he was calling for the "assassination of the president."</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, causing the skyline to disappear and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning. The storm was the result of high winds blowing over dry farmlands, collecting dust into the air. Visibility dropped to zero in some areas, forcing drivers to pull over, and a ground stop was implemented at Midway International Airport. The National Weather Service noted that this was only the second time their Chicago office had issued a dust storm warning, and the first time it included the city itself.</p>
