        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Brazilian government has granted Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD a short-term exemption from import tariff hikes, though for a shorter period than the company sought. BYD will be allowed to import up to $463 million in semi-assembled vehicles tax-free during the first half of 2026 to support the ramp-up of its new plant in Bahia. However, Brazil also accelerated its long-term plan, with import tariffs on EV kits set to reach 35% by January 2027, earlier than planned. This decision balances BYD's needs against concerns from traditional automakers about potential job losses and investment risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, Acrophylla alta, in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia, which is now considered the country's heaviest insect. Weighing 44 grams and measuring 40 centimeters long, the insect was found high in the canopies of the Wet Tropics region. Its large size is believed to be an evolutionary adaptation to the colder, high-altitude environment. The discovery was confirmed through its distinctive eggs, and two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum for further research.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates and market volatility, some pre-retirees are considering rolling over their 401(k) funds into an annuity to secure a guaranteed income stream. While annuities can offer protection against inflation and market downturns, the decision involves significant trade-offs, including high fees, limited liquidity, and potentially lower growth compared to a diversified portfolio. The article suggests that while elevated rates make annuities more attractive, a rollover should be part of a comprehensive retirement strategy, not a standalone solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed a decision to stop sharing crucial satellite weather data that forecasters rely on, particularly for tracking hurricanes. The Navy had planned to phase out the data as part of a modernization effort but reconsidered after receiving feedback from government partners and scientists. This information is vital for real-time storm monitoring, allowing for more accurate and timely warnings that help people prepare and evacuate. The data is also essential for monitoring sea ice in polar regions, which impacts global weather patterns and climate change research.</p>

          <p>The San Diego Padres have significantly upgraded their pitching staff by acquiring All-Star closer Mason Miller and left-handed pitcher JP Sears from the Oakland Athletics. Miller, known for his 101mph fastball, has 20 saves this season and is under team control through 2029, making him a long-term asset. In exchange, the Athletics received a package of promising prospects, including shortstop Leo De Vries. This blockbuster trade signals the Padres' intent to make a strong push for the postseason as they currently hold a National League wildcard spot.</p>

California Governor Gavin Newsom and L.A. Mayor Karen Bass had strongly opposed the deployment, calling it unnecessary political theater and an illegal usurpation of state power. Newsom's office stated that President Trump's strategy backfired, as the troops had little to do once protests subsided. Around 250 Guard members will remain to protect federal buildings.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its diabetes drug Mounjaro demonstrated significant heart health benefits in a late-stage trial comparing it to its older treatment, Trulicity. While Mounjaro met the primary goal of not being inferior to Trulicity in reducing major cardiovascular events, it also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and offered greater kidney protection. This data strengthens the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The results are expected to bolster Mounjaro's market position, especially as Trulicity's patent nears expiration.</p>
