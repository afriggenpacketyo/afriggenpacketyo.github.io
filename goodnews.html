          <p>Naomi Osaka secured a significant victory at the US Open by defeating American third seed Coco Gauff 6-3, 6-2 in the fourth round. This win marks Osaka's most impressive performance since her return to tennis after giving birth, advancing her to a Grand Slam quarter-final for the first time since 2021. Gauff, the 2023 champion, struggled with her form, particularly her forehand, leading to a subdued performance. Osaka's measured and powerful baseline game effectively capitalized on her opponent's uncertainty, signaling a strong return to form for the two-time champion.</p>

Donald emphasized the need for experience to face the hostile "bear pit" atmosphere expected at Bethpage in New York. The continuity in the team, with only Rasmus Højgaard replacing his twin brother Nicolai, is unprecedented in Ryder Cup history. Donald is preparing his team for a different challenge than Rome, focusing on strategies to achieve Europe's first away win since 2012.</p>

          <p>Two decades after Hurricane Katrina devastated the Gulf Coast, residents of New Orleans, particularly in the hard-hit Ninth Ward, share their stories of loss, resilience, and rebuilding. The storm, which killed nearly 1,400 people and remains the costliest on record, left deep physical and emotional scars on the city. The article features personal accounts from individuals who lived through the catastrophic flooding, including a city council member, a community organizer, and a local business owner. Their reflections highlight the slow and uneven recovery, the challenges of federal aid programs, and an enduring connection to their heritage and community.</p>

          <p>Larry Pickett Jr., a sophomore and football player at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, is being hailed as a hero for his role in a dramatic rescue. Pickett Jr. and his father pulled an injured driver from a crashed car in Orange County, New York, just moments before the vehicle was engulfed in flames. The driver had struck a utility pole, and the Picketts navigated downed power lines to perform the rescue. The victim was alert with reportedly minor injuries, and the academy praised Pickett Jr.'s actions as an example of selfless service.</p>

          <p>Arsenal has strengthened its defense by signing Ecuadorian international Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan. The deal includes an option for the Gunners to make the transfer permanent next summer for a fee of £45 million. The 23-year-old Hincapie was a key part of Leverkusen's Bundesliga-winning squad last season and is seen as a versatile and physical addition to Mikel Arteta's team. His arrival coincides with the departure of defender Jakub Kiwior, who has joined Porto on a season-long loan.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," features Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary, explores the crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, which spiraled into substance abuse and personal turmoil. Johnson's performance is praised as a perfect casting choice, capturing the vulnerability beneath the fighter's colossal physique. While the film effectively portrays Kerr's struggles with addiction and relationships, the review notes it doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of the sport or elevate the drama to the level of other great fighting films.</p>

          <p>The appointment of key figures from the Resolution Foundation, including Torsten Bell and Dan Tomlinson, to senior roles in the UK Treasury suggests a significant policy shift towards higher wealth taxation. These officials have previously argued that wealth is undertaxed compared to income and have advocated for radical changes to address fiscal pressures. This alignment of personnel from the left-leaning think tank within the government indicates that future budgets under Chancellor Rachel Reeves are likely to include measures targeting wealth, land, and inheritance.

          <p>This article debunks persistent online rumors claiming that former First Lady Melania Trump worked as an escort and met her husband at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell. These allegations, which resurfaced in 2025, are unsupported by credible evidence. The escort claim originated from a 2016 tabloid article, leading Melania Trump to successfully sue for defamation, resulting in retractions and damage payments. Furthermore, multiple credible sources confirm that the Trumps were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli, not at an event connected to Maxwell or Jeffrey Epstein.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Divergent Size Evolution of Wild and Domesticated Animals Due to Human Influence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 13:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activity, particularly since the Middle Ages, has caused a significant divergence in the body size of wild and domesticated species. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild animals like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domesticated species such as cattle and chickens grew larger due to systematic selective breeding and controlled management. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact humans have had on the evolutionary trajectory of the animal kingdom.</p>
