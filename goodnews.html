          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay their athletes. The settlement permits each school to share up to $20.5 million with athletes over the next year and $2.7 billion over the next decade to former players previously barred from such revenue. Payouts will be determined by sport and career length, with potential earnings reaching nearly $135,000 for most football and men's basketball players. This decision marks a significant shift in college sports, addressing antitrust concerns and compensation rules dating back to 2016.</p>

Countries with longer, healthier lives often have governments and cultures that normalize healthy living through affordable nutritious food, clean air policies, and preventive healthcare.
