          <p>England fast bowler Jamie Overton will miss the remaining one-day internationals against the West Indies after breaking his little finger. The injury occurred while Overton attempted to take a return catch during the series opener. He initially left the field for treatment but returned to bowl, taking three wickets before the severity of the injury was fully assessed. Matthew Potts has been named as Overton's replacement in the England XI, and Overton is expected to be sidelined for approximately a month, also missing the T20 series against the West Indies.</p>

          <p>Jewish organizers are increasingly challenging the Trump administration's use of antisemitism allegations to justify repressive policies against pro-Palestinian voices on college campuses. They argue that these policies do not represent their Jewish values and are being used to undermine academic freedom. Jewish students, faculty, and alumni have been at the forefront of protests against the war in Gaza and are now rallying around detained students and condemning the exploitation of antisemitism. They highlight the complexity of Jewish American views on Israel, antisemitism, and the Trump administration's actions, emphasizing the need for nuanced discussions that respect diverse perspectives.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has sparked debate about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While some see it as a potential solution to Social Security's funding challenges, experts caution that it may not be suitable for the U.S. due to income and life expectancy disparities. The U.S. already has legislation in place to gradually raise the full retirement age for Social Security from 65 to 67. Experts suggest that an across-the-board increase in the retirement age would disproportionately harm those in lower income brackets who already receive benefits for a shorter period of time.

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings after nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons yielded false positives between April and July of last year. Inmates who were denied parole based on these faulty tests may be entitled to a new hearing. Attorneys for inmates affected by the defective drug tests confirmed the false test results after they received records showing that positive test results had spiked across the state‚Äôs prison system. The review involves at least 459 parole hearings, as well as dozens of administrative reviews and denials from inmates to move up their parole hearings.</p>

Governor Newsom has allocated over $200 million to revamp San Quentin, making it the most visible example of the California Model.

          <p>A recent study suggests that the UN's global population estimates may be significantly undercounted, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions, due to incomplete census data in rural areas of the global south. While this news may raise concerns about overpopulation, the author argues that anxieties about population size often reflect power struggles over resource distribution and which lives are valued. Historically, fears about overpopulation have led to coercive policies, but the current approach focuses on empowering women through education and access to reproductive healthcare, which has proven effective in reducing fertility rates. The author suggests that responsible consumption and sustainable technologies can mitigate the challenges of a larger population.</p>

It recommends deploying digital experts alongside troops to protect against enemy drones and control future unmanned weapons.
