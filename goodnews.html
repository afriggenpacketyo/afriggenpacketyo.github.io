          <p>A U.S. Court of International Trade panel will hear arguments in a case challenging President Trump's tariffs, questioning whether he exceeded his power by enacting tariffs on over 180 countries. Five domestic businesses filed the lawsuit, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not authorize the sweeping duties. The Department of Justice argues that IEEPA clearly authorizes the president to impose tariffs, and the court's decision could significantly impact Trump's ability to unilaterally impose import taxes. This article highlights the legal challenges facing the President's economic agenda.</p>
