          <p>Three-time champion Tadej Pogacar has reclaimed the leader's yellow jersey in the Tour de France after winning the seventh stage. He narrowly defeated Jonas Vingegaard in a sprint finish on the iconic Mur-de-Bretagne climb, a repeat of a finish where he has previously found success. The previous day's leader, Mathieu van der Poel, could not keep pace and slipped in the overall standings. The stage also saw veteran Geraint Thomas in a breakaway attempt and a crash that impacted Pogacar's teammate, Joao Almeida.</p>

          <p>Americans on Social Security can qualify for credit card debt forgiveness, though there are specific considerations for this demographic. Living on a fixed income often meets the financial hardship criteria required for debt settlement negotiations with creditors. However, the ability to save enough for a lump-sum payment can be a significant challenge. A key advantage for these individuals is that Social Security benefits are legally protected from garnishment by most creditors, which can provide significant leverage during negotiations.

          <p>High-yield savings accounts continue to offer significantly better interest rates than traditional savings accounts, making them an attractive option for savers. While rates remain high, there is a possibility they may decrease as banks could preemptively act on anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite this uncertainty, these accounts offer crucial flexibility, allowing access to funds without penalties, which is a key advantage over fixed-term CDs. However, the best rates are typically found at online-only banks, which may be a drawback for some customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high, surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs saw their largest single-day inflow of the year at $1.18 billion, signaling strong investor confidence. The rally was also fueled by expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and the potential for an increased federal deficit, which some investors view as a positive catalyst for assets like Bitcoin. The price surge triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward momentum. (not investment advice)</p>
