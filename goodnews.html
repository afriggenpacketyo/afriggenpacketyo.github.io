        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier Li Qiang's recent statements and escalated policy support highlight Beijing's ongoing concerns about the property sector's impact on China's economic growth and domestic demand, especially amid external economic challenges. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies and enhance implementation to stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks within the property market. Specific measures include a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, along with increased land supply and financing aid for urban-renewal projects, all aimed at halting the sector's decline and stabilizing it. The article suggests that Beijing is actively seeking solutions to address the property sector's woes while avoiding previous ineffective measures. Optimism surrounding these efforts is cautiously moderate, reflecting the complex nature of the economic challenges.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to make his pitching comeback against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023, following right elbow surgery. Ohtani's return is expedited due to injuries within the Dodgers' bullpen, with expectations for him to pitch shorter innings. Despite the pitching return, Ohtani has been performing well as a batter, recently achieving a 3-for-3 performance with two runs scored. Meanwhile, rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki's return remains uncertain due to a shoulder impingement, potentially sidelining him for the remainder of the season.</p>

          <p>The Prime Minister is determined to proceed with plans to cut the benefits bill by ¬£5 billion by 2030, despite potential internal opposition within the Labour Party. The Welfare Reform Bill includes proposals to tighten eligibility for Personal Independence Payment (PIP) for disabled individuals with less severe conditions in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister argues that the current system is not working for those who need support or for taxpayers, emphasizing the necessity of reform that everyone agrees is needed. The government intends to reform the system to better serve both those requiring assistance and the interests of taxpayers.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has added China's Huawei and SMIC to its trade blacklist, a move that strengthens its alignment with U.S. trade policy amidst rising tensions with Beijing. The International Trade Administration of Taiwan included Huawei and SMIC on its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to these entities. This action reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions already followed by companies like TSMC and aims to tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. The decision reflects Taiwan's commitment to adhering to international trade standards and addressing national security concerns.</p>

          <p>Santos shares experienced a significant surge following a non-binding takeover offer by an ADNOC-led group, marking the biggest intraday jump since April 2020. The consortium, including Abu Dhabi Development Holding Co and Carlyle Group, has proposed a cash offer price of $5.76 per Santos share, representing a substantial premium. Santos' board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the potential transaction, absent a superior proposal.

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, enacting legislation to address growing threats from state-backed hackers.

The legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers, while obliging companies to report cyberattacks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, driven by government subsidies aimed at boosting consumption amidst persistent deflation. Retail sales jumped 6.4% year-on-year in May, surpassing analysts' estimates, attributed to the consumer goods trade-in program, online shopping events, and increased foreign tourism. However, industrial output slowed, and fixed-asset investment growth undershot forecasts, with a deepening contraction in property investment. Analysts caution that falling property prices could dampen consumer sentiment, necessitating stronger policy support to sustain economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>
