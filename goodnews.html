          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China Earlier Than Previously Thought</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research from Chinese and US institutions indicates that pigs may have been domesticated in southern China as early as the Neolithic period, around 8,000 years ago. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The findings suggest that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, occurred alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East.</p>

          <p>Chess grandmaster Magnus Carlsen addressed his viral outburst after losing a classical match against Gukesh Dommaraju at the Norway Chess 2025 tournament. Speaking on the "Pardon My Take" podcast, Carlsen expressed regret over his actions, explaining that losses can be more impactful than wins are satisfying. He said that he felt "washed and useless" after the loss. While he doesn't aspire to be a "bad boy" of chess, Carlsen believes there should be room for emotional expression in the sport, comparing it to smashing a racket in tennis.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed achieved a rare albatross, also known as a double-eagle, during the first round of the US Open, hitting his second shot on the par-5 fourth hole into the cup from 286 yards. This marks only the fourth albatross in US Open history since records began in 1983. Despite the exceptional shot, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, hampered by a triple bogey on the final hole. He joins a select group of golfers who have accomplished this feat at the US Open.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are continuing their overseas expansion plans to ensure survival amid ongoing trade tensions and US tariffs. Production abroad is seen as crucial, with companies increasingly diversifying their production bases. While Southeast Asia currently hosts most of their overseas capacity, planned expansions are heavily focused on the Middle East and Africa, followed by the US and Europe. Executives emphasize that localizing production abroad is essential due to high tariffs on exports.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a "Trojan horse" therapy that delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells. This therapy, belantamab mafodotin, can halt the blood cancer myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments while reducing side effects. The drug, bound to an antibody that targets plasma cells, releases its toxic payload inside cancerous cells, killing the cancer. Clinical trials showed it halted the cancer for three years, compared to 13 months with existing therapies.</p>
