          <p>Former US President Joe Biden, 82, is currently undergoing radiation and hormone therapy as part of his treatment for prostate cancer. His spokesman confirmed the ongoing regimen, which is expected to span five weeks. Biden was diagnosed in May with an aggressive form of the disease, characterized by a high Gleason score and metastasis to the bone, though it appears to be hormone-sensitive for effective management. This health update follows his departure from office as the oldest serving US president and his decision to end his re-election campaign due to health concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Major airlines, including American, Southwest, Delta, United, and JetBlue, are waiving flight-change fees and fare differences for flights to and from over a dozen airports in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast US. This measure is in anticipation of a significant coastal storm expected to bring flood and high-wind advisories from Sunday through Monday evening. The proactive policies allow customers booked for Sunday travel to rebook later in the week without penalty. As of Saturday afternoon, flight delays and cancellations remained minimal, but travelers are advised to monitor their flight status.</p>

Despite being underdogs, England sits atop the table after three games, with their duo's form rejuvenating the squad. While bigger tests against India and Australia await, their strong start and balanced bowling attack position them well for a semi-final spot.</p>

While minor road flooding is possible, significant flooding is not widely anticipated. This unusually deep low-pressure system, bringing colder temperatures and strong winds, is a welcome development but will not be enough to end the region's wildfire season.</p>

The hospital's team, learning from previous hostage releases, emphasizes a "medical detective" approach and providing ample space and quiet for recuperation.

          <p>Quaker, one of five British army horses that broke free and galloped through London streets last year, has been retired to a sanctuary in Buckinghamshire. The 15-year-old black horse sustained a broken bone and serious bleeding after being spooked by construction noise, leading to a five-mile chase and injuries to soldiers and civilians. Maj. Thomas Stewart confirmed Quaker was unable to return to duties, and retirement was deemed best for his welfare. This concludes the story of a dramatic incident, with Quaker now enjoying a well-deserved rest.</p>

          <p>John Swinney's strategy for achieving a second Scottish independence referendum has been backed by members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) at their conference. The First Minister's plan asserts that if the SNP wins a majority of seats in next year's Holyrood election, it will constitute a mandate for a new independence vote. Swinney argued this approach is the most realistic path, echoing a precedent set for the 2014 referendum. While the UK Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, has previously stated he cannot imagine a second referendum during his premiership, Swinney remains confident in delivering Scotland's choice.</p>

          <p>Gen Z consumers are increasingly rejecting "fast furniture"—cheap, mass-produced decor designed for disposability—in favor of sustainable, secondhand items. This trend is driven by environmental awareness, budget constraints, and a desire for emotional connection with unique pieces. Researchers estimate over 95% of the 51 million tons of furniture consumed annually is discarded, largely due to items not being made for recycling. Platforms like Facebook Marketplace and Pinterest show skyrocketing interest in secondhand decor, indicating a significant cultural shift towards reuse and durability, challenging the influence of fast-fashion brands on home design.</p>
