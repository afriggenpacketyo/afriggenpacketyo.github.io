          <p>Following President Trump's decision to terminate trade negotiations, Ontario Premier Doug Ford announced the province will pause its controversial anti-tariff ad campaign starting Monday. The move is intended as a goodwill gesture to allow for the resumption of talks between the United States and Canada. Ford stated that the ad, which featured a speech by Ronald Reagan, had successfully initiated a conversation about the economic impact of tariffs. The ad will continue to air through the weekend, including during the World Series, before being pulled to de-escalate the trade dispute.</p>

          <p>Following a visit to Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized the need for the quick establishment of an international peacekeeping force in Gaza to uphold the fragile ceasefire. This force is a key component of the U.S.-brokered peace plan agreed upon by both Israel and Hamas. Several nations, including Indonesia and the UAE, have offered to contribute troops, though Israel will have veto power over participants. The move comes as Palestinian factions agreed in Cairo to form a temporary committee of technocrats to manage Gaza, while the long-term governance structure remains unresolved.</p>

          <p>Ferrari driver Charles Leclerc recorded the fastest time during the first practice session for the Mexico City Grand Prix. He finished just ahead of Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli, with Sauber's Nico Hulkenberg in third. The session was notable as nine of the ten teams used the opportunity to give their mandatory track time to rookie drivers. Championship leader Oscar Piastri finished fourth, while his main rivals, Lando Norris and Max Verstappen, sat out the session to allow their respective teams' junior drivers to participate. The dusty track conditions in Mexico make this particular session less critical for race preparation.</p>

          <p>Chinese national Zhi Dong Zhang, also known as "Brother Wang," has been extradited from Cuba to the United States to face charges of international drug trafficking and money laundering. Zhang is accused of running a major operation that imported fentanyl and cocaine from Mexico and distributed it across the U.S., allegedly working with the Sinaloa and Jalisco New Generation cartels. His capture and extradition, facilitated by the Mexican government, represent a significant development in the U.S. crackdown on the fentanyl supply chain. Zhang had previously escaped house arrest in Mexico before being apprehended in Cuba.</p>

The endorsement from the powerful Brooklyn Democrat helps to unify the party behind Mamdani, who has also secured support from Governor Kathy Hochul and Senator Bernie Sanders. Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, recently received the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles County judge has ordered the permanent closure of the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts and imposed $2 million in penalties. For decades, the scrap yard endangered students and staff at the adjacent Jordan High School with toxic dust, flying shrapnel, and explosions, including one involving a military artillery shell. The owners pleaded no contest to criminal charges related to hazardous waste handling. The ruling is being celebrated as a major victory for environmental justice in a community that has long suffered from the facility's reckless operations.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) for September revealed a 3% annual inflation rate, a figure that was slightly cooler than economists had predicted. This key economic data, released by the Department of Labor despite the ongoing government shutdown, is essential for determining the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security benefits. While tariffs have contributed to upward price pressure, the impact on consumers has been partly muted. The report complicates the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, though analysts still expect a rate cut due to concerns about a slowing labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

This diplomatic push follows recent U.S. indictments against Chinese companies allegedly involved in the deadly trade.</p>
