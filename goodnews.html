          <p>A woman was mauled by a brown bear while hiking on a popular trail in Alaska's Chugach Mountains. She managed to call 911 despite being unable to walk and was located by officials using drones before being evacuated by helicopter. Her injuries are not considered life-threatening, and authorities have closed the area while they search for the bear, advising other hikers to take necessary precautions like carrying bear spray.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed its first wave of sanctions targeting individuals involved in people-smuggling across the English Channel. The list of 25 targets includes gang leaders and suppliers of small boats, who will have their UK assets frozen and be banned from traveling to the country. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a "landmark moment" in the fight against irregular migration, though some experts suggest its impact may be limited given the scale of the smuggling networks.</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor interest rates quashed by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. The court ruled their trials were unfair, and the Serious Fraud Office confirmed it will not seek a retrial. The decision vindicates the traders, who have long argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what was then common commercial practice in order to appease public anger following the 2008 financial crisis.</p>

          <p>India will restart issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens for the first time in five years, marking a significant step in normalizing people-to-people exchanges between the two nations. The Indian embassy in Beijing announced that applications would resume on Thursday.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 05:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heat waves strain power grids, the practice of "precooling"—significantly lowering a home's temperature during off-peak hours—has gained popularity, though its effectiveness is contested. Some utilities and researchers suggest it can work if a home is well-insulated, while others warn it could be more expensive and strain HVAC systems. Experts generally agree that keeping an air conditioner at a steady temperature is often more efficient than turning it on and off, and recommend other measures like using fans and closing curtains.</p>

          <p>European auto stocks, particularly German giants like Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, experienced a significant rally following the announcement of a U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, has sparked investor optimism that a similar breakthrough could be reached for the European Union. The EU has been seeking to lower auto tariffs with the U.S., and the terms of the Japan deal suggest that a rate below 20% is a viable possibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research from the ancient settlement of Catalhoyuk in Turkey provides strong evidence of a society centered around women 9,000 years ago. An international team analyzed DNA from skeletons buried under houses and found that related individuals were often connected through the maternal line, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with their female partner's family. This genetic data, combined with more grave goods found with female bodies, supports theories about the elevated status of women in this community.</p>

These soft figures provide the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) with room to potentially ease its monetary policy to support the export-dependent economy amid an uncertain global trade environment. The MAS has noted that growth is expected to be "subdued" in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
