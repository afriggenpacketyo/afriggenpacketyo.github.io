          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced plans to shift its primary listing to the U.S., a significant loss for the London Stock Exchange. The company intends to implement a dual listing, with the main hub moving to the U.S. while retaining a secondary listing in London. This strategic move would enable Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE. The company's earnings announcement highlighted that this would allow greater access to capital markets and a broader investor base, but the full implications of this decision for the London market are still unfolding. </p>

          <p>Russia is attempting to revive a strategic alliance with China and India as a counterweight to the Western-led international order, but faces challenges due to existing distrust between the two Asian powers. Despite historical border disputes, President Trump's policies could potentially serve as a catalyst to unite the three nations. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has criticized NATO's efforts to involve India in 'anti-China' initiatives and reaffirmed Moscow's hope for restoring the Russia-India-China framework. The border dispute between China and India had largely frozen bilateral ties until a disengagement agreement was reached in October of the previous year.</p>

The charity estimates that adopting a retired police dog costs an average of ¬£3,000 more per year compared to other dogs.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition with its solar panels, creating a model for the Global South, but a Chinese energy scholar questions the financial viability. The report argues that China must choose between its coal-fired plants in Pakistan and its solar panel exports, as both cannot succeed in the same market. It emphasizes the need for indigenous manufacturing to counter rising trade tensions and export restrictions on critical minerals. The influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for coal-fired plants, potentially leading to stranded assets.</p>
