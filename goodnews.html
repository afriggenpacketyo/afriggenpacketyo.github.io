          <p>Sue Baker, a patient with escalating heart issues and an LVAD, faced a high risk of organ rejection while awaiting a heart transplant at the Mayo Clinic. Doctors proposed an unprecedented heart-liver transplant to address her antibody problem, as the liver helps lower the risk of rejection. The surgery was successful, proving that placing a liver and a heart from the same donor can bring antibodies close to zero. After a long recovery, Baker now advocates for others needing transplants, finding solace in knowing her case has opened opportunities for more LVAD patients to receive life-saving treatment, despite facing financial struggles following her husband's sudden death. The patient's courage has paved the way for additional surgeries of this nature.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its HarmonyOS in space, reducing reliance on foreign software for small satellites. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS), a lightweight version of Huawei‚Äôs platform, was evaluated on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat. The satellite demonstrated faster data updates and improved stability compared to previous setups. Following the Lianli mission, national technical standards are proposed to guide OpenHarmony's use in small satellites, encouraging broader adoption across commercial and research missions within China. This represents a fully home-grown hardware-software solution for spacecraft operating systems.</p>

          <p>Pip Adam's novel "Audition" envisions space as both a dystopian prison and a site of new possibilities, following three giants exiled from Earth due to their size. The giants are confined on a ship that is powered by their speech, and they must keep talking or they will grow even more. Through their meaningless dialogue, the novel explores themes of exploitation, incarceration, and the corruption of language.

          <p>China's most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, is reportedly developing the capability to carry out "deck load strikes," a type of swarm attack, according to state broadcaster CCTV. This capability could give the Chinese navy a first-mover advantage in combat. The report highlights the historic leap in China's aircraft carrier technology as it enters a critical phase of combat capability development. The Fujian is expected to be commissioned by the end of the year, joining the Liaoning and Shandong to form a three-carrier fleet for the Chinese navy, signaling a significant advancement in China's naval power.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to DNA test all newborn babies to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative is part of a government drive towards predicting and preventing illness, with ¬£650 million invested in DNA research for all patients by 2030. The plan aims to ease pressure on NHS services by using genomics and AI to revolutionize prevention and provide faster diagnoses. The screening will involve sequencing complete DNA from umbilical cord blood samples to identify single-gene disorders that develop in early childhood and for which there are effective treatments.</p>

The bill, backed by MPs, allows mentally competent adults with a life expectancy of less than six months to request assistance in ending their lives. Critics, including Lord Shinkwin, fear that it could lead to vulnerable people being coerced into ending their lives. Dame Esther, who joined Dignitas after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer, argues that the bill sets out a rigorous process with numerous safeguards.</p>
