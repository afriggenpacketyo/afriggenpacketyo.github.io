          <p>President Trump has arrived in Saudi Arabia, marking the beginning of his four-day tour through the Gulf, his first major overseas trip of his second term, where he aims to secure business deals worth over $1 trillion. The trip includes stops in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, with expectations of lavish hospitality similar to his 2017 visit to Saudi Arabia. The deals are anticipated to involve investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and significant arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. The trip coincides with scrutiny over Trump family's financial interests, including pending real estate and cryptocurrency deals with Saudi-owned firms and the UAE, as well as a luxury Boeing 747-8 donation from Qatar for use as Air Force One. Trump maintains the plane will be retired as an exhibit in his library.</p>

          <p>Honda's fourth-quarter earnings revealed a 76% plunge in operating profit, falling short of expectations as the company braces for the impact of U.S. tariffs. Revenue for the financial year ended in March rose by 6.2% to 21.69 trillion yen, but operating profit declined by 12.2% to 1.21 trillion yen. The company had previously decided to produce its next-generation Civic hybrid in the U.S. to avoid potential tariffs. Amidst these challenges, discussions of a potential $60 billion merger with Nissan were terminated earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Cities worldwide are exploring public transportation to combat air pollution and traffic congestion, as cars contribute significantly to carbon emissions and road accidents. Some cities, like Tallinn, Estonia, have made public transport free for residents, but results have been mixed, with ridership falling and car use increasing. Behavioral scientists suggest that addressing the psychological aspects of car ownership, such as status and comfort, is crucial. Jakarta, Indonesia, is improving its bus system with air-conditioned buses, designated lanes, and connectivity to minibuses to encourage public transport use.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to accept a $400 million jet from Qatar has sparked criticism, even from allies like Laura Loomer, who calls it a "stain" on his tenure. Trump defends the gesture as a "great" one, citing maintenance costs on older Air Force One planes and planning to donate the jet to his future library. Critics raise ethical concerns about accepting such a gift from a foreign nation, particularly one with ties to groups that have harmed U.S. service members. Trump also announced a 90-day agreement with China to reduce tariffs and a cease-fire between India and Pakistan.</p>
