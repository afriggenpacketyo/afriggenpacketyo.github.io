          <p>Experts are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) this June, considering the current economic climate and Federal Reserve policies. While long-term CDs typically offer more competitive annual percentage yields (APY), short-term CDs are currently providing the highest interest rates due to market uncertainty. Professionals recommend that individuals assess their financial goals and liquidity needs before deciding between short-term and long-term CDs, as early withdrawal penalties apply. A CD ladder strategy, involving investments in CDs with varying maturity dates, may be useful for navigating the changing interest rate environment (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has directed the Trump administration to lift a pause on processing certain immigration applications, offering relief to immigrants from various countries. Judge Indira Talwani ruled that the government's actions were arbitrary and violated federal administrative law. The pause affected 240,000 Ukrainians and 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans who entered the U.S. under Biden-era parole policies, preventing them from obtaining other forms of legal status. The Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman stated that the administration believes the law favors their position.</p>

          <p>Hormel Foods Corporation is recalling over 256,000 pounds of canned beef stew nationwide due to potential contamination with wood fragments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stocks surged at the open of trading after a federal court blocked President Trump from imposing some tariffs on China and other major U.S. trading partners. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq all saw increases following the ruling. The court's decision invalidated levies on dozens of countries, but the Trump administration appealed the ruling immediately. The ruling centered on Trump's invocation of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, with the court finding that the law does not explicitly permit tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic argues that the court's decision to strike down almost all of President Trump's tariffs is a vindication of the rule of law, not a judicial coup. The author emphasizes that the Constitution delegates the tariff power to Congress, not the presidency. The ruling affirms Congress's power over tariffs, and Americans need not fear a judicial dictatorship, as Congress can reinstate the tariffs if it chooses. The article suggests that the Trump administration's criticism of the judiciary reflects contempt for any check on the power of the presidency.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed strong sales growth, driven by demand for its GPUs in the data center division, particularly from cloud providers. However, U.S. export controls are hindering Nvidia's sales in China, a market the company estimates could be worth $50 billion. CEO Jensen Huang expressed concerns that these restrictions are encouraging Chinese AI developers to use homegrown chips. Looking ahead, Nvidia sees significant potential in AI inference, where its GPUs are used to serve AI models to millions of customers, and the company's latest Blackwell chips are designed to meet this surging demand.</p>

Analysts noted that the court ruling suggested that extreme tariffs and rapidly changing tariffs are less likely to happen, reducing uncertainty.
