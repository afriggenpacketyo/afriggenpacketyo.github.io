          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, nephew of Emperor Naruhito, has officially reached adulthood in a traditional coming-of-age ceremony, becoming the first male royal to do so in 40 years. As he is second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his new status brings renewed focus to the country's male-only succession laws. With only one other male heir younger than the current emperor, the event has reignited discussions about whether the rules should be changed to allow female succession, a move supported by much of the public but opposed by conservatives. The shrinking number of heirs reflects Japan's broader demographic challenges.</p>

The article explores how the team embodies the spirit of Buffalo, a city with a history of resilience and a reputation for being an underdog. The author reflects on the powerful sense of community and shared identity that comes from supporting a team, particularly one known for its passionate and loyal fanbase. This experience illustrates how sports allegiance can be a way of finding a sense of home and connection, even from afar.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors has proposed a new long-term compensation package for CEO Elon Musk that could potentially make him the world's first trillionaire. The plan, which requires shareholder approval, would grant Musk up to 12% of Tesla's stock over a decade if he achieves extremely aggressive growth targets, including increasing the company's market capitalization to at least $8.5 trillion. The proposal is designed to retain Musk and incentivize him to lead Tesla's expansion into AI and robotics. However, the plan has raised concerns among some analysts about corporate governance and the precedent it sets for executive compensation.</p>

          <p>Scotland secured a valuable point in their World Cup qualification campaign with a hard-fought draw against Denmark in Copenhagen. The performance, praised for its work-rate and defensive solidity, marks a promising beginning for a team that has often struggled in the early stages of past qualifying tournaments. Manager Steve Clarke remained characteristically understated, but the result puts pressure on Denmark, a key rival in the group. The team's resilience, particularly from players like Grant Hanley and the returning Aaron Hickey, has provided a sense of cautious optimism for their chances of reaching a World Cup for the first time since 1998.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Colombian goalkeeper René Higuita performed his legendary "scorpion kick" save during a friendly match against England at Wembley Stadium, creating one of football's most iconic moments. The article reflects on the career of Higuita, known as 'El Loco' (The Madman), whose flamboyant and risk-taking style revolutionized the role of the goalkeeper. Beyond his on-field antics, which included scoring 43 career goals, his story is also marked by controversy, including a prison sentence for his involvement in a cartel kidnapping. The scorpion kick remains the defining moment of a complex figure who was both a pioneer and a controversial icon.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over one million immigrants from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the removal of legal protections that allow them to live and work in the United States due to dangerous conditions in their home countries. The judge criticized Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's decision as "arbitrary and capricious," stating it exceeded her authority. This decision provides relief for hundreds of thousands who faced deportation and family separation, though it comes after some have already been deported.</p>

Companies are investing billions to build advanced AI models and view spending lavishly on top talent as a necessary expense to gain a competitive edge. This "AI talent war" has seen enormous offers made to poach experts from rivals and universities, driving wage inflation to unprecedented levels. The trend raises concerns that smaller startups and traditional industries will be unable to compete for the talent needed to innovate.</p>

In the speech, Mandelson will draw parallels between the mandates for national renewal that brought both Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to power. The address is seen as a strategic effort to bolster the UK-US special relationship under the unconventional Trump presidency. The article also notes that Mandelson, a key architect of New Labour and a former Remainer, will frame Brexit as an opportunity for closer US ties.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping recently hosted leaders from the world's other four ruling communist parties, highlighting the continued importance of party-to-party diplomacy in China's foreign policy. This channel, managed by the Communist Party's International Department, operates alongside traditional state-level relations and is a key tool for engagement, particularly with ideologically similar nations. While not aimed at creating a global communist movement like the Soviet Union, this diplomatic strategy has become an increasingly active part of Beijing's outreach. The International Department has connections with over 600 political parties worldwide and plays a central role in these high-level interactions.</p>
