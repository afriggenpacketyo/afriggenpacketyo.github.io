          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 08:59:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average retirement benefit by approximately $56 per month starting in January. This annual adjustment is designed to help Social Security and Supplemental Security Income benefits keep pace with inflation. The 2026 increase aligns with expert projections and is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment in 2025. This measure aims to ensure that benefits reflect current economic realities for millions of recipients. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index for September showed a 3% annual increase, a figure slightly below economists' expectations but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. This data, released despite the government shutdown to facilitate Social Security adjustments, is a critical factor for the Fed's upcoming interest rate decision. While rising inflation complicates the central bank's dual mandate of managing prices and unemployment, the benign report is seen as reinforcing expectations for another rate cut. The job market's recent slowdown remains a key concern for policymakers. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the British Journal of Nutrition indicates a potential link between the temperature of consumed beverages and certain health outcomes. Researchers found that among Asian participants, drinking more cold beverages in warmer months was associated with increased anxiety and sleep disturbances. Conversely, White participants reported better sleep and fewer gastrointestinal issues when drinking hot beverages in winter. The study, based on self-reported data from over 400 adults, suggests a correlation rather than causation, highlighting cultural habits and individual temperature sensitivity as potential factors.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, scoring in three consecutive games and earning praise from managers like Jose Mourinho. However, the 24-year-old has yet to score or provide an assist in the Premier League this season, reflecting a broader struggle for the team in domestic competition. Gordon, known for his effectiveness in big games, has excelled in Europe with a high shot conversion rate. The challenge now is for him to consistently deliver that same level of performance in the Premier League, starting with the upcoming match against Fulham.</p>

          <p>Research on fossils from New Mexico suggests that dinosaur populations were diverse and thriving in North America just before the mass extinction event caused by an asteroid 66 million years ago. By accurately dating the rock formations, scientists determined the fossils, including those of Tyrannosaurus rex and the massive Alamosaurus, are from approximately 400,000 years before the impact. This evidence challenges the long-debated theory that dinosaurs were already in decline. While the findings provide a snapshot of one region, they contribute significantly to understanding the state of dinosaur ecosystems at the end of the Cretaceous period.</p>

          <p>England goalkeeper Hannah Hampton, a hero of the Euro 2025 victory, will miss the upcoming friendly match against Brazil due to an elbow injury. Her absence guarantees a debut for one of the squad's other goalkeepers, either Khiara Keating or Anna Moorhouse. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that while the injury is not major, it presents an opportunity for other talented players to gain experience. The match is part of a homecoming series for the Lionesses to celebrate their European championship success and begin a new cycle in preparation for the 2027 Women's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming segments. However, the company's overall sales volume was flat compared to the previous year, indicating waning consumer demand for some products like home and health care items. P&G's CFO noted that U.S. consumption has slowed, with shoppers stretching their budgets by using products to the last drop. Despite these challenges and tariff-related costs, the consumer goods giant reiterated its sales and earnings forecast for the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The portrayal of "aliens" in popular culture has long served as a mirror for societal fears, from Cold War paranoia in the 1950s to modern anxieties about migration and artificial intelligence. The article traces how alien imagery evolved from little green men to the iconic "grey" figures, shaped by media and alleged eyewitness accounts. It notes how the term "alien" itself carries connotations of otherness and exclusion in political discourse. More recently, the concept has been applied to artificial intelligence, which some experts describe as a non-human, "alien intelligence" that is reshaping our world in unpredictable ways.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has dismissed concerns about winger Mohamed Salah's recent dip in goal-scoring form, stating it is the "last thing" he worries about. Salah, who was the team's top scorer last season, has scored only three league goals this term and was started on the bench for a recent Champions League match. Slot attributed the slow start to the natural fluctuations in a player's performance and the need for the team to adapt to new summer signings. He expressed full confidence that Salah, a prolific scorer throughout his career, will soon return to his usual goal-scoring ways.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a report from Hedge Fund Research. This growth was driven by a combination of strong investment returns and the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital from investors in 18 years. In the third quarter alone, the industry's assets grew by over $238 billion, with investors pouring in $33.7 billion in new money. The surge is attributed to successful bets on technology and artificial intelligence, as well as rising M&A activity and expectations of lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
