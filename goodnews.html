          <h2>Flexible Work Options Could Help Teacher Retention, Says Educator</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A primary school teacher, Alice Cole, highlights the importance of flexible working arrangements for retaining teachers, especially new parents, after returning to work part-time following the birth of her child. She believes flexible options allow teachers to balance their personal and professional lives, addressing recruitment and retention issues within the profession. The government is trying to improve flexible hours as part of its pledge to recruit new teachers, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson suggesting more schools should offer flexible hours. A computer science teacher, Sam Alner, notes that teachers are burning out due to the relentless nature of the job, which leads to experienced staff members leaving to find a better work-life balance.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used the rare mineral tellurium to create an artificial retina that restored sight in blind animals and gave them the ability to see infrared light. The nanowire implants convert visible light and infrared radiation into electrical signals, replacing damaged photoreceptor cells. This advancement offers significant promise for treating human blindness. Tellurium, a byproduct of copper refining, possesses excellent photoelectric properties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has clarified that Costco membership cards are not acceptable forms of identification for air travel. This announcement follows the implementation of the REAL ID Act, which requires travelers to present REAL ID-compliant driver's licenses or state IDs for domestic flights. The confusion may stem from the gold stars on Costco cards, similar to the star marking on REAL ID-compliant documents. TSA emphasizes that travelers must provide documentation showing their full legal name, date of birth, Social Security number, proof of address, and lawful status to obtain a REAL ID.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that subsidizing men‚Äôs participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining global birth rates, particularly in countries like China. The study found that subsidies for fathers produce significantly higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. Researchers emphasize the urgency of addressing declining fertility rates in countries "getting old before getting rich," as it threatens economic stability.</p>

Instead, they emphasize the importance of smart work, sustainable innovation cultures, and providing employees with a healthy work-life balance.
