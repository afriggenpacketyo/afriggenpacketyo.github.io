        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>GE Appliances is investing $490 million to move its washer and dryer production from China to a new plant in Kentucky, a decision accelerated by U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. The company states the move will create 800 new American jobs in fields like engineering and advanced manufacturing, with the new facility expected to be operational by early 2027. While the company cites its "zero distance" philosophy of building products where they are sold as the primary driver, it acknowledges that the tariff environment made the decision more urgent and financially sensible.</p>

          <p>The Privy Council in London has affirmed the legality of same-sex civil partnerships in the Cayman Islands, a British overseas territory. The ruling rejected a legal challenge against the 2020 law, which was enacted by the governor after the local parliament voted it down. This decision provides legal certainty for same-sex couples and is seen by activists as a significant victory for LGBTQ+ rights that could influence similar legal battles in other British territories. The original case was brought by a lesbian couple who were denied the right to marry.</p>

          <p>The Writers Guild of America West has removed producer Randall Emmett from its "strike list," allowing guild members to work with him again. This follows Emmett's payment of $630,000 to resolve a long-standing debt related to unpaid compensation and benefits for writers on a failed television project from 2019. The WGA had previously warned its members against working on Emmett's new projects, including a planned film with Martin Scorsese.

          <p>The U.S. is considering a multibillion-dollar missile defense system, dubbed the "Golden Dome," intended to bolster protection against long-range missile threats and deter China in the Indo-Pacific. The system, conceptualized under the Trump administration, would utilize a network of satellites and space-based sensors for missile interception. Analysts believe it could enhance U.S. strategic capabilities, particularly in potential conflicts like one over the Taiwan Strait. However, significant questions remain regarding the project's immense cost and technological feasibility, making its implementation uncertain.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major U.S. Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 17:59:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term strategies employed by businesses, including pre-ordering large amounts of inventory before tariffs took effect. Companies have also absorbed some costs and utilized trade loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay or reduce duty payments. However, experts caution that this buffering effect may be temporary and that price increases could still materialize later in the year if tariffs remain high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has signed an executive order to lift a portion of the financial sanctions imposed on Syria, a move intended to support the country's stability after the ousting of Bashar al-Assad. The order primarily cancels a 2004 program that froze Syrian government assets, though significant sanctions, including those under the Caesar Act, will remain in place. The new Syrian government welcomed the decision, stating it opens the door for reconstruction and the return of displaced people.

          <p>Senator Mike Lee has removed a controversial provision from the Republican budget bill that would have allowed the sale of public lands in several Western states. Lee stated the withdrawal was necessary because he could not secure "enforceable safeguards" to prevent the land from being sold to foreign interests or large corporations like BlackRock. The proposal had faced bipartisan opposition from lawmakers in states like Montana and Idaho, as well as from conservation groups. The removal of the provision resolves a key point of contention that threatened the bill's passage in both the Senate and the House.</p>

However, a money market account may outperform a 9-month CD.
