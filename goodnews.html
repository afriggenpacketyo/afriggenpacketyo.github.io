          <p>A recent Kyodo News poll indicates that nearly 60% of Japanese citizens anticipate a decrease in soaring rice prices following the appointment of a new farm minister. This expectation arises after the previous minister was dismissed for insensitive remarks about receiving gifted rice. The poll also reveals that many believe rice prices should drop below 3,000 yen per 5 kg, a lower target than the one pledged by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. The survey reflects public concern over rising rice prices and their hopes for government intervention.</p>

Means, a Stanford-educated surgeon, believes psychedelics can unlock new perspectives and free individuals from limiting beliefs. While psilocybin, the active compound in magic mushrooms, remains federally illegal, the FDA has designated it as a "breakthrough" drug for research purposes.

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to address the Canadian Parliament, signaling a strengthening of ties with the Crown amidst tensions with the US under President Trump. This move is seen as an affirmation of Canada's sovereignty and independence. The visit is notable as it marks the first time a British monarch has opened a new session of parliament since 1957. The decision reflects Canada's desire to maintain its unique identity and build stronger alliances with Europe.</p>

          <p>Five years after the murder of George Floyd, Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara continues to implement reforms aimed at improving community relations and reducing crime. Despite challenges such as officer shortages, O'Hara is focused on restoring trust and changing the department's culture. While violent crime remains a concern, O'Hara emphasizes the importance of earning community trust and ensuring the safety of residents. The Justice Department recently ended investigations of six police agencies and canceling consent decrees proposed for Louisville and Minneapolis, but O'Hara said that reform efforts will continue, even without the federal oversight.</p>

          <p>A leading Chinese respiratory disease expert, Zhong Nanshan, predicts that COVID-19 infections in China are reaching their peak and will begin to decline next month. He advises individuals with symptoms, particularly the elderly, to seek medical treatment promptly. While the virus is more infectious with symptoms similar to influenza, data suggests an upward trend in positive cases from March to May.
