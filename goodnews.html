          <p>Erika Kirk, widow of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, publicly forgave Tyler Robinson, the man accused of her husband's murder, during a memorial service in Arizona. She emphasized that the answer to hate is love, drawing a stark contrast with the rhetoric of Vice President JD Vance and President Donald Trump, who spoke at the same event. Kirk tearfully recounted seeing her husband's body and expressed comfort in the public's embrace of Christianity following his death. This article highlights her message of forgiveness and faith amid the tragedy, positioning it as a call for spiritual revival.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, kept its one-year and five-year loan prime rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, who anticipated a hold on major stimulus despite recent economic data showing signs of fatigue, balanced by a stock market rally. The article notes that the central bank had previously cut rates in May and maintained its seven-day reverse repo rate last week, following a U.S. Federal Reserve rate cut. Policymakers are expected to implement marginal monetary easing later this year to meet the annual growth target.</p>

          <p>Research on over 200 parent-child relationships reveals nine key practices that foster exceptional social skills in children, emphasizing the importance of emotional safety and authentic connection at home. Parents who openly discuss feelings, model empathy, build genuine confidence, teach conflict resolution, and validate emotions are crucial.
