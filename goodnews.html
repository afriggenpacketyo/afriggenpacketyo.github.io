          <p>President Trump announced that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations, though Beijing's confirmation was more reserved. The proposed agreement would reportedly involve a consortium of U.S. investors, including Oracle, acquiring TikTok's American business, allowing it to continue operating under U.S. control. A key point of contention remains the ownership of the app's powerful algorithm, which pushes content to its 170 million American users. While Trump expressed optimism about closing the deal, some U.S. lawmakers remain concerned about potential continued influence from the Chinese Communist Party.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the current hurricane season. According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm is currently over open waters and is not expected to pose an immediate threat to land. Forecasters predict Gabrielle will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday as it moves in a west-northwest direction, passing north of the Caribbean islands. While its long-term track is still being monitored, the system could pass east of Bermuda early next week, potentially bringing some impacts to the island.</p>

Inspired by an attempt to defraud her own grandfather, Manoj developed a website and an AI-powered app called Shield Seniors to educate older adults on how to identify and report fraudulent messages. She now conducts workshops at senior centers, teaching cybersecurity awareness. Manoj, who is largely self-taught through online resources, hopes the recognition will help her secure funding to launch her app by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated Western markets and slowing demand, many Chinese companies are using a major trade fair in Nanning to explore opportunities in Southeast Asia. The region's fast-growing economies and large, young consumer base present an attractive alternative for exporters seeking new growth. One manager from an electric scooter company noted that while his firm has long relied on Europe and America, Southeast Asia offers immense untapped potential. This strategic shift highlights a broader trend of Chinese businesses diversifying their international footprints and adapting to changing global economic conditions.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Dismisses President Trump's $15 Billion Defamation Lawsuit Against The New York Times</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, criticizing the complaint's length and "improper and impermissible" language. The judge ruled that the 85-page filing resembled a political rally speech rather than a professional legal document and failed to clearly state its legal basis. The dismissal was on procedural grounds, not the legal merits of the case. Trump's lawyers have been given 28 days to file an amended, more concise complaint, while the newspaper welcomed the ruling as recognition that the original suit was a political document.</p>

          <h2>Major US Tech Investments Signal Growing Confidence in the UK's AI Superpower Potential</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent wave of multi-billion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft is fueling optimism about the United Kingdom's future as an AI superpower. During President Trump's state visit, executives praised the UK's rich history of scientific research and innovation, suggesting the country is too humble about its capabilities. While some critics, like former Deputy PM Nick Clegg, argue the UK is just taking "crumbs from the Silicon Valley table," the influx of capital is seen as a major boost for the economy. This growing tech "bromance" may also signal a pro-growth shift in UK regulatory policy to attract further investment.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Cillian Murphy has confirmed a "Peaky Blinders" film is forthcoming from Netflix, though he remains tight-lipped about the plot to keep it a surprise for fans. Reflecting on his iconic role as the violent gangster Tommy Shelby, Murphy stated that playing the character for a quarter of his life has been a defining privilege, but emphasized he is nothing like the "psychopathic" patriarch in real life. The actor, who is currently promoting his new film "Steve," noted that the joy of long-form television was growing older with a character, an experience he never anticipated when the show began in 2013.</p>

          <p>The "Pupusas and Punchlines" comedy show, held in a Los Angeles Salvadoran restaurant, is providing a vital platform for Latinx comedians in a competitive scene where they often feel marginalized. Created by Justin Alexio, the weekly event allows performers to connect with an appreciative audience over shared food and cultural experiences, joking about topics like immigration and the first-generation dilemma. The show has grown from a monthly event to a sold-out weekly staple, helping to launch the careers of upcoming comics by fostering a sense of community. It stands out as one of the few consistent shows catering specifically to the Latinx community in a majority-Latin city.</p>
