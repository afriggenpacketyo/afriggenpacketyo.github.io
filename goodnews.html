This potential payout comes after Ryanair reported a fall in full-year profits, though O'Leary maintains that the airline provides exceptional value to shareholders. Ryanair emphasized that the bonus is contingent on both the share price target and O'Leary's continued employment, and he has indicated he may stay with the airline beyond his current contract's expiration in 2028.

          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Supporting Healthy Moms and Babies Act, has been introduced in the Senate to require private insurance companies to fully cover all childbirth-related expenses without co-pays or deductibles. The bill has garnered support from organizations across the political spectrum, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and anti-abortion groups. The proposed legislation aims to alleviate the financial burden of childbirth for American families, where out-of-pocket costs for privately insured families average nearly $3,000. The bill would expand the list of essential health benefits under the Affordable Care Act and would be paid for by insurance companies and modest increases in premiums.</p>

          <p>OpenAI, valued at $300 billion, is grappling with its nonprofit origins as it seeks to dominate the AI industry with products like ChatGPT. Founded in 2015 with a mission for safe and beneficial AI, OpenAI created a for-profit subsidiary in 2019 to attract investors, but its nonprofit status has become a constraint. After facing investor concerns, OpenAI initially proposed transitioning to a for-profit structure, but later backtracked, deciding to keep the nonprofit in charge following scrutiny from regulators and critics. Despite the structural debate, OpenAI continues to expand its AI infrastructure and develop new products, striving to balance its founding mission with the competitive pressures of the market.</p>

Manchester City opted not to exercise their buy-back option for Delap, who was given permission by Ipswich to speak to interested clubs. Chelsea's co-owner Behdad Eghbali met with Delap's agent, and head coach Enzo Maresca directly pitched to the player, with Delap undergoing a medical examination.</p>

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing economists' expectations, despite global economic uncertainties. This growth marks the strongest quarterly performance in the government's fiscal year 2025, with the full fiscal year expanding by 6.5%. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and relatively lower dependence on exports, which have helped cushion the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the U.S. has imposed tariffs on goods imported from India, negotiations for a potential trade deal are ongoing, with India reportedly offering zero tariffs on U.S. imports.

Joe Walsh, the first Alzheimer's patient to receive the experimental treatment, has shown reduced inflammation in his brain, according to researchers. The nasal spray contains a monoclonal antibody called foralumab, previously tested for inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis, and aims to reduce the activity of microglia in the brain. While it's unclear if the treatment will improve Walsh's cognitive function, his wife has observed positive signs in his social engagement, and a clinical trial of foralumab for Alzheimer's is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>

          <p>Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she wants to see Michigan secure a semiconductor plant by the end of 2026, calling it an issue she has advocated for at the federal level, during a May 29 speech at the Mackinac Policy Conference. Whitmer told business and political leaders attending the Detroit Regional Chamber's annual policy that she has been advocating for federal support to land such an advanced manufacturing project with President Donald Trump's administration. During her speech, she also laid out other policy goals she said would necessitate bipartisan cooperation. She reiterated her call for a sustainable, long-term plan for funding roads.</p>
