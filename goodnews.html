          <p>President Trump's ever-changing tariff policies have caused uncertainty for consumers, but a recent agreement with China would reduce the level of U.S. taxes on Chinese goods. Shoppers can look for sales, check product origins, and purchase domestic products to avoid price hikes. Electronics and toys are expected to be hit hardest by tariffs. Experts advise consumers to consider planned purchases and move up the timeline, rather than panic shopping.</p>

Her primary aim this season remains winning gold at the World Championships in Tokyo in September, although she is also hoping to break the 1m54sec barrier for the 800m.

          <p>The "de minimis" tariff rate on low-value parcels from China will come down to 54% from 120%, after an agreement between the U.S. and China.

Effective May 14, the tariff rate on low-value imports from China will be slashed to 54%. Temu has halted shipments of goods from China to the U.S., and is now relying on domestic sellers to fulfill U.S.-based customers' orders and avoid tariffs.</p>

          <p>Jennie Erin Smith's book, "Valley of Forgetting," explores memory, medicine, and hereditary fate in rural Colombia, focusing on a rare genetic mutation linked to early-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The book tells the stories of families affected by the paisa mutation and the researchers studying them. Through these stories, Smith suggests that forgetting might be more than just an existential loss; it might also be a chance to explore other forms of humanity grounded in feeling, presence, or touch. The book also touches on the relationship between memory and identity.</p>
