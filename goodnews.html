          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that she declined an offer from U.S. President Donald Trump to send American troops into Mexico to assist in fighting drug trafficking. Sheinbaum asserted Mexico's sovereignty, emphasizing that while collaboration is welcome, the presence of the U.S. military is not acceptable. Trump's proposal followed an increase in U.S. military presence along the southern border with Mexico, and the designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. Sheinbaum's stance signals a potential collision course with the U.S. regarding military intervention.</p>
