          <p>New estimates from The Senior Citizens League and policy analyst Mary Johnson suggest that Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, mirroring the adjustment made in 2025. This cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) aims to help monthly checks keep pace with inflation, with the official change announced by the Social Security Administration in October based on third-quarter inflation data. The estimate is subject to change, with potential impacts from President Trump's tariff policies, though recent consumer price index data showed limited impact from these policies. A 2.5% COLA increase would be considered about average, according to Johnson. (not investment advice)</p>

Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, emphasized that the new rule will alleviate the pressure on players to return to the court prematurely. Stephens has previously used the off-season to freeze her eggs, and believes this new protection is the best thing possible for players' health.</p>
