          <h2>Trump Approves Nippon Steel's Takeover of U.S. Steel with Conditions</h2>

          <p>President Trump approved Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel, reversing a previous decision by President Biden.  The approval is contingent on Nippon Steel's commitment to significant investments in U.S. steelmaking and adherence to national security agreements.  The deal will create the world's third-largest steelmaker.  The decision was met with support from the companies involved and the Japanese government, but also highlights the politicization of the deal.</p>
