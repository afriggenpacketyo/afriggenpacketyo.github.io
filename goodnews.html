          <p>Coinbase shares surged as the crypto exchange is set to join the S&P 500, replacing Discover Financial Services before trading on May 19. Since its direct listing in 2021, Coinbase has become a significant part of the U.S. financial system, boosted by the rising value of Bitcoin and the approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs. Despite its volatility, Coinbase reported net income of $65.6 million in the last quarter and plans to acquire Dubai-based Deribit for $2.9 billion to expand its global presence. The addition to the S&P 500 is expected to increase the stock's value as funds tracking the index add it to their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>
