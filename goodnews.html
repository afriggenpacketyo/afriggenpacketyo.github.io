          <p>A new Netflix documentary, "America’s Team: the Gambler and his Cowboys," is earning acclaim for its raw and comprehensive portrayal of the Dallas Cowboys' dynasty in the 1990s. The series delves into the team's on-field success and off-field controversies, featuring candid interviews with key figures like owner Jerry Jones, coach Jimmy Johnson, and star player Michael Irvin. Unlike many polished sports documentaries, this series explores gritty topics such as player misconduct, internal feuds, and health issues with remarkable openness. The article suggests its unflinching approach offers a more complete and compelling narrative than other popular sports hagiographies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has signed 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens for £18.1 million, choosing him over the more experienced Emiliano Martinez from Aston Villa. This decision aligns with the club's "Project 150" strategy, which aims to build a title-contending team by its 150th anniversary in 2028. While Martinez is a proven Premier League talent, United's data analysis highlighted Lammens' exceptional potential in key metrics like shot-stopping and distribution for his age group. The move represents a calculated risk, prioritizing future development over immediate, proven experience as the club rebuilds under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>A strong solar storm allowed the Northern Lights to be seen across a wide swath of the UK, with sightings reported from northern Scotland down to Norfolk and Kent. The celestial display was caused by a coronal mass ejection from the Sun, which sent increased solar energy into Earth's atmosphere. Space weather forecasters predict that the heightened solar activity could continue, potentially leading to an even more widespread aurora visibility. The US Space Weather Prediction Center confirmed a "moderate geomagnetic storm," creating the conditions for this rare and beautiful phenomenon to be observed so far south.</p>

          <p>Citizens in Guyana voted in a crucial presidential election, the outcome of which will determine the stewardship of the nation's massive newfound oil wealth. The election is primarily a contest between the incumbent People's Progressive Party and the opposition A Partnership for National Unity, with the winning party set to manage billions in annual oil revenue. The vote takes place against a backdrop of a severe cost of living crisis and heightened territorial tensions with neighboring Venezuela. Despite its oil boom, Guyana remains one of the poorest countries in the region, making economic management a key issue for voters.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has climbed to an estimated $1.3 billion for Wednesday's drawing after no ticket matched all the winning numbers on Monday night. This new grand prize now ranks as the fifth-largest in the game's history and the ninth-largest among all U.S. lottery jackpots. The drawing on Wednesday will be the 41st consecutive one without a jackpot winner, nearing the record for the longest streak. A potential single winner would have the choice between an annuity of approximately $1.3 billion or a lump-sum cash payment of an estimated $589 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>In anticipation of steep new U.S. port fees taking effect in October, Chinese shipping firms are collaborating with international partners to diversify their operations and reduce exposure to the American market. Companies like Cosco Shipping are actively expanding services in emerging and regional markets, including intra-Asia, Africa, and Latin America, to counteract potential negative impacts. While acknowledging the risks posed by the new fees, these firms are also identifying opportunities to strengthen their presence in non-U.S. trade routes. This strategic shift reflects the industry's adaptation to an evolving and challenging global trade environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Utah has launched an ambitious initiative to build 35,000 affordable starter homes in five years to combat a severe housing crisis that has pushed homeownership out of reach for many young residents. However, progress has been slow, with only about 5,100 homes built or started so far. The state has offered incentives like low-interest construction loans, but experts argue that without bolder zoning reforms to allow for smaller, denser housing, the impact will be limited. Despite the challenges, some developers are embracing the program, creating new, lower-cost homes that offer a crucial entry point into the housing market for first-time buyers.</p>

          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a veteran Democrat and the longest-serving New Yorker in the House, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026. Citing a "necessity for generational change" in the Democratic party, the 78-year-old congressman stated his belief that a younger successor could be more effective. Nadler, first elected in 1992, has had a prominent career, including chairing the House Judiciary Committee and serving as an impeachment manager during President Trump's first impeachment. His retirement opens up a key seat in New York and reflects ongoing discussions within the party about leadership and renewal.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the China Astronaut Research and Training Centre have designed a compact, detergent-free washing machine for use in space, addressing the challenge of cleaning clothes on long-duration missions. The device, slightly larger than a carry-on suitcase, uses a combination of ultrasonic mist and ozone to clean and sterilize clothing. It requires only 400ml of water per cycle, a crucial feature given that water is a scarce resource in space. This innovation could significantly improve hygiene and comfort for astronauts by allowing them to reuse clothing multiple times during their missions.</p>
