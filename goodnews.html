          <p>OpenAI is set to acquire io, the AI device startup founded by former Apple design chief Jony Ive, for $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal. Ive will assume significant creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io, with io merging into OpenAI while Ive's LoveFrom studio remains independent. This acquisition, OpenAI's largest to date, follows the company's recent purchase of AI-assisted coding tool Windsurf for $3 billion, marking a significant push into hardware to stay competitive in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. OpenAI is investing heavily in hardware to bring AI into the physical world, previously hiring Meta's AR glasses lead and investing in robotics startup Physical Intelligence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Senate has passed a bill that would provide a tax break on tip income, potentially benefiting a small subset of the U.S. workforce primarily in the restaurant, hotel, and courier service industries. Both President Trump and Vice President Harris supported the idea during campaign appearances in Nevada, and the bill allows workers to deduct 'qualified tips' from 2025 through 2028 if they are reported. However, experts raise concerns about fairness, potential income misclassification, and shifts in compensation structures, noting that lower-income tipped workers may not benefit significantly. The policy could also incentivize the introduction of tipping in new occupations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, fueled by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, easing U.S.-China trade tensions, and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. The cryptocurrency's price has steadily climbed in May, supported by cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin and increased liquidity in the crypto market. Investors are anticipating further catalysts, including regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments, to drive prices higher. The Senate recently advanced legislation to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins, and Coinbase joined the S&P 500, signaling growing acceptance of the crypto industry.</p>

          <p>A proposed ban on the 'tush push' play in the NFL has failed to pass, as it did not receive the required 24 votes from team owners. The Philadelphia Eagles, who have effectively used the play since 2022, brought former center Jason Kelce to argue against the ban, emphasizing that no injuries have been reported as a result of the play. While some coaches and executives have expressed concerns about the play's safety and aesthetics, the NFL has maintained that no injuries have been directly linked to the 'tush push.' The play involves pushing the quarterback forward in short-yardage situations.</p>
