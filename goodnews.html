          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the deal will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow. This strategic partnership aims to strengthen NATO's northern flank by creating a joint UK-Norwegian fleet to operate in the North Atlantic. The deal is seen as a significant victory for the British defense industry over competitors from France, Germany, and the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from deporting ten unaccompanied children to Guatemala. The ruling came after advocacy groups argued the removals would violate U.S. laws that provide special protections for vulnerable minors who arrive at the border without a parent or guardian. The administration had recently established an agreement with Guatemala to facilitate such deportations. The judge's 14-day order blocks the immediate transfer of the children to ICE custody, where they faced the risk of being sent to a country where they could face harm.</p>

          <p>During an informal meeting, European Union foreign ministers brainstormed new approaches to support Ukraine as the war with Russia continues. Among the ideas discussed were the potential for secondary sanctions targeting Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" production sites for Ukrainian arms companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious debate over seizing some €200 billion in frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Additionally, there was broad support for a proposal to move the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops onto Ukrainian territory following a ceasefire.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has achieved remarkable success by removing millions of purple sea urchins that were devastating the ecosystem. Over the past 13 years, divers led by The Bay Foundation have smashed nearly 6 million urchins, clearing over 80 acres and allowing the vital kelp forests to regrow. These "sequoias of the sea" are crucial habitats for hundreds of marine species and serve as significant carbon sinks. The project offers a successful model for restoring marine ecosystems that have been thrown out of balance by environmental pressures.</p>

While no one won the grand prize, nine tickets matched the five white balls to win $1 million each, and three other tickets won $2 million by including the Power Play option. The next drawing is scheduled for Monday night, with a potential winner facing the choice between the full annuity paid over 30 years or a lump sum cash value of $498.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri claimed a controlled victory at an incident-filled Dutch Grand Prix, extending his championship lead. The race was a major turning point in the title fight, as his teammate and rival, Lando Norris, was forced to retire from a comfortable second place due to an oil leak with only seven laps remaining. Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherited second place, while French rookie Isack Hadjar secured a remarkable first-ever podium finish for Racing Bulls.

          <p>A woman in Llanharan, Wales, had an unexpected experience while pet-sitting her brother's pregnant Labrador, Tilly, who went into labor a week early. Rhian Boxall, who was told the dog was unlikely to give birth while she was watching her, ended up helping deliver a litter of 14 puppies over 15 hours. With advice from an emergency vet, she managed to save 12 of the pups, including one born outside in the garden. The dog's owner, who was on holiday in the Canary Islands, expressed his shock and gratitude for his sister's emergency midwifery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a personal essay, the author makes a case for hunting as a morally complex but honest and sustainable way to consume meat, challenging the reflexive disdain it often receives from the political left. Drawing from personal experiences hunting in Montana, the author argues that it fosters a deep connection to nature and a sense of responsibility for one's food that is absent in industrial agriculture. The essay posits that hunters are often dedicated conservationists who contribute directly to wildlife management, suggesting that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground on food ethics than is commonly acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Jeremy Allen White is playing Bruce Springsteen in the film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of the artist's seminal 1982 album, "Nebraska." In an interview, White discussed the daunting task of portraying the iconic musician, especially during a period when Springsteen was battling depression. He spoke about finding a connection with the artist's feeling of being a "fraudulent" human, a sentiment he relates to as an actor. Springsteen himself has given his approval and was reportedly significantly involved in the making of the film, which he calls an "antibiopic."</p>
