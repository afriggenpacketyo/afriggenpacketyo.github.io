          <p>A passenger on a SkyWest flight described the moment the plane made a sudden, sharp turn to avoid a B-52 bomber near Minot, North Dakota. The pilot, who was not informed of the bomber's approved flyover for the state fair, apologized for the aggressive maneuver, stating it was the safest option. The incident, which left passengers shaken, is now under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration to determine the proximity of the two aircraft and the communication breakdown between air traffic control and the military.</p>

          <p>Corporate spending on business travel is increasing but at a more moderate pace than previously predicted, as companies adopt a strategic, cautious approach due to economic pressures and trade policy uncertainty. A new report from Navan shows a 15% year-over-year increase in spending, with a focus on individual relationship-building meetings rather than large team events. The Global Business Travel Association has tempered its growth forecast, citing a drop in industry optimism. This trend reflects a "wait and see" mode among C-suite leaders prioritizing high-return-on-investment travel. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts note that current annuity rates are among the best seen in years, driven by high Treasury yields and increased competition among providers. This elevated rate environment presents a potentially favorable opportunity for retirees or those nearing retirement to lock in guaranteed income streams. However, advisors caution that annuities are not suitable for everyone, particularly those who may need liquidity or whose financial goals don't align with a long-term, locked-in product. The decision should be based on individual financial plans rather than attempts to perfectly time the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has stated that while he does not believe Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell needs to resign, the central bank should conduct an internal review of its non-monetary policy functions. Bessent argued that the Fed's responsibilities have expanded over the years without sufficient oversight, referencing the costly renovation of its headquarters as an example. He suggested that monetary policy decisions should remain independent, but a review of other operations could "right-size" the institution. This call for review comes amid ongoing criticism of the Fed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Coca-Cola's announcement to offer a cane sugar-sweetened soda, health experts are clarifying the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. Dietitians explain that while their chemical compositions vary slightly, both sweeteners have similar metabolic impacts and contribute equally to health issues like Type 2 diabetes and heart disease when consumed in excess. Both are considered "empty calories" and have a high glycemic index. The key takeaway from experts is that moderation is crucial, and limiting overall intake of all added sugars is more important than choosing one type over the other.</p>
