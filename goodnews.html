        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data from England's Department for Education reveals a strong correlation between missing school in the first week of the academic year and persistent absence later on. According to the figures, 57% of students who were partially absent during the initial week in September 2024 went on to miss at least 10% of the school year. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized that the start of the term is a critical period for establishing attendance habits, urging schools and parents to prioritize getting children into classrooms. This focus comes as schools continue to grapple with higher absenteeism rates than those seen before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is uniquely positioned to offer the world a new, pragmatic approach to international relations amid global dysfunction. As a leader of a major economic power that is not aligned with a single ideological bloc, Prabowo can act as a bridge between competing interests. The piece argues that his philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" could serve as a model for a new world order that prioritizes cooperation over confrontation. This approach is presented as a necessary corrective to an international system often paralyzed by vetoes and competing national agendas.</p>

          <p>Director Guillermo del Toro's long-awaited adaptation of 'Frankenstein' has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature. Del Toro described the project as a decades-long dream, emphasizing his desire to create a large-scale, visually rich world for the classic story. The film, which runs for 149 minutes, explores the narrative from the perspectives of both the creator and the creation, aiming to humanize the monster. Early reviews are mixed, with some critics praising its artistry and epic scope while others found it lacked emotional voltage.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, an article explores how revisiting the shared history of Sino-American cooperation during World War II could help improve current bilateral ties. It highlights forgotten stories of collaboration, such as the efforts of Chinese villagers who risked their lives to protect American airmen from the Japanese army. By focusing on this period of mutual support against a common enemy, the piece suggests that a foundation for better understanding and diplomacy can be built from the ground up. This historical perspective is presented as a potential antidote to the prevailing tensions between the two global powers.</p>

After her loss, Ostapenko accused Townsend of having "no education" and "no class," sparking controversy. In a statement, Ostapenko explained that English is not her native language and she was referring to what she perceived as poor tennis etiquette, not Townsend's general education. She acknowledged that her words could have been offensive and expressed her commitment to learning and growing as both a person and a player.</p>

          <p>A proposal to silence a town clock in Machynlleth, Wales, between midnight and 7:00 a.m. has been rejected by the local council. The request came from the owner of a nearby hotel, who cited frequent complaints from guests about the clock chiming every fifteen minutes throughout the night. However, councillors argued that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, a sentiment echoed by some local residents. The 150-year-old clock recently underwent a £55,000 restoration, and the hotel owner must now wait six months before submitting another proposal to address the noise concerns.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," continues to explore themes of frustrating romantic encounters, suggesting that fame has not improved her love life.

The album's sound, crafted with producer Jack Antonoff, blends '70s-era pop with modern influences. While some critics find it slightly less sharp than its predecessor, tracks like "Goodbye" and "House Tour" are praised for their witty lyrics and catchy production, solidifying Carpenter's signature style.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing cautious guidelines on screen time for children, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development. The consensus recommends a "screen-free until age three" approach, as the first years are critical for exploring the physical world and developing self-controlled attention. For older children, the concern is that screen time displaces crucial activities like social interaction, imaginative play, and motor skill development. While acknowledging the unrealistic nature of eliminating screens entirely, experts advise parents to supervise content, set clear rules, and prioritize real-world engagement to foster healthy growth.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish has made an immediate impact at Everton since joining on a season-long loan from Manchester City, earning man-of-the-match honors and registering two assists in a 3-2 win at Wolves.

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Wales, organized a rescue mission to move thousands of fish after a local waterway, Aberhafesp Brook, dried up due to prolonged drought conditions. A local man discovered the fish "gasping for air" in a shrinking puddle and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency Natural Resources Wales (NRW), rallied friends to help. The group successfully relocated numerous species, including salmon and trout, to a nearby river. NRW later stated that moving fish during extreme heat can cause more harm, but the resident who initiated the rescue felt it was better than leaving them to die.</p>
