          <h2>Chinese Researchers Develop Highly Resilient Aerogel for Advanced Aircraft Shielding</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:50:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from Zhejiang University in China has engineered a new type of aerogel with exceptional toughness and elasticity, potentially revolutionizing shielding for aircraft operating in extreme conditions. Traditional aerogels are excellent insulators but are mechanically fragile, limiting their application. The new method, which involves using graphene oxide, creates a unique internal dome-like cellular structure, resulting in a material that is both strong and lightweight. This innovative preparation technique can be adapted to hundreds of different formulations, opening up new possibilities for advanced material science.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank's shares surged over 9% after the company reported second-quarter profits that significantly beat analyst expectations, signaling it is on track to meet its full-year targets. The German lender posted a net profit of €1.485 billion, despite mixed results in its investment banking division and headwinds from a stronger euro. While revenue from fixed income and currencies was strong, the origination and advisory division saw a decline due to market uncertainty. The bank's leadership expressed confidence in its momentum and cost discipline moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Republican National Committee chairman Michael Whatley and former Democratic Governor Roy Cooper are both reportedly preparing to run for the U.S. Senate seat in North Carolina being vacated by Republican Thom Tillis. According to sources, Whatley's bid has received approval from the White House, while Cooper is expected to make his official announcement next week. This developing race is anticipated to be one of the most closely watched and competitive contests of the 2026 election cycle, setting the stage for a major political battle in the key swing state.</p>

          <p>Shares of apparel retailer American Eagle jumped significantly, becoming the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally driven by individual retail investors. The surge was fueled by discussions on social media forums like Reddit's Wall Street Bets, which targeted the stock due to its high short interest. The rally coincided with the company's announcement of a new marketing campaign for its denim line featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. This activity provided a boost to the company's stock, which had fallen approximately 35% year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn has officially announced the launch of a new political party, aiming to create a "real, democratic alternative" in British politics. In a joint statement with fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana, Corbyn criticized the current political system as "rigged" and called for a mass redistribution of wealth and power. The new party's platform is expected to include nationalizing key industries, building more council housing, and ending arms sales to Israel. This move could potentially draw left-leaning voters away from the Labour Party in future elections.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank held its key interest rate steady at 2%, pausing a series of cuts amidst significant economic uncertainty, particularly concerning trade negotiations between the EU and the United States. While inflation in the euro area has reached the bank's 2% target, officials cited geopolitical volatility as a key reason for the hold. ECB President Christine Lagarde stated that risks to economic growth are "tilted to the downside," but noted that a quick resolution to trade tensions could boost growth more than expected.

          <p>Authorities in Arizona have arrested a suspect in the 1984 murder and sexual assault of two teenagers in Northern California, solving the cold case after four decades. Roger Neil Schmidt Sr., 64, was identified using forensic genetic genealogy, which linked his DNA to evidence collected from the crime scene. The victims, Terrance Arndt and an unidentified female, were attacked in a parked car; Arndt was fatally shot, and the female victim was assaulted. The arrest brings long-awaited resolution to a case that Shasta County's sheriff said had "rocked the community for many years."</p>

          <p>A researcher who has studied thousands of cases of companies implementing a four-day, 32-hour workweek reports significant and sometimes unexpected benefits for both employees and businesses. Juliet Schor, a professor at Boston College, found that beyond improved work-life balance and reduced stress, employees reported feeling a major jump in their own productivity, which positively impacted their overall well-being. The research also showed that, contrary to expectations, the pace of work did not intensify, and employees did not use the extra day off for second jobs, indicating a successful reorganization of work.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the U.S. House to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of accessory dwelling units (ADUs), such as granny flats or backyard cottages. The legislation would authorize the FHA to insure second mortgages specifically for ADU construction and allow government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to purchase these loans. This aims to close a financing gap, as homeowners currently rely on cash or home equity loans, and could help increase housing supply amid a national shortage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a significantly reduced risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. Researchers argue this is a more realistic and evidence-based target for many people than the widely promoted but unscientific goal of 10,000 steps. The analysis of data from over 160,000 adults found that even modest increases in daily steps, from 2,000 to 4,000, were associated with better health outcomes, with benefits tending to level off after 7,000 steps for most conditions.</p>

          <p>In a return to monetary easing, Turkey's central bank cut its key interest rate by three percentage points to 43%, a larger reduction than markets had anticipated. This is the first rate cut since April and suggests the bank is confident in its progress on tackling the country's high inflation rate, which has been steadily decreasing. The central bank stated that its tight monetary policy stance will be maintained until price stability is achieved. Some analysts viewed the move as a dovish surprise, questioning if policy is tight enough to meet year-end inflation targets. (not investment advice)</p>
