          <p>Catherine Connolly has been elected as the 10th President of Ireland, securing a landslide victory with 63% of first preference votes, which marks the largest amount in Irish presidential election history. The independent candidate, supported by major left-wing parties, pledged in her acceptance speech to be an inclusive president for all citizens. Connolly, a 68-year-old TD from Galway, articulated her vision to be a strong voice for peace, uphold Ireland's policy of neutrality, and actively address the existential threat posed by climate change. Her primary rival, Heather Humphreys, graciously conceded defeat before the official declaration, acknowledging Connolly's resounding mandate and expressing her best wishes. The article highlights the president's significant role as head of state, representing the nation and ensuring constitutional adherence, despite having limited direct legislative powers.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United secured a dramatic 2-1 victory against Fulham at St James' Park, with captain Bruno Guimaraes scoring a late winner in the 90th minute. The Brazilian midfielder capitalized on a rebound from a substitute's shot, sending the home crowd into raptures and earning his team three vital points after a previously underwhelming 1-1 draw seemed imminent. Manager Eddie Howe praised the team's resilience and belief, noting the significant psychological impact of scoring late goals. Match of the Day pundit Michael Carrick highlighted Guimaraes's leadership and "talisman" quality, especially after his recent Champions League performance. This crucial win propelled Newcastle to 10th place, a significant boost for their season.</p>

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Misleading European Sexual Assault Statistics Comparison</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A viral bar chart claiming the UK is the "sexual assault capital of Europe" due to exponentially higher rates is debunked as misleading. The article explains that cross-national comparisons of sexual assault statistics are problematic due to vast differences in legal definitions, reporting practices, and cultural factors across countries. For instance, the UK's consent-based law and counting method (multiple offenses per perpetrator) inflate its reported figures compared to nations with narrower definitions. Criminologists advocate for victim surveys, rather than police reports, as a more accurate measure. The article also refutes claims linking higher rates to "uncontrolled mass immigration," citing a lack of evidence.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius recently participated in a reconnaissance flight over the North Atlantic, observing how P-8 Poseidon aircraft utilize highly sensitive radar and sonar to detect Russian submarines. Germany plans to acquire eight of these advanced airborne reconnaissance and surveillance systems, joining the UK, Norway, and the US in a collaborative NATO network. This network aims to monitor the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea from key air bases, addressing the significant increase in Russian submarine movements in recent years, which NATO officers describe as a strategic threat. The initiative is also intended to signal to Donald Trump that Europeans are taking greater responsibility for security, while assuring Vladimir Putin that his ships will always be found. The article highlights the broader goal of protecting critical infrastructure and enhancing the alliance's defense capabilities.</p>

          <p>A recent daylight robbery at the Louvre, where four masked thieves stole nine "priceless" pieces in under seven minutes, has captivated the internet, rapidly transforming into a meme phenomenon. The article highlights how the dramatic heist, compared to a Dan Brown novel, has become a template for viral content, with brands and influencers creating humorous ads and Halloween costumes. While authorities continue their investigation, recovering one damaged crown and analyzing forensic evidence, public fascination has shifted from the crime itself to its cultural interpretation. The museum's security failures are under scrutiny amidst questions about camera coverage.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has indicated an openness to another presidential run, stating unequivocally, "I am not done," during a wide-ranging interview with the BBC. Currently promoting her new book, "107 Days," which details her turbulent time as the 2024 Democratic nominee, Harris reflected on former President Joe Biden's last-minute withdrawal and her warnings about President Donald Trump's perceived authoritarian tendencies. While she didn't commit directly, she acknowledged a "possibly" for a future run, emphasizing her deep-seated commitment to a life of public service. However, recent CBS News polls in her home state of California suggest limited voter enthusiasm for her running in 2028, with Governor Gavin Newsom demonstrating stronger support among independents and even registered Democrats.</p>

          <p>The popular "VOO and chill" passive investing strategy, involving exchange-traded funds tied to market indexes like the S&P 500, may be losing its appeal among investors. Tidal Financial Group's Gavin Filmore notes clients are seeking diversification beyond index funds, which are increasingly imbalanced with technology accounting for over 35% of the S&P 500. Strategas Securities' Todd Sohn points out defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight. As a result, traders are showing renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban suggests that for the average person, practical savings through bulk shopping can be a more reliable "investment" than picking stocks. He highlights that saving 40% on household consumables like toilet paper and shampoo by buying in bulk can yield significant financial benefits, illustrating this with an example of $800 annual savings from a $2,000 spend. Cuban emphasizes that the smartest money move isn't always flashy stock market plays, but rather grounded, practical decisions. He also cautions against using credit cards for such purchases unless they can be paid off immediately, underscoring the importance of avoiding interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the historic removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, marking the largest project of its kind in US history, the river is rapidly rebounding and inspiring global restoration movements. Indigenous youth, who were the first to kayak the entire 310-mile length of the river in over a century, are now connecting with a revitalized ecosystem. Significant successes include coho salmon reaching farther upstream than in 60 years and Chinook salmon appearing in headwaters for the first time in over a century. Native seeds are blooming, and diverse wildlife is returning, demonstrating that large-scale environmental victories are achievable.

          <p>California's Proposition 50, which aims to redraw congressional district lines, is gaining significant support through a campaign strategy that leverages anti-Donald Trump sentiment among voters. Democrats are framing the initiative as a way to counteract Republican gerrymandering efforts in states like Texas, appealing to Californians who largely oppose Trump. Despite mixed feelings about suspending the state's non-partisan redistricting commission, recent polls show Proposition 50 passing by a wide margin, with a majority of "yes" voters motivated by opposition to Trump. The article suggests the emotional appeal of "screw Trump" is proving more effective than arguments about democratic process.</p>
