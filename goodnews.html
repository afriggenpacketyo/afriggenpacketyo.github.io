          <p>Roberto Minervini's new film, "The Damned," explores the Civil War through a naturalistic and observational lens, focusing on the dazed souls and uncertainties of the time. The film follows a group of volunteer soldiers in the U.S. Army, highlighting the minutiae of their military life with minimal combat. Minervini avoids traditional antiwar tropes, instead capturing the characters' internal struggles and the spiritual purgatory they inhabit. While the film has limitations due to its overdetermined nature, it subtly pinpoints the economic inequalities, brutality, and thwarted masculinity that continue to affect America.</p>
