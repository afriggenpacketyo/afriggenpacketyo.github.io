          <p>California has initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shrinking Salton Sea's shore, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds while controlling harmful dust. Water is being pumped into newly constructed basins, marking the state‚Äôs largest effort to address the sea's environmental issues. The $200-million Species Conservation Habitat Project, originally envisioned to cover 4,100 acres, is now planned for expansion to over 9,000 acres. The project aims to create lower-salinity habitats suitable for fish and birds, utilizing a mix of saltwater from the lake and freshwater from the New River. This initiative comes after years of delays and is seen as a crucial step in fulfilling the state's obligations to mitigate the environmental impacts of the Salton Sea's decline.</p>

          <p>Specialist mental health crisis centers will be opened across England over the next decade to reduce crowding in A&E departments. The clinics will be open to walk-in patients and referrals, with specialist staff to treat people in acute mental distress. NHS England said the centers would reduce overcrowding and relieve pressure on emergency services. Some experts are sceptical of the scheme's effectiveness, calling for better funding of NHS mental health services.</p>
