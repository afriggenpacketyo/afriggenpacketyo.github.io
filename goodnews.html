          <p>Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed on Friday, diverging from Wall Street trends as investors evaluated various economic data points. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix declined after Tokyo's core consumer prices rose at a slower pace in August, while South Korea's Kospi and Kosdaq also fell following the indictment of the nation's former first lady. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw gains. The upcoming meeting between Indian Prime Minister Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit is also a key focus for regional relations.</p>

This visit signals a potential thaw in relations, strained since the 2020 Galwan Valley clashes, as both nations face US tariffs. While experts are cautious about a long-lasting friendship due to deep-seated suspicions and border disputes, the meeting could foster reluctant cooperation on economic challenges. India seeks to address its widening trade deficit with China and reduce reliance on Chinese supplies for key industries.</p>

Founded in 2015, Innoscience specializes in gallium nitride (GaN) technology, a material crucial for efficient power electronics. In less than six years, Luo's company achieved a global first by mass-producing 8-inch silicon-based GaN wafers, positioning China at the forefront of third-generation semiconductor technology. This development is particularly significant as the United States pursues decoupling from China in cutting-edge chip technology, highlighting China's strategic advancements in a critical sector.</p>

          <p>Conservation scientists are studying the 800-year-old Druids Oak in Buckinghamshire, along with about 50 other ancient oaks across the UK, to unlock the secrets of their remarkable resilience. Researchers from The Woodland Trust and Arboricultural Association are analyzing the trees' DNA to understand how they live for over a millennium, resisting climate change and disease. The goal is to identify genes responsible for their longevity and survival in extreme conditions, using this knowledge to select the best oak trees for future planting. This initiative aims to restore Britain's depleted woodlands and support the diverse wildlife that depends on these vital ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Bev Johnson, known as "your girlfriend" to her listeners, celebrates 42 years as a host at WDIA, America's first all-Black radio station in Memphis. For over 75 years, WDIA has served as a vital community lifeline, providing news on issues like police brutality and civil rights activism that mainstream outlets ignored. The station also promoted Black-owned businesses and organized charity drives, famously spearheading efforts to save the Lorraine Motel, now the National Civil Rights Museum. Johnson continues this legacy, offering critical information from local experts to a community where one in five people live below the poverty line.</p>

Health minister Stephen Kinnock highlighted the vaccine's role in empowering parents and prioritizing children's health.

          <p>Naomi Osaka has reached the third round of the US Open with an efficient win, demonstrating strong recovery after a disappointing Montreal final where she faced criticism for not congratulating her opponent. Osaka, who returned from maternity leave in January 2024, described feeling "shame" after the Montreal incident, but has since won eight of her last nine matches under a new coach. Her improved performance and clean striking of the ball signal a positive trajectory, setting her up for a potential deep run in the tournament, her first Grand Slam fourth-round appearance since winning the Australian Open in 2021.</p>
