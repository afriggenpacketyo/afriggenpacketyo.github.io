          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant rally, climbing to within 1% of its all-time high as the U.S. government shutdown continued into its third day. Investors are reportedly turning to the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset amid rising concerns over U.S. government stability and financial risks. Analysts suggest the digital asset's recent gains are directly tied to the political turmoil in Washington, with some forecasting that Bitcoin could soon surpass its previous record price and reach new heights.

        </div>

          <p>This article offers crucial advice for individuals contacted by a debt collector, emphasizing that one should not rush to pay without taking protective steps first. Experts recommend a three-part strategy: first, formally request written validation to confirm the debt is legitimate and that the collector legally owns it. Second, carefully weigh all options, such as negotiating a lower settlement or a payment plan. Finally, ensure any agreement is documented in writing before any money is exchanged to prevent future disputes.</p>

          <p>A recent decline in mortgage rates to just over 6.3% is providing substantial financial relief for prospective homebuyers. For a typical $800,000 mortgage, this drop translates to a monthly payment savings of approximately $312 compared to the rates seen at the start of the year. The article highlights how even a seemingly small percentage point decrease can lead to significant long-term savings, potentially totaling over $112,000 over the life of a 30-year loan, making homeownership more accessible.

          <p>The price gap between used electric vehicles and their gasoline-powered counterparts has shrunk to a record low, prompting analysts to forecast a surge in their popularity. A significant number of EVs returning to the market after their leases end is boosting supply and driving down prices, making them an affordable option for mainstream consumers for the first time. Even with the expiration of a federal tax credit, this trend of increasing affordability is expected to make 2026 a breakout "year of the used EV." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his first speech as leader of the UK's Green Party, Zack Polanski called for a new tax on the assets of the wealthiest 1% to fund a range of public services and end what he termed "rip-off Britain." He argued that the revenue generated could pay for universal free childcare, special needs education, and improved rural bus routes. Polanski also positioned his party as a staunch defender of migrants and refugees, while accusing the opposition Labour Party of capitulating to the right-wing agenda of Reform UK.</p>

          <p>Sales of all-electric vehicles in the U.S. have reached a new record, surpassing one million units in the first nine months of the year and capturing a 10.5% market share in the third quarter.

While Tesla continues to lead the market, General Motors has made significant gains, securing the second-largest share as legacy automakers expand their EV offerings and challenge Tesla's dominance.
