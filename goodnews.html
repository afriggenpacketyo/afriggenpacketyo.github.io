          <p>Bernie Sanders argues that the Democratic Party lacks a compelling message for working-class people, criticizing their incremental approach to change. He believes Trumpism taps into the understanding that the system is not working for many Americans, albeit with flawed solutions. Sanders highlights the growing wealth inequality in the U.S., where the richest thrive while a majority of people live paycheck to paycheck. He advocates for policies that take on the billionaire class, ensure healthcare for all, and address the housing crisis, arguing that the Democrats' failure to articulate these issues weakens their credibility.</p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has achieved a 3:1 resonant orbit, synchronizing with the motion of the Earth and Moon, which is considered a significant advancement for lunar infrastructure. The Deep Space Exploration Laboratory claims this makes Tiandu-1 the first spacecraft to achieve such a trajectory. However, experts in the U.S. and Canada have challenged this assertion, citing NASA‚Äôs Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011. While Tiandu-1's achievement is notable, its claim as the first to achieve this orbit is debatable.</p>

          <p>The Okhotsk Tokkari Center in Mombetsu, Hokkaido, Japan's only seal sanctuary, rescues and rehabilitates injured or weakened seals with the goal of releasing them back into the wild. Staff members intentionally avoid naming or having close contact with the seals to minimize emotional attachment, though bonds inevitably form. The center has successfully rescued and released over 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s, initially addressing concerns about seals harming the fishing industry. The sanctuary faces challenges such as declining seal populations and habitat loss due to receding drift ice, emphasizing the importance of their conservation efforts.</p>
