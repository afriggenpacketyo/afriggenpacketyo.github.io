          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible damage to oceans. The proposal follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the harmful impacts of bottom trawling on marine life and the seabed. This initiative, subject to a 12-week consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and their habitats. </p>
