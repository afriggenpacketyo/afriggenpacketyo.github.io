          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to extend the deadline for countries to reach trade deals with the United States, though he expressed confidence that it wouldn't be necessary. He mentioned that his administration would soon send letters to about 15 countries outlining the terms of potential deals. These remarks were made ahead of attending a performance of "Les Mis√©rables" at the Kennedy Center in Washington. Trump also highlighted ongoing trade talks with countries like Japan and South Korea, while emphasizing his intention to set unilateral tariff rates if agreements aren't reached.

          <p>Chinese court astronomers in 1408 recorded details of a dying star's explosion, describing it as being about the size of a cup-shaped oil lamp with a pure yellow color. The observation was documented in a formal report to Emperor Yongle, interpreting the event as a heavenly endorsement of his reign. The report noted the star remained stationary and calm over 10 days of measurement and observation, confirming the phenomenon was a nova. This rediscovered memorial settles a long-standing debate among modern astronomers about the true nature of the 1408 event, with the unprecedented details helping narrow down the star‚Äôs possible position.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the United States could extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if they continue negotiating in good faith. He stated that the administration has been in talks with 18 important trading partners, including Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. President Trump also indicated he might extend the pause, but doesn't think it will be necessary. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs under the reciprocal scheme, but not the baseline duty of 10 percent targeting imports from all parts of the world. (not investment advice)</p>

Combined with the city‚Äôs vast offshore yuan holdings and China‚Äôs restricted use of cryptocurrencies, the law has fueled hopes that Hong Kong could rival US dollar-backed tokens like Tether‚Äôs USDT and Circle‚Äôs USDC.

          <p>Scientists have discovered a new dinosaur species, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis, that they say rewrites the evolutionary history of tyrannosaurs. The two 86 million-year-old skeletons, found in a Mongolian museum, represent the closest known ancestor of all tyrannosaurs, including T. rex. This discovery helps to understand how tyrannosaurs evolved into powerful predators that terrorized North America and Asia. The new species exhibits early evolutionary stages of features key to tyrannosaurs' tyranny, including skull anatomy that gave it a strong jaw.</p>
