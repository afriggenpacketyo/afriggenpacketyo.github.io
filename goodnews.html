          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing a plan to take a 10% equity stake in Intel, potentially making the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. The proposal involves converting some of the billions in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company equity. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and establish national champions in strategic sectors, though it remains uncertain if the plan will proceed.

It dismisses the likelihood of artificially induced wet races, citing the sport's preference for maintaining purity over gimmicks. The discussion also explores the aesthetics of F1 cars, naming the 1990 Ferrari 641 as a standout, and explains the technical reasons why a car's performance can differ significantly between one-lap qualifying and a full-length race, primarily due to tire degradation.</p>

The 1943 artwork, which had been in private hands, was at risk of being exported from the UK. The acquisition was made possible by over 2,800 public donations and major grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund, ensuring it will remain on public display in the artist's home city.</p>
