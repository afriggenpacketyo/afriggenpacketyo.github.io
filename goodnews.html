          <p>Nvidia's announcement of a $100 billion investment into OpenAI has triggered a significant rally in global semiconductor stocks, reflecting strong investor confidence in the artificial intelligence sector. The deal, which involves building massive AI data center infrastructure, boosted shares of key suppliers like Taiwan's TSMC and South Korea's SK Hynix. While some European equipment suppliers saw mixed results, analysts noted the news reinforces that the AI trade is robust and not a zero-sum game, benefiting a wide range of companies.

          <p>Hurricane Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 4 storm, making it the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. While it is not expected to make landfall, the National Hurricane Center has warned that its powerful swells will generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda for several days. The storm is currently tracking northeast, further out into the Atlantic Ocean, posing no direct threat to land amidst a quieter-than-predicted hurricane season.</p>

A second system further west has a 50% chance of development and could bring gusty winds to the Leeward Islands.

          <p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has raised its forecast for global economic growth in 2025 to 3.2%, citing greater-than-expected resilience, particularly in emerging markets. The U.S. growth forecast was also lifted to 1.8%, supported by strong AI-related investment. However, the OECD warns of significant risks ahead, including high policy uncertainty and the escalating impact of U.S. tariffs, which have reached their highest effective rate since 1933 and are beginning to affect consumer prices.

          <p>Following President Trump's claims, this article explains why the scientific consensus does not support a causal link between Tylenol (acetaminophen) use during pregnancy and autism. Experts state that autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder linked to polygenetic risks, meaning hundreds of gene variants, not a single medication, are involved. The rising number of autism diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness and broader diagnostic criteria, while past theories linking the condition to vaccines have been thoroughly and repeatedly disproven by extensive research.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England is launching a new initiative called "Jess's Rule," urging general practitioners to reconsider a patient's diagnosis if their symptoms persist or worsen after three visits. The rule is named after Jessica Brady, a 27-year-old who died from advanced cancer in 2020 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid. This guidance aims to improve patient safety by prompting doctors to conduct further tests, seek second opinions, or make specialist referrals to catch serious illnesses earlier.</p>

His visionary leadership transformed the event, culminating in a landmark win at The Belfry that revitalized the Ryder Cup and set the stage for decades of intense competition.</p>
