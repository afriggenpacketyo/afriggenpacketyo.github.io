          <p>UK newspapers are leading with stories about a new ¬£5bn trade deal between India and the UK, which has sparked criticism from Conservative and Reform parties due to its "two-tier" tax implications for Indian migrants. The government defends the deal, citing similar agreements with the US and EU. Other headlines highlight "Labour turmoil" over Keir Starmer's decision to cut winter fuel payments for OAPs, a move that has drawn criticism from Labour MPs. The Financial Times reports on Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's stance against US President Trump, while The Guardian covers Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich's controversial comments on Gaza.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has claimed that his administration has attracted nearly $9 trillion in new investments to the U.S., a figure that lacks supporting evidence. While the White House cited approximately $5 trillion in investments in Trump's first 100 days, some of these projects were announced before his term. The administration's comparisons to the Biden era are misleading, as Trump cites future investment pledges while contrasting them with a narrower list of projects completed under Biden. Experts caution that announcements about planned investments do not guarantee action, and it's too early to attribute new investments directly to Trump's policies.</p>

          <p>As cardinals prepare to elect the next Pope following the death of Pope Francis, deep divisions within the Catholic Church are becoming apparent. Pope Francis's 12-year tenure, marked by efforts to shift the Church's focus towards the poor and marginalized, has sparked both support and criticism. The upcoming conclave is the most diverse in history, reflecting Francis's appointments of cardinals from around the world, but differing priorities among regions, such as declining congregations in Europe versus social issues in Africa and Asia, complicate the selection process. The new Pope will need to balance spiritual leadership with global influence and address internal challenges such as sexual abuse and financial corruption.</p>

          <p>Ross Douthat's New York Times newsletter discusses ‚ÄúYour Friends & Neighbors,‚Äù a new Apple TV show starring Jon Hamm as a New York City moneyman who resorts to thievery after losing his job. Douthat notes that the show eliminates any sense of aspirational identification from its portrayal of affluent life in Connecticut, depicting characters as unhappy and insecure despite their wealth. The show functions as a reassuring response to meritocratic status anxiety by portraying its rich world as a place where unhappiness is only magnified and financial security is still an illusion. Douthat questions whether this is an accurate depiction of contemporary wealthy life.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive beat Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter but negatively adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries and capital spending, citing tariff pressures. The electric vehicle manufacturer is expected to incur additional expenses due to tariffs, including a 25% tariff on imported auto parts. The company's new guidance includes deliveries of 40,000 to 46,000 units and capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, while reaffirming plans to achieve a positive gross profit this year.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted an amicable tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, despite previously suggesting the annexation of Canada. While Trump expressed his affection for Canada, Carney firmly stated that Canada would never be for sale. The meeting, which should have been routine, was freighted with awkwardness due to Trump's previous rhetoric, leading him to avoid directly addressing the complications and instead discussing unrelated topics.</p>

          <p>Newly elected Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney experienced President Trump's unpredictable behavior during his first visit to the Oval Office, where Trump has transformed routine meetings into precarious affairs. Trump joked about annexing Canada, prompting Carney to firmly declare that Canada is not for sale. The meeting exemplified how Trump's approach to international relations can force foreign leaders to navigate between placating or confronting the American president.</p>
