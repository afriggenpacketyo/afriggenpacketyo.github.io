          <p>A new book argues that Apple made a strategic error by consolidating its operations so heavily in China, effectively becoming trapped by the authoritarian state. However, some analysts discussed at a think tank event counter this view, suggesting the tech giant likely had no better alternative to achieve its current scale and innovation. They argue that missing out on China's production ecosystem would have prevented Apple from becoming the company it is today, highlighting the complex and perhaps unavoidable nature of its strategic choices.</p>

The ruling is stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal, but if it holds, it would require the administration to resume processing asylum claims.</p>
