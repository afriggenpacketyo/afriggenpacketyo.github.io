The article highlights the dilemma faced by individuals, such as a Guangzhou engineer who sold early and missed further gains, on whether to buy, sell, or hold their gold assets amidst the volatile rally. This see-saw sentiment is also reflected in retail stores, where shoppers display considerable hesitation due to the unprecedented price levels.

          <p>A federal judge temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to federalize and deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, citing insufficient violence to justify the action without the governor's approval. U.S. District Judge Karin Immergut ruled that Trump's determination of chaos was "untethered to the facts" and warned against blurring the fundamental line between civil and military rule, emphasizing the nation's tradition of resistance to government overreach. Oregon officials, including Governor Tina Kotek and Attorney General Dan Rayfield, hailed the decision as a victory for state sovereignty and a "wake-up call" for the president. This article highlights a significant legal challenge to federal authority, affirming the protection of constitutional principles regarding military intervention in domestic affairs and local control.</p>

          <p>The previously winless UCLA Bruins football team achieved a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, largely attributed to interim playcaller Jerry Neuheisel's innovative offensive plan. Elevated just four days before the game, Neuheisel inspired an offense that scored on its first five drives, with quarterback Nico Iamaleava delivering a career-best performance, accounting for five touchdowns. The article highlights the team's renewed belief and aggressive strategy, which included a successful onside kick. This improbable win, the first against a top-10 team since 2007, marked a dramatic turnaround for a team that had been nationally lampooned, bringing jubilant celebration and hope for the remainder of their season.</p>
