          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen topped Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, setting the fastest time ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc. His title rivals, McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri, struggled significantly, with Piastri notably off the pace on both short and long runs. Despite Norris handing his car over to a rookie for part of the session, McLaren's overall pace was not comparable to Red Bull's on soft tires. Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli also demonstrated strong long-run pace, while Verstappen himself complained of a lack of grip, describing the car as "driving on ice," indicating challenges even for the fastest driver.</p>

          <p>As clocks go back, many in the UK, especially in northern regions with significantly less daylight, experience Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). Symptoms include low mood, irritability, and decreased energy, affecting over a million people. The article highlights initiatives like "Wintering Well" boxes in Orkney, offering therapeutic lamps and activity guides to encourage outdoor life and positive "light routines." Experts suggest adopting Scandinavian attitudes towards winter by embracing outdoor activities and creating cosy interior light environments to combat the effects of reduced daylight, emphasizing that even short periods outside can boost mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. MPs argue that such a reduction is unlikely to achieve the goal of promoting an investment culture in the UK, a long-term ambition of the chancellor. Reeves had previously mulled reducing the cash ISA limit to £10,000 to encourage stock and shares investments, but faced strong opposition from banks and consumer campaigners. The committee emphasizes that while fostering an investment culture is good, this is not the right time for such a cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Debate Arises Over Manual vs. Automatic Driving Skills in the UK</h2>

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in UK driving, with automatics now comprising one-third of cars and a quarter of driving tests, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol/diesel cars and the rise of electric vehicles. This trend presents a dilemma for new drivers: learn manual for versatility or automatic for perceived ease, though many face limited access to automatic instructors or higher lesson costs. Despite a common misconception, manual tests actually have a higher pass rate. Experts emphasize that essential driving skills remain paramount regardless of transmission type, and the stigma around automatic-only licenses is diminishing.</p>

          <p>Vote counting for the Irish presidential election is set to begin Saturday morning, with results expected later that evening, determining who will replace current head of state Michael D Higgins. Voters had a choice of three candidates, but the race is primarily between independent Catherine Connolly, backed by left-wing parties, and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys. Early unofficial indications suggest a potentially low turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the last presidential election in 2018. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew from the campaign too late for his name to be removed from the ballot paper.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has ruled that UCLA must publicly release the Trump administration's $1.2 billion settlement proposal, a victory for faculty seeking transparency. The 28-page document outlines federal demands for policy changes at UCLA concerning antisemitism complaints, admissions practices, and gender identity on campus. UCLA had argued that disclosure would harm negotiations, but faculty leaders, who intend to distribute the document publicly, contend it is a matter of public interest. The proposal includes controversial demands like preventing "anti-Western" international students and banning gender-affirming healthcare for minors, prompting concerns about academic freedom and institutional values.</p>
