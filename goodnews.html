          <p>The village of Chimney Rock, North Carolina, is still struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene, which brought mudslides and flash flooding that devastated the town. Eight months after the disaster, the tourist town is not ready to welcome summer visitors, endangering the local economy. Residents like Theresa and Glenn Cauthren have had to move into their hotel, the Chimney Rock Inn, which lacks running water and sanitation, as their home was filled with mud. The remote location and geography of Chimney Rock have made recovery efforts slower and more expensive, leaving residents grappling with the stark contrast between their situation and the normalcy in nearby cities. Despite these challenges, the community remains resilient and determined to rebuild and come back stronger than ever. </p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, shifting production of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox from Mexico to the U.S. This move is influenced by President Trump's implementation of tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts. The investment will convert an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks by 2027, potentially creating more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S. GM CEO Mary Barra stated that the company is committed to American innovation and manufacturing expertise, aiming to provide customers with a broad range of vehicle choices. </p>

          <p>Drug-related deaths among young people in the U.S. are declining at an unprecedented rate, potentially saving thousands of lives annually. This trend follows a decade in which fentanyl and other street drugs claimed over 230,000 lives under the age of 35. The reasons behind this drop are being examined, particularly in light of potential federal funding cuts that could impact the progress made. The decrease offers a glimmer of hope in the ongoing battle against opioid addiction and overdose deaths, though sustaining this positive trend will require continued effort and resources. </p>

          <p>The Atlantic argues that the recent demonstrations in Los Angeles against immigration enforcement operations signal the start of a broader mass movement against the Trump administration. While some worry about the potential for violence or missteps that could give Trump an excuse to overreach, the article emphasizes the historical effectiveness of large protests. The author contends that Trump's decision to deploy the military demonstrates his vulnerability and that suppressing dissent only benefits him. Drawing parallels to past instances where public opposition swayed Trump's policies, the piece suggests that these protests can shape public opinion and hold the administration accountable. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's stock has largely recovered after a feud between Elon Musk and President Trump caused a significant drop in market capitalization. The rebound was fueled by Musk's demonstration of Tesla's driverless vehicles operating on public roads in Austin, Texas, without a safety driver. Tesla is expected to launch a limited "pilot" program for its robotaxi service in Austin, using the Model Y with an "unsupervised" version of its Full Self-Driving technology. Despite past delays and unfulfilled promises, this development suggests Tesla is finally making progress in the robotaxi market, though analysts caution against excessive optimism regarding the safety and cost-effectiveness of the technology. </p>

The Switch 2 includes a new chat feature enhanced by an optional camera, with a free roam mode to explore and the console can support mouse controls.

          <p>The Atlantic argues that in an era dominated by AI-generated content, good taste is more critical than ever. Taste, defined as judgment with style, is the ability to discern what should be done, not just what can be done. It's cultivated through exposure, curation, and reflection, and involves ethical dimensions that AI lacks. As AI proliferates outputs across industries, the person who knows which option to choose becomes increasingly valuable. The article emphasizes the need to develop taste in education and leadership to make the right choices in the AI era. </p>
