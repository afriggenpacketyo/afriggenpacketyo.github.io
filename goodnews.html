          <p>A growing number of large, historic "trophy" ranches in the American West are being put on the market for the first time in generations. High-end real estate brokers report that as families expand and heirs become geographically scattered or disagree on the properties' future, many are choosing to sell. The demand for these sprawling estates remains high, partly due to the "Yellowstone" effect, with wealthy buyers seeking privacy and a rural lifestyle. While sellers gain a financial windfall, the trend marks the end of long-held family legacies on these unique properties.</p>

          <p>The American Gaming Association estimates that a record $30 billion will be legally wagered on the upcoming NFL season, an 8.5% increase from the previous year. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings are preparing for their busiest period, facing increased competition from rivals and new market entrants. A significant challenge for the legal market remains the prevalence of unlicensed offshore sportsbooks. In response, state and city prosecutors are increasing enforcement actions against these illegal operations to reclaim lost tax revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

The sessions were eventful, featuring spins from Lewis Hamilton and crashes involving Lance Stroll and Alex Albon.

          <p>According to multiple sources, Republican Senator Joni Ernst of Iowa has privately indicated she will not run for a third term in 2026 and plans to make a formal announcement next week. Ernst, who has served in the Senate since 2015 and is a member of the GOP leadership, has reportedly told confidantes she intended to serve only two terms before moving to the private sector. Her departure would add to a growing list of Republican senators not seeking reelection, opening up a key seat that Democrats are already targeting.</p>

          <p>Shares in Alibaba climbed significantly after the company reported better-than-expected profits for the June quarter, driven by accelerated growth in its cloud computing unit. Revenue for the cloud division grew 26% year-over-year, largely fueled by robust demand for AI-related products, which have seen triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts and profits in the core e-commerce division fell due to heavy investment in "quick commerce," investors responded positively to the strong performance and future potential of the company's AI and cloud businesses.

          <p>Shares of "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue.

          <p>Philadelphia Phillies' designated hitter Kyle Schwarber had a historic night, becoming the 21st player in major league history to hit four home runs in a single game. The feat occurred during a 19-4 victory over the Atlanta Braves. Schwarber even had an opportunity to hit a fifth home run, a feat no player has ever accomplished, but he popped out in his final at-bat. His final plate appearance was against a position player, infielder Vidal Bruján, which averted a potential controversy had the record-breaking homer come against a non-pitcher.</p>

          <p>Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has evolved into a significant tool for India's global soft power and cultural diplomacy. Spearheaded by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, the establishment of the International Day of Yoga has helped position the practice as a symbol of Indian cultural identity worldwide. This promotion is seen as a non-controversial way to build people-to-people ties and enhance India's influence as a civilizational force. However, the article also notes criticisms regarding the over-commercialization and cultural appropriation of yoga in the West.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, a key inflation gauge for the Federal Reserve, showed prices rose at a 2.6% annual rate in July, unchanged from June. However, core inflation, which excludes food and energy, edged up to 2.9%, its highest level since February. The report also indicated that consumer spending remains robust, increasing by 0.5%, the largest jump since March. These figures suggest that while overall inflation has cooled, persistent underlying price pressures may lead the Fed to proceed cautiously with any potential interest rate cuts.

          <p>Crystal Palace is reportedly working to sign two new central defenders before the transfer deadline, a move that could facilitate defender Marc Guehi's potential transfer to Liverpool. The Premier League champions have been in talks for a £35 million deal for the England international, who has indicated he will not sign a new contract with Palace. While Palace manager Oliver Glasner publicly insists Guehi must stay, the club is reluctant to lose him on a free transfer next summer. Palace is reportedly in advanced talks for Toulouse's Jaydee Canvot and is also seeking an experienced defender.</p>

          <p>The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is tracking a tropical wave that is expected to emerge from the west coast of Africa by the end of the weekend. Forecasters indicate that environmental conditions may support slow development of the system as it moves westward across the Atlantic next week. While it is far too early to determine if the system will strengthen into a named storm or what its eventual path might be, it is the only system currently being monitored for potential development. The Atlantic has been uncharacteristically calm, with no named storms expected over the Labor Day weekend.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of the Interior has drafted a proposal to expand its list of critical minerals, adding 51 commodities including copper, lead, and silicon. This strategic list guides government investment, tax incentives, and permitting decisions to secure supply chains for national security and economic stability. The expansion aims to reduce reliance on foreign sources, particularly China, and encourage domestic production for key industries like semiconductors, automotive manufacturing, and solar panels. The move is intended to mitigate risks from potential geopolitical disputes or other overseas supply disruptions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Defender Trent Alexander-Arnold has been dropped from the latest England squad for the upcoming World Cup qualifiers, compounding a difficult start to his career at Real Madrid. England coach Thomas Tuchel, who has previously expressed reservations about Alexander-Arnold's defensive abilities, opted for other players in the right-back position. This exclusion from the national team comes as Alexander-Arnold is also fighting for a starting spot at his new club. The decision raises questions about his role in England's plans for the World Cup.</p>
