          <p>Jake Paul, the social media influencer turned professional boxer, has officially been ranked by the World Boxing Association (WBA) as the No. 14 cruiserweight contender. This ranking makes him eligible to compete for a world championship title, a significant milestone in his controversial boxing career. The development follows his recent unanimous decision victory over former middleweight champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr., his most accomplished opponent to date. Paul has expressed his ambition to become a world champion and has already engaged in a staredown with current WBA champion Gilberto 'Zurdo' Ram√≠rez, suggesting a future title bout could be on the horizon.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman, is expected to plead guilty to U.S. drug trafficking and money laundering charges, according to recent court filings. Prosecutors allege that Guzman Lopez and his brother ran the 'Chapitos' faction of the Sinaloa cartel, a notoriously violent group responsible for exporting fentanyl into the United States. He was arrested in Mexico in 2023 and subsequently extradited to face charges in federal court in Chicago. This plea would mark a significant development in the U.S. government's efforts to dismantle the powerful cartel's leadership structure following his father's life sentence.</p>

          <p>Figma, the popular collaborative design software company, has officially filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and plans to trade on the NYSE under the ticker 'FIG'. The move is highly anticipated, especially after a $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated last year due to regulatory hurdles, resulting in a $1 billion fee paid to Figma. The company's prospectus reveals strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and a growing base of high-value customers. CEO Dylan Field stated the decision to go public is intended to allow the company's community to share in its ownership and to facilitate 'big swings,' including future acquisitions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks reveals that Microsoft, Nvidia, and Meta significantly outperformed their peers in the first half of the year, each reaching all-time highs. Microsoft's strong performance was driven by better-than-expected growth in its Azure cloud computing division. Nvidia maintained its market leadership, rallying from a slow start due to sustained high demand for its unrivaled AI chips. Meanwhile, Meta's stock surged following quarterly earnings that blew past estimates, underscoring the strength and effectiveness of its advertising business. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real Madrid's decision to pay a substantial fee for Trent Alexander-Arnold, just before he could have signed for free, is already paying dividends. The right-back provided a crucial assist in the Club World Cup, which alone was worth an extra ¬£10 million for the club, more than covering his transfer cost. The move has allowed him to acclimate to his new team and coach Xabi Alonso's tactical system ahead of the regular season. While questions about his defensive work remain, his attacking prowess and crossing ability are already proving to be valuable assets, with teammates and pundits praising his quality and potential fit with the Spanish giants.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California has passed a significant overhaul of the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a landmark 1970 environmental law, in an effort to spur housing development. The reforms, championed by Governor Gavin Newsom, will waive CEQA requirements for most low- and mid-rise housing projects in urban areas already zoned for multifamily use. This change aims to eliminate lengthy environmental studies and the threat of lawsuits that have historically delayed or blocked construction. While developers and housing advocates have praised the move as a 'seismic shift,' it removes a key point of leverage that community and labor groups have used to influence development.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic successfully advanced to the second round of Wimbledon, but not without overcoming physical difficulties during his four-set victory over Alexandre Muller. Djokovic reported stomach issues early in the third set but recovered after a medical timeout to secure the win. In a major upset, third-seeded Alexander Zverev was knocked out of the tournament by Frenchman Arthur Rinderknech in a grueling five-set match. The early rounds have seen several top-ranked players eliminated, setting the stage for an unpredictable tournament as top contenders like Jannik Sinner move forward.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos, the founder and executive chairman of Amazon, has sold more than 3.3 million shares of the company, valued at approximately $737 million. The transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan that was adopted in March, which allows for the sale of up to 25 million shares through May 2026. Bezos, who remains Amazon's largest individual shareholder, has regularly sold stock in recent years to fund other ventures, including his space exploration company, Blue Origin, and his philanthropic educational initiatives. The sale was disclosed in a financial filing shortly after his highly publicized wedding celebration in Venice.</p>
