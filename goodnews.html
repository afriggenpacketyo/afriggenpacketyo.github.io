        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The demand for protein has dramatically increased, fueled by social media influencers, transforming it into a $114 billion industry. Despite protein being a crucial nutrient for health, dietitians caution that current wellness trends often exaggerate the amount most people truly need. They advocate for obtaining protein primarily from whole foods, highlighting that recent Consumer Reports testing found unsafe lead levels in over two-thirds of tested protein powders. While supplements can benefit competitive athletes or individuals with specific medical conditions, general consumers should limit their intake, prioritizing nutrient-rich whole foods for better satiety and broader nutritional benefits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has announced a significant reduction in the cost of in vitro fertilization (IVF) drugs, attributing the change to his administration's price negotiations. He stated that the per-cycle cost of these essential drugs is projected to decrease by an estimated 73% for American consumers. Biopharmaceutical company EMD Serono has agreed to provide substantial discounts, including an 84% reduction from list prices for its fertility drugs like Gonal-f. Although this initiative aims to make IVF more accessible, the article points out that it does not fulfill Trump's earlier promise of full IVF coverage and that the overall cost of an IVF cycle, which includes various medical fees beyond just drugs, will not see an equivalent percentage drop.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced plans to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest to discuss a resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war, following a "lengthy" phone call between them. High-level US and Russian advisors, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio leading the American delegation, are slated to meet next week to prepare for the summit. This diplomatic initiative is notable as it precedes Trump's scheduled meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House. The article also mentions First Lady Melania Trump's involvement in efforts to reunite Ukrainian children with their families, a point Putin reportedly appreciated, indicating multiple facets to the ongoing international dialogue.</p>

          <p>Indianapolis Colts linebacker Zaire Franklin voiced strong support for Detroit Lions safety Brian Branch, who received a one-game suspension for an altercation with Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster after a recent game. Franklin controversially stated that Smith-Schuster "needed his a-- whooped," accusing him of "sneaky" and "childish" on-field tactics. Branch, while admitting his actions were immature, expressed frustration over unaddressed in-play bullying. The incident, which involved Branch slapping Smith-Schuster and pulling off his helmet, was condemned by Lions head coach Dan Campbell, who apologized to the Chiefs. This article underscores the passionate and sometimes volatile nature of professional sports rivalries.</p>

          <h2>German Parliament Debates Reintroduction of Voluntary Military Service with Future Mandatory Component</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's Bundestag parliament has commenced its first reading of a contentious bill aimed at reintroducing some form of military service, initially on a voluntary basis, with provisions for a mandatory component if necessary. This legislation seeks to modernize the Bundeswehr and significantly increase its personnel to 460,000 by 2035, a goal spurred by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius emphasized the democratic nature of the debate, clarifying that any future decision on obligatory recruitment would require a distinct Bundestag resolution. The current proposal mandates a questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, but the coalition government faces internal disagreements and public protests from conscientious objector groups regarding the implementation and scope of mandatory service.</p>

          <p>EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen concluded a three-day tour of the Western Balkans, urging states like Serbia to accelerate reforms in rule of law, electoral frameworks, and media freedom for EU accession. While praising Montenegro as a frontrunner for potential 2028 entry, she publicly criticized Serbia's pro-Russian stance and increasingly authoritarian government, which faces ongoing protests and repression. Von der Leyen also pressed Serbia to align with EU sanctions against Russia. The visit aimed to promote economic integration with a €6 billion funding plan, but also highlighted geopolitical considerations, as nationalist divisions in Kosovo and Bosnia and Herzegovina offer opportunities for Russian influence, emphasizing that the EU will not lower accession criteria.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma's new schools chief, Lindel Fields, has reversed his predecessor Ryan Walters' controversial plan to incorporate the Bible into the state's educational curriculum. Fields, appointed by Gov. Kevin Stitt after Walters resigned to join a conservative group, stated he has "no plans to distribute Bibles or a Biblical character education curriculum in classrooms." He also intends to dismiss ongoing litigation against the policy, which had been temporarily blocked by the Oklahoma Supreme Court. Walters, known for pushing a far-right agenda, had previously sought to place 55,000 Bibles in public schools and require a video of him praying for Donald Trump, drawing significant criticism from church-state separation advocates.</p>

          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune declared his intention to push forward a bipartisan bill imposing new sanctions on Russia, asserting that "the time has come" for such action. This announcement followed President Trump's recent call with Vladimir Putin, where a future meeting to discuss the Ukraine war was agreed upon. The proposed legislation, which boasts overwhelming support from 85 senators, seeks to intensify economic pressure on Russia to halt its aggression in Ukraine. Although the bill had faced delays due to other international crises and White House requests for more flexibility, Thune anticipates an updated version, including a 500% tariff on imports from countries purchasing Russian energy, will be introduced shortly, indicating a renewed legislative commitment to confront Russia.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies which types of debts typically do not qualify for traditional debt settlement programs, which aim to reduce balances by 30-50%. Debts fall into two main excluded categories: those backed by government authority and those secured by collateral. Secured debts like mortgages and auto loans are excluded because lenders can repossess assets. Federal student loans and tax debts are generally ineligible due to government-specific repayment and settlement options. Additionally, domestic support obligations such as child support and alimony, along with court fines and criminal restitution, cannot be negotiated down. For these excluded debts, alternative solutions like bankruptcy or specialized government programs may be more appropriate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates for a 30-year mortgage have dropped again to 6.27%, reaching their lowest in about a month, offering new opportunities for homebuyers. However, the article advises strategic action due to the unique market climate influenced by inflation and economic policies. Homebuyers should get pre-approved to understand their loan capacity and demonstrate seriousness to sellers. They should avoid assuming rates will continue to fall, as market conditions can change, and instead act if current rates are affordable. Aggressive home hunting is recommended, but buyers should anticipate increased competition as lower rates attract more demand, challenging conventional seasonal homebuying trends.
