          <p>UK newspapers prominently featured President Trump's state visit, displaying photos from the Windsor Castle banquet and emphasizing the "special relationship" between the US and Britain. The Times reported King Charles's characterization of the two nations as "the closest of kin," while the Daily Express quoted Trump's expressions of respect. The Guardian highlighted a significant government announcement regarding £150 billion in US investment into the UK, suggesting this aims to mollify critics of the presidential visit. Additionally, reports covered the Home Secretary's strong criticism of migrants lodging last-minute legal challenges against deportation, alongside claims about a Home Office-backed charity advising migrants on legal processes.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle, the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Forecasters expect the storm to remain over open waters for the next several days, posing no immediate threat to land, but anticipate it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane by the weekend. Its current forecast track shows it moving north of the Caribbean, with a potential reach towards Bermuda next week. This storm emerges in a season that has been less active than NOAA's initial predictions, which suggested a busier period. Only one of the six preceding named storms made landfall, making Gabrielle's trajectory a point of continued observation.</p>

          <p>Huawei Technologies has announced a significant computing breakthrough, unveiling hardware that reportedly achieves world-class computing power without utilizing Nvidia’s advanced chips. The Shenzhen-based telecoms giant claims to have developed the "world's most powerful" supernode computing cluster, leveraging local chipmaking processes. This innovation provides a substantial boost to China's self-reliance in artificial intelligence computing, aligning with Beijing’s toughening stance against US export restrictions on advanced technology. Huawei also outlined plans to release upgraded Ascend AI chips, including the Ascend 950PR, over the next three years, setting a competitive timeline against Nvidia and AMD. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed disappointment but acknowledged larger geopolitical agendas at play.</p>

          <p>Saudi Arabia and Pakistan have signed a strategic mutual defense pact, significantly deepening their decades-long security partnership. The agreement declares that any aggression against one country will be considered an aggression against both, aiming to strengthen joint deterrence. This development comes as Gulf Arab states express increasing apprehension regarding the reliability of the United States as a long-term security guarantor, particularly following recent regional conflicts. The pact was signed by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who is on a state visit. The alliance reinforces existing strong ties, including Pakistan's large expatriate community in Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia's role as a major oil supplier to India.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris reveals in an excerpt from her forthcoming book, "107 Days," that Pete Buttigieg was her "first choice" for a 2024 running mate. Harris writes that Buttigieg "would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man," but concluded the pairing was "too big of a risk." She reasoned that the Democratic ticket was already asking a lot of America by presenting a woman, a Black woman, married to a Jewish man. Harris ultimately chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and they subsequently lost the election. This candid admission highlights the complex calculations involved in political ticket formation, particularly concerning identity and perceived electability in the American political landscape.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 soared to a fresh record high, propelled by strong performances in the real estate and technology sectors, amidst a mixed trading session across other Asia-Pacific markets. This market activity followed the Federal Reserve's anticipated 25 basis point cut to its benchmark rate, which Chairman Jerome Powell characterized as a "risk management cut" rather than a response to economic weakness. The Fed's forward guidance suggested two additional rate cuts by year-end, with more reductions projected through 2027, but none in 2028. Additionally, Asian chip stocks saw gains after reports of China banning Nvidia's artificial intelligence chips. The Bank of Japan is currently holding its two-day policy meeting, where it is widely expected to keep policy rates steady, though HSBC forecasts a hike later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the US Federal Reserve's first interest rate cut of the year, analysts predict that China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), will likely pursue only moderate easing measures. Despite the increased flexibility afforded by the Fed's move, the PBOC set the yuan's midpoint rate slightly lower on Thursday. Experts, such as Standard Chartered Bank's chief Greater China economist Ding Shuang, suggest that a more conservative rate cut pace from the PBOC compared to the Fed will narrow the interest rate gap between the two nations. This strategy is expected to alleviate capital outflow pressures on the yuan, thereby lending support to the currency and contributing to China's financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>San Diego International Airport experienced a complete ground stop for all flights following an aircraft emergency where a disabled plane's nose gear collapsed on the runway. The incident, which occurred around 6:40 p.m., led to the temporary closure of the runway, causing all inbound flights to be diverted to other airports. Fortunately, no injuries were reported among the individuals on board the affected aircraft. However, the obstruction resulted in significant operational disruptions, with estimated two-hour delays for departing flights and 50-minute delays for arrivals. All United Airlines flights were subsequently canceled due to the prolonged runway closure.</p>

It spotlights the unconventional story of Gong Sheng, a young man who, despite his academic potential, discovered a profound passion for cooking and is now pursuing a culinary program. The article suggests that such examples, historically considered novelties in China's exam-centric society, are becoming increasingly prevalent and represent a positive societal shift. This trend indicates a growing clarity among young Chinese regarding their personal aspirations and an increasing level of family and societal support for pursuing non-traditional dreams, thereby challenging the long-held belief that one's future is solely determined by exam scores.</p>

Music is presented as a crucial informational layer, directly conveying a designer's intended emotion and narrative, whether it aims to evoke nostalgia, arousal, or disorientation. Designers frequently collaborate with composers to craft unique soundtracks, seamlessly blending original compositions with familiar melodies to achieve specific atmospheric effects. The article provides examples such as Campillo's incorporation of a Nezahualcóyotl poem, Eckhaus Latta's use of choppy dance music, Diotima's Caribbean-inspired sounds, and Collina Strada's disorienting club music collage. Ultimately, the piece underscores how sound profoundly influences the memory and overall perception of runway presentations, making it an indispensable element of fashion storytelling.</p>

This strategic move by OSU comes in response to a dramatic 619% increase in AI-related job listings over the past decade, according to the Brookings Institution.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has revealed that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume naturally fermented fruit, an intake equivalent to roughly two alcoholic beverages per day for a human. Researchers directly measured the alcohol content in the figs and plum-like fruits eaten by chimps, finding an average of 0.3% by weight. This finding supports the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which posits that primates' attraction to alcohol originates from ancestral fruit-eating habits, where the presence of alcohol signals ripe, calorie-rich fruit. While the chimps do not become intoxicated, this steady, low-dose exposure influences their feeding rates, linking human alcohol attraction to deep evolutionary roots shared with other fruit-eating animals.</p>
