          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new fare structures for its premium cabins, similar to how it segmented its main cabin with options like basic economy. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that premium seat revenue has grown significantly, prompting a focus on offering more tailored choices to high-end customers. While specific changes have not been announced, possibilities could include different levels of service and amenities within business or first class. Delta is currently surveying travelers to gauge interest and ensure new offerings provide clear value before any official rollout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely attributed to a significant increase in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were 301% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall rise in government receipts compared to June 2024. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit remains substantial at $1.34 trillion. The report also highlighted the ongoing financial pressure from high interest payments on the national debt, which totaled $84 billion for the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chemical company DuPont has agreed to a $27 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit concerning the PFOA contamination of the water supply in Hoosick Falls, New York. This agreement resolves DuPont's role as the final defendant in a case that began in 2016, bringing the total recovery for residents to over $90 million. The lawsuit claimed that a local facility using DuPont's Teflon materials contaminated drinking water with the "forever chemical," which is linked to serious health issues. The settlement, which awaits judicial approval, also includes funding for a medical monitoring program for affected residents.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors are exploring alternative ways to generate supplemental income. This article outlines three potential strategies for homeowners and those with savings to bolster their finances during retirement. Options discussed include reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 or older to receive payments from their home equity. Another method is purchasing an annuity, which provides guaranteed lifetime payments in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A third, though less favorable, option is a personal loan for more immediate financial needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A message in a bottle, tossed into the Atlantic Ocean by a Canadian couple in 2012, has been discovered on a beach in Ireland, roughly 2,000 miles from where it was thrown. The note, written by Brad and Anita Squires during a trip to Newfoundland's Bell Island, was found by a couple in Scraggane Bay. After the finders posted about it on social media, the Squires, now married with three children, were quickly located. The story has brought joy to both the finders and the senders, who see the bottle's long journey as a metaphor for resilience and connection.</p>

          <p>Ovidio Guzman Lopez, a son of the infamous drug lord Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman, has pleaded guilty to drug trafficking and criminal enterprise charges in a U.S. federal court. Guzman Lopez was a leader of the "Los Chapitos" faction of the Sinaloa cartel, which prosecutors accuse of running a massive and violent fentanyl trafficking operation. As part of his plea agreement, he must provide "substantial assistance" to the government, which could lead to a sentence of less than life in prison. He is the first of El Chapo's sons to strike such a deal with U.S. prosecutors.</p>

          <p>The latest season of "Love Island USA" is drawing massive viewership despite a perceived lack of genuine romance, which this article suggests is a reflection of Gen Z's dating habits. The cast, many of whom came of age during the pandemic, appear emotionally guarded and hesitant to form deep connections, leading to a season dominated by "situationships" rather than love stories. The analysis posits that these young contestants, like many of their peers, are anxious about vulnerability and avoid appearing "cringey" or "overeager." The show's most popular contestants, however, are those who have shown genuine, and sometimes messy, emotion.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely adopted fitness goal of walking 10,000 steps per day originated not from scientific research but from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign for a pedometer. While the number is somewhat arbitrary, health experts note that it coincidentally aligns with general physical activity guidelines and can be a useful motivator. Studies show health benefits, such as reduced cardiovascular risk, can begin at far lower step counts, around 2,500 to 3,000 steps a day. Experts emphasize that consistency and intensity matter more than a specific number, encouraging people to simply move more than they currently do.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the concept of American exceptionalism, questioning whether the U.S. is unique or if it is subject to the same political and social forces as any other nation. It draws upon two recent books reviewed in The Atlantic: one detailing the recovery of children stolen during Argentina's Dirty War, and another on the shared democratic history of the Western Hemisphere. The author suggests these works offer lessons for the U.S., showing that authoritarianism can happen anywhere, but also that democratic principles have been pioneered and strengthened in other nations, offering models for Americans to learn from.</p>

The initiative aims to reduce the number of people signed off on long-term sick leave by providing a plan for recovery and re-entry into the workplace. The government is funding the project in 15 regions, giving doctors the resources to refer patients to occupational therapists and other services.
