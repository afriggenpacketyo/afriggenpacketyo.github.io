          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in net profit for the first quarter, primarily due to lower crude oil prices and reduced production. The net income for the three months ending March 31 was $26 billion, slightly above analyst expectations but down from $27.3 billion in the same period last year. Free cash flow for the quarter was announced at $19.2 billion, a decrease from $22.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024, while cash flow from operating activities totaled $31.7 billion, compared to $33.6 billion last year.

He described the talks as "very good" and mentioned that change had been "negotiated in a friendly, but constructive, manner". The discussions, led by China's Vice-Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, are aimed at de-escalating the trade war that has seen the US impose tariffs of 145% on Chinese imports, with China retaliating with levies of 125% on some US goods. Trump expressed hope for the opening of China to American businesses for the benefit of both countries.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power accounting for 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China invested $66 billion in Africa's energy sector, with the continent becoming a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology. Exports of this technology have surged by 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by rising energy demand in Africa and China's dominance in solar panel production. This shift aligns with China's commitment to halting funding for new coal-fired power plants overseas.</p>
