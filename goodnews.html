          <p>Approximately 2,800 service members, including 700 Marines, are expected to support the National Guard in Los Angeles within 48 hours as part of Task Force 51. The Marines have undergone training in de-escalation and crowd control and will operate under Title 10 status, focusing on protecting federal personnel and property. While they can detain individuals to prevent harm or interference, they must transfer custody to civilian law enforcement. This deployment aims to maintain order and protect federal assets amidst ongoing protests in the city. Optimism for a peaceful resolution remains moderate, considering the potential for escalation and the need for de-escalation tactics. </p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the United States might extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue in good faith. He emphasized that the Trump administration is in discussions with 18 important trading partners. Japan is among these partners, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Trump scheduled to meet at the G7 summit. Bessent's remarks offer a hint of flexibility in the administration's tariff policies.

          <p>Chris Mason discusses the UK's Spending Review, highlighting the government's focus on long-term capital spending while limiting day-to-day expenditures. The review seeks to transform the public realm and boost economic potential, but these changes will take time. The government's willingness to prioritize long-term goals reflects a gamble on patience in an era of impatience. This strategy involves potential risks in a volatile political climate. </p>
