          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have pledged $1 million in financial assistance to immigrant families affected by recent immigration enforcement activity in the region. The announcement comes amid federal immigration raids in the Los Angeles area and calls for the Dodgers to take a stand against them. The Dodgers stated they will collaborate with the City of Los Angeles and local organizations to provide food and mental health services. This pledge follows a disagreement between the Dodgers and ICE after the team denied ICE agents access to Dodger Stadium parking lots, a claim ICE refuted.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An NPR report explores the increasing trend of self-managed medication abortion, where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision. This method gained traction due to limited access to clinics and the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Studies show self-managed abortions are safe and effective, leading organizations like the World Health Organization and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists to support it. While telehealth prescriptions and support hotlines have expanded access, political and legal challenges remain, as some states seek to restrict access to abortion pills.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and the presence of foreign male DNA. Despite maintaining her innocence, Dorotik was initially found guilty based on circumstantial evidence and testimony from her sons. The Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover these inconsistencies, leading to the dismissal of charges due to insufficient evidence.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have published studies suggesting that advances in cell transplantation into the spleen could transform the organ into a hub for treating diabetes. Research indicates that "shielding" islet cells could improve their survival after transplantation into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. The spleen, a more promising long-term survival site than the liver, could be engineered into a transplant hub using nanoparticles. These findings could lead to new treatments for diabetes, which affects millions worldwide, including a significant population in China.</p>
