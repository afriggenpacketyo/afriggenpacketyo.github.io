          <p>A Russian woman named Irina Krynina moved to Ukraine with her daughters to support Russian prisoners of war after her own partner was captured. She founded "Our Way Out," an initiative that helps relatives contact captured soldiers, records interviews, and facilitates communication, providing proof of life that is often hard to obtain from Russian authorities. Despite her partner's cold reception and their eventual separation, Krynina continues her work, believing it aids in prisoner exchanges and shows Russians the reality of the war. Her project has gained significant traction but has also led to her being labeled a "foreign agent" by Russia.</p>

          <p>A major security operation is underway in South Ayrshire, Scotland, for Donald Trump's four-day private visit to his Turnberry golf resort. The visit includes meetings with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Scottish First Minister John Swinney, alongside protests in Edinburgh and Aberdeen. Roads have been closed and a large security perimeter established, with police raising concerns about the cost and staffing impact. The visit has also drawn attention to the Scottish government's recent decision to provide public funding for a golf tournament at another of Trump's courses.</p>

          <p>A U.S.-based Japanese nutritionist describes her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting the incredible variety of traditional and healthy foods not commonly found in American stores. She was impressed by the wide selection of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like freeze-dried tofu, and an abundance of seasonal Japanese produce. The store also offered a range of ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and a vast assortment of green tea products. The article suggests that incorporating these items could offer significant nutritional benefits, reflecting staples of the Japanese diet.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise album "Swag" is being positioned as a potential "song of the summer," offering a soothing and melancholic alternative to typical upbeat pop anthems. The album, his first since parting with manager Scooter Braun, leans into R&B and hip-hop with a unique, muffled production style influenced by indie artists. The lead single "Daisies" exemplifies this with its gentle, whispery vocals and themes of stability over passion. This article suggests this downtempo yet complex sound resonates with a broader cultural malaise, as listeners gravitate towards more reserved and introspective music.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a novel public health initiative by releasing millions of mosquitoes modified with Wolbachia bacteria to combat the spread of dengue fever. This naturally occurring bacteria prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, rendering it unable to transmit the disease to humans. A pilot program in Niterói demonstrated remarkable success, reducing dengue cases by approximately 90% and also significantly lowering rates of chikungunya and Zika. The Brazilian government is now investing in a massive new factory to produce billions of these "Wolbitos" to protect millions of citizens.</p>

          <h2>Harvard Expert Suggests 30-Second Mental Prep to Improve Everyday Conversations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:05:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Harvard conversation expert, Alison Wood Brooks, recommends taking just 30 seconds before any casual interaction to mentally prepare. This brief practice involves thinking about potential topics, questions, and conversational goals, which can make a person appear more prepared, considerate, and influential. According to Brooks' research, this forethought helps individuals stay present during the conversation, as the brain is less overwhelmed with the task of generating talking points in real-time. This strategy is part of a broader set of skills for effective communication, which includes focusing on the other person and encouraging them to elaborate.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 74-year-old dog trainer, was unexpectedly diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease, during a routine pre-surgery X-ray. With less than a year to live, he was initially hesitant but ultimately agreed to a double-lung transplant, an option for which he was a promising candidate despite his age. After a month in the hospital and a successful surgery at the Cleveland Clinic, his lung capacity is now at 98%. He is recovering well from post-surgery complications and plans to train a new therapy dog, named "Encore," to celebrate his new lease on life.</p>

          <p>Despite being Hollywood's highest-paid actor in the 1930s, Will Rogers' true passion was being a cowboy, according to his great-granddaughter, Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry. She explains that he viewed his prolific film career primarily as a means to fund his travels and time on his ranch. Rogers, known as "Oklahoma's favorite son," never lost touch with his roots and remained a "common man" despite his fame and friendships with presidents and celebrities. His great-granddaughter is now dedicated to preserving the legacy of the beloved humorist, columnist, and movie star who she says brought people together in a unique way.</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Venus Williams humorously remarked that she returned to competition partly for the health insurance, shedding light on the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system. After a break from the sport, she lost eligibility for the WTA's plan and was placed on COBRA, which is notoriously expensive. The article uses her situation to explain how employment is tied to insurance, the challenges for those with pre-existing conditions like Williams' Sjogren's syndrome, and how the Affordable Care Act has created more options than existed previously. Her quip resonated with many Americans who face the "job lock" created by the employer-sponsored insurance model.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the life of Ozzy Osbourne, who passed away at 76, celebrating him as a figure who lived multiple, extraordinary lives. From a difficult childhood and a prison stint, he rose to fame as a founder of Black Sabbath, was fired for his excesses, and then launched an even more successful solo career. The article recalls his notorious acts and struggles with addiction before his reinvention as a beloved, bumbling TV dad on "The Osbournes." The author concludes that Osbourne, who once sang he didn't want to die an ordinary man, succeeded in his wish.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has appointed Yulia Svyrydenko as its new prime minister, a rare move for a woman in Eastern European politics, but she is already facing skepticism and sexist criticism. Some observers have dismissed the 39-year-old as a mere "loyalist" to President Zelensky, questioning her ability to act independently. However, Svyrydenko has an extensive resume, including negotiating major international trade and reconstruction deals. Her appointment comes at a critical time for Ukraine, and she is tasked with managing the economy and securing foreign support, following a path similar to other female leaders in the region who overcame initial disparagement to become effective reformers.</p>

          <p>Leading AI experts, including Geoffrey Hinton, used the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai to call for urgent collaboration between the U.S. and China to manage the risks of advanced AI. Hinton warned that while nations have divergent interests on some issues, they share a common goal of preventing AI from "taking over," comparing the threat to a "cute tiger cub" that could grow into a dangerous predator. He emphasized that international cooperation, similar to Cold War-era nuclear non-proliferation talks, is essential to ensure the technology remains under human control and develops safely for all of humanity.</p>
