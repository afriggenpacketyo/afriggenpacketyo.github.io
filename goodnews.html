        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As temperatures rise, animal welfare charities are urging dog owners to take extra precautions, as dogs are highly susceptible to heat-related illnesses. Unlike humans, dogs have a limited ability to cool themselves and can overheat quickly, especially during exercise. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, excessive drooling, and lethargy. Experts advise against walking dogs in hot weather, recommending instead to check pavement temperatures and provide walks only in the very early morning or late evening. Keeping dogs indoors in a cool environment is the safest option during peak heat.</p>
