          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced revenue exceeding expectations in its first earnings report since its IPO, with a 420% increase in revenue compared to the previous year. The company anticipates revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, driven by new client uptake and infrastructure demand. Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation, CoreWeave secured a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion, supplementing OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft. The company expects to double its deployed power by the end of the year to accommodate its growth, while not expecting meaningful impact from President Trump's tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump, speaking in Saudi Arabia, denounced Western intervention and nation-building, a statement met with applause but also skepticism. He urged the people of the Middle East to chart their own destinies, a message resonating with grievances over past American policies, particularly the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions and current support for Israel. While some viewed Trump's remarks as a welcome shift away from lecturing, others expressed concern over the potential loss of pressure on human rights issues. Trump also met with the new leader of Syria, Ahmed al-Shara, a former jihadist, sparking controversy.</p>

Governor Newsom has committed to providing more support than any other state, even as Congress considers penalties for states that insure undocumented immigrants. The decision is driven by economic and moral considerations, as lack of routine care can lead to costly emergency room visits. However, new budget realities may force cuts in coverage, including capping enrollment for undocumented adults and adding monthly premiums.</p>
