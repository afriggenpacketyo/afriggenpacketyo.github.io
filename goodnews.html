          <h2>Hugo Boss Shares Surge After Promising First-Quarter Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 05:03:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hugo Boss shares experienced a significant jump after the fashion retailer reported a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, with revenues falling just 2% on a currency-adjusted basis to 999 million euros, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the company reiterated its full-year guidance, projecting sales between 4.2 billion and 4.4 billion euros. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to subdued consumer demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China, but the company's strategic overhaul, including improvements in store formats and product diversification, has helped mitigate some of the negative impacts. Analysts suggest that while Hugo Boss has expanded its appeal, womenswear remains an area needing improvement.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has announced its plans to acquire British food delivery firm Deliveroo in a deal valued at ¬£2.9 billion ($3.9 billion), marking a significant push into overseas markets. Deliveroo's board has agreed to DoorDash's offer of 180 pence per share, a 44% premium over Deliveroo's closing price on April 4, prior to the initial offer. This acquisition will expand DoorDash's reach to over 40 countries, covering a combined population of over 1 billion people, and provide more local businesses with necessary tools and technology. The financial terms are final, pending shareholder approval, with no increase expected unless a rival bid emerges.</p>

          <p>Despite facing massive tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, experts believe Temu and Shein will remain dominant forces in the U.S. e-tail scene. The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has been closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. However, both companies have been preparing for this change by accelerating localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses. Experts suggest that Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and competitive pricing will enable them to adapt and continue competing effectively with rivals like Amazon.</p>

          <p>The UK's Deliveroo is set to be acquired by US firm DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at ¬£2.9bn. The combined company will have a presence in more than 40 countries serving about 50 million customers per month. The tie-up is also expected to provide fierce competition to rivals Just Eat and Uber Eats in the UK. However, the deal is the latest example of a UK-listed company being taken over by a US firm, fuelling further concerns over UK investment. Will Shu, chief executive and co-founder of Deliveroo, said he was "very proud of everything we have achieved as a standalone business".</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's economic narrative, long defined by "supply-side reform," is now pivoting towards prioritizing domestic demand. President Xi Jinping's focus on boosting productivity and technological advancement has yielded impressive results, positioning China as a leader in electric vehicles, solar energy, and artificial intelligence. However, the Communist Party's Politburo recently signaled a shift towards "demand-side reform," emphasizing the need to stabilize employment, markets, and expectations while increasing household income and consumption. This pivot acknowledges that supply-side success does not automatically translate into strong domestic demand, which has become a pressing issue for China's economy.</p>

          <p>The UK government is allocating ¬£102 million to modernize approximately 1,000 GP practice buildings across England, marking the largest public investment in such facilities in five years. This funding aims to expand and improve surgeries, converting office space into clinical consulting rooms and constructing new practices. The announcement comes amid record-low satisfaction levels with GP services and reports that many practices are unfit for purpose. While the government touts this as a significant step, the Royal College of GPs emphasizes that long-term investment is necessary to address inadequate infrastructure and improve patient experiences.</p>

          <p>Ferrari's struggles in the Miami Grand Prix have raised questions about the team's performance and tire management. Team principal Frederic Vasseur admitted that the car's pace was not where Ferrari expected it to be at the start of this season, after running McLaren so close for the constructors' title last year. Lewis Hamilton won the sprint in China, but that seems to be a case of him and the team finding a good set-up after just one practice session, while others did not, and then benefiting from clean air at the start of the race. Stricter rules on front wing deflection that are being introduced at the subsequent race in Spain may make a difference.</p>

          <p>In China, the children of senior officials are increasingly opting for jobs in the public sector, reversing a previous trend of pursuing lucrative careers in the private sector. This shift is attributed to the ruling Communist Party's tightening of rules around officials and their families as part of its anti-corruption drive, as well as a slowing economy. Government jobs, once seen as less attractive due to lower pay and greater constraints, are now viewed as more secure and desirable amid economic uncertainties and increased scrutiny of officials' families.</p>
