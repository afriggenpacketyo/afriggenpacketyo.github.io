          <p>Carrie Edwards, a widow and grandmother from Midlothian, Virginia, has donated her full $150,000 Powerball winnings to charitable causes. After winning the prize, she immediately decided to give the money away, stating, "God is blessing me, so I can bless others." The donation was split into three $50,000 gifts to organizations meaningful to her: the Association for Frontotemporal Degeneration in memory of her late husband, Shalom Farms for local food access, and the Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society to honor her family's military background. Her act of generosity has been widely praised, with lottery officials noting that it is very rare for winners to donate their entire prize.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Common consumer gadgets are increasingly incorporating features that serve as powerful accessibility aids for people with sensory decline or chronic diseases. For instance, Apple's AirPods can now function as FDA-authorized over-the-counter hearing aids and provide real-time language translation, making communication more accessible and affordable. Similarly, vision-assistance tools like Magnifier on iPhones and Lookout on Android devices use AI to help visually impaired users navigate their environment by reading labels and describing surroundings. The recent availability of over-the-counter continuous glucose monitors further illustrates this trend, transforming everyday technology into vital tools for health management and personal autonomy.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the dominance of streaming services and challenges facing the traditional box office, repertory cinemas in Los Angeles are successfully drawing audiences by offering unique, community-focused viewing experiences. Theaters like Vidiots and the American Cinematheque are thriving by screening classic and rare films, often on 35-millimeter prints, and hosting curated events with filmmakers and industry professionals. This approach has attracted a younger, more diverse audience that craves a shared cultural experience that cannot be replicated at home. While the financial model often relies on nonprofit status and donations, the success of these venues demonstrates a resilient demand for the magic of communal movie-watching.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom is poised to officially recognize a Palestinian state, a significant diplomatic move that diverges from the position of its close ally, the United States. The decision follows a deadline set by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who stated the UK would grant recognition unless Israel met certain conditions related to the war in Gaza, including agreeing to a ceasefire. While largely symbolic, the recognition is intended to increase pressure for a two-state solution and keep the prospect of a lasting peace alive. The UK joins other Western nations, including France, in a growing movement to recognize Palestine, a step already taken by over 140 countries worldwide.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Suggests ASML is a More Promising AI Stock Than Palantir</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-21 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a case for why semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML could be a more valuable company than the high-flying AI firm Palantir within the next three years. The argument centers on Palantir's current stock valuation, which is described as unreasonably high at 130 times sales, making it vulnerable to a significant correction. In contrast, ASML holds a technological monopoly on the essential EUV lithography machines required to produce advanced AI chips, giving it a durable competitive advantage. With strong projected growth and a more reasonable valuation, ASML is positioned for steady performance while Palantir faces the risk of a pullback from its current speculative highs.

          <p>King Charles III paid a special visit to Ethel Caterham, who at 116 years old is recognized as the world's oldest living person. During their meeting at her care home in Surrey, Mrs. Caterham, the last surviving subject of Edward VII, shared her memories of the King's 1969 investiture, telling him that "all the girls were in love with you." Born in 1909, she has lived through two world wars, the Great Depression, and the entire reigns of six British monarchs. The visit was arranged after she mentioned that she would have loved to meet the King, turning her quiet birthday wish into a memorable royal encounter.</p>

In London, the Canary Wharf financial district is experiencing a revival, with office leasing expected to hit a decade high as banks and new brands return. While private equity markets face some fundraising challenges due to delayed exits, the broader sentiment among investors at recent European conferences has been one of cautious confidence and a search for new opportunities across the continent.

          <p>Lucy Guo, a 30-year-old self-made billionaire who dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University, still recommends that aspiring entrepreneurs spend at least one to two years in college. While she chose to leave her studies to accept a Thiel Fellowship and build her company, she emphasizes that college provides an unparalleled environment for networking. Guo argues that it is the best place to meet intelligent peers and future hires, as everyone is in a similar life stage and open to forming new connections. She credits her own success partly to the high-density network of smart, ambitious people she met, which is a unique advantage that higher education offers.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans defeated Michigan State 45-31 to improve their record to 4-0, in a game where their offense demonstrated significant power but was hampered by defensive lapses and penalties. Receiver Makai Lemon was a standout performer, accounting for 127 receiving yards and scoring a crucial fourth-quarter touchdown to secure the win. USC's rushing attack was also dominant, gaining over 200 yards against a tough Spartan defense. However, the team's lack of discipline, with 10 penalties for 88 yards, allowed Michigan State to remain competitive until late in the game, highlighting an area for improvement as USC heads into a more challenging stretch of its schedule.</p>

          <p>In an unusual intersection of China's cultural boom and its real estate crisis, stalled property developments are finding new life as lavish film sets for the country's burgeoning micro-drama industry. As the audience for these short, dramatic online videos surpasses 660 million, demand has surged for high-end locations like luxury offices and apartments, which are common settings for popular urban romance stories. This has created an opportunity for developers with unfinished projects, allowing opulent sales halls and model homes to be rented out to production crews. The trend provides a stream of revenue for struggling projects while offering a stark visual contrast between on-screen glamour and real-world construction delays.</p>
