          <p>A new Pew Research Center study reveals that Islam is the fastest-growing religion globally, primarily due to natural demographic growth. The world's Muslim population increased by 347 million people between 2010 and 2020, exceeding the growth of all other religions combined. Christianity, while still the largest religion, declined as an overall slice of the world's population, with religious disaffiliation impacting its proportion. The study analyzed religious data from 201 countries, highlighting the influence of population growth and religious switching on the global religious landscape.</p>

Winfrey highlighted Lamb's work with women in prison as an influence on the story, although the book focuses on a male protagonist.

          <p>The British government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, aiming to lower household bills and enhance energy security. The project is expected to create 10,000 jobs over the next decade and provide a steady power supply for six million homes. However, the plant will take at least 10 years to complete, with power generation expected to begin in the mid-2030s. The investment is part of a broader effort to attract private investment into the UK and boost economic growth, but the project has faced opposition over its potential cost and environmental impact.</p>

Building a nuclear power station is a huge engineering and financial project. The UK currently has nine nuclear reactors in operation, but the plants are ageing and eight of them are due to close by the end of this decade. Last year, nuclear power provided about 14% of the UK's electricity, which is significantly less than what was generated by wind (30%) and gas (26%).</p>
