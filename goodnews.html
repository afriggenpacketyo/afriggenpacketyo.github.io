          <p>The Prime Minister of Japan has pledged to maintain stable relations with South Korea following Lee Jae-myung's election as president. This commitment signals a desire for continued cooperation and diplomacy between the two nations. The statement underscores the importance of the relationship between Japan and South Korea, suggesting that both countries recognize the mutual benefits of a stable and cooperative partnership. The pledge may be particularly significant given historical tensions and ongoing geopolitical considerations in the region.</p>

          <p>An 88-year-old woman in the Czech Republic, declared dead by a coroner, was discovered to be alive while being placed in a coffin. Morticians noticed signs of life, leading to her immediate transport to a hospital. This rare medical occurrence is known as the Lazarus Effect, where a patient shows signs of life after being clinically pronounced dead, often following CPR. According to the Cleveland Clinic, the Lazarus Effect typically occurs after a cardiac arrest and the administration of CPR, with 74 confirmed cases in the U.S. between 1982 and 2022.</p>

          <p>Rams receiver Puka Nacua recently returned from a trip to Samoa, where he joined medical professionals to provide diabetes testing and education, inspired by his father's experience with the disease. Back with the team, Nacua is honing his skills alongside new teammate Davante Adams, who brings a wealth of knowledge to the remade Rams receiver corps. Nacua, who had a record-setting season last year, is expected to play a key role in the Rams' offense, working alongside Adams and other receivers to elevate the team's performance. The team is expanding markets, beginning with minicamp in Hawaii.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 19:14:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has been temporarily exempted from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs to 50%. This exemption is contingent on the US-UK tariff pact signed in May, which aims to eliminate these tariffs. The UK government remains committed to protecting British business and jobs and is working with the US to implement the agreement. However, Trump indicated that the US might increase tariffs on the UK after July 9, 2025, if the UK does not comply with the Economic Prosperity Deal.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Manhattan has extended an injunction, preventing the Trump administration from canceling unspent funding for elementary and high schools in 16 states and Washington, D.C. The funding, totaling over $1.1 billion from the American Rescue Plan Act, is intended to address the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on schools. The judge's order requires the Department of Education to process funding requests without delay and prevents enforcement of a letter setting a deadline for states to claim remaining funds. The lawsuit was led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, with support from other attorneys general and Pennsylvania's governor.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is bringing back the Snack Wrap to its U.S. menus starting July 10, 2025, after a nine-year hiatus. The popular item, consisting of a tortilla filled with chicken, lettuce, and cheese, was removed in 2016 due to kitchen complexity. The revived Snack Wrap will feature fried chicken and come in Ranch and Spicy flavors, a simplified recipe to ensure faster service. The company acknowledged the demand from fans, pointing to a Change.org petition with nearly 19,000 signatures.</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old Mexican girl has been granted humanitarian parole to remain in the U.S. and continue receiving lifesaving medical care. The decision reverses an earlier notification that her parole would be revoked, potentially leading to deportation. She has been receiving treatment for short bowel syndrome since arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2023, which is necessary for her survival. Humanitarian parole, which does not provide a path to citizenship, was widely used during the Biden administration to address individual emergencies.</p>
