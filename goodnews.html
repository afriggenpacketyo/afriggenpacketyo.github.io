          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported 250 million bees escaped, but later corrected the number with assistance from a beekeeper. The public was advised to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away from the incident site. Beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees, aiming to save as many as possible, and the road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to return to their hives.</p>

          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has left his role as the Doctor after two series on Doctor Who, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played companion Rose Tyler. The BBC confirmed the regeneration but teased the mystery behind Piper's return. Gatwa expressed gratitude for his time on the show, while Piper's return marks a significant event, considering her successful career since leaving the show in 2006. This marks one of the shortest tenures for an actor playing the Doctor since Christopher Eccleston's departure after a single series in 2005.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaying Medicare enrollment can lead to penalties that increase premiums for life, but exceptions exist for individuals covered by employer-provided health insurance. Those who are working for an employer with 20 or more employees can typically delay Medicare enrollment without penalty. Deferring enrollment also allows continued contributions to a health savings account (HSA). Medicare suggests confirming appropriate coverage with the employer's benefits department to ensure eligibility for delayed application.</p>

          <p>The price of a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich, a New York City staple, has risen at a Brooklyn bodega due to soaring egg costs and other increased expenses. The owners of El Vacilon Grocery decided to raise the price from $4.50 to $5, the first increase since 2019, as egg prices surged. Despite a revenue decline, the bodega has managed to stay afloat due to owning the building and renting out apartments above the store. The sandwich, referred to as "bandera" by the owners, remains a popular item among locals.</p>

          <p>Corporate buzzwords are often seen as annoying and can impede trust in the workplace, despite being intended to convey meaning. Gen Zers, who rely on instant answers, may be particularly susceptible to using jargon as a coping mechanism. Employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, while new buzzwords continue to emerge. Ultimately, buzzwords can be seen as a way to distract from the primary goal of making money, and it's recommended to use real, human language instead.</p>
