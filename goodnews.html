          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka appeared in federal court for a status conference after being arrested outside an Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility. Baraka, a Democratic candidate for New Jersey governor, was taken into custody on trespassing charges while supporting members of New Jersey's congressional delegation touring the facility, which he claims lacked necessary permits. Baraka disputed the U.S. Attorney's account, stating he was invited inside and remained for over an hour, and the trespassing charge carries a maximum sentence of 30 days in prison. The mayor's arrest has sparked rallies and protests against the facility.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court is hearing arguments regarding President Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship for children born in the U.S. to undocumented immigrants. The case addresses whether lower court judges can block presidential orders nationwide, with the Trump administration arguing that universal injunctions undermine the president's ability to carry out his policy agenda. Legal experts contend that ending birthright citizenship would violate the 14th Amendment, potentially rendering tens of thousands of children undocumented or stateless.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is selling 25 shares of Eaton (ETN) to lock in gains following a recent rally, reducing its weighting in the portfolio. The Club had previously capitalized on concerns about DeepSeek's impact on the data center market and tariff-related uncertainty to acquire Eaton shares at lower prices. With the stock now trading near $330, up significantly from previous buys, the Club is lightening its position and downgrading its rating to a hold-equivalent 2. This move aligns with the Club's disciplined approach to managing an overbought market, following similar trims in Texas Roadhouse and Wells Fargo. (not investment advice)</p>

While no legal right to a bank account exists, banks are prohibited from discriminating based on race or gender, but can avoid customers deemed risky, which some see as prejudice. The Trump administration may issue an executive order to force large banks to provide "fair access" to their products, while the Treasury Department calls debanking "un-American."</p>
