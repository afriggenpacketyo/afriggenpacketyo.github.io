          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have established a trade agreement framework following high-level discussions in London, awaiting approval from President Trump and President Xi. The agreement aims to implement the Geneva consensus and de-escalate trade tensions between the two nations, which had previously accused each other of violating trade agreements. U.S. representatives will brief President Trump, while China's representatives will brief President Xi, to secure their approval for the framework. While this signals a commitment to continued dialogue, the uncertainty remains regarding whether it will lead to substantial breakthroughs. (not investment advice)</p>

Players must be out for at least 10 consecutive weeks to qualify and will receive a "Special Entry Ranking" based on their recent performance, which can be used for three tournaments upon their return.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that AI models struggle to represent concepts that require human senses, resulting in AI-generated content that lacks depth. Researchers found that Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot represent a flower in the same way humans do because they lack sensory and motor experiences. AI's inability to represent sensory concepts may explain why its creativity is often perceived as shallow. While AI can produce outputs that meet minimal definitions of creativity, it fails to capture the richness and complexity of human sensory experiences.</p>

While Chinese exports to the U.S. have decreased, shipments to the EU have increased, particularly to France and Germany. The European Commission stated that it's too early to conclude if this surge is due to trade diversion and if it's causing harm to EU industries.

          <p>President Trump's agenda, including budget cuts and tariffs, is transforming the battle between U.S. states to attract businesses and jobs. States that were previously reliant on federal funding are now facing challenges, while those less dependent on Washington are faring better. The trade war is disrupting economies built on international trade, creating both challenges and opportunities. Foreign companies are seeking to establish manufacturing operations in the U.S. to avoid tariffs, and domestic companies are moving in burgeoning industries like AI and quantum computing.
