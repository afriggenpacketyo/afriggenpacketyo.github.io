          <p>President Trump has given the green light to the merger between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing President Biden's previous decision to block the acquisition due to national security concerns. Trump stated the partnership would generate 70,000 jobs and inject $14 billion into the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. Following the announcement, U.S. Steel shares experienced a significant surge, and Trump plans to hold a rally at U.S. Steel in Pittsburgh to celebrate the merger.</p>

          <p>Experts are attempting to revitalize Florida's declining coral reefs by planting over 1,000 nursery-grown elkhorn coral juveniles, a resilient species, in the Florida Keys. The reefs have suffered a 90% decline in healthy coral cover due to climate change and record ocean heat. The project, involving multiple organizations, aims to identify and propagate the most resilient corals to help rebuild the reef ecosystem, which provides essential habitat for marine life. Scientists hope that even a small percentage of surviving corals can contribute to future recovery efforts in the ecologically fragile area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that the sensitivity experienced in human teeth can be traced back to the exoskeletons of ancient, armored fish from approximately 500 million years ago. Scientists initially misidentified Anatolepis, an early vertebrate fossil, as an arthropod. Further investigation revealed similarities between the armor of ancient fish and vertebrate teeth, suggesting a shared purpose of sensing the environment. By examining modern-day fish embryos, researchers found nerves in tooth-like scales, indicating that the armor of ancient fish allowed them to sense their surroundings, a trait inherited by human teeth.</p>

          <p>Seiya Suzuki hit his 13th home run while going 3-for-5 as the Chicago Cubs came from behind to beat the Cincinnati Reds 13-6 on Friday for their third straight win. Suzuki launched a three-run shot off reliever Brent Suter's 1-1 four-seamer with two out in the eighth, putting the Cubs up 11-6 and capping a productive outing at Cincinnati's Great American Ball Park. Yusei Kikuchi earned his first win for the Los Angeles Angels, meanwhile, after scattering seven hits over 5-2/3 shutout innings in a 7-4 victory over the Miami Marlins that stretched their unbeaten streak to eight games.</p>
