        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the imposition of significant tariffs on Chinese imports, experts believe that e-commerce giants Temu and Shein are well-positioned to remain competitive in the U.S. market. These companies have been proactively adopting localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses, to mitigate the impact of tariffs. While prices may increase, Temu and Shein's agile supply chains and ability to offer lower prices than competitors like Amazon are expected to sustain their appeal to U.S. consumers. The article explains that Temu is offering local warehouse goods, and Shein is expanding its supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>
