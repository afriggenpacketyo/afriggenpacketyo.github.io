His partnership with Sadaharu Oh, dubbed "O-N," made them household names, symbolizing a prosperous era for many older Japanese.

          <p>Due to rising tariffs, a restaurant in Beijing has had to remove American chicken feet, a delicacy known as "phoenix talons," from its menu after prices increased by 30%.

Geng hopes that the price of American chicken feet will decrease if global political tensions ease.

          <p>Iowa state Representative J.D. Scholten has announced his candidacy to challenge Republican Senator Joni Ernst in 2026, spurred by Ernst's response to constituents concerned about potential Medicaid cuts. Ernst's comment, "Well, we're all going to die," during a town hall meeting sparked controversy and motivated Scholten to enter the race. Scholten, a former congressional candidate and current baseball player, aims to make the election a referendum on President Trump's trade policies, particularly their impact on Iowa soybean farmers.

The pause provides older borrowers with defaulted loans additional time to become current and prevent future benefit reductions. (not investment advice)</p>
