          <h2>NBA Sponsorship Revenue Sees Significant Increase Due to Jersey Patches and New Stadium</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 09:32:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NBA teams have experienced an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, driven largely by the introduction of sponsor patches on team jerseys and the opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome. Jersey patch deals, which have become increasingly popular since their introduction in 2017, more than doubled year over year, contributing significantly to the league's revenue. The Intuit Dome's opening also added substantial sponsorship revenue, equivalent to adding three new teams to the league in terms of revenue generation. Brands in construction, alcohol, and technology sectors have shown the most growth in NBA sponsorships, with Rakuten and JPMorgan Chase leading in spending. Optimism is moderate given the continued financial growth of the NBA.</p>

Approved users can access websites like Google and Wikipedia without additional costs, aiming to boost Hainan's ambition to become a global free-trade port.

          <p>Silver futures rose sharply, trading above $36 per troy ounce, reaching their highest level since early 2012. This surge follows a strong performance by gold in 2025, with silver up over 20% year-to-date, though still lagging behind gold's 25% increase. Silver's rally has closed some of the gap between the two precious metals, as silver has both industrial uses and is considered a defensive investment. The Silver Institute estimates that silver supply was about 15% lower than demand in 2024 and projects another deficit in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, about potential interference with contraception. The MHRA advises that these medications may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives due to side effects like vomiting and diarrhea, and because they slow stomach emptying. Women are urged to use effective contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, and to consult with their healthcare provider about the risks and benefits. The MHRA has acted following reports of unintended pregnancies among women using these drugs while on the pill.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Brydon Carse contemplated having his toe amputated to resolve an injury sustained from the repeated impact of his front foot hitting the crease while bowling. After multiple courses of antibiotics and concerns about plastic surgery, Carse opted for extended rest, narrower boots, new insoles, and a different hole in his footwear. He had to withdraw from a lucrative contract in the Indian Premier League due to the toe problems but has since returned to the England squad. Carse is now viewed as one of England's frontline fast bowlers and is set to feature in upcoming matches against West Indies and India.</p>

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a 25-basis-point interest rate cut, lowering the deposit facility rate to 2% due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs. This decision was based on an updated assessment of the inflation outlook, underlying inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary policy transmission. The ECB now anticipates inflation to average 2% in 2025, revised down from a March forecast of 2.3%, reflecting lower energy prices and a stronger euro. The decision comes amid increasing uncertainty due to rising geopolitical tensions and potential impacts from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>
