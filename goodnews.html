          <p>A painting by surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, which was purchased for just £150 at a house clearance in Cambridge, is now expected to sell for up to £30,000 at auction. The piece, titled "Vecchio Sultano," has been authenticated as an original work from a series illustrating "The Arabian Nights." The artwork was part of a commissioned project of 500 pieces, many of which were lost or damaged. The seller, an art dealer, recognized its potential and later confirmed it had been previously attributed to Dalí at a Sotheby's sale in the 1990s, making it a significant rediscovery.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer highlighted "turmoil" in the market, particularly in the health-care sector, as Novo Nordisk shares plunged after cutting its sales outlook, impacting other stocks like Eli Lilly. In contrast, the tech sector showed strength, with Nvidia's stock reaching a new high following a report that it ordered 300,000 additional H20 chips from TSMC for the Chinese market. This move comes after the Trump administration reversed a ban on the sale of these specific chips to China. The report suggests continued strong demand for AI-related hardware.

          <h2>UCLA to Pay $6.45 Million to Settle Lawsuit from Jewish Students Over Campus Protests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 12:16:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles has agreed to a $6.45 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor who alleged their civil rights were violated during pro-Palestinian campus protests in 2024. The plaintiffs claimed they were excluded from parts of the campus by an encampment, creating a hostile environment. As part of the 15-year agreement, UCLA is prohibited from allowing the exclusion of Jewish individuals from campus areas and will donate funds to several Jewish organizations and a campus antisemitism initiative. The settlement follows a federal judge's earlier order admonishing the university's handling of the protests.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's recent visit to Scotland yielded significant political and economic outcomes, including the finalization of a major trade deal with the European Union. The agreement will see the EU purchase billions in American energy and military equipment in exchange for a lower 15% tariff on European goods entering the US. During his trip, Trump also held key discussions with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on the Gaza crisis, pledging to push for more humanitarian aid. The visit, which blended official business with the promotion of his golf resorts, showcased Trump's transactional approach to foreign policy.</p>

Trump, who has been critical of high taxes on oil production, reportedly raised the issue with Swinney, who later told press he believes the industry is "overtaxed."

          <p>Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern have proposed an $85 billion merger that would create the first single transcontinental railroad in United States history. The deal aims to connect Union Pacific's extensive network in the western U.S. with Norfolk Southern's tracks across the East, which the companies argue will streamline national shipping and improve delivery times. The landmark proposal is expected to face intense scrutiny from antitrust regulators at the Surface Transportation Board, given concerns about industry consolidation and the potential for service disruptions. If approved, the merger would likely pressure the remaining major railroads to pursue a similar combination. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund has raised its forecast for global economic growth, predicting 3% growth in 2025, up from its April projection of 2.8%. The upgrade is partly attributed to a modest easing of trade tensions and a surge in U.S. imports as firms moved to get ahead of potential tariff hikes. However, the IMF warned that growth remains below pre-pandemic averages and that significant risks persist, including the potential for renewed tariff disputes and persistent inflation. The UK's growth forecast remained unchanged at 1.2% for the year, placing it among the faster-growing advanced economies. (not investment advice)</p>

For Apple, partnering with the more experienced JPMorgan could bring greater stability to the program after years of rapid growth and regulatory scrutiny under Goldman.
