The opinion leaves open the possibility for broad injunctions when necessary to provide "complete relief" to plaintiffs, such as states arguing a policy is unworkable if not blocked everywhere. The article suggests that opponents of the policy could also pursue a class-action lawsuit to achieve a similarly broad effect, meaning the ruling does not fully eliminate powerful judicial checks on executive power.</p>
