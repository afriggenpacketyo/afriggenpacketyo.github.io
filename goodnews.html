        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, with the initial nationalized service running from Woking to Surbiton. The government describes the move as a "new dawn for rail," focusing on service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment, but refrained from promising fare reductions. SWR trains will now fall under the responsibility of the Department for Transport Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), pending parliamentary approval. The Transport Secretary highlighted this as a "real watershed moment," though unions have raised concerns about outsourcing to private companies. </p>

The rail services were privatized in the mid-1990s, and the government says renationalization will save up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees paid to rail operators.

          <p>A new study indicates that a dog owner's stress related to work can be transferred to their pet, leading to increased anxiety in the animal. Researchers found that when dog owners dwell on work problems during their free time, their dogs exhibit more stress-related behaviors. This "crossover" of stress is attributed to emotional contagion, where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that avoiding work-related rumination at home could benefit the well-being of dogs. </p>
