          <p>Claims circulating on social media that Melania Trump worked as an escort and met her husband at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell are unfounded and lack credible evidence. These allegations, which originated from a 2016 tabloid article, have been successfully challenged in court through defamation lawsuits. Both a blogger and the Daily Mail retracted their stories and paid damages to Mrs. Trump. Furthermore, reports from multiple sources confirm that the Trumps were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli, not at an event connected to Jeffrey Epstein or Maxwell.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has cautioned that his team cannot simply "rinse and repeat" their successful 2023 strategy for the upcoming event at Bethpage in the U.S. Despite retaining 11 of the 12 players from the victorious Rome team, Donald emphasized that playing away from home presents a different challenge that requires a new approach. He acknowledged the continuity is beneficial but stated that player profiles change over two years and that pairings will be adapted accordingly. Europe has not won a Ryder Cup on American soil since 2012.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains at the start of the month, driven by positive developments in the defense and healthcare sectors. A significant £10 billion warship export deal between the U.K. and Norway lifted shares for defense companies like BAE Systems. Simultaneously, pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk's stock increased following trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, is highly effective in reducing heart disease risks compared to competitors. The market movements occurred as U.S. financial markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Domestication Diverged Animal Size Evolution in Middle Ages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 13:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new scientific study has found that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, have caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated animals. Researchers analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones discovered that while wild species like foxes and deer have shrunk due to habitat loss and hunting, domesticated animals such as sheep and chickens have grown larger through selective breeding. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact of human influence on the natural world, altering evolutionary paths that had previously moved in similar cycles for millennia.</p>
