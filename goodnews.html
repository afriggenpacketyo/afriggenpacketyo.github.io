          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. This fund is part of President Trump's major legislative package, intended to offset significant Medicaid cuts that raised concerns about the viability of rural healthcare facilities. Oz stated the funding aims to support workforce development, system right-sizing, and telehealth expansion to improve healthcare delivery. The broader legislation also introduces stricter Medicaid work requirements, which the CBO estimates could lead to nearly 12 million people losing coverage over the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with estimated payouts likely to be under £950 per person. This follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively large commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA plans to launch a consultation in October to define eligibility for the scheme, which could cover agreements dating back to 2007 and cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The regulator is advising affected consumers to contact their loan providers directly to avoid fees from claims management companies. (not investment advice)</p>

The 24-year-old finished two strokes ahead of England's Charley Hull, who recorded her fourth runner-up finish in a major. Yamashita maintained her composure throughout the final day, holding the lead she established with a remarkable round of 65 on Friday. Despite a persistent challenge from Hull, late bogeys on the 16th and 17th holes ended the Englishwoman's hopes, allowing Yamashita to secure the historic victory and a $1.462 million prize.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano, located on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula, has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending an ash plume over 3.7 miles into the sky. The eruption occurred shortly after a major earthquake in the region, though there is no confirmed link. Russian authorities issued and then lifted a tsunami warning for parts of the peninsula, stating that the ash cloud was moving over the Pacific Ocean and did not pose a threat to populated areas. Volcanologists confirmed this was the first historically documented eruption of Krasheninnikov, with its last known activity occurring around the 16th century.</p>

The Smithsonian clarified that the removal was due to the placard not meeting museum standards for appearance and presentation, not due to any external political pressure.

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is set for a thrilling conclusion, with the outcome hanging in the balance after a dramatic fourth day was cut short by bad weather. Chasing a record 374 runs for victory, England reached 339-6, needing just 35 more runs with four wickets remaining. Centuries from Harry Brook and Joe Root had put England in a commanding position, but a late comeback from India's bowlers, who took three quick wickets, turned the game on its head. The intense atmosphere and momentum shifts have set the stage for a nail-biting finish to decide the series.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are increasingly adding spicy items to their menus in an effort to capture the attention of Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers.

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a hard-fought victory at the Hungarian Grand Prix after a masterful defensive drive against his teammate, Oscar Piastri. Norris employed a bold one-stop strategy after falling to fifth on the opening lap, which put him in the lead but required him to manage his tires carefully. In the closing laps, Piastri, on fresher tires, launched a series of attacks but was unable to pass on the notoriously difficult-to-overtake track. The win reduces Norris's championship deficit to Piastri to just nine points, while Mercedes' George Russell finished third.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK International Airport is progressing, with the massive project now weather-tight and key structures in place. Set to be the airport's largest terminal, it will replace the current Terminal 1 and be dedicated solely to international flights, with its first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The project is part of a wider $19 billion overhaul of JFK aimed at modernizing the aging infrastructure of the major U.S. travel hub. The new terminal will feature light-filled spaces, 23 gates, extensive retail and dining, and its own resilient microgrid for power.</p>

          <p>China has granted export permits to 183 new Brazilian coffee companies, a significant move that provides an alternative market for Brazilian exporters facing new U.S. tariffs. The approval comes as the United States prepares to implement a 50% tariff on some Brazilian products, including coffee, creating a major challenge for a trade relationship valued at over $4 billion annually. This development highlights the shifting global trade dynamics, as Brazil, a major U.S. supplier, strengthens its ties with China, its top overall trade partner. The new permits allow Brazilian coffee companies to export to the growing Chinese market for the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult system, a key milestone for the vessel. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a series celebrating the People's Liberation Army anniversary showed what looked like a successful launch from the carrier's deck. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern launch technology, which allows for launching heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump ramps on its older carriers. The successful drill marks significant progress as the carrier moves closer to its expected entry into service this year.</p>
