          <p>A long-standing succession battle within Rupert Murdoch's media empire has concluded with a settlement that solidifies his son Lachlan's control over Fox and News Corp. The agreement involves buying out siblings Prue MacLeod, Elizabeth Murdoch, and James Murdoch, who will cease to be beneficiaries of trusts with company shares. This resolution ensures the continuation of the companies' conservative direction after 94-year-old Rupert's death. The deal ends all litigation over the family trust, which had been the subject of a private legal battle in Nevada.</p>

          <p>In an interview promoting her new book, Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed public perceptions of the Court's partisanship, stating that justices "wear black, not red or blue." She emphasized that the Court's decisions are based on interpreting the law and the Constitution, not political affiliations. Barrett also discussed misconceptions surrounding the Dobbs decision, clarifying that it returned the issue of abortion to the political process rather than outlawing it. She asserted that the Court must remain independent of public opinion to maintain its integrity.</p>

          <p>China has made substantial progress in reducing air and water pollution while continuing its industrial expansion, a feat described as "industrialisation-driven decarbonisation." Research indicates that from 2015 to 2022, the average national level of PM2.5 air pollutants fell by over 35%, a reduction comparable to what the United States achieved in three decades. This environmental improvement is not due to deindustrialization but is powered by the deployment of advanced technology, real-time environmental monitoring, and large-scale investments in green infrastructure. Water quality has also seen significant improvements, with over 90% of monitored sections now rated as good or fair.</p>

          <p>Actor Charlie Sheen is opening up about his past struggles with addiction and his personal life in a new memoir, "The Book of Sheen."

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent appearance at a military parade in Beijing alongside other world leaders marks a significant diplomatic achievement, transforming his image from an isolated pariah to a more influential global figure. The event was the first Kim has attended with multiple heads of state, a stark contrast to a decade ago when North Korea was largely shunned by the international community. This shift reflects a change in North Korea's international standing, which began with diplomatic efforts in 2018. His presence in Beijing underscores a notable change in regional power dynamics.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently filmed a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep waterway in the San Francisco Bay, offering a rare glimpse into how the animals populate the island. A breeding pair of coyotes first arrived on the island in 2017, and researchers now estimate a population of 14 to 17 related individuals. The animals are known to be strong swimmers, and experts believe they have been expanding their territory throughout the Bay Area. The video has sparked public curiosity about the resilience and adaptability of local wildlife.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners had challenged the landmark status, arguing they had a right to raze the property, which they purchased in 2023. The house, where the iconic actor died in 1962, is the only one she ever owned herself. The ruling is a victory for preservationists and Monroe fans who fought to protect the 1920s Spanish-style home from being torn down.</p>

          <p>London's Heathrow Airport has fully reopened after a "hazardous materials" scare led to the partial evacuation of Terminal 4 on Monday. Emergency services, including specialist officers and fire crews, were called to the scene to investigate, but a thorough search found no trace of any adverse substance. Twenty-one people were assessed by paramedics at the scene, with one person taken to the hospital as a precaution, though no one was in a life-threatening condition. The airport apologized for the disruption and confirmed it was working to ensure flights departed as scheduled.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve being widely expected to cut interest rates in September, opening a high-yield savings account may still be a worthwhile financial decision for many savers. While returns are no longer at their peak, rates on these accounts remain significantly higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Experts suggest that initial rate cuts are likely to be gradual, meaning the impact on savings yields will not be immediate. Furthermore, these accounts provide liquidity and access to funds, which is valuable in an unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines for specific groups: adults aged 65 and older, and younger individuals with certain medical conditions that place them at high risk for severe illness. While officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting with a doctor, the narrower formal approval may limit access for some. High-risk conditions include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy, among others. The new vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Novavax are expected to become available in pharmacies and clinics in the coming days.</p>
