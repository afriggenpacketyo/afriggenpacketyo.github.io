Although Baker has recovered, she faces financial challenges due to medical and funeral expenses after her husband's unexpected death.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested its HarmonyOS in space, marking a significant step in reducing reliance on foreign software. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS) was evaluated on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat, demonstrating faster data updates and improved stability. The satellite ran on a domestically produced chip, achieving a fully home-grown hardware-software solution. Following the Lianli mission, national technical standards have been proposed to guide the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in small satellites.</p>
