          <p>Dating app Tinder is now requiring all users in California to undergo a facial recognition scan to verify their identity. The 'Face Check' feature prompts users to take a video selfie, which is then used to confirm that their profile photos are authentic and that they are not a bot. This move is part of a broader effort by Tinder's parent company, Match Group, to combat the rising problem of romance scams and fraudulent accounts. The mandatory verification pilot program comes as Congress also takes action with the Romance Scam Prevention Act.</p>

          <p>NBA star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander has signed a four-year, $285 million contract extension, giving him the richest average annual salary in sports history at $71.25 million. This article compares his deal to other massive contracts across major American sports leagues. While MLB players like Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto have larger total contract values due to their length, top NBA players earn more annually because of smaller roster sizes. The analysis also contrasts these guaranteed deals with the complex, less-guaranteed contracts of top NFL quarterbacks.</p>

          <p>Clean energy stocks, including NextEra Energy and AES, saw a significant jump after a punitive tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the final Senate version of the GOP's major spending bill. The proposed tax would have applied to projects using components from foreign entities like China and could have cost the industry $7 billion. While the removal was a relief for the sector, industry groups noted the bill is still harmful overall, as it accelerates the phase-out of crucial investment and production tax credits that have supported the growth of renewable energy.</p>
