        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article reports on the debate in the UK Parliament regarding a bill to legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales. The bill has undergone significant changes since its initial passing, including the removal of the need for a High Court judge's approval. MPs raised concerns about the role of doctors and potential pressure on vulnerable individuals. The debate included emotional speeches from MPs on both sides of the issue, and a final vote is expected in June. The government has published an impact report projecting NHS savings, but a correction notice revealed an error in the estimated number of assisted deaths. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Scientists have unraveled the mystery behind the flamingo's unique feeding behavior, revealing it to be a sophisticated display of fluid dynamics.

The study suggests that flamingo feeding techniques could inspire improvements in water filtration technology. Optimism score is 80.</p>
