          <p>The House is progressing with President Trump's budget bill, addressing defense, energy, and tax priorities. Three committees voted to advance the legislation, though Republicans are divided on issues like Medicaid and tax cuts. A key point of contention is the state and local tax deduction (SALT) cap, with blue state Republicans seeking an increase. The House aims for a vote next week, but the Senate's input is expected to bring changes to the package, with some Senate Republicans expressing concerns about the House's version.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are facing challenges as they attempt to pass the "big, beautiful bill" due to President Trump's mixed signals on key issues. Trump's suggestions of a tax increase for the wealthy and limiting resources for children have caused confusion among GOP members. While some Republicans oppose raising taxes, Trump's economic message resonates with his blue-collar coalition. The White House expects Republicans to ultimately vote in favor of the bill, despite frustrations over the shrinking size of tax cuts and spending reductions.</p>

          <p>Parts of Texas are experiencing record-high temperatures weeks before the official start of summer. Austin reached a daily record of 99 degrees Fahrenheit, surpassing the previous record set in 2003.

Sara Duterte, likely to survive an impeachment trial, is positioned to be a formidable candidate in the 2028 presidential election, potentially ushering in improved relations with China if she succeeds. Observers note her "pragmatic" stance on China could lead to better ties if she wins, as Marcos's allies fell short in securing Senate seats in recent midterms.</p>
