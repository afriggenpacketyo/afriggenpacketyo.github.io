          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way to earn returns that can outpace inflation, with current top rates surpassing national averages. While the national average for a one-year CD is 2.02% APY, select online banks are offering significantly higher yields, with some reaching up to 4.51% for shorter terms. The article notes an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide better rates than long-term ones, a trend observed since late 2022. To maximize returns, savers are advised to explore offerings from online banks, which typically have lower overhead, and consider laddering CDs of varying terms to capitalize on high short-term rates.

          <p>A new biography, "Claire McCardell: The Designer Who Set Women Free," examines the revolutionary impact of the American fashion designer whose name, once famous, is now largely forgotten. McCardell championed comfort and practicality, introducing innovations like pockets in women's clothing, the popularization of ballet flats, mix-and-match separates, and the wrap dress. Rejecting the restrictive European styles of the mid-20th century, she designed for the active, modern American woman, believing clothes should be easy to wear and live in. Although her brand did not continue after her death in 1958, her design philosophy fundamentally shaped modern womenswear and continues to influence what hangs in closets today.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is executing a trade to sell a portion of its holdings in the semiconductor and software company Broadcom. The sale of 25 shares at approximately $272.78 is intended to lock in a significant gain of around 220% on shares purchased in August 2023. The decision follows the stock's recent surge to an all-time high, driven by its strong potential in the artificial intelligence sector. This move aligns with the club's discipline of taking profits and raising cash when market momentum indicators, like the S&P Oscillator, suggest the market is overbought and may be due for a pullback.

          <p>For those looking to build an emergency fund, high-yield savings accounts currently offer interest rates that significantly outperform traditional options. While the national average savings rate is a mere 0.38% APY, top high-yield accounts from online banks are providing rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, with some even higher. The article emphasizes that online banks can offer these competitive rates due to lower operational costs. Financial planners recommend these accounts as a safe and effective way to grow savings, noting that even small, consistent deposits can benefit from the power of compounding interest, making them accessible for savers at all levels.

          <p>Gold remains a popular safe-haven asset for investors, particularly during times of economic and market uncertainty. As of June 30, 2025, the price of gold stood at $3,288.46 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. The price of the precious metal is influenced by a variety of factors, including global supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Additionally, movements in currency values, particularly the U.S. dollar, and the policies of central banks that hold large gold reserves can significantly impact its market price, making it a dynamic investment.

          <p>Certain widely prescribed medications can interfere with the body's natural ability to regulate temperature, increasing the risk of heat-related illness during hot weather. Drugs such as specific antidepressants (SSRIs and TCAs), antipsychotics, and heart medications like beta-blockers and diuretics can disrupt processes like sweating and fluid balance. For example, some drugs may reduce sweating, making it harder to cool down, while others can cause dehydration. People taking these medications, especially older adults and those with chronic conditions, are advised to stay hydrated, avoid peak heat, and be aware of the warning signs of heatstroke without discontinuing their prescriptions.</p>

According to a state media readout, the plan also involves better integration of domestic and foreign trade, making it easier for export-oriented goods to be sold within China. The policy aims to cultivate strong firms that can operate effectively in both markets, reinforcing China's strategy of economic self-reliance and stability amidst external pressures.</p>

          <p>A recent Citigroup report on U.S. credit card data reveals that spending on luxury goods declined in the first five months of 2025 compared to the previous year. However, the jewelry category has defied this trend, consistently outperforming other luxury segments like handbags and apparel. Monthly spending on luxury jewelry surged 10.1% year-over-year in May, and it was the only category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this resilience is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, its sentimental value, and the recent appreciation in gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Headley was sentenced to life in prison, with the judge stating he will die there. The case, which had remained unsolved for 58 years, was finally cracked in 2023 when advanced forensic testing of DNA evidence from the victim's clothing definitively linked Headley to the crime. The conviction brings a long-awaited sense of justice for the victim's family after nearly six decades of uncertainty.</p>
