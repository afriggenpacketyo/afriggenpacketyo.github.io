Named after Rabbi Leo Baeck, the institute has branches in New York, London, and Jerusalem, serving as vital research hubs. The LBI's extensive digitized collections, comprising over 3.5 million pages of books, letters, photos, and art, are accessible online, aiding scholars and descendants of Jewish survivors worldwide. Despite facing threats from attacks on academic life and the rise of right-wing ideologies, the LBI continues to promote German-Jewish culture through podcasts and other initiatives, ensuring remembrance and combating antisemitism. </p>

          <p>Boeing Global Services' senior vice-president Turbo Sjogren emphasized the need for Europe to reduce its dependence on China for critical minerals, similar to the United States. He highlighted the global nature of the aerospace supply chain, noting that collaboration is essential as no single entity can manage it independently. Sjogren pointed out that US legislation since 1973 has aimed to prevent reliance on countries like China for critical materials in the aerospace and defense sectors. This call to action underscores growing concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities and the importance of diversifying sources for essential resources.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi informed U.S. President Donald Trump that the ceasefire between India and Pakistan was achieved through direct military talks, without U.S. mediation. Modi emphasized that India has never accepted third-party mediation on matters concerning Kashmir. The call, the first between the two leaders since April 22, addressed Trump's previous claims of U.S. involvement in brokering the ceasefire. Modi also conveyed that India considers cross-border terrorism an act of war, with ongoing operations against terrorists. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to skirt higher duties imposed by the U.S. government by altering materials or dimensions of products to fit into lower-tariff categories. This practice involves strategic design choices to reclassify products under different harmonized system codes, which can result in significant duty savings. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. While generally legal, companies must avoid fraudulent misrepresentation of product classifications, as illustrated by Ford's case involving Transit Connect vans. </p>
