          <p>President Lee Jae-myung of South Korea stated that South Korean companies will be hesitant to invest in the U.S. after a large immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia led to the arrest of over 300 South Korean nationals. Lee emphasized that sending workers to set up overseas factories is a common practice, and the raid raises concerns about the feasibility of establishing manufacturing facilities in the U.S. He also mentioned Seoul is negotiating with Washington for visa options for South Korean workers, including securing higher quotas or creating new visa categories. The White House has defended the operation, but media in South Korea have described the raid as a "shock." The current situation could potentially strain relations between the two countries. Optimism here is cautious given the economic implications. </p>

          <p>Global equities are rallying, with the MSCI All Country World Index reaching record highs, driven by easing inflation, strong corporate earnings, and expectations of U.S. rate cuts. The S&P 500 also closed at a record high, while Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi have hit all-time highs this week. Recent U.S. data indicating labor market weakness and a soft producer price index have further fueled investor optimism, bolstering the likelihood of Federal Reserve rate cuts. Oracle's positive outlook for AI-related revenue has also boosted confidence in the tech sector's rally. (not investment advice)</p>

Several papers picture Prince Harry arriving at Clarence House for tea with his father, while others focus on the growing calls for Lord Mandelson's dismissal. Additionally, some newspapers report on Britain's consideration of sending fighter jets to Poland and Merck's decision to scrap a research center in London.

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan in a strategic mineral-exploration initiative over the past five years, leading to significant discoveries in oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium. Chinese geologists have mapped the reserves, distribution, and utilization of 163 mineral types, uncovering over 500 large and medium-sized oil, gas, and mineral deposits. These efforts aim to reduce China's reliance on imports and secure its supply chains amid geopolitical tensions. Discoveries include 10 large oilfields, 19 major gas fields, and substantial deep coal bed methane reserves.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, at Clarence House in London for their first face-to-face meeting since February 2024, potentially marking a small but significant step towards reconciliation. This meeting follows months of subtle clues suggesting a shift in tone from Prince Harry, who expressed a desire for reconciliation with his family. While Buckingham Palace and Prince Harry's team have remained tight-lipped about the details of their conversations, the fact that the reunion occurred suggests a slight shift in their relationship. The road to full family reconciliation remains uncertain, but this meeting represents a move in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Bad Bunny explained his decision to exclude U.S. dates from his world tour, citing concerns about ICE enforcement outside his concert venues. He expressed worry about the potential for ICE to be present at his concerts, leading to the deportation of Latino fans. The artist noted that there were many reasons for not performing in the U.S., none of which were out of hate. He suggested that U.S. fans could travel to Puerto Rico or other parts of the world to see his shows. The artist has previously spoken out against ICE raids.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks in a dry river channel on Mars that may contain potential signs of ancient microscopic life. The rover cannot directly detect life, but it has gathered samples from areas deemed suitable for hosting life billions of years ago. Scientists found organic carbon and chemical compounds that, on Earth, are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. While non-biological processes could be responsible, lead researcher Joel Hurowitz calls it the best, most compelling candidate yet in the search for potential signs of long-ago life. The samples await retrieval to Earth for in-depth analysis.</p>

          <p>China has opened the world's longest cable-stayed bridge over the Yangtze River, connecting the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou in Jiangsu province. The Changtai Yangtze River Bridge stretches 10.3km and features a main span of 1,208 meters. This bridge is the river’s first crossing to carry an expressway, regular road, and intercity railway on the same structure. A distinctive feature is its asymmetrical lower deck, with a railway on one side and a regular road on the other, marking the first use of a side-by-side traffic layout in a large-span bridge.</p>

          <p>Approximately 75 cargo containers fell off a stationed vessel at the Port of Long Beach, resulting in a light oil sheen, a sprained ankle, and waterlogged cargo. The U.S. Coast Guard and the National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the incident, which occurred while the vessel was offloading at Pier G. The containers struck and damaged a smaller clean-air barge, causing a leak of renewable diesel. An oil spill response team is working to contain the sheen, and authorities are assessing the affected cargo and containers. The port is fully operational despite the incident.</p>

          <p>Senior cancer doctors are warning that excessive red tape is hindering access to the latest cancer treatments for some patients in England. The Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) says bureaucracy is stifling innovation, leading to a postcode lottery where cutting-edge treatments are only available in larger, better-funded units. The RCR is calling for red tape to be cut and for commissioners to listen to clinicians to improve patient care. The government says a new cancer strategy is expected later this year.</p>

          <p>China is adopting a lean and mean approach to artificial intelligence, focusing on practical use cases rather than massive investments. Beijing launched a national AI fund and is rolling out plans to integrate AI across the economy and society as part of the "AI+" initiative. China's strategy contrasts with the U.S.'s pursuit of human-level artificial general intelligence. Despite lagging in advanced chips, China aims to leverage its resources and infrastructure to overcome hurdles and become a global AI innovation center by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>
