          <h2>Trump's UK Trade Deal Signals 10% Baseline Tariffs Are Here to Stay</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 04:35:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.K. and U.S. have agreed to a trade deal that includes a 10% tariff on most goods imported to the U.S. from the U.K., with exceptions for specific sectors like autos, steel, and aluminum. This deal, the first since President Trump unveiled his reciprocal tariffs, suggests that a 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain in place for other trading partners. Analysts believe that this deal signals more flexibility on sectoral tariffs but indicates that tariff-free agreements are unlikely under Trump's administration. The agreement allows the U.K. to export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, while steel and aluminum exports are tariff-free.</p>

          <p>Some luxury labels are pulling back from steep markdowns in China, seeking to rebuild an image of exclusivity to lure back wealthy shoppers. Brands like Balenciaga and Versace have significantly reduced or eliminated discounts on platforms like Tmall. This trend marks a shift from chasing short-term revenue to cultivating long-term brand affinity. The move is aimed at investing in relevance, desirability, and premium experiences to foster long-term loyalty among consumers in China.</p>

          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on some goods traded between the countries, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While President Trump's blanket 10% tariffs on imports from countries around the world remains in place and still applies to most UK goods entering the US, this deal reverses or cuts some of those tariffs on specific goods. Car tariffs are cut to 10% for a maximum of 100,000 UK cars, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped. Discussions on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax on US firms.</p>

          <p>Republican District Attorney George Brauchler, serving Colorado's 23rd Judicial District, is implementing a tough-on-crime approach, emphasizing accountability and enforcing the rule of law. Brauchler secured a first-degree murder conviction in a high-profile DUI case, marking the first murder trial in the newly formed district. He argues that the criminal justice system has lost sight of its purpose, particularly in addressing day-to-day crimes like DUI. Brauchler's approach has been well-received, reflecting a shift in public sentiment towards personal responsibility for criminal conduct.</p>
