        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New health guidance, based on research from King's College London, recommends specific dietary changes like consuming several kiwi fruit daily and drinking mineral-rich water as effective remedies for constipation. This advice suggests focusing on these items as a better starting point than merely increasing overall fiber intake. The article explains that magnesium oxide supplements were also found to be beneficial, improving symptoms such as lower tummy pain, bloating, and straining. For the one in ten people experiencing persistent constipation, these targeted interventions, including 8-10 prunes a day, work by increasing stool volume and water content in the gut, offering practical and accessible solutions beyond broad dietary recommendations.</p>

          <h2>Debunking Three Common Credit Card Debt Myths Impacting Personal Finances</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-13 12:13:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article debunks three persistent credit card debt myths that can significantly harm personal finances, particularly given current average interest rates exceeding 22%. The first myth, that carrying a small balance helps your credit score, is false; it only incurs interest without credit score benefit. What truly matters is a low credit utilization ratio, achievable by paying balances in full. Secondly, relying solely on minimum payments is an unsustainable strategy, as these often cover mostly interest, prolonging debt for decades and costing thousands. Lastly, closing old credit cards can negatively impact credit scores by reducing total available credit and shortening credit history. Understanding these misconceptions is vital for effectively managing debt and fostering financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

The article captures the jubilant mood as Trump spoke, coinciding with Israel's release of 250 Palestinian prisoners and over 1,700 detainees. He lauded his special Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, for his pivotal role in brokering the ceasefire, even suggesting President Isaac Herzog pardon Prime Minister Netanyahu for corruption charges. Trump also recounted advising Netanyahu to end the conflict, asserting the "brilliance" of the timing for focusing on peace and reconstruction, a sentiment echoed by Hillary Clinton's rare praise for the deal.</p>

          <p>US stocks experienced a significant rebound from Friday's plunge after President Trump softened his rhetoric on China tariffs, alleviating market concerns about escalating trade tensions. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq composite all recorded substantial gains, recouping some losses from Trump's earlier threat of additional 100% tariffs on Chinese imports. The article attributes this market recovery to Trump's conciliatory social media post, stating "all will be fine" with China. While global trade conflicts continue to pose a risk to investor confidence, market focus is now shifting towards the impending earnings season and delayed inflation data, with chipmakers notably leading Monday's gains.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot successfully negotiated a landmark medicine deal with the Trump administration, becoming the first non-U.S. drugmaker to secure such an agreement and effectively shielding his company from threatened steep tariffs on imports. The article outlines Soriot's extensive strategic engagement, including public and private meetings with President Trump and his officials since November of the previous year, culminating in a White House signing ceremony. This agreement, aimed at lowering drug prices for millions of Americans, also involved AstraZeneca's commitment to a $4.5 billion manufacturing expansion in Virginia. Soriot's adept handling of Trump's trade policies is seen as a significant win, providing clarity and ensuring continued growth for AstraZeneca in the vital U.S. pharmaceuticals market.
