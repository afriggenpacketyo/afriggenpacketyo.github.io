          <p>Shares of American Eagle rose approximately 5% after the apparel company announced a limited-edition collaboration with NFL star Travis Kelce's sportswear brand, Tru Kolors. The announcement came strategically just one day after Kelce and singer Taylor Swift revealed their engagement, generating global buzz. This partnership, which has been over a year in the making, features vintage-inspired T-shirts and reimagined varsity jackets. The stock bump mirrors a similar surge seen after a previous collaboration with actress Sydney Sweeney, highlighting the significant market impact of celebrity endorsements and timely marketing.</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% after the retailer significantly surpassed Wall Street's fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, despite an overall decline in sales. The company tightened its full-year sales guidance to reflect the higher end of its previous range and revised its adjusted earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed sales challenges to lower and middle-income customers trading down, but highlighted strategic efforts like reintroducing petite sections and jewelry, overhauling discount strategies, and focusing on lower-priced exclusive brands. The company successfully reduced inventory, and sales trends showed improvement throughout the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United States Ryder Cup captain Keegan Bradley has made the decision not to select himself as a player for the upcoming match against Europe next month. The 39-year-old revealed his six wildcard picks, completing the 12-strong team set to compete at Bethpage Black from September 26-28. Bradley, who is the youngest US captain since Arnold Palmer in 1963, stated that while it "broke his heart not to play," his ultimate goal was to serve as the most effective captain possible. His decision was made after careful consideration, prioritizing team leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of US container data reveals that retailers such as Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below are employing varied strategies to manage the economic impact of tariffs. Abercrombie & Fitch utilizes a diversified global supply chain, shifting production and enhancing supplier contracts to absorb higher costs without implementing broad price increases. Best Buy front-loaded its freight in June, reducing its reliance on China, while discount retailer Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese tariffs, leverages its flexible inventory to adapt. These distinct approaches highlight how businesses tailor their plans based on product categories and customer bases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutors in Washington, D.C., have failed to secure a felony assault indictment against Sean Dunn, who was accused of throwing a sandwich at a Customs and Border Patrol agent. This outcome follows a similar instance where federal grand juries repeatedly declined to indict another individual, Sidney Reid, for assaulting an FBI agent, eventually leading to a misdemeanor charge. Dunn's confrontation with the CBP agent garnered significant public attention, amplified by a White House video of his arrest. Prosecutors now face a 30-day deadline under the Speedy Trial Act to decide on further legal action.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified only as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a locked guesthouse bedroom in Sichuan province. Realizing her phone was outside and the door's malfunction, she bit her finger and used her blood to write "110 625" (the emergency number and her room number) on a pillow. She then threw the pillow from the sixth-floor window. A quick-thinking food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the desperate message and immediately alerted the police, leading to her prompt rescue. Zhang was later awarded 3,000 yuan for his actions.</p>

          <p>Scientists have announced the discovery of a bizarre armored dinosaur species, Spicomellus afer, in Morocco, dating back 165 million years. This unique find represents the oldest known ankylosaur and features metre-long spikes fused directly onto its neck bones, a characteristic unprecedented in any known animal, living or extinct. Researchers are now re-evaluating theories on ankylosaur evolution, suggesting that early armored dinosaurs might have developed elaborate defenses primarily for display before these structures became co-opted for protection against later, larger predators. The fossil, unearthed by a local farmer, is hailed as one of the strangest dinosaurs ever found.</p>

Conversely, professional fields like dentistry, veterinary medicine, and law often involve substantial educational debt coupled with starting salaries that can prolong repayment to 10-20 years.
