Appearing on the "New Heights" podcast, she revealed the album was written in Europe during her Eras Tour and explores the behind-the-scenes aspects of her life during that period. The project reunites her with producers Max Martin and Shellback, and Swift described the songs as energetic "bangers." During the podcast, she also discussed her relationship with Travis Kelce and shared emotional details about successfully buying back her master recordings.</p>

          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin, a former senior economist in the George W. Bush administration, has confirmed he is being considered for the position of Federal Reserve chair. In a recent interview, Sumerlin stated he would support an aggressive interest rate cut of 50 basis points, aligning him with President Trump's calls for monetary easing. Sumerlin, who is reportedly close with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, said he was contacted by the White House about his inclusion on a list of candidates. He emphasized the importance of Fed independence but noted his nomination would depend on being "in synch" with the president. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage in the United States has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of declining rates, providing a potential boost to the housing market, which has been sluggish due to high borrowing costs. The drop is partly influenced by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate next month, following weaker-than-expected jobs data. Despite the recent decline, economists generally anticipate that mortgage rates will remain above 6% for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In her campaign for Virginia governor, Democrat Abigail Spanberger is reaching out to Latino voters with her first Spanish-language radio advertisement. The ad focuses on economic issues, with Spanberger promising to lower costs for families, a key concern for this demographic. This move is part of a broader Democratic effort to reconnect with Latino voters, who showed increased support for Republicans in the 2024 election. Polling suggests that the economy remains the top priority for Latino voters, and Spanberger's campaign is aiming to address these concerns early to build support ahead of the 2025 election.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have used generative AI to design two novel antibiotic compounds that have shown effectiveness against drug-resistant bacteria like gonorrhoea and MRSA. The AI was trained on millions of chemical structures to learn how molecules affect bacterial growth, allowing it to invent entirely new drugs atom-by-atom. In laboratory and animal tests, these compounds successfully killed the targeted superbugs. While these potential drugs are still years away from clinical use, the breakthrough suggests that AI could revolutionize antibiotic discovery and help combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in top grades, with 28.3% of entries marked A* or A, and boys have outperformed girls for the first time since 2018. A record number of 18-year-olds secured a place at their first-choice university, with the most selective institutions seeing the steepest growth in acceptances. However, a growing regional disparity in England is evident, as the performance gap between London and the North East has widened. These results are the second set graded to pre-pandemic standards, affecting a student cohort that also faced disruptions during their earlier GCSE years.</p>

          <p>Pilot Raphael Domjan has broken the altitude record for a solar-powered electric plane, reaching 9,521 meters (31,237 feet) during a flight from Sion, Switzerland. The flight, which lasted over five hours in the SolarStratos aircraft, surpassed the previous record of 9,235 meters set 15 years ago. The team highlighted a moment when the solar plane crossed paths with a commercial airliner, symbolizing the potential for decarbonized aviation. Domjan's next goal is to fly the solar plane into the stratosphere, demonstrating the capabilities of solar energy and promoting environmental protection.</p>

          <p>Cottontail rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, have been observed with large, horn-like growths on their faces, prompting concern from local residents. However, wildlife officials have clarified that the animals are infected with the Shope papillomavirus, a relatively common and mostly harmless virus. The virus, which is not transmissible to humans or pets, causes tumors that typically resolve on their own as the rabbit's immune system fights off the infection. This virus is believed to be the inspiration for the folkloric jackalope and has played a role in historical research on the link between viruses and cancer.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Young, a 13-year-old pupil from Glasgow, has been named one of TIME magazine's 'Girls of the Year' for inventing a solar-powered heating blanket designed to help homeless people. Her concept, which uses solar panels to charge a battery pack that provides warmth at night, won a national engineering competition. The idea was then developed into a working prototype by the engineering firm Thales, with dozens of units distributed to a local homeless charity. In recognition of her innovative and compassionate design, Rebecca was featured on a digital cover of the magazine and honored with a custom Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <p>A woman from Manhattan, New York, discovered a 2.30-carat colorless diamond during a visit to Arkansas's Crater of Diamonds State Park. Micherre Fox, 31, had spent a month searching the park with the specific goal of finding a diamond to create her own engagement ring, a personal project she felt was symbolic of problem-solving through hard work. She found the gem on her last day of searching at the park, which is the only public site in the world where visitors can search for diamonds at their original volcanic source. The stone is the third-largest diamond found in the park this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advocacy group The Senior Citizens League is projecting a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for Social Security beneficiaries in 2026. This estimate, based on recent inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% boost retirees received for the current year. The Social Security Administration will officially announce the 2026 COLA in October after reviewing inflation figures from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists are concerned that a modest COLA may not be sufficient to cover rising expenses for seniors if inflation accelerates later in the year.
