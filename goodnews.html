        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI announced it is restructuring as a public benefit corporation, allowing the nonprofit that controls it to retain its grip on the company. This decision is seen as a win for critics like Elon Musk, who argued OpenAI was too focused on profits. The nonprofit will be OpenAI's largest shareholder and will pick the board members of the new entity. The move comes after Musk sued OpenAI, claiming it prioritized commercial interests over public good, and after a consortium offered to buy the nonprofit's assets.</p>

          <p>A skull discovered at the Basilica of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Hungary may belong to Matthias Corvinus, who ruled as king of Hungary and Croatia from 1458 to 1490. Facial reconstruction specialist Emese G√°bor found a high degree of morphological similarity between the unknown skull and that of Corvinus' son, J√°nos Corvinus. The greenish discoloration on the bone surface suggests the presence of a metal crown, while the skull's physical features align with what is known about Corvinus' age and height. Researchers plan further studies, including genomic and DNA analyses, to confirm the skull's identity.</p>

          <p>Mr. Deepfakes, one of the largest websites dedicated to deepfake pornography, has shut down after a critical service provider withdrew its support. Created in 2018, the site was a prominent marketplace for deepfake porn of celebrities and individuals, allowing users to upload, view, and buy custom nonconsensual content. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which makes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery a federal crime. Experts see this as a positive step in combating deepfake abuse, though they acknowledge the issue will persist on other platforms.</p>
