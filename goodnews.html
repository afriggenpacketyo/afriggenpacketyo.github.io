          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has reduced the list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair to five individuals after a series of intensive interviews. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as Kevin Hassett, Kevin Warsh, and Rick Rieder. The selection criteria emphasize a willingness to reform the Fed's structure and policies, with a preference for a candidate who might reduce the institution's size and scope. The next round of interviews will proceed in the coming months before a final recommendation is made to President Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is now in effect, with the Israeli military initiating a withdrawal of its forces to a designated buffer zone within Gaza. The first phase of the agreement, approved by the Israeli Cabinet, centers on the release of all remaining hostages held by Hamas in exchange for the release of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. This development marks a potential end to the devastating two-year war that began with the October 7th attack, a conflict that has caused tens of thousands of deaths and left Gaza in ruins.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have secured their spot in the National League Championship Series by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies, even without their star-studded offense firing on all cylinders. The team relied heavily on its strong pitching to win the series, as key hitters like Shohei Ohtani had a relatively quiet performance at the plate. Despite the victory, players and management acknowledged they have yet to reach their full potential, expressing confidence that there is 'another gear' they can hit as the postseason continues.</p>

          <p>The European Union has launched an inquiry into four major U.S. technology platforms—Apple, Google, Snapchat, and YouTube—over concerns that their child protection measures are inadequate. Under the Digital Services Act (DSA), the European Commission is demanding information on how these companies ensure high levels of safety and privacy for minors. The investigation will scrutinize issues such as age verification systems, the potential for algorithmic addiction, and access to inappropriate content, with non-compliance potentially leading to substantial fines.</p>

          <p>The puzzling discovery of a 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker in a New Orleans garden has been solved, with its journey traced back to a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II. The soldier's granddaughter explained that he brought the artifact home as a souvenir, and it was passed down through the family until she inadvertently left it behind at a former residence. The headstone, which belongs to a second-century Roman sailor, has now been given to the FBI's art crime team to be repatriated to its original museum in Italy.</p>

          <p>In an era of divisive political battles over public monuments, the musical memorials created by Leonard Bernstein following the assassination of John F. Kennedy offer a powerful alternative. By conducting Mahler's transcendent 'Resurrection' symphony and composing the eclectic 'MASS' for the Kennedy Center opening, Bernstein created spaces for collective grief and national healing that spoke to shared existence rather than specific politics. This artistic approach serves as a reminder that culture can unite a fractured society and memorialize events in a way that transcends partisan conflict.</p>

          <p>Washington Irving's classic story 'Rip Van Winkle' is analyzed not just as a tale of a long sleep, but as a crucial American folktale about national identity, memory, and radical transformation. By having its protagonist sleep through the American Revolution, the story powerfully illustrates the abrupt and disorienting birth of a new nation and its culture. Rip's eventual acceptance as a living 'chronicle of the old times' symbolizes the process of creating a shared past, making the story itself a foundational myth that helped a young country forge a collective memory.</p>

          <p>This historical analysis explores how Abraham Lincoln reframed the American Revolution as an active, unfinished project to address the moral crisis of slavery. Rather than treating the Founders with static reverence, Lincoln argued their ideals, particularly the universal equality stated in the Declaration of Independence, imposed a living duty on future generations to pursue justice. By casting the Civil War as a struggle to fulfill the Revolution's original promise, he transformed its legacy from a fixed inheritance into a dynamic force for achieving a 'new birth of freedom.'</p>

After her husband's death, Eliza lived for another half-century, during which she became a pioneering philanthropist, co-founding New York's first private orphanage, and a crucial historian, meticulously preserving the records of the founding generation.</p>

This commitment to telling the full story often challenges visitors' preconceptions and places the museum at the center of the national debate over historical memory.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out Drake's defamation lawsuit concerning Kendrick Lamar's widely popular diss track, 'Not Like Us.' The judge ruled that the song's serious allegations were 'nonactionable opinion' because they were made within the context of a rap battle, a forum known for 'hyperbolic vituperations.' The court concluded that a reasonable listener would not interpret the incendiary lyrics as conveying verifiable facts, but rather as part of the heightened and figurative language characteristic of the genre's historic feuds.</p>
