          <p>Stock prices for U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies saw a significant increase after the European Union agreed to a major energy purchase from the United States. The deal, valued at $750 billion, is part of a broader trade agreement and aims to reduce the EU's reliance on Russian energy. Companies like Cheniere, Venture Global, and NextDecade experienced notable gains in their share values. EU President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted that the purchases will enhance Europe's energy security by diversifying its supply sources. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Haptic Technology Aims to Improve Aviation Safety by Preventing Pilot Disorientation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:51:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the University of Maryland are developing a new technology to combat spatial disorientation, a factor in 5% to 10% of general aviation accidents. The system, which could be integrated into a flight suit or pilot's seat, uses haptic vibrations to provide sensory cues, similar to a car's lane departure warning. This tactile feedback is designed to help pilots maintain their orientation when visual and equilibrium senses become unreliable, particularly in poor weather. The goal is to reduce the high fatality rate associated with such incidents.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are considering secure options like certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts to grow their money. This article compares the potential earnings of placing $20,000 into either a short-term CD or a high-yield savings account. Calculations show that for terms of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, CDs currently offer a slightly higher return. The fixed rate of a CD also provides a guaranteed return, unlike the variable rate of a savings account which could decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Facing a demographic crisis with a population that has declined for three consecutive years, the Chinese government is introducing new financial incentives to encourage births. Beijing will offer parents an annual subsidy of 3,600 yuan (about $500) for each child under the age of three. This national policy follows various provincial-level efforts to address low marriage rates and the high cost of child-rearing. While analysts see the move as a positive step, they caution that the amount is likely too small to significantly impact the birth rate or reverse the population decline on its own.</p>

          <p>After a period where "false nines" and versatile attackers dominated top-level soccer, the traditional center-forward is making a significant comeback. This summer's transfer market has been defined by a "carousel of strikers," highlighting a tactical shift. The success of players like Erling Haaland at Manchester City has demonstrated the value of a dedicated goalscorer, even in possession-based systems. This article explores how players such as Alexander Isak and Viktor Gyökeres represent a new age for the No. 9, combining traditional poaching instincts with a more complete, modern skillset.</p>

          <p>With high home values and shifting interest rates, homeowners are weighing how best to tap into their equity. This article consults mortgage professionals on whether a home equity line of credit (HELOC) or a home equity loan is the better option. Experts suggest home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed rate, which is appealing amid market uncertainty. Conversely, HELOCs provide flexibility and could become cheaper if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. The best choice ultimately depends on the borrower's specific financial needs and risk tolerance.

Despite this, players currently receive just over 9% of league revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share seen in men's professional sports leagues.
