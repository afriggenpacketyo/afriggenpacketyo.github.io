          <p>Thirteen-year-old Faizan Zaki emerged as the champion of the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, triumphing over eight other finalists and securing a prize package exceeding $50,000. Zaki, who was a pre-competition favorite and the previous year's runner-up, clinched the title by correctly spelling "√©claircissement" after a dramatic final round where multiple finalists misspelled their words. The competition, marked by late-round tension, highlighted the historical significance of the event, which began a century ago in 1925, although this year's winner is the 110th champion due to past ties. The event featured nine students aged 11 to 14 who advanced from local and regional bees, showcasing the culmination of their spelling prowess on the national stage.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will hold a press conference with Elon Musk at the Oval Office, marking the end of Musk's official role in the Trump administration as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Musk's 130-day appointment as a "special government employee" is concluding, but Trump hinted that Musk will continue to assist the administration. DOGE, created by executive order on Inauguration Day, has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts, though these claims have faced scrutiny. Despite criticism from Democrats, markets have reacted positively to Musk's return to the private sector, with Tesla shares rising.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's departure from his role in Washington leaves behind a legacy of disruption and cost-cutting, as well as questions about oversight of his companies. During his time in government, Musk spearheaded efforts to revamp government efficiency, but his methods stirred controversy and faced legal challenges. While he steps away from his official duties, his companies are expected to encounter less scrutiny, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest. The article suggests that Musk's influence may persist despite his exit, as his actions have reshaped the landscape of government operations and regulatory oversight.</p>

          <p>Coastal rail service linking Orange and San Diego counties is scheduled to resume on June 7 after nearly six weeks of construction to reinforce tracks at risk of landslides and coastal erosion. The California Coastal Commission approved emergency construction last month after sections of the rail were deemed unstable. Crews placed 5,900 tons of boulders and will add 240,000 cubic yards of sand to stabilize the rail line, with an estimated project cost of $300 million. The Orange County Transportation Authority acknowledged the recurring interruptions to passenger rail service due to eroding bluffs in San Clemente.</p>

The project, based on a protocol proposed by Chinese and American scientists, aims to enhance Beijing's position in international disarmament talks. Key challenges included training the AI with sensitive nuclear data, ensuring the system's security to prevent tech leaks, and convincing skeptical nations to adopt the new verification methods. The CIAE team acknowledged the classified nature of nuclear warhead data, limiting the disclosure of specific information in their published paper.</p>

Although he was not knocked down during the bout, Shigeoka began losing consciousness in the ring after the final bell and was stretchered out. Japan Boxing Commission rules prohibit a boxer who has had a craniotomy from holding a professional license, meaning Shigeoka must retire from the sport.</p>

          <p>An investigation into stolen pickup truck tailgates in Houston has uncovered a sophisticated scheme involving the cloning of key fobs to steal vehicles. Victims tracked down suspects through social media posts, leading to the discovery of blank key fobs and a key programming device. Thieves access a vehicle's onboard diagnostics (OBD) port to create new key fobs, enabling them to steal cars in as little as five minutes. Authorities are advising vehicle owners to take precautions, such as locking tailgates, using OBD port protection, and storing key fobs in Faraday bags, to prevent key fob-related car thefts.</p>
