          <p>South Korea has ceased its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking a step towards easing tensions. The decision, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, aims to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. North Korea has not yet commented on the move, but the South hopes this will encourage dialogue after years of heightened tensions. This action follows Lee's campaign promise to halt the broadcasts, which had caused discomfort for South Korean residents near the border, and is seen as a proactive effort to reduce military tensions.</p>
