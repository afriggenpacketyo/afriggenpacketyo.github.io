          <p>The Cannes Film Festival has implemented a new dress code banning nudity and excessively voluminous outfits. Despite the new rules, celebrities like Halle Berry, Angelina Jolie, and Heidi Klum made striking appearances on the red carpet. Berry had to change her original dress due to its large train, while others like Jolie and Stone donned elegant gowns. The new dress code aims to maintain decency and prevent traffic flow issues on the red carpet, with festival staff enforcing the regulations.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court has criticized the administration for providing inadequate warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Lower courts have also intervened to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their deportations. This pushback underscores the constitutional right to due process for all individuals, regardless of citizenship status, before being deprived of liberty or property.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria surprised senior officials at the Treasury Department. The announcement lacked specifics, causing officials to scramble for understanding, though Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was aware. The decision followed lobbying from Syria's transitional government for sanctions relief, which they blamed for economic struggles. The move aligns with support from Turkey and Saudi Arabia for normalizing relations with Syria, despite potential conflicts with existing sanctions.</p>

          <p>As the United States and China decrease their presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its investment and influence on the continent. Emirati corporations are investing in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects, with $110 billion in deals announced since 2019. This expansion is part of a plan to diversify the UAE's economy and increase its control over global supply chains. While the Emirates' involvement has strategic and economic benefits, it has also raised concerns regarding its role in conflicts and its relationship with China.</p>
