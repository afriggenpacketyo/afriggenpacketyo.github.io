          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the scientific concept of black holes creating a form of cosmic "music" through gravitational waves. While mature black holes are known for letting nothing escape, newly formed ones, created from events like stellar collapses or mergers, emit distinct vibrations as they settle into a stable shape. These vibrations, or 'ringdowns,' are described as a pure, strange music that distorts space-time itself. Scientists believe that by studying these gravitational waves, they can understand the precise properties of a black hole, as its final form is perfectly sculpted by its own gravity, mass, and angular momentum, offering a unique window into general relativity.</p>

          <p>Supermodel and "America's Got Talent" judge Heidi Klum shared a photo on Instagram from a recent seaside photoshoot in St. Barth where she experienced a minor wardrobe malfunction. While posing in the ocean wearing only bikini bottoms and using seashells for top coverage, she humorously captioned the image "Woopsy," using a star emoji to maintain modesty. The article also touches upon Klum's response to public criticism regarding the 17-year age gap with her husband, rockstar Tom Kaulitz. She attributes the negativity to spitefulness and age-shaming, emphasizing that she is a mature woman aware of her life choices.</p>

          <h2>China's New Childcare Subsidies May Disproportionately Benefit Poorer Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a national childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan annually for each child under three, in an effort to address its low birth rate. This explainer analyzes the potential impact of the scheme, suggesting it will have a more significant effect in less affluent regions. For instance, the subsidy represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4% in the wealthy city of Shanghai. This disparity means the policy is expected to boost consumption and potentially birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reached an agreement with the U.S. government to pay 15% of their revenue from specific chip sales in China. This deal is a condition for securing export licenses to sell advanced semiconductors, such as Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, to the Chinese market. The agreement follows months of lobbying and represents a significant development amid easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. The move allows American technology to compete globally while adhering to U.S. export control regulations designed to address national security concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

While welcoming efforts to end the conflict, the European nations stressed their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and the principle that international borders should not be changed by force. The White House has indicated it remains open to including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but the meeting is currently set to be bilateral at Putin's request.</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose secured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years by winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. After both players finished tied at 16-under-par, they matched each other on the first two sudden-death holes before Rose clinched the title with a birdie on the third. The victory was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke behind, tied for third. For Rose, the win marks his 12th on the PGA Tour and a gratifying return to form.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has introduced new measures to help newly qualified nurses and midwives in England secure jobs within the National Health Service (NHS). The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing NHS trusts to hire graduates based on anticipated needs rather than waiting for formal vacancies to arise. This addresses a growing problem where the number of graduates has exceeded available positions, leaving many without employment after completing their training. While nursing unions have welcomed the move as a step in the right direction, employer representatives have raised concerns about how these new positions will be funded amid existing budget pressures.</p>

In contrast, Taylor Heinicke, who is also vying for the backup role, struggled in his first preseason action. The game also highlighted the Chargers' defensive depth, with edge rusher Caleb Murphy recording two sacks and undrafted rookie Eric Rogers making two interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown.</p>

          <p>A 60-foot passenger boat named Discovery ran aground in powerful surf near Honolulu's Kewalo Basin Harbor with two crew members aboard. Video captured the vessel being tossed by large waves, nearly flipping before coming to rest in shallow water. The boat's operator reported that two large waves disrupted its course, causing a loss of propulsion after it grounded. No injuries were reported, and the boat's fuel and batteries were removed to prevent pollution. The vessel is owned by Atlantis Adventures, which uses it to ferry passengers for submarine tours, and a plan is in place to tow it away.</p>

          <p>U.S. fashion designer Willy Chavarria and Adidas have issued apologies following criticism that their "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe constituted cultural appropriation. The design was inspired by traditional Mexican huarache sandals but was reportedly produced without consulting or crediting the Indigenous artisan communities who originated it. The issue drew condemnation, including from Mexico's president, who highlighted the common practice of large companies taking designs from Indigenous communities. In response to the backlash, Adidas has removed promotional images and stated its commitment to engaging in a respectful dialogue with the affected community to repair the damage.</p>

          <p>Historian Rana Mitter, a leading expert on modern China, argues that the impact of World War II on the nation's development is frequently underestimated in both China and the West. He explains that Japan's invasion during the war was a pivotal event that fundamentally shaped Chinese politics, society, and culture. The conflict resulted in the widespread destruction of infrastructure and communications that had been built in the preceding decades. According to Mitter, this devastation was a massive setback, effectively forcing China to start its modernization process over again in the post-war era, a factor crucial to understanding its subsequent trajectory.</p>
