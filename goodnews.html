          <p>Miki Sudo has once again won the women's division of the annual Nathan's Famous Hot Dog Eating Contest, a Fourth of July tradition in Coney Island, New York. The 39-year-old champion consumed 32 hot dogs and buns in ten minutes to claim her 11th victory in the event. While she fell short of her 2024 world record of 51 hot dogs, she comfortably beat her closest competitor, Michelle Lesco, who finished with 22. The contest, which offers a $20,000 prize, continues to be a major holiday spectacle, with the men's competition following later in the day.</p>

          <p>Despite Chinese state media criticizing the addictive nature of "blind box" toys and calling for tighter regulations, analysts believe Pop Mart, maker of the popular Labubu dolls, will remain resilient. The company's primary demographic consists of young adults and millennials, not the children under eight that the proposed regulations target. Furthermore, Pop Mart has seen explosive international growth, with overseas sales in 2024 surpassing its total sales from 2021, which is expected to cushion any potential impact from domestic policy changes. The brand's success highlights a unique consumer trend in an otherwise sluggish Chinese economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Toronto Blue Jays' four-game sweep of the New York Yankees, which vaulted them into first place in the AL East, a broadcaster for the Canadian team took a celebratory jab at a New York announcer. During the series, Yankees announcer Michael Kay had claimed the Blue Jays were "not a first-place team," citing their run differential. After the sweep, SportsNet's Jamie Campbell, holding a broom, noted that a certain Yankee broadcaster would now have to admit the standings prove otherwise. The Yankees have struggled recently, losing a seven-game division lead and now trailing the Blue Jays by one game.</p>

          <h2>Expert Suggests Chinese High-Tech Industrial Model Could Help Revitalize US Rust Belt</h2>

          <p>An international security expert has proposed that the United States could learn from China's model of integrating university research with advanced manufacturing to rejuvenate its own rust-belt cities. Following a trip to China, Professor Robert Pape highlighted the success of hi-tech clusters like Wuhan's "Optics Valley," which has transformed a second-tier city into an industrial powerhouse. Pape suggests that this approach of fostering university-industry collaboration outside of traditional tech hubs like Silicon Valley could offer a pathway for economic revival in struggling American regions. The idea emerges amid a temporary de-escalation in the US-China trade war.</p>

          <p>Ismail Abdo, the alleged head of the Rumba crime organization and one of Sweden's most wanted criminals, has been arrested in Turkey. Abdo is accused of orchestrating drug trafficking and instigating a wave of violent crime in Sweden from abroad. He was formerly allied with Rawa Majid of the Foxtrot network, but a falling out between them is believed to have triggered a violent gang war that has plagued the country. The arrest is the result of collaboration between Turkish and Swedish authorities as Sweden grapples with escalating organized crime, including bombings and shootings.</p>

          <p>After 42 years, an indictment has been made in the disappearance of Teresa Peroni, a 27-year-old woman last seen in Selma, Oregon, in 1983. Her former boyfriend, Mark Sanfratello, now 72, was indicted on murder charges after new DNA evidence emerged. Peroni vanished after an argument with Sanfratello at a party. The case went cold until a human skull found in 1997 was recently confirmed to be Peroni's through advanced DNA testing. Sanfratello was located and detained in California and is awaiting extradition to Oregon to face the charges, bringing a long-awaited development in the decades-old case.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced it is consulting with other Palestinian factions before responding to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal presented by the US, Egypt, and Qatar. President Trump stated he expects a decision from Hamas within 24 hours on the plan, which Israel has reportedly accepted. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire and a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. Meanwhile, Israeli military operations continue across Gaza, with recent strikes in Khan Younis killing at least 15 displaced people, underscoring the urgency of the diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Christopher Killick has been sentenced to three years in prison for the persistent harassment of Emily Hunt, the government's former independent advisor for its review on sexual assault. Hunt expressed profound relief after a ten-year fight for justice, which began in 2015 after Killick filmed her unconscious in a hotel room. He initially pleaded guilty to voyeurism and received a community order, but repeatedly breached a restraining order by tweeting about Ms. Hunt. The judge noted Killick's "unwavering persistence" and Ms. Hunt's great courage in a case that highlights the justice system's challenges in handling harassment and its consequences.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, a comet designated 3I/ATLAS. The object was spotted by a telescope in Chile and is currently about 416 million miles from the sun. While scientists are still determining its precise trajectory, the comet poses no danger to Earth, with its closest approach expected to be about 240 million kilometers away in October. The discovery of this 20-kilometer-wide comet, which likely originated from another planetary system near the galactic center, provides a rare opportunity for scientists to study pristine material from outside our solar system.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has outlined five types of food he avoids feeding his own children to promote lifelong health. These include microwave popcorn due to chemical-lined bags, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like bacon and hot dogs, which are linked to heart disease and cancer. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks that cause blood sugar crashes and deep-fried foods prepared in reused industrial oils. The doctor recommends healthier alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and lean proteins to build healthy habits early.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Deciding whether the high cost of professional movers is worthwhile requires careful consideration of several factors, according to financial experts. Key questions to ask include whether you have valuable or fragile items that would be expensive to replace if damaged during a DIY move. You should also calculate the value of the time saved by outsourcing the labor, which could be spent more productively. Ultimately, the decision should balance the cost against the benefits of protecting your possessions, saving time, and preserving your peace of mind, without sacrificing long-term financial goals or going into debt.</p>
