          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held meetings with U.S. congressional leaders, including House Speaker Mike Johnson and a bipartisan group of senators, to discuss security and regional peace. Key topics included the U.S. commitment to Israel's security, a potential ceasefire in Gaza, and the possibility of regime change in Iran, which Netanyahu suggested would benefit the region. The visit occurs amid ongoing debates in Washington about U.S. policy towards Iran following recent military strikes. Netanyahu emphasized the strong coordination with the Trump administration in efforts to secure the release of hostages and dismantle Hamas.</p>

          <h2>'Heartstopper' Actor Joe Locke to Make West End Stage Debut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-09 19:09:25 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joe Locke, star of the popular Netflix series 'Heartstopper,' is set to make his West End debut this autumn in the play 'Clarkston.' Written by Samuel D. Hunter, the playwright behind 'The Whale,' the story follows two young men who form a bond while working night shifts at a Costco in a small Washington town. Locke expressed excitement about playing a "flawed" character with depth, noting the play explores themes of class, friendship, and platonic male love. The actor is currently filming the 'Heartstopper' movie, which he described as a nice closing chapter for the story.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has engineered its own custom hardware to cool Nvidia's next-generation GPUs, which are essential for the current AI boom. These powerful processors generate immense heat, and existing cooling solutions were deemed insufficient for AWS's massive scale, taking up too much space or using too much water. The new hardware, called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX), can be integrated into both new and existing data centers. This development allows AWS to support Nvidia's latest high-density computing systems, keeping it competitive in the cloud infrastructure market.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated Club World Cup semi-final, Ousmane Dembélé's stellar performance for Paris Saint-Germain overshadowed his former teammate Kylian Mbappé's first match against his old club. Dembélé was a central figure in PSG's 4-0 demolition of Real Madrid, scoring one goal and playing a key role in two others through relentless pressing and creative passing. In contrast, Mbappé struggled to make an impact within Real Madrid's disjointed system, which failed to counter PSG's collective and structured approach. The match highlighted the success of PSG's team-oriented strategy under coach Luis Enrique since Mbappé's departure.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin surged to a new all-time high of over $112,000, buoyed by a strong rally in the technology sector led by Nvidia. As a risk asset, Bitcoin's value often moves in tandem with growth-oriented stocks, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite also closed at a record high. The cryptocurrency's recent climb follows a period of consolidation, despite significant inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and increased purchasing by public companies. Analysts suggest that bullish sentiment, coupled with potential progress on crypto legislation, could drive prices even higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a controversial state immigration law. The law, known as SB 4-C, would have made it a state felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously blocked its enforcement, ruling that it likely encroached on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration policy. The Supreme Court's decision means the law will remain unenforceable while the legal challenge against it proceeds in the lower courts, reaffirming the principle that states cannot regulate immigration.</p>
