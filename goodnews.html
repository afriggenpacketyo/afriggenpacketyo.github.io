          <h2>Federal Reserve Chair Powell Cites Labor Market Slowdown as Reason for Interest Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 12:45:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that a marked slowdown in the labor market prompted the central bank's recent decision to lower its key interest rate. In a speech, Powell explained that rising downside risks to employment have begun to outweigh concerns about persistent inflation, creating a "challenging situation" for policymakers. He described the current policy stance as "modestly restrictive" but well-positioned to respond to future economic developments, including potential further rate cuts if necessary. Powell acknowledged that while inflation has cooled, it remains above the Fed's 2% target, and uncertainty surrounding tariffs continues to pose a risk to price stability.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a period of strengthening, the growth of single-family home rents in the U.S. began to slow in July, potentially indicating that landlords are adjusting to consumer financial struggles. According to data from Cotality, rent prices increased by 2.3% year-over-year, a rate below the pre-pandemic average and a significant deceleration from previous months this year. This cooling trend was observed across most major metropolitan areas and at all price tiers, with even high-demand markets like Los Angeles showing weakening growth. The slowdown contrasts with the strong demand seen in recent years, which was fueled by high prices in the for-sale housing market.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration restore $500 million in grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), that had been frozen. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, stating the administration likely violated federal law by not providing specific reasons for suspending the grants, which support critical medical research. The funding was part of a larger $584 million suspension related to allegations of civil rights violations. This ruling follows similar legal battles where universities have challenged the administration's use of federal funding to influence campus policies on issues like diversity and antisemitism.</p>

          <p>Health agencies and experts from around the world are refuting the Trump administration's recent claim of a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Major bodies including the European Medicines Agency, the UK's regulatory agency, and Australian health officials have all issued statements affirming that there is no new evidence to change current recommendations and that the medication remains a safe option for pain and fever during pregnancy. These organizations point to robust scientific evidence, including a major Swedish study of 2.5 million children, that contradicts the administration's assertions and warns against spreading misinformation and unnecessary alarm.</p>

          <p>Actress Scarlett Johansson is stepping behind the camera for the first time to direct the new film "Eleanor the Great," starring 95-year-old June Squibb. Squibb plays Eleanor, a 94-year-old woman who moves to New York City after her best friend's death and inadvertently finds herself involved in a lie with a Holocaust survivors support group. Johansson, who has wanted to direct since she was 12, said the project came at the right time in her career. Squibb praised Johansson's leadership and actor-centric approach to directing, highlighting the unique opportunity to play such a complex, human character in a leading role at her age.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales visited Southport to support the families and schools affected by last year's fatal knife attack that killed three young girls. Prince William delivered a speech at a memorial playground, praising the community's resilience and the pastoral work of teachers in helping the children heal. The royal couple met with pupils and staff from the schools the victims attended, promising that those affected would not be forgotten. This visit follows a previous one last autumn, which was Princess Catherine's first public engagement after her chemotherapy, underscoring their continued commitment to the grieving community.</p>

          <p>An opinion article in The Guardian explores the political future of Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, suggesting she may be preparing for a presidential or Senate run in 2028. The piece argues that against a backdrop of an aging political establishment, there is a growing appetite for change, reflected in polling that shows Democratic voters favoring progressive figures. While noting that some on the left feel AOC has shifted toward the center, particularly on issues like Palestine, the author contends she still possesses the necessary charisma and fight to lead the Democratic party. The commentary concludes that she may be the best-positioned figure to chart a path forward from Trumpism.</p>

Feeling overwhelmed and unable to get home safely, a man named Blake noticed her distress, stopped to help, and then offered to drive them home. Friedman expressed immense gratitude for the selfless act from Blake and his friend, who came to their rescue and ensured both she and her terrified dog made it home without incident.</p>

          <p>An article from NPR's Planet Money newsletter delves into how S&P Global generates hundreds of millions of dollars annually from its S&P 500 stock market index. The index evolved from a simple market barometer into a financial powerhouse with the advent of index funds and ETFs, which pay licensing fees to use the S&P 500 name and data. This business is protected by a strong competitive "moat" consisting of a trusted brand name, economies of scale, and its status as a common language for financial benchmarks. Despite recent criticism that the index is now dominated by a few tech giants, it continues to accurately reflect the market's state and remains a cornerstone of modern retirement investing.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its most affordable level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage at this new rate, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $2,128. This represents a savings of about $210 per month, or over $2,500 annually, compared to the average rates near 7% at the beginning of the year. The lower rates have spurred a surge in both new mortgage and refinancing applications, as borrowers look to capitalize on the reduced costs, which could save over $75,000 in total interest over the life of the loan.</p>

According to an internal memo, the Wall Street firm is partnering with the startup Zerohash to provide liquidity and custody for the service, which will initially include bitcoin, ether, and solana. This move signals a deeper embrace of digital assets by a major financial institution, aiming to provide clients with direct ownership of crypto rather than just exposure through funds. The head of wealth management described the initiative as the "tip of the iceberg" in a broader strategy to integrate digital and traditional asset management.</p>

The discussion highlighted that shares for major financial institutions like Wells Fargo, Goldman Sachs, and Capital One have been trending higher. This upward movement is largely attributed to investor optimism that the Federal Reserve will continue to implement interest rate cuts after its recent reduction. The article notes that while megacap tech stocks have driven overall market gains, the banking sector is now seeing strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>

This will be the first crewed lunar mission in over 50 years and serves as a critical test of the Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket for future lunar landings. The crew will not land but will travel further into space than any previous mission, conducting systems checks and experiments to monitor the effects of deep space on the human body. The success of this flight is pivotal for the subsequent Artemis III mission, which aims to return astronauts to the lunar surface.</p>
