          <p>The Women's Africa Cup of Nations (WAFCON) is underway in Morocco, showcasing the continent's growing talent but also highlighting familiar organizational and financial problems. While host nation Morocco is emerging as a force in women's football and stars like Nigeria's Asisat Oshoala are competing, the tournament faces issues like last-minute scheduling and smaller venues. Significant pay disparities and financial struggles persist for many teams, with the prize money for WAFCON winners being considerably less than their male counterparts, reflecting broader challenges that hinder the sport's full potential in Africa.</p>

          <p>Following the conclusion of the recent Club World Cup, FIFA is already exploring an expansion to 48 teams for the 2029 tournament and potentially holding it more frequently. The event generated over $2 billion in revenue, with winning club Chelsea earning £85 million, prompting other top clubs to express keen interest in future participation. Despite the commercial success and high viewership figures, concerns over player welfare, extreme heat, and a crowded global football calendar remain significant unresolved issues as FIFA pushes for a bigger and more frequent competition.</p>

          <p>This archival piece from 2005 commemorates the addition of Macau's historic center to the UNESCO World Heritage list, a move that was celebrated as a significant step in diversifying the city's identity beyond its reputation as a gambling hub. The 29 designated sites, featuring unique Portuguese-style architecture on Chinese soil, were recognized for their crucial role in the early encounters between Eastern and Western cultures. At the time, Chief Executive Edmund Ho Hau-wah described the collection of landmarks as a "unique, peerless jewel," placing them on par with world-renowned sites like the Great Wall of China.</p>

          <p>The UK government is updating its relationships, sex, and health education (RSHE) guidance for schools in England to include topics such as misogyny, deepfakes, and unhealthy online influences. The new curriculum will teach pupils to identify positive male role models and will cover AI-generated sexual imagery and the link between pornography and misogyny in secondary school. While the government is not imposing strict age limits for topics, it will outline what should be taught by the end of primary and secondary school, and parents will have the right to view all curriculum materials.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated NBA Summer League game, Bronny James delivered one of his strongest performances, scoring 17 points with five rebounds and five assists for the Lakers. Despite his impressive play, which drew excitement from a crowd that included his father LeBron James and other sports dignitaries, the Los Angeles Clippers ultimately defeated the Lakers 67-58. James showed growing confidence, particularly with his shooting, and Lakers summer league coach Lindsey Harding praised his energy and execution on both offense and defense, noting he was a clear bright spot in the team's fatigued performance.</p>

          <p>To encourage the transition from petrol and diesel vehicles, the UK government is introducing a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750 on the purchase of new electric cars. The discounts, funded by a £650 million program, will apply to eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000 and are expected to be available at dealerships within weeks. While the move is welcomed by some automakers, critics and consumers point to the high cost of EVs and the insufficient number of public charging points as persistent barriers to widespread adoption.</p>

The H20 GPU was developed for the Chinese market after stricter export controls were imposed in 2023, which Nvidia said would cost the company $15 billion in revenue. The move comes as CEO Jensen Huang visits Beijing and signals a potential easing of tech trade tensions, though Chinese firms are expected to continue diversifying their suppliers to ensure supply chain security.

Within a year, Scheffler won seven PGA Tour events, including his second Masters and an Olympic gold medal, transforming from one of the worst putters on tour to one of the best, reaffirming his dominance in the sport.</p>

Despite the slowdown, the data keeps China on track to meet its annual 5% growth target, but economists warn of underlying fragility and are calling for deeper structural reforms and additional fiscal stimulus to support domestic consumption and stabilize the economy.

The country's success is attributed to a long-term strategy of combining strong incentives for EV buyers, such as tax exemptions, with increasingly high taxes on polluting internal combustion engine cars. This sustained policy approach, along with heavy investment in public charging infrastructure, has effectively pushed gasoline and diesel vehicles out of the new car market.</p>
