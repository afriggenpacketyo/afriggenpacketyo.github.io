          <p>An All Nippon Airways flight from Tokyo to Houston was diverted to Seattle after a passenger attempted to open the plane's exit doors mid-flight. Fellow passengers and crew members restrained the individual, who was later evaluated and transported to a local hospital for a medical crisis. A second, unrelated unruly passenger was also removed from the plane while on the tarmac in Seattle. The airline confirmed that the safety of passengers and crew remains their top priority and expressed gratitude to local law enforcement for their assistance; the flight eventually continued to Houston.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump has renewed his criticism of Harvard University's international student enrollment following a judge's decision to block the administration's attempt to revoke the school's ability to enroll international students. Trump claimed that some of these students come from countries "not at all friendly to the United States" and contribute nothing to their education, further stating that his administration wants to know the identities of these students. This attack follows a federal judge's temporary restraining order against the revocation, which Harvard argued was a First Amendment violation aimed at controlling the university's governance and ideology. International students comprise about 27% of Harvard's student body and are typically ineligible for federal financial aid.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris of McLaren won the Monaco Grand Prix, followed by Charles Leclerc and Oscar Piastri, after converting his pole position into a lead at the first corner and maintaining it throughout the race. The front-runners, including Norris, Leclerc, and Piastri, all followed a similar strategy of starting on medium tires and then switching to hard tires for two stints. Max Verstappen, who had a disadvantage due to limited tire sets, finished fourth after Red Bull's strategy of delaying his final pit stop in hopes of a safety car intervention did not materialize. The race was relatively straightforward for the leaders, with only an early virtual safety car intervention after a crash for Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto.</p>

          <p>Canada's invitation to King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament is being interpreted as a statement of sovereignty and independence against threats from U.S. President Donald Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney's move is seen as a way to emphasize Canada's unique traditions and separation from the U.S., amid Trump's suggestions that Canada would be better off as a U.S. state. The visit also aims to strengthen ties with Europe and improve relations with Trump, who is known to admire the British monarchy; the King's visit will be his first to Canada as reigning monarch and is expected to include a throne speech marking a significant moment between the Head of State and the Canadian people.</p>

She emphasizes the importance of creating believable lies in her novels, allowing readers to experience another person's reality. Tyler, known for her Baltimore-based stories, also shares insights into her writing process, including her reliance on a "blue box" filled with overheard conversations and ideas, and discusses her latest book, "Three Days in June," highlighting the beauty in the acceptance people have over their own lives.

          <p>Following former President Joe Biden's prostate cancer diagnosis, experts are questioning the current guidelines for prostate cancer screening, particularly for men over the age of 70. The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that men aged 55 to 69 discuss the potential benefits and risks of PSA screening with their healthcare provider, but advises against screening for men over 70. Some medical professionals argue that this recommendation is flawed, citing the importance of early diagnosis and advancements in treatment options that minimize side effects; they suggest that men over 45 should have the screening regardless of age, as some men aged 70 and older are appropriate candidates for screening.</p>
