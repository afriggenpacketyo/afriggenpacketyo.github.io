          <p>As temperatures rise, animal welfare experts are reminding pet owners of the serious dangers of exercising dogs in hot weather. The RSPCA notes that dogs are far more likely to suffer from heat-related illness during exercise than from being left in hot cars, as they have a very limited ability to cool themselves down. Key signs of overheating include heavy panting, lethargy, and excessive drooling. To keep dogs safe, owners should avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water and shade.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that a buyer has been found for the U.S. operations of TikTok, describing them as "a group of very wealthy people." He stated he would reveal their identity in about two weeks and suggested that the deal would likely require and receive approval from China's President Xi. This development comes after the U.S. government ordered TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American arm over national security concerns regarding user data. The deadline for the sale has been extended multiple times, with the current one set for September 17.</p>

Analysts suggest the move, spurred by the success of other open-source models like DeepSeek, could dramatically lower costs for developers and accelerate AI application development worldwide. While this increases accessibility, it also raises questions about data security and transparency, as the training data for such models is often not disclosed. (not investment advice)</p>
