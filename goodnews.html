        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's burgeoning humanoid robotics industry is offering salaries significantly above the national average to attract skilled engineers and AI specialists. The average monthly pay for algorithm engineers is over three times the urban average, reflecting a severe talent crunch in the sector. This surge in pay stands out against a backdrop of a subdued hiring landscape in China, where economic slowdown and corporate earnings are impacting the job market. Despite challenges, the humanoid robotics field remains a promising area for employment growth. The situation seems positive for those in the robotics industry, but general economic uncertainty keeps the score moderate.</p>

          <p>The G7 summit in Canada, hosted by Mark Carney, faced disruptions due to the Israel-Iran conflict and President Trump's unexpected departure. While Trump left early, citing events in the Middle East, other leaders focused on trade, Ukraine, and other global issues. Despite reports of US resistance, Carney denied a lack of consensus on Ukraine and pointed to remarks on Ukraine in the summit chairman's summary statement. Discussions included trade deals, cooperation on wildfires, and addressing tensions between Canada and India. The summit underscored both cooperation and underlying tensions among the world's leading economies.</p>

          <p>Rafael Devers expressed his enthusiasm for joining the San Francisco Giants, emphasizing his willingness to play wherever the team needs him. This contrasts with his stance during the previous season with the Red Sox, where he was less flexible about his position. The Red Sox traded Devers due to differing visions for his role, despite his long-term contract. The Giants are eager to integrate Devers into their lineup in the competitive NL West, hoping he will contribute significantly to their success. The trade represents a fresh start for Devers and a potentially valuable addition for the Giants.</p>
