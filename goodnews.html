          <p>Boston Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet delivered a dominant performance, striking out ten batters to lead his team to a 4-2 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers. While the Dodgers managed two early solo home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández, Crochet effectively shut down their offense for the remainder of his outing. Dodgers veteran Clayton Kershaw struggled with his command, allowing four runs in just over four innings. The loss sets up a rubber match for the series at Fenway Park on Sunday.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security has officially designated 'drone flight planner' as a new occupation, reflecting the rapid growth of the country's low-altitude economy. This sector, which includes activities up to 1,000 meters, is considered a strategic emerging industry by Beijing. The new role involves planning flight paths for multiple drones, developing mission plans, and managing on-site operations. The government views this burgeoning field as a key driver for job creation, innovation, and overall economic stimulus.</p>

Historical texts describe the ornate device as being able to detect distant earthquakes and indicate the direction of their epicenter. Despite its legendary status, the invention's existence has been debated by some scholars, leading to its removal from Chinese school curricula in 2017. The new project, supported by modern scientific analysis and new clues, aims to restore the historical credibility of this ancient wonder.</p>

          <p>Following the death of rock legend Ozzy Osbourne, many are also remembering his significant impact on television as the star of the early 2000s reality show "The Osbournes." The MTV series, which followed the daily life of his family, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format and became a cultural phenomenon before the rise of shows like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians." Producers and critics note that the show's blend of mundane family life with rock-star fame humanized the "Prince of Darkness." The series successfully redefined his public image for a new generation.</p>

          <p>With England in the Euro 2025 final, an article explores the intense physical and emotional reactions fans experience during tense sporting events. Psychologists explain that hormones like adrenaline and cortisol surge, causing increased heart rates and a "fight or flight" response, which is a normal sign of deep investment in the outcome. To manage the stress, experts advise getting good rest, having a clear match day plan, and engaging in physical movement to release energy. They also emphasize reframing the anxiety as part of an enjoyable, communal experience.</p>

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in several decades, with average July temperatures running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chill to a misplaced high-pressure system over the Pacific, which has led to persistent cloud cover and increased coastal upwelling of cold ocean water. While not record-breaking, the weather pattern is the most sustained of its kind in 20 to 30 years. The cool, gray conditions are expected to continue, though experts caution that the region's hottest weather often occurs in September and October.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to reform licensing rules to protect pubs and live music venues from noise complaints, particularly from new residential developments. Under the proposed changes, developers building near existing venues would be responsible for soundproofing new properties. The reforms also aim to streamline the process for opening new businesses in disused shops and encourage outdoor dining and performances to revitalize struggling town centers. The government hopes these changes will help reverse the steady decline of the pub industry. (not investment advice)</p>
