          <p>OpenAI has launched ChatGPT Go, a new subscription plan in India priced at 399 rupees (about $4.60) per month, making it the company's most affordable paid tier yet. This strategic move aims to expand its user base in India, which is already its second-largest market. The Go plan offers significantly higher usage limits for messages, image generation, and file uploads compared to the free version. The company plans to use feedback from the Indian market before considering a wider global rollout for this new, lower-cost offering.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled images of a prototype crewed tilt-rotor aircraft, a design that combines the vertical take-off and landing capabilities of a helicopter with the speed and range of a fixed-wing plane. The photos show a white prototype hovering in helicopter mode, suggesting it is a manned vehicle, which would be a first for the country. This type of aircraft, similar in concept to the US V-22 Osprey, is known for its versatility but also for its significant mechanical complexity and high operational costs. The development marks a significant step in China's military aviation technology.</p>

          <p>The US Open has introduced a revamped mixed doubles tournament, featuring top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu, a shorter format, and a significantly increased prize purse of $1 million for the winners. The United States Tennis Association (USTA) aims to elevate the event's profile and attract more fans. However, the changes have polarized the tennis world, with some praising the initiative for its promotional value while others, particularly doubles specialists like Jamie Murray, criticize it as a "glorified exhibition." Critics argue it devalues the Grand Slam title and redirects prize money.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly considering a plan to take an equity stake of around 10% in chipmaker Intel, which would make the U.S. government its largest shareholder. The proposal involves converting some or all of the $10.9 billion in grants awarded to Intel under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company equity. This move is part of a broader effort to revitalize the American semiconductor industry and bolster a key national company that has fallen behind global competitors. While discussions are ongoing, it reflects an increasing government interest in creating national champions in strategic sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to recreate the potential faces of Welsh convicts who were transported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey, deported for crimes ranging from theft to minor offenses like trampling turnips. The AI generated the profiles using detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, in some cases, photos of modern descendants. This project sheds light on the harsh justice system of the era and the personal histories of the convicts who formed a significant part of Australia's foundational population.</p>

          <p>American investors and private equity firms are increasingly pouring money into Europe's top soccer clubs, attracted by soaring revenues and valuations. Since the 1996-97 season, revenues in the five biggest European leagues have grown by 750%, driving up the value of teams like Manchester United. This trend is fueled by the high cost of US sports franchises, making European soccer an attractive alternative. Investors are utilizing multi-club ownership models to maximize returns, though this is drawing scrutiny from regulators like UEFA, which recently barred Crystal Palace from a European competition.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A travel trend known as "coolcations" is gaining momentum as tourists avoid Europe's traditional summer hotspots in favor of cooler, quieter destinations. This shift is driven by concerns over record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires in southern European countries like Spain, Greece, and Portugal. Travelers are now booking trips to more temperate locations such as Iceland, Norway, and Slovenia, or scheduling their vacations for the cooler spring and autumn months. While this trend may alleviate overtourism in some areas, it poses economic challenges for southern European nations heavily reliant on peak-season tourism.</p>

          <p>A new report from S&P indicates that Chinese exports to the Global South have doubled since 2015, with a significant acceleration following the U.S.-China trade war. In the last five years alone, these exports grew by 65%, far outpacing the growth of exports to the U.S. and Western Europe. This shift suggests Chinese firms are actively diversifying their markets in response to tariffs and a domestic economic slowdown. The trend is contributing to a potential new global trade order where South-South commerce, with Chinese multinationals as key players, becomes a more dominant force. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The high-stakes meeting in Washington between Presidents Trump, Zelenskyy, and several European leaders yielded several key developments regarding the war in Ukraine. A primary outcome was Trump's arrangement for a potential future face-to-face meeting between Zelenskyy and Vladimir Putin, though Moscow's commitment remains uncertain. Trump also backed away from demanding a ceasefire before negotiations, a stance European leaders pushed back on, and hinted at providing US security guarantees for Ukraine. Throughout the visit, Zelenskyy conducted a successful charm offensive, presenting a more positive atmosphere than his previous tense encounter.</p>
