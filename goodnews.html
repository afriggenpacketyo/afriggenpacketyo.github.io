        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent significant drop in the price of gold, questions have arisen about the viability of purchasing the metal from large retailers like Costco. While the price has fallen, it remains historically high, presenting a potentially attractive entry point for new investors. Buying from a trusted retailer offers convenience and transparency compared to other sources, though sales are often final, requiring a firm decision. The article suggests that price dips in gold are typically temporary, and a lower entry point could position buyers for future gains if the price rebounds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong revenue. However, the company has lowered its full-year guidance for 2025 due to the significant impact of a fire at a key aluminum supplier's plant. The disruption is expected to cost between $1.5 billion and $2 billion by affecting the production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs. Ford is actively working to mitigate the financial impact and plans to increase production in 2026 to recover the lost volume. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Average interest rates for five-year home equity loans have fallen to 8.11%, nearing their lowest point since 2023 and offering a potentially cost-effective borrowing option for homeowners. Compared to alternatives like personal loans or credit cards, which have significantly higher rates, home equity loans present a more affordable way to access large sums of money. While the Federal Reserve is expected to make minor rate cuts, the impact on these loans is likely to be minimal, suggesting that waiting may not yield substantial savings. Homeowners are advised to consider locking in a rate now to avoid future market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In the wake of federal arrests linking NBA figures to illegal gambling and organized crime, the legal sports betting industry is positioning itself as part of the solution. Major sportsbooks like FanDuel and DraftKings, along with the American Gaming Association, issued statements emphasizing their commitment to integrity and transparency. They argue that the regulated legal market provides the necessary oversight and data monitoring to detect suspicious activities, which helped uncover a related scheme. The industry is using the scandal to advocate for its expansion into states that have not yet legalized sports gambling.</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that while a majority of California Democrats support Governor Gavin Newsom running for president in 2028, the state's overall electorate is more divided on the matter. The poll also found less enthusiasm for a presidential run by former Vice President Kamala Harris, even among California Democrats. Newsom currently holds a positive approval rating as governor, though many voters feel he is more focused on national and state issues than their local concerns. The survey also highlighted Californian's views on the state as a national model, with positive marks for technology but poor ratings on housing and tax policy.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has dropped to 6.19%, marking the second consecutive week of declines and approaching a three-year low. This downward trend may present an opportunity for potential homebuyers who have been sidelined by previously high rates. However, experts advise caution, noting that the rate drops have been gradual and could reverse course due to various economic factors. Acting now could help buyers avoid potentially increased competition during the traditional spring homebuying season, especially if rates continue to fall and attract more market participants.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold prices have experienced sharp fluctuations recently, creating both risks and opportunities for investors. To capitalize on this volatility, experts suggest several approaches beyond simply holding the physical metal. One strategy is trading the stocks of gold mining companies or related ETFs, which can offer leveraged exposure to gold's price movements and are more liquid than bullion. For short-term plays, gold-backed ETFs or futures contracts allow for direct trading on price swings. A more conservative approach involves strategically buying physical gold during price dips as a long-term hedge against inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pediatric psychologists and child development experts are decoding common toddler behaviors like constantly saying "no," claiming everything as "mine," and resisting transitions between activities. These actions, while often frustrating for parents, are described as developmentally appropriate ways for young children to establish their identity and test boundaries. Experts explain that this behavior is a crucial part of social and emotional learning as toddlers begin to understand they are separate individuals with their own sense of agency. The article provides parents with context for this stage and offers practical tips, such as offering choices and modeling desired behaviors.</p>

The decision is seen as a significant political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has advocated for partnership with federal agencies but opposed a military-style presence.
