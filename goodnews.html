          <p>A U.S. Military Academy cadet and football player, Larry Pickett Jr., is being hailed as a hero for his recent actions in Orange County, New York. Pickett and his father came across a car that had crashed into a utility pole and quickly pulled the driver from the vehicle. Moments after the rescue, the car was completely engulfed in flames, a scene captured on video by Pickett's sister. The driver sustained only minor injuries, and the academy praised Pickett for exemplifying the values of selfless service and courage.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has concluded the transfer window with a record-breaking £415 million expenditure, a significant departure from former manager Jurgen Klopp's more conservative fiscal policies. This spending spree was enabled by a combination of factors, including saved funds from previous windows, substantial commercial growth, and over £200 million in player sales. The club capitalized on its recent title success to attract top talent like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, aiming to evolve the team's style under new manager Arne Slot. The article notes this ambitious financial strategy marks a new era for the club's operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Advanced driving assistance systems (ADAS), such as rearview cameras and automatic emergency braking (AEB), are becoming mandatory features in new vehicles sold in the United States. While the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has mandated AEB for all light-duty vehicles by 2029, other features are effectively required for automakers to achieve high safety ratings from organizations like the IIHS. A recent study indicates strong consumer demand for these technologies, with hands-free driving and reverse automatic braking topping the list of desired features. This trend reflects a shift driven by both regulatory pressure and customer interest in enhanced vehicle safety.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian nations including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. The initiative aims to provide an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system, thereby insulating member countries from associated risks. Analysts suggest the bank will accelerate key infrastructure projects and strengthen economic ties within the bloc. The move is seen as a logical step to enhance financial sovereignty and cooperation among the member states. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Increased Solar Activity May Make Northern Lights Visible Across the UK</h2>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. The phenomenon is due to a fast-moving coronal mass ejection from the sun, which could push the Northern Lights much farther south than is typical. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution, the Midlands may have the best viewing conditions. Experts advise that Monday and Tuesday nights offer the greatest potential for UK residents to witness the rare and memorable celestial display.</p>

          <p>Despite setting new age-related records at the US Open, Novak Djokovic's campaign for a 25th Grand Slam title is shadowed by concerns over his physical condition. The 38-year-old has been visibly hampered by various issues, including his neck, shoulder, and back, during his matches. While his serving and overall form have improved throughout the tournament, his ability to withstand the grueling demands of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents remains a significant question. His next challenge is against Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds an undefeated record, but his biggest opponent may be his own body.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary, explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, which triggered struggles with substance abuse and his relationships. Johnson's performance is central to the film, with facial prosthetics altering his appearance for the role, while Emily Blunt plays his girlfriend, Dawn. The review notes the film is a solid drama that insightfully portrays Kerr's vulnerability but stops short of the tragic depth seen in similar sports biopics.</p>
