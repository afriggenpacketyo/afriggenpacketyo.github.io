          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist detained by ICE for over three months, affirmed his commitment to Palestinian human rights advocacy in an ABC News interview. Khalil, a green card holder, faces potential deportation under the Trump administration but remains resolute. He criticized the administration's portrayal of him as a violent terrorist without evidence, emphasizing the Palestinian movement's stance against antisemitism and racism. Khalil's detention sparked controversy, with a judge ordering his release on bail, a decision sharply criticized by the Department of Homeland Security, while an immigration judge denied his asylum request. The activist expressed concern for his family's safety and acknowledged the long legal battle ahead. His optimism score will reflect his determination in the face of adversity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS England will begin offering at-home HPV test kits to women who have delayed cervical screening, aiming to overcome barriers like embarrassment and lack of time. The self-sampling kits, containing a vaginal swab, will be mailed in discreet packaging with pre-paid postage. The initiative seeks to increase screening rates, particularly among younger women and minority communities, as current rates fall short of NHS targets. If HPV is detected, women will be invited for further examination to check for cancerous cell changes, but a negative HPV test means women aged 25-49 will wait five years for their next screening appointment.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, following a period of heightened aerial attacks. This announcement comes after the U.S. conducted strikes on three Iranian nuclear sites, prompting Iran to launch a missile attack on a U.S. military base in Qatar. According to a U.S. official, there were no casualties from the Iranian attack. Trump stated that "Monumental Damage was done to all Nuclear sites in Iran," but the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff noted that a full battle damage assessment is still pending.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An RBN Energy executive, Rusty Braziel, stated that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. Braziel explained that closing the strait would harm Iran's own exports, which amount to 1.7 million barrels per day. He also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China could negatively impact U.S. energy exporters. The market appears to agree with Braziel's assessment, as oil prices dropped on Monday despite the recent U.S. attack on Iran's nuclear sites. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, characterizing Iran's response as "very weak."

Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing over the weekend.

They trust Trump to protect American interests and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons while avoiding a prolonged conflict. Some voters expressed disappointment, but most supported the strikes, viewing them as preventative rather than provocative. Nearly all defended Trump's decision to proceed without congressional approval, trusting his access to national security intelligence.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to strike Iranian nuclear facilities was a high-risk maneuver that may be paying off if Iran's retaliation ends here. Iran launched missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, but there were no casualties or damage, and Trump claimed all parties agreed to a ceasefire. Trump indicated he's inclined to hold his fire if no further attacks occur, hoping Iran will negotiate in earnest. A similar situation occurred in 2020 after the killing of Qasem Soleimani, where cooler heads prevailed after initial retaliation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran are raising questions about the impact on oil and gas supplies, including whether the widening conflict could result in higher energy prices. Experts predict that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, but ongoing tensions could disrupt the energy market. If the Strait of Hormuz were closed, energy prices could soar, severely impacting markets in China, India, Japan, and South Korea. American drivers are likely to see higher gas prices at the pump over the next week, with prices jumping between 10 cents and 15 cents a gallon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top U.S. analyst believes China is unlikely to use its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it. Instead, China would likely pursue quiet negotiations and prioritize its own interests. This approach is based on China's previous actions, such as its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. China's focus is on protecting its own interests rather than policing global waterways.</p>
