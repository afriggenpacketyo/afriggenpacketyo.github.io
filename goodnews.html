          <p>The contest to succeed Angela Rayner as Labour's deputy leader has officially begun, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and veteran MP Emily Thornberry announcing their candidacies. They join Lucy Powell, who was recently dismissed as leader of the House of Commons, and backbencher Bell Ribeiro-Addy in the race. Candidates have a tight deadline to secure nominations from at least 80 MPs. The race highlights different wings of the party, with some candidates signaling a desire to be a more critical voice for the membership and challenge the government's direction on issues like welfare and foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Michael Clune, author of the acclaimed heroin addiction memoir "White Out," has released a new novel titled "Pan," which delves into the subjective experience of adolescent panic attacks. The book's protagonist, Nicholas, navigates high school in the 1990s while besieged by debilitating anxiety, which he comes to interpret not as a medical condition but as an encounter with the mischievous Greek god, Pan. The article reviews the novel as a vivid and unconventional coming-of-age story that avoids a standard recovery narrative. Instead, it focuses on the philosophical and existential dimensions of panic, portraying it as a terrifying but insightful state of heightened consciousness.</p>

          <p>Ethiopia has officially inaugurated the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), Africa's largest hydroelectric project, located on the Blue Nile. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed stated the $5 billion dam is a major achievement for the nation and is intended for prosperity and regional electrification, not to harm downstream neighbors Egypt and Sudan. Both countries have previously expressed concerns about the dam's impact on their water supply from the Nile River. The project, funded entirely by Ethiopia, is expected to significantly boost the country's energy production, where nearly half the population currently lacks electricity.</p>

          <p>Construction work in downtown Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, unearthed a 500-pound unexploded bomb from World War II, leading to significant evacuations on Tuesday. The emergency measures affected several city blocks and a major bridge over the Danube River, halting traffic during the morning rush hour while experts worked to defuse the device. The bomb was found near the site of a former oil refinery that was a target for Allied bombing raids in 1944. Such discoveries of unexploded wartime ordnance are not uncommon in European cities that experienced heavy bombing during the war.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest is set to appoint Ange Postecoglou as its new head coach, replacing the recently sacked Nuno Espirito Santo. Postecoglou, who was dismissed by Tottenham at the end of last season despite winning the Europa League, was seen at Forest's training ground. His appointment comes after Forest's 3-0 defeat to West Ham and with the team currently 10th in the Premier League table. The move, which reportedly surprised many players, would make Postecoglou the eighth permanent manager under owner Evangelos Marinakis since 2017, signaling another significant change in direction for the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to its lowest level in nearly a year, but at around 6.29%, it remains significantly higher than the sub-3% rates seen during the pandemic. Financial experts suggest that potential homebuyers can take steps to secure better loan terms regardless of the market. Key strategies include improving one's credit score by paying bills on time and keeping debt low, as a higher FICO score directly translates to a lower interest rate. Additionally, providing a larger down payment and considering alternatives like adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) can also help borrowers obtain more favorable terms. (not investment advice)</p>

However, foreign policy experts assert that India is not abandoning Washington but rather pursuing a policy of "multi-alignment" and strategic autonomy. This approach allows New Delhi to leverage relationships across different power blocs to navigate an unstable global landscape, though it risks straining its long-term strategic partnership with the U.S.</p>

Instead, they will receive approximately $1.1 billion each from the sale of their holdings.

          <p>In an era of political attacks on diversity initiatives and curriculum content, Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) are experiencing a surge in applications. Beverly Daniel Tatum, former president of Spelman College, suggests that as the broader social and political environment becomes more hostile, Black students are increasingly seeking out HBCUs as affirming communities "where their history is not being erased." While this trend is a positive sign for the institutions, it also presents challenges, as many applicants require financial aid that the often under-resourced HBCUs struggle to provide. The increased interest highlights the vital role these institutions play in providing supportive educational environments.</p>
