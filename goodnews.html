          <p>A new mural immortalizing the late Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, nine months after his passing. Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts the iconic pitcher in his wind-up motion and tipping his cap, celebrating his legacy and symbolizing unity within the Latino community. Valenzuela, who played for the Dodgers from 1980 to 1990, became a cultural phenomenon known as "Fernandomania," inspiring a generation of Latino fans. The article highlights the emotional reactions from fans who saw Valenzuela as a hero who represented triumph over adversity.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old darts world champion Luke Littler secured a comfortable 10-2 victory over Ryan Searle to advance to the second round of the World Matchplay in Blackpool. Displaying formidable form from the start, Littler finished with an impressive average of 108.92 and a 52.6% checkout rate, avoiding the first-round exit that befell world number one Luke Humphries. Littler expressed satisfaction with his performance, attributing it to increased practice time ahead of the prestigious tournament. He will next face Dutchman Jermaine Wattimena, while other matches saw former champions Rob Cross and Peter Wright eliminated from the competition.</p>
