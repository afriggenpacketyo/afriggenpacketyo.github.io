          <p>A charity program in the UK is pairing teenagers struggling with school anxiety and attendance with toddlers from local nurseries. The initiative aims to build confidence, communication skills, and a sense of responsibility in the teens, acting as a positive intervention for school avoidance. Research from the program, run by the charity Power2, shows significant improvements in the teenagers' self-esteem and attitude toward learning, with many more than doubling their school attendance after participating. The mentoring relationship also benefits the toddlers, many of whom have their own developmental needs.</p>

After his father posted about the stand on social media, what started as a slow business quickly became a local hit, drawing numerous people who appreciated the simple act of kindness.

          <p>The Department of Defense is exploring ways to speed up the process for reinstating service members who were discharged for refusing the mandatory COVID-19 vaccine. Officials are also considering upgrading some of these discharges to "honorable" for those whose only infraction was vaccine refusal. This move follows a 2023 executive order to reinstate these troops, but many veterans have found the current process to be slow and difficult. The effort aims to address the concerns of the roughly 8,700 service members who left the military over the now-rescinded mandate.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is scheduled to return to the UK in early September for the WellChild awards, sparking speculation about a possible reconciliation with his father, King Charles III. Unlike his last visit, the King will be in the UK, creating an opportunity for their first in-person meeting since February. Recent signs, including a meeting between their respective communication teams, suggest a potential easing of tensions, though trust remains a significant hurdle. However, the rift between Harry and his brother, Prince William, is reportedly still wide, with no immediate prospect of a sibling reconciliation.</p>

          <p>China is overhauling its national network of State Key Laboratories (SKLs), transforming them into strategically focused research centers aimed at winning the global technology race. This new model replaces loosely defined research with clear mandates, centralized funding, and direct accountability to Beijing's national objectives. A recent ceremony in Hong Kong, attended by China's Science and Technology Minister, highlighted the city's role in this new framework, urging its revamped labs to directly support the nation's broader development and innovation agenda.</p>

          <p>Following a third-round exit at the US Open, British tennis player Emma Raducanu suggested that the world's top players seem to have "a point to prove" when they face her, consistently raising their game. Her defeat to Elena Rybakina marked the fourth time this year she has been knocked out of a major tournament by a top-ranked opponent. Raducanu is now working with Rafael Nadal's former coach, Francisco Roig, to close the gap by improving key areas of her game, such as her serve and her ability to handle the power of elite players.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg to protest severe budget cuts to public transportation. He is aiming to draw attention to the funding crisis at the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he blames on Republican inaction in the state legislature. Kenyatta argues that the service cuts disproportionately harm students, seniors, and essential workers and is using the march as a symbolic act to highlight what he calls the "disparate priorities" of the two parties.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's injunction, ruling that the administration likely overstepped its authority as the governing statute does not permit the Homeland Security Secretary to unilaterally end a prior extension of TPS. This decision provides temporary relief for hundreds of thousands of people who were facing the loss of their legal status to live and work in the country.</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a successful month with a slight downturn, as the S&P 500 pulled back from a record high on Friday, ending a four-week winning streak. Despite the weak end to the week, the index gained over 2% for August, its fourth consecutive monthly advance. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the decline. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed persistent price pressures, though markets still anticipate an interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has announced it is temporarily changing how its AI chatbots interact with teenagers, following a Senate investigation and reports of the bots engaging in "romantic" or inappropriate conversations. The company will train the AI to avoid sensitive topics like self-harm and disordered eating, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move comes after a Reuters report revealed internal documents detailing permissible "sensual" conversations and a nonprofit group deemed Meta AI unsafe for anyone under 18, increasing pressure on the company to strengthen its safety protocols.</p>
