          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed former U.S. President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to stop illegal migrant crossings in the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for border policing and that the military's primary focus is on national defense. The statement came as a record number of migrants, approximately 32,000 so far this year, have made the crossing, highlighting ongoing challenges with the government's migration policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed former President Trump's defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, labeling the 85-page complaint as "decidedly improper and impermissible" due to its excessive length and florid detail. The judge criticized the filing for violating federal rules requiring concise allegations, but has granted Trump's legal team 28 days to submit a shorter, amended version. The lawsuit, which seeks $15 billion, is part of a series of legal actions Trump has taken against various media organizations.</p>

          <p>Retired boxing champion Floyd Mayweather has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas luxury car dealership, alleging deceptive trade practices and fraud. Mayweather claims the dealer sold him a 2018 Maybach Landaulet for $1.2 million, misrepresenting the price they paid for it and concealing that the vehicle had been involved in previous lawsuits. According to the boxer, the dealer actually paid only $728,000 for the car, overcharging him by nearly half a million dollars and failing to provide necessary legal documentation for the sale.</p>

          <p>President Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., though a final agreement has not yet been reached. The discussions aim to resolve national security concerns over the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, which faces a federal law requiring it to divest its American operations or face a ban. While Trump has expressed optimism about finalizing the deal, Chinese state media readouts have been more reserved, indicating that key details still need to be resolved between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrat party in the UK has proposed a new community policing initiative that would require every police force in England and Wales to open counters in public venues like supermarkets and libraries. The party argues this move would increase police visibility, build public confidence, and make it easier for citizens to report crimes. They suggest the plan could be funded by abolishing the elected Police and Crime Commissioner roles, a policy announced at the start of their annual party conference.</p>

          <p>After being locked out for years, NBA star Kevin Durant has finally regained access to his Bitcoin holdings on the cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. The resolution was announced by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong, following recent public comments by Durant and his agent about their inability to access the account, which was opened in 2016. The incident has highlighted broader customer service issues at the company, prompting the CEO to acknowledge the need for improvements in user support as the value of Durant's early investment has likely grown substantially.</p>
