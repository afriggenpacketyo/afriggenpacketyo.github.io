          <p>A new pilot program in Kent primary schools is teaching children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which includes lessons on checking UV levels and applying sunscreen, is set to be integrated into nationwide curriculum by 2026. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. The project aims to instill lifelong protective habits in the next generation as melanoma diagnoses in the UK are projected to rise.</p>

The rocket lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deploying a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. The H2A series, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has had a high success rate since its 2001 debut, despite one failure in 2003. Japan's space program will now rely on the more cost-effective H3 rocket to compete in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>Two young European brown bears, Mish and Lucy, escaped their enclosure at Wildwood Devon wildlife park and were later found in a food storage area. The bears had indulged in various snacks, including a week's supply of honey. While the park moved visitors to a secure building as a precaution, the animals were not considered a public threat and eventually returned to their enclosure on their own. The park attributed the incident to an operational error and is conducting an internal investigation to prevent future occurrences of this nature.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights and solidarity. The large turnout was seen as a direct response to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which attempted to ban the event under a controversial 2021 law. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, supported the march, framing it as a victory for freedom over a "hateful power." Many participants used the event to protest what they see as the country's slide towards authoritarianism under Orban's leadership.</p>

He effectively attacked the strike zone and retired the side in the second inning. Despite his strong start, the Dodgers' bulk reliever struggled and the offense failed to capitalize on opportunities, leading to the team's defeat.

          <h2>Stock Market Reaches Record Highs Despite Geopolitical Tensions</h2>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at new record highs, capping a strong week for the stock market that began under the shadow of significant geopolitical risk. Following news of U.S. military action in Iran, initial fears of a wider conflict did not materialize into sustained market panic. Energy prices, which had surged, quickly retreated, allowing market focus to return to corporate earnings and potential Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. This de-escalation of tension, combined with positive economic sentiment, propelled the major indices to weekly gains of over 3% and 4% respectively. (not investment advice)</p>
