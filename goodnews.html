          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 01:02:29 EDT</div>

          <p>The European Union is launching an ambitious initiative to build "gigawatt" AI factories, aiming to close the gap with the U.S. and China in artificial intelligence development. These facilities are designed as comprehensive ecosystems that combine computing power, data, and talent to industrialize the creation of AI models and applications. With an initial investment of 20 billion euros, the EU seeks to bolster its technological sovereignty and support its numerous AI startups, which have been hindered by limited computing capacity. However, challenges such as high energy costs and the need for massive private investment remain significant hurdles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Volunteer crews from the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) are defending their mission to save lives at sea, following accusations of acting as a "taxi service" for migrants. Crew members emphasize their humanitarian duty, stating they respond to any distress call from the Coastguard without political consideration. The charity released harrowing footage of a recent rescue to illustrate the dangerous reality of Channel crossings, where they saved 19 people from a capsized dinghy. Volunteers shared emotional stories, highlighting the human element of their work in the face of public criticism.</p>

          <h2>India Surpasses China as Top Smartphone Exporter to the United States</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 00:38:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India has become the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., overtaking China for the first time, according to a new report from Canalys. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, largely driven by Apple's strategic shift of its manufacturing supply chain. This move reflects a broader trend of global manufacturers diversifying away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties and tariffs. While this marks a significant milestone for India's manufacturing sector, Apple still relies on China for producing its premium models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi held his first official call with his new South Korean counterpart, Cho Hyun, urging Seoul to adopt an independent foreign policy and resist "decoupling." Wang emphasized the need for a stable and predictable China policy to foster pragmatic cooperation between the two nations. The call signals Beijing's effort to reset relations with South Korea's new administration, which is perceived as more open to engagement with China than its predecessor. Both ministers affirmed a shared commitment to advancing their strategic partnership, particularly ahead of the upcoming APEC summit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat its declining birth rate and looming demographic crisis, the Chinese government has announced its first nationwide subsidy for parents. The new policy offers families 3,600 yuan (about $500) annually for each child under the age of three, a move intended to help alleviate the high costs of raising children. This national scheme follows various local pilot programs aimed at encouraging larger families after the abolition of the one-child policy failed to reverse the trend. The initiative addresses findings that China is one of the world's most expensive places to raise a child.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has reportedly placed a new order for 300,000 H20 chipsets with manufacturer TSMC, driven by robust demand from China for its specialized AI hardware. This move comes after the Trump administration reversed a ban, allowing sales of the H20 GPU, which was specifically designed to comply with earlier U.S. export restrictions. The decision to restart production signals a change from Nvidia's initial plan to rely on existing inventory. The resumption of sales is part of broader U.S.-China trade negotiations, though it has drawn criticism from U.S. lawmakers concerned about national security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has recalled his cabinet for an emergency meeting to discuss a new peace plan and humanitarian aid strategy for Gaza. This follows a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump and weekend calls with French and German leaders, signaling a coordinated European effort after U.S.-led peace talks stalled. The plan aims to provide immediate relief and establish a pathway toward a two-state solution. The move comes amid growing pressure from within Starmer's own party to immediately recognize a Palestinian state, a step he has framed as a matter of "when, not if."</p>

          <p>A new trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is sparking debate among economists about which side emerged as the winner. The agreement imposes a 15% U.S. tariff on most EU imports, a rate higher than historical averages but lower than the 30% President Trump had threatened. In return, the EU will face no new tariffs on its exports to the U.S. and has pledged to make significant investments. While the Trump administration touts benefits for U.S. manufacturers, some analysts argue the deal is unbalanced and could slightly reduce the EU's GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

While the optics of associating with Trump's unpredictable style carry risks, Downing Street views the face time as invaluable for influencing U.S. policy.
