          <p>The 2025 Notting Hill Carnival has officially begun in west London, starting with the traditional J'ouvert celebration at dawn, where attendees covered the streets in colorful paint and powder. The opening day focused on the children's parade, featuring young musicians and dancers in bright costumes, marking the start of Europe's largest street festival. The annual event, which has been running for over 50 years, celebrates Caribbean culture and heritage. Organizers have also planned a 72-second silence on both days of the carnival to commemorate the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others who have passed away in recent years.</p>

          <p>In this opinion article, former EPA administrator Gina McCarthy criticizes the Trump administration's focus on fossil fuels and its withdrawal from global climate leadership, arguing it undermines America's economy and security. McCarthy contends that despite federal inaction, significant progress is being made at the state and local levels, with states like California, Florida, and Texas setting records in clean energy adoption. She highlights that corporations, cities, and investors continue to pursue ambitious climate goals because they recognize the economic and practical benefits of clean energy. McCarthy asserts that this widespread commitment demonstrates that the country's future lies in renewable technologies, regardless of the administration's stance.</p>

          <p>In a Q&A, former star quarterback Todd Marinovich reflects on writing his memoir, describing the process as a cathartic act of self-love after a life of defiance. He discusses his complicated relationship with his father, Marv, acknowledging his father's role in his intensive training but also defending him against what he feels was unfair public criticism. Marinovich recounts his turbulent years at USC, his brief NFL career with the Raiders, and his subsequent struggles with drug addiction, including heroin use, which spiraled as his football career waned. He shares his perspective on hitting multiple "rock bottoms" and the ongoing, one-day-at-a-time process of recovery.</p>

          <p>As the U.S. Open brings tennis into the spotlight, this article highlights the sport's growing popularity and its significant, long-term health advantages. Tennis provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves bone density and has been linked to a longer life expectancy compared to other physical activities. The sport also offers substantial cognitive benefits, as it requires complex motor coordination, rapid decision-making, and spatial awareness, which can enhance reaction times and buffer against cognitive decline. Unlike many sports, tennis is accessible to people of all ages, making it an ideal lifetime activity for maintaining both physical and mental fitness.</p>

          <h2>A Parent Reflects on How Reading Aloud to Her Infant Forged a Deeper Connection</h2>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author describes the profound experience of reading aloud to her newborn son, beginning with Romantic poetry in the hospital. She explains that this practice became a way to share her love of literature and connect with her child, even before he could understand the words or see the pictures clearly. As her son grew, simple board books helped teach him to discern objects and form words, which the author likens to a form of creation. She concludes that reading to her children was not just about teaching them to read, but was also a powerful tool for her to learn how to read them and understand their developing minds.</p>

          <p>This article posits that the most effective use of current artificial intelligence is not to fully automate jobs, but to collaborate with and augment human expertise. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it explains that imperfect automation can be dangerous, as it may undermine human skills and fail in critical moments. The authors distinguish between automation tools, which replace human input, and collaboration tools, which enhance it. They argue that AI should be designed as a collaborative partner, leveraging its vast data-processing capabilities to complement human strengths like contextual understanding, ethical intuition, and creativity, leading to better outcomes in complex fields like medicine and law.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to head the newly established U.S. National Design Studio, an agency tasked with streamlining and beautifying online government services. The studio, seen as a successor to the Department of Government Efficiency previously led by Elon Musk, will advise federal agencies on usability and standardized design for three years. Gebbia, who recently shifted his political alignment from Democrat to supporting Trump, aims to create a user experience for government websites comparable to the Apple App Store.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The First and Last Bank," proposes a novel approach to carbon sequestration by treating excess atmospheric carbon as a valuable, sacred commodity to be hoarded, much like the U.S. government does with gold. The authors envision a grassroots system of community-based carbon banks that would accept organic waste, convert it into stable biochar, and issue a local digital currency to depositors in return. This decentralized model would not require government or corporate buy-in, allowing communities to create their own value systems around carbon removal. The concept aims to incentivize sequestration by pairing a collective environmental mission with modest financial benefits for participants.</p>

          <p>Chelsea has authorized midfielder Carney Chukwuemeka and defender Aaron Anselmino to travel to Germany to complete moves to Borussia Dortmund. Chukwuemeka, who was on loan at Dortmund last season, is set for a permanent transfer for a fee of around £24 million, while Anselmino will join on a season-long loan. These departures will bring Chelsea's total income from player sales this summer to over £270 million, nearly balancing their spending on new transfers. The sales are crucial for the club to comply with UEFA's financial regulations, which require a positive transfer balance to register new signings for the Champions League.</p>

          <p>The disclosure that over 500 Taiwanese soldiers participated in this year's U.S. National Guard's Northern Strike drills in Michigan highlights a significant deepening of defense cooperation between Washington and Taipei. This contingent is the largest ever sent by Taiwan to the American-led exercises and marks the first time such participation figures have been publicly revealed. The move represents a departure from the long-standing U.S. policy of strategic ambiguity and avoiding public discussion of Taiwan's role in its military exercises. This development indicates strengthening ties despite the transactional nature of the Trump administration's foreign policy.</p>
