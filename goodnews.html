          <p>China has undertaken a significant environmental project by demolishing around 300 dams and closing hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. The initiative aims to restore the natural habitat for rare and endemic fish species, which have been severely impacted by decades of dam construction. These structures blocked migratory routes and altered water flows, sometimes causing sections of the river to dry up. This action is part of a broader effort to address ecological damage and preserve biodiversity in the region's vital waterways.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player via social media. The player, widely reported to be American star Montrezl Harrell of the Adelaide 36ers, received the abuse following a match in November 2024. The man was charged with using a carriage service to menace or harass and has been released on bail. Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a "landmark moment" in the fight against online abuse, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy to ensure a safe and respectful environment in sports.</p>

          <h2>Surge in Electric Truck Sales in China Curbs Diesel Demand</h2>

          <p>China is experiencing a rapid increase in the market share of electric heavy trucks, a trend that is significantly reducing the country's diesel consumption and impacting oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have surged by 175% in the first half of the year. This boom, primarily in short-haul vehicles for industrial use, has led analysts to revise diesel demand forecasts downward and accelerate predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak. The shift is seen as another blow to diesel usage, following the rise of electric cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant deposits of rubidium and gold, are part of a national strategy to enhance resource security. Investment in mineral exploration, particularly for critical elements like tin, copper, and bauxite used in high-tech industries, rose by nearly 24%. This push to identify and develop domestic resources is aimed at strengthening China's position in the global race for minerals essential for its economy and strategic sectors.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling signaling she will likely order the Trump administration to stop its agents from conducting unlawful stops and arrests of individuals based on their appearance. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other rights groups, argues that federal agents have been indiscriminately targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause as part of a mass deportation plan. The judge appeared to challenge the government's lack of specific evidence justifying the arrests, noting the plaintiffs had provided a high volume of evidence of indiscriminate targeting. A final order on the temporary restraining motions is expected shortly.</p>

The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major sanitation project, when a section of the tunnel caved in, trapping 27 workers who were later joined by four colleagues attempting a rescue. Firefighters, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, responded to the scene, and the workers were able to climb over a large pile of dirt to escape without any visible injuries. The project has been put on hold while Cal/OSHA investigates the cause of the collapse.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Bianchi, now 74, has been imprisoned since 1979 for his role in the sexual assault, torture, and murder of 12 women in Los Angeles and Washington state during the 1970s. He and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., terrorized the region by impersonating police officers to lure their victims. The parole board determined that Bianchi will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Buono died in prison in 2002 while serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite designated NWA 16788, with an expected sale price of up to $4 million. The 54-pound rock, which represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet, was discovered in Niger's Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe it was dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike before traveling 140 million miles to Earth. Such meteorites are exceptionally rare, providing valuable data for scientists studying the red planet. The meteorite is currently on public display in New York ahead of the July 16 auction.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science, known for its dinosaur exhibits, made a rare and unexpected fossil discovery directly beneath its own parking lot. A vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived approximately 67.5 million years ago was found in a core sample drilled from over 750 feet deep. The drilling was part of a study on the potential for geothermal heating for the museum. Museum officials described the find as incredibly rare, likening the odds to hitting a hole-in-one from the moon. The small, hockey-puck-shaped fossil is now on display, becoming the museum's deepest and oldest discovery from the immediate area.</p>

While the meeting's specific agenda was not disclosed, it occurs as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration has restricted sales of certain processors for national security reasons, a move Nvidia has stated effectively closes off the lucrative Chinese market. President Trump praised Nvidia's stock performance, attributing its 47% rise to his administration's tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

The iconic nightclub celebrated the occasion with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display. The original blades collapsed due to a failure in the central axis, but new aluminum sails were installed in time for the Paris Olympics. However, delays in acquiring a new electric motor, which also powers the landmark's lights, kept them motionless until now. The restoration returns a beloved symbol to the Parisian skyline.</p>

          <p>A political strategist claims to have identified a formula for effective campaign slogans by analyzing 20,000 messages from around the world. The analysis revealed eight words that consistently resonate with voters: people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together. These words act as "emotional shortcuts," though they don't guarantee victory on their own. While famous bespoke slogans like "Get Brexit Done" exist, the most effective ones often use these building blocks. The article also notes that the future of slogans may be changing due to AI, which allows for micro-targeted messaging tailored to individual voters.</p>
