          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 07:26:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fact-check by DW has debunked social media claims that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer, labeling the assertion as false. Experts confirm there is no scientific evidence for this association, and a graphic circulating online attributed to the Connecticut Tumor Registry was found to be misrepresented. The article explains that rising skin cancer incidence rates are linked to factors like better diagnostics, increased sun exposure, and climate change, not sunscreen use. While global sunscreen sales are rising, inconsistent application and use primarily during vacations may limit its effectiveness for many individuals.</p>

          <p>With average daily phone use exceeding four hours, smartphone addiction is a growing concern linked to mental health issues like depression and anxiety. This article explores the science behind this behavioral addiction, noting that apps are often designed to be engaging and escapist. Scientists recommend a multi-pronged approach to breaking the habit, including creating physical distance from the device, reducing notifications, and using self-control apps. For severe cases, professional help through cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can address the root causes of the addiction and retrain behaviors for long-term health benefits.</p>

          <p>Russian customs and security services announced the seizure of 1,800 pounds of cocaine, their largest bust from Latin America this year, with an estimated value of $153 million. The drugs were discovered hidden in a shipment of bananas, with packages disguised with the label of a luxury fashion brand. Officials stated the operation was based on a tip from foreign colleagues about a South American criminal group's smuggling channel. This incident is part of a global trend where large quantities of cocaine are found concealed within banana shipments.</p>

          <p>The United States has constructed new naval facilities in the Philippines, including at Oyster Bay, to enhance the repair and maintenance capabilities of the Philippine military's small watercraft. The U.S. embassy emphasized that the facility is not a military base and that all activities are coordinated with Manila. Analysts suggest the move is intended to directly strengthen the Philippine Navy's ability to confront Chinese maritime activities. The development also hints at the potential for shared use of naval facilities, deepening the strategic alliance between the two nations.</p>

          <p>For decades, Kentucky resident Russ Miller, known as the "River Cowboy," has dedicated himself to cleaning up the state's waterways, personally removing an estimated 3,000 to 4,000 illegally dumped tires from the Red River Gorge. Each year, millions of tires are improperly discarded in the U.S., with many ending up in rivers, where they can leach toxic chemicals. Miller's grassroots efforts have inspired volunteer groups and raised awareness, contributing to recent state-level legislative action to address the widespread pollution. His work highlights a persistent environmental problem rooted in a lack of convenient, legal disposal options for many rural residents.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, even as the company experienced a decline in sales volume in North America. The food and beverage giant's organic revenue grew 2.1%, though overall volume for its food products fell. To counter softer domestic demand, the company is focusing on cost-cutting measures, improving in-store execution, and investing in popular product categories like protein-fortified snacks. Despite the mixed performance, PepsiCo reaffirmed its full-year financial outlook, signaling confidence in its strategic adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have detailed the mechanics of the squirting cucumber, a plant that expels its seeds at high velocity to ensure their dispersal. Through high-speed videography and CT scans, scientists found the fruit ripens under high internal pressure and orients itself at a perfect ballistic angle. When disturbed, it shoots its seeds at nearly 30 miles per hour, launching them up to 40 feet away. The seeds are also coated in an incredibly strong, slimy adhesive, which could inspire new material science applications, from soft robotics to advanced glues.</p>
