          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to focus on the market's third-quarter winners, despite ongoing government shutdown headlines, suggesting these top performers offer a valuable roadmap for the year's final stretch. He highlighted companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, Seagate, and Warner Bros. Discovery for their substantial gains, attributing success to factors like AI demand and balance sheet improvements. Cramer believes many of these can continue rallying through the end of the year, but cautioned that the biggest gains for the year may have already been realized. Fund managers often acquire these successful stocks in the fourth quarter to present strong portfolios to clients, indicating potential sustained interest. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Choosing and Using Cooking Oils for Health</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professor Nita Forouhi from the University of Cambridge offers expert guidance on selecting and using cooking oils, dispelling common myths. She affirms that sunflower and vegetable oils are beneficial, being low in saturated fats and rich in healthier mono- and polyunsaturated fats essential for heart and brain health. Modern margarines are also deemed healthy, with negligible trans fats, and can help reduce bad cholesterol. While extra virgin olive oil is ideal for dressings, basic olive oil suits shallow frying, and vegetable or sunflower oil is recommended for deep frying due to their higher smoke points, ensuring healthier cooking.</p>

This year's maze design celebrates farmers, and the attraction also features a popular corn bath for toddlers. Visitors from various regions find delight in navigating the intricate pathways, often relying on children's innate sense of direction.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has granted captain Martin Odegaard "total freedom" on the field, recognizing his inherent creativity as a crucial asset for the team. Despite a shoulder injury disrupting his early season, Odegaard's recent performances, including his pivotal role in Arsenal's 2-0 Champions League victory over Olympiacos where he contributed to both goals, underscore his importance. Arteta expressed confidence in the 26-year-old midfielder's ability to take risks and generate space, indicating that Odegaard's return to form is making a significant difference for the Gunners as they compete at Europe's top level.</p>

          <p>Hackers, operating under the name Radiant, who attempted to extort a nursery chain by publishing stolen images and private data of approximately 8,000 children on the darknet, now claim to have deleted all the information. This unusual reversal follows widespread public condemnation and direct threatening phone calls to parents, with the group stating, "We are sorry for hurting kids." Kido Schools reportedly did not pay the estimated £100,000 ransom. While the reliability of hackers' claims to delete data is often questionable, this incident highlights a rare instance where public outcry appears to have influenced cybercriminals' actions, suggesting an unexpected ethical boundary was crossed.</p>

          <p>Manchester City twice squandered a lead, resulting in a 2-2 draw against Monaco in the Champions League after conceding a 90th-minute penalty. Star striker Erling Haaland, who netted both of City's goals, openly criticized the team's performance, stating they "don't deserve to win" and lacked sufficient energy in the second half. This result extends a concerning pattern for City of conceding crucial late goals, which has negatively impacted their standings in both the Premier League and Champions League. Despite a six-game unbeaten run, this draw represents another missed opportunity to improve their poor away record in European competition.</p>

          <p>Despite the ongoing US government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs, indicating investors remain largely unfazed by the political gridlock. Historical data from 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 reveals a modest average gain of 0.3% for the S&P 500 during these periods, followed by an average 13% jump in the subsequent 12 months. Economists suggest most economic activity is merely delayed rather than lost. However, analysts caution that a prolonged impasse could significantly erode investor confidence and halt the release of crucial economic data, potentially leaving investors "flying blind" and impacting future growth.

          <p>Pope Leo XIV, in his first significant comments on US politics, challenged the "pro-life" stance of individuals who oppose abortion but simultaneously support the death penalty, asserting such a position is inconsistent. He also questioned the sincerity of those claiming to be pro-life while condoning inhumane treatment of immigrants. These remarks, reflecting established Catholic arguments, came amidst controversy over Chicago Cardinal Blase Cupich's plan to honor Senator Dick Durbin, an abortion rights supporter. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, publicly disputed the Pope's concerns regarding the treatment of immigrants under the current administration.</p>

The blast, which residents likened to a bomb, sent debris raining down onto nearby buildings.
