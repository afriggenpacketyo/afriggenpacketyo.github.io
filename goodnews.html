        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Microsoft is set to reduce its workforce by 3%, impacting employees across all levels, teams, and geographies. The decision is part of organizational changes aimed at positioning the company for success in a dynamic marketplace, according to a Microsoft spokesperson. This round of layoffs is not performance-based and is likely the largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023. The article contextualizes the layoffs with Microsoft's recent better-than-expected financial results and upbeat quarterly forecast, signaling a strategic realignment rather than a response to financial distress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April, marking the smallest annual increase since February 2021, driven by lower prices for groceries and gasoline. However, economists warn that President Trump's tariffs could soon reignite inflation, potentially costing the average U.S. household an extra $2,800. The article details how tariffs, as taxes on imports, are expected to be passed on to consumers through higher prices. Despite a temporary trade deal with China, core inflation is still projected to rise, creating uncertainty about the inflation outlook.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in April showed a 2.3% annual increase, slightly below economists' expectations, yet still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were primary drivers of inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease, with egg prices dropping significantly. Economists are closely monitoring the impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices. The article discusses the potential for the Fed to hold off on cutting rates as it assesses the effects of trade policies, potentially delaying relief on borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.</p>
