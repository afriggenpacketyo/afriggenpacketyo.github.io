          <p>U.S. airlines are engaged in a fierce competition to attract international business-class travelers, with American Airlines and United Airlines introducing upgraded suites featuring amenities like sliding doors, wireless charging pads, and larger screens. These enhanced offerings aim to provide a more luxurious and private experience for premium customers. Airlines are betting that consumers will continue to spend on better travel experiences despite weaker demand for lower-priced tickets.

          <p>The Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed subdued inflation in April as consumer spending slowed. The Federal Reserve has put interest rate cuts on hold until it has more clarity about President Trump‚Äôs policies. The personal consumption expenditures price index increased only slightly, while consumer spending posted a modest gain, reflecting a more cautious consumer mood. The data suggests that inflationary pressures are easing, but the Fed remains cautious about future policy decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump and Elon Musk are scheduled to appear together in the Oval Office as Musk's tenure as a "special government employee" concludes. Musk, who led the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), will return to the private sector but continue as an adviser to the president. During his time in DOGE, Musk aimed to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, but fell short of this goal, achieving roughly $160 billion in savings, according to his estimates. However, Musk has recently disagreed with Trump over the president's domestic policy package, which Musk believes increases the budget deficit.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man survived after being trapped face-down in an icy creek by a 700lb boulder for three hours, sustaining only minor injuries. His wife held his head above water to prevent him from drowning while waiting for rescuers, with a sled dog tourism company providing helicopter transport for the rescue team. It took seven men and inflatable air bags to lift the boulder off him as he drifted in and out of consciousness. The man acknowledged his luck and credited his wife's quick thinking and the efforts of the rescuers for his survival.</p>

          <p>New sumo grand champion Onosato performed his first ring-entering ceremony at Tokyo's Meiji Jingu shrine, marking his promotion to yokozuna. The 24-year-old achieved the rank after just 13 professional tournaments, making it a record pace.

Net income rose to $1.90 billion, with comparable sales up 8% and e-commerce sales rising nearly 16%. Costco has been actively managing tariff costs by rushing orders, rerouting goods, and sourcing more items for its Kirkland Signature brand locally.</p>

She justified the choices by stating that women's matches can potentially go "really fast" due to being played over three sets. Mauresmo also noted that the tournament aims to avoid late finishes by limiting night sessions to one match. She pointed to the full crowd at a recent men's match as a measure of the schedule's success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unanimous ruling by the United States Court of International Trade against President Trump's expansive tariffs is being hailed as a victory for the constitutional system of separation of powers and the rule of law. The court found that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The decision upholds the principle that the president cannot impose taxes in the form of tariffs without legislative authorization. The ruling imposes a nationwide permanent injunction blocking the tariffs, though the administration has appealed the decision.</p>

          <p>Former yokozuna Hakuho is planning to retire from the Japan Sumo Association due to uncertainty surrounding the future of his scandal-hit Miyagino stable. The stable was closed in April 2024 after a top-division grappler was found to have physically abused junior wrestlers. The association's board of directors has yet to seriously discuss the stable's reopening, leading to the belief that it will not be feasible. The status of the stable is expected to be discussed at an upcoming board meeting, and Hakuho is likely to hold a press conference following the official announcement.</p>
