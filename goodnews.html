          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, he juggled a ball off his glove and kicked it back into the air with his foot for a "hacky-sack" style catch to rob a batter of extra bases. He followed this in the ninth with a leaping catch at the wall to take away a potential game-tying home run, dealing a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept an interim deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production rather than demanding complete denuclearization. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described this as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to halt the North's growing arsenal, which is estimated to be expanding by 15-20 weapons annually. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume negotiations, viewing their mutual trust as a potential pathway to reducing tensions.</p>

          <p>Protests took place across all 26 states of Brazil against a legislative proposal that could grant amnesty to former President Jair Bolsonaro and his allies convicted of attempting a coup. The demonstrations were fueled by a bill, fast-tracked by right-wing lawmakers, that would pardon those involved in the January 2023 uprising. Prominent artists and cultural figures helped organize the protests, urging the public to reject what they see as an attempt to shield politicians from accountability.</p>
