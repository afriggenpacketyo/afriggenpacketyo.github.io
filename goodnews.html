          <h2>PwC Report Challenges Myths About AI's Impact on Jobs and Wages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 01:36:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new PwC report, analyzing over 800 million job ads across six continents, challenges common fears about AI's impact on the workforce. The report indicates that AI is creating jobs and increasing wages, particularly for workers with AI skills, which are seeing a 56% wage increase. It also finds that productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries best positioned to adopt AI since 2022. The study suggests that AI can enrich automatable jobs by freeing up employees for more complex tasks, and that softening job growth in AI-exposed occupations could be beneficial in countries with declining working-age populations. The report highlights the need for workers to be prepared to take on new roles requiring different skills in the evolving job market.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-06 01:27:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese producer prices have been in deflationary territory for over two years due to overcapacity and weak domestic demand, leading to concerns of a "China shock" in global markets. While steep tariffs deter Chinese exports to the U.S., other countries in Asia worry that a flood of cheap imports could squeeze local industries. However, some economists believe this influx of low-cost goods could ease inflationary pressures in inflation-worn economies, offering central banks some relief. Nomura predicts that emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may lead to more rate cuts across Asia, with central banks decoupling from the Fed to deliver additional easing (not investment advice).</p>

MSC's senior vice-president Marie-Caroline Laurent stated that the competitiveness of Chinese shipyards cannot be easily matched in the short term, particularly for vessels needed for the energy transition. She acknowledged the U.S.'s efforts to revive its shipbuilding sector, but noted that it would require state subsidies and strategic assets and would not happen overnight.</p>

          <p>The article reflects on the unlikely victory of a horse named Journalism at the Preakness Stakes. Journalism, initially fading in the pack, demonstrated patience and resilience, surging late to win the race. The horse is now headed to the Belmont Stakes at Saratoga, and the author uses the horse's victory as a metaphor for patience and perseverance in a fast-paced world. The author suggests that Journalism is the horse we forgot how to ride and that his victory is a reminder that some victories are earned not by charging to the front but by knowing exactly when to move.</p>

          <p>Republican lawmakers are standing firm against Elon Musk's criticism of President Trump's "Big, Beautiful Bill," despite Musk's influence and demands for a new piece of legislation. House Speaker Mike Johnson attempted to contact Musk but was unsuccessful, while Republicans expressed frustration with Musk's vague criticism and lack of productive feedback. Democrats, on the other hand, saw Musk's opposition as an opportunity to sidetrack the bill, though some acknowledged their past criticism of Musk. The Congressional Budget Office estimates the bill will add $2.3 trillion to the deficit over a decade, a figure Republicans dispute.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, suggested that the government might initiate emergency rice imports if current measures fail to lower prices. The government is releasing rice reserves to combat soaring prices, but Koizumi emphasized that no agricultural policy should be considered a "sacred cow." The government currently imports 770,000 tons of rice annually tariff-free under WTO rules, but most is not for human consumption. The government is also attempting to contain soaring prices by selling reserve rice directly to retailers.</p>
