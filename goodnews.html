          <p>A Major League Baseball game between the Atlanta Braves and the Cincinnati Reds, held at Tennessee's Bristol Motor Speedway, successfully broke the league's regular-season attendance record. The unique venue attracted a massive crowd, with over 85,000 tickets sold for the event. Despite the historic turnout and excitement, the game itself was short-lived. It had to be suspended in the first inning due to heavy rain, putting a damper on the otherwise record-setting occasion.</p>

          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area on Saturday night, with its epicenter located near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. The U.S. Geological Survey confirmed the minor quake, which caused brief shaking felt across parts of the region. New York City Emergency Management stated that no injuries or damage were reported in the city. An analyst from the USGS noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, a magnitude 3.0 event is not considered significant and is not expected to cause damage.</p>

          <p>Germany has entered into a new military-industrial cooperation with Ukraine, agreeing to finance the production of long-range combat drones directly on Ukrainian soil. This marks a significant shift in Germany's support, moving beyond arms delivery to direct investment in Ukraine's defense industry. The agreement includes funding for approximately 500 An-196 Liutyi attack drones, which have a range of up to 2,000 kilometers. This collaboration not only provides Ukraine with crucial weaponry but also aims to leverage German technology and know-how to enhance Ukraine's domestic production capabilities against ongoing Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>In Lagos, Nigeria, a unique church offers a dedicated space for the deaf community to worship and connect. For hours each Sunday, services are conducted almost entirely in sign language, with the beat of drums providing cues for the congregation. The church, which began as the Christian Mission for Deaf Africans in 1956, has become a vital community hub in a country with limited infrastructure for its estimated 10 million deaf or hearing-impaired citizens. It provides a safe space, sign language classes, and a sense of belonging, countering societal isolation and stigma.</p>

          <p>Nearly ten years after the Zika virus outbreak in Brazil, mothers of children born with congenital Zika syndrome are finding strength in a community they built themselves. Many of these children, now nine years old, cannot walk, talk, or eat on their own and require constant care. In Maceió, the epicenter of the outbreak, a group of affected mothers have moved into the same housing complex to create a mutual support network, helping each other with childcare and navigating legal battles for healthcare. Their decade-long advocacy recently resulted in a legislative victory for increased financial compensation from the government.</p>

          <p>A new BBC One series, "Parenthood," narrated by Sir David Attenborough, will document the extraordinary lengths animal parents go to for their young. The series promises to show universal and relatable parental dilemmas, from a poison dart frog father carrying tadpoles up trees to the ultimate sacrifice of the African social spider mother, who is eaten by her own offspring. The director highlights that the show, filmed across six continents, aims to explore how animals adapt to a changing world, offering lessons in dedication and ingenuity. At 99 years old, Attenborough continues to provide his iconic narration for these nature documentaries.</p>

          <p>As director Gurinder Chadha hints at a potential sequel, women are reflecting on the profound cultural impact of the 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham." The movie, which follows a Punjabi teenager who defies her family's expectations to play football, is credited with making many South Asian women feel seen and understood. For many, the film mirrored their own struggles against cultural and familial barriers to participating in sports. Despite significant progress in women's football since the film's release, its themes of representation and pursuing one's passion against the odds remain highly relevant.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and a mother of two young children, has been released after being held in an ICE detention facility for two months. She was detained in May during what was supposed to be a routine green card application interview, leaving her husband to care for their two-year-old and newborn daughter. The family was unaware of a years-old deportation order issued after her mother, who had abandoned her, missed an immigration hearing. Her case highlights the "hyper-enforcement environment" where deference previously given to military families is being superseded by new detention priorities.</p>

          <p>Ukraine's anti-corruption agencies have arrested a member of parliament and several other officials in connection with a large-scale bribery scheme involving the procurement of military drones. The scheme allegedly involved signing state contracts with suppliers at prices inflated by as much as 30%. President Volodymyr Zelensky affirmed his "zero tolerance" policy for corruption, praising the agencies for their work. The arrests come shortly after the independence of these anti-corruption bodies was restored following public protests, a move seen as crucial for Ukraine's bid to join the European Union.</p>
