          <p>Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for a state supreme court race in North Carolina, has conceded the election to Allison Riggs after a six-month legal battle contesting the results. The prolonged legal contest raised significant alarm among legal observers because it could lay out a playbook to try to overturn election results after voting has concluded. After the election, Griffin sought to have some 65,000 votes thrown out. Even though voters had not done anything wrong, his lawyers argued that the rules state election officials had set well in advance of the election were illegal. Optimism score is 65.</p>
