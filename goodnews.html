          <p>Nintendo announced that its fiscal first-quarter revenue more than doubled year-over-year, driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, significantly boosting its video game platform sales. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its conservative full-year financial guidance. Analysts remain optimistic about the company's prospects, believing an expanded user base will offset short-term profitability declines from potential U.S. tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy restricting its main civil service internship program to university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." This initiative, driven by Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation within Whitehall to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be given priority for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move has drawn criticism from the Conservative opposition, who labeled it as "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>Chinese schoolgirl Yu Zidi has made history as the youngest swimmer to win a medal at the World Aquatics Championships. The 12-year-old earned a bronze medal after participating in the heats for the women's 4x200m freestyle relay. Her participation has sparked debate, as competitors are typically required to be at least 14, but she was granted an exception for meeting the 'A' standard times. While some experts express concern about the physical and mental strain on such a young athlete, others celebrate her as a remarkable prodigy.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has publicly denied that its H20 chips contain "back doors" that would allow for remote access or control. The statement follows an inquiry from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which summoned company representatives over potential security risks in the chips designed specifically for the Chinese market. This development underscores the complex position of the U.S. tech giant, which must navigate the security concerns of Beijing while complying with export controls from Washington amid the escalating U.S.-China tech rivalry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, known as the Rhisotope Project, is injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. This innovative technique, developed by the University of the Witwatersrand and its partners, makes the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at borders and airports. The goal is to deter poaching and disrupt trafficking networks by increasing the risk of arrest. After successful trials confirmed the method is safe for the animals, the project officially launched with the injection of five rhinos.</p>

          <p>An analysis of the space industry indicates a growing shift in focus from the Moon to Mars as the ultimate goal for human exploration. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar objectives, including a planned human habitat, these are increasingly framed as stepping stones for future missions to the red planet. This new space race involves multiple nations, including China and European countries, all with ambitions for Mars. The article suggests that as national agencies pivot toward Mars, lunar projects may increasingly become the domain of private companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh has defended the court's management of a rising number of emergency appeals, particularly from the Trump administration. Speaking at a judicial conference, Kavanaugh attributed the increase to presidents using executive orders to bypass congressional inaction, which inevitably leads to more legal challenges requiring the court's intervention. He acknowledged criticism over the lack of detailed reasoning in some emergency orders but stated the court has improved its process. Kavanaugh emphasized that despite disagreements, collegiality among the justices remains strong.</p>

In her ruling, Judge Trina L. Thompson stated the administration's decision was likely motivated by racial animus and failed to properly review current country conditions. The ruling provides a reprieve for TPS holders, who were facing the loss of their legal status and deportation protections in August and September, extending them until at least November.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), reported an 18% increase in revenue for the second quarter, reaching $30.87 billion. This growth was slightly ahead of analyst expectations and demonstrates the continued strength of the market leader. However, AWS faces intensifying competition from Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud, both of which posted higher quarterly growth rates. AWS remains a major profit center for Amazon, generating $10.2 billion in operating income, as all major cloud providers ramp up investment in artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>
