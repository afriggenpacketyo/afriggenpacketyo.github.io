          <p>The Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, was targeted by Iranian missiles in retaliation for U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Established in 1996, the base serves as the forward headquarters for U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM), overseeing military operations across a vast region. President Trump visited Al Udeid in May, reaffirming the U.S. commitment to defending its interests and partners, while the U.S. maintains a significant military presence in the Middle East, with bases and installations in countries including Bahrain, Kuwait, and Iraq. Despite the recent attack, which was reportedly intercepted, the base remains a crucial hub for U.S. military operations and regional stability. </p>

          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, two days after the U.S. struck three nuclear sites in Iran, but U.S. and Qatari authorities reported the missiles were intercepted without injuries. President Trump indicated the U.S. received prior warning of the attack, while Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, describing the missile strike as "devastating and powerful." The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, with Al Udeid Air Base serving as the forward headquarters for CENTCOM. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar issued and then lifted a shelter-in-place order, and Bahrain also temporarily closed its airspace, highlighting the heightened tensions in the region. </p>

Despite the risk of future detention, Khalil vowed to continue speaking out, emphasizing the importance of justice and equality for Palestinians.

          <p>NHS England will begin offering at-home HPV testing kits to women who have delayed or avoided cervical screening, beginning in January, to improve early detection of cervical cancer. The self-sampling kits, containing a vaginal swab, will be sent in discreet packaging with pre-paid postage to women aged 25-64 who are not up-to-date with their screenings. If HPV is detected, women will be invited for a follow-up appointment to check for cell changes. The initiative aims to address barriers such as embarrassment, discomfort, and lack of time that prevent women from attending traditional screenings, with a goal of increasing screening rates to 77% over three years. </p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire after more than a week of aerial attacks following Israel's attack on Iran's nuclear program. This agreement includes two 12-hour ceasefire periods before the war is over, according to Trump, while Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar on Monday. The attack by Iran was in response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop 14 Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran on Saturday, and Trump stated that monumental damage was done to all nuclear sites in Iran. The situation remains fluid, and the ceasefire's durability is yet to be determined. </p>

The agency is gathering additional information about these incidents, while the federal safety regulator does not pre-approve new technologies, it investigates potential safety defects.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>RBN Energy executive Rusty Braziel told CNBC that Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial oil shipping passage, despite recent threats following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. According to Braziel, Iran has threatened to close the Strait during major conflicts for over 20 years but has never followed through due to its own economic interests, as it exports 1.7 million barrels a day through the Strait. Braziel also warned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China pose serious issues for exporters, making global customers more reluctant to buy other energy products. If Iran were to close the strait, the loss of so many barrels would make U.S. exports more valuable. (not investment advice)</p>

Following the strikes, Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, urging both countries to pursue peace, echoing Iran's 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq, where advance notice was also given.

These voters believe Trump is protecting American interests while preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons, though some expressed disappointment and concern about potential long-term conflict. While some Republican leaders criticized the strikes, others defended Trump's decision to proceed without congressional approval, citing the need for decisive action. Trump's supporters trust his judgment and access to national security intelligence, despite acknowledging the unexpected nature of the strikes. </p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated with missiles aimed at a U.S. base in Qatar, but President Trump claimed all parties had agreed to a ceasefire. Trump characterized Iran's response as "very weak" and expressed hope that Iran would pursue peace, signaling a potential de-escalation, and his initial reaction suggests he is inclined to hold his fire in hopes that the Iranians will be willing to negotiate in earnest. This approach mirrors the 2020 Soleimani killing, where the U.S. chose not to escalate after Iranian retaliation, but the situation remains sensitive, and the ultimate outcome depends on whether the ceasefire holds and further attacks are avoided. </p>

          <p>The U.S. health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to change prior authorization practices, a common and often criticized process where insurers require patients to seek approval before receiving medical treatment. The voluntary measures aim to standardize the approval process, expedite decisions, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, and increase transparency through a public dashboard. While officials expressed hope for the agreement, some, like Dr Greg Murphy, remained skeptical about insurers' commitment and questioned whether the measures were merely for placating an audience. Notably, insurance companies made a similar pledge in 2018, but the American Medical Association argued that insurers failed to uphold their end of the bargain. </p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, ‚ÄúElio,‚Äù experienced the lowest opening weekend in the studio's history, earning $21 million in the U.S. and Canada, highlighting the challenges for original animated movies in attracting audiences. Despite strong reviews, ‚ÄúElio‚Äù came in third at the box office, while analysts attributed the film's performance to post-pandemic difficulties for original animated films and competition from other family-friendly movies. Disney remains optimistic about the film's long-term potential and plans to continue investing in original animated intellectual property. The film's performance underscores the difficulty of attracting audiences to new stories and characters, as animated sequels and films based on existing intellectual property continue to dominate the box office. </p>
