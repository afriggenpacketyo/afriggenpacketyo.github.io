          <p>A bank teller, Izabella Bogumil, identifies common mistakes Social Security recipients make, emphasizing the importance of strategic planning. Claiming benefits too early, at age 62, results in a significant reduction in monthly payments, often leading to financial struggles. Bogumil recommends waiting until age 70 to maximize benefits, highlighting the potential for increased payments by delaying retirement. Careful consideration of claiming age is crucial for maximizing Social Security benefits and ensuring financial security in retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kyoto saw a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, with overall visitor numbers second only to 2015, but satisfaction levels remain high despite overtourism issues. A survey found that 97.2% of foreign tourists and 94.6% of Japanese tourists were at least fairly satisfied with their visits. Temples, shrines, and historic sites were popular among foreign visitors, while Japanese tourists expressed more concern about crowds and public transportation. A lodging tax increase is planned for 2026 to address overtourism, with revenue directed towards strengthening related measures.</p>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is drawing attention as Japan faces a potential absence of giant pandas for the first time in over half a century. Experts suggest China may loan new pandas to Japan to stabilize relations amid escalating tensions with the United States. Since 1972, pandas have symbolized friendship between the two countries, with China last sending pandas to Japan in 2011. However, historical and territorial disputes continue to strain relations, making the potential panda loan a significant gesture of goodwill.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence usage increases, potentially harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements, are being uncovered, highlighting the need for more standards and testing. Researchers emphasize the lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Red teaming, involving testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is suggested as a way to evaluate risks. Standardized 'AI flaw' reports, incentives, and information dissemination are recommended to ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools and users.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, Reem Raouda, identifies five "toxic" phrases that hinder communication with children and offers alternative approaches for fostering cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so" and "Stop crying" are discouraged, as they shut down communication and invalidate children's emotions. Instead, the expert suggests using phrases that acknowledge feelings, explain reasoning, and invite problem-solving. The goal is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural by respecting the child's autonomy and providing emotional safety.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro, a weight loss injection, will be available at GP surgeries in England for those meeting strict criteria, including a high BMI and specific health conditions. The move aims to provide access to those most in need, but some GP practices warn that many patients will not immediately qualify. Mounjaro, initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, helps with weight loss by making individuals feel fuller, but requires ongoing support and monitoring. NHS England plans to expand availability in phases over the next few years, with the health watchdog NICE evaluating the rollout.</p>

          <p>The UK government has made it known that it was informed in advance about the US attacks on Iran but did not participate. While the Prime Minister has spoken to President Trump, there was no direct request for UK involvement, such as authorizing US warplanes to use the UK military base on Diego Garcia. The British government has repeatedly pressed publicly for "de-escalation," and questions have seemingly been raised privately about the legality of getting involved. The article suggests that some trade-offs could soon return, depending on Iran's response.</p>

          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold last year being electric. The Chinese government's long-term planning, vast subsidies, and dominance in battery production have contributed to this success. The government spent around $231 billion developing the EV industry from 2009 to 2023. Chinese EV makers are now looking to sell more cars overseas, challenging traditional car manufacturers.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine assisted therapy to clients with treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a party drug, is being explored for its potential to treat severe depression. The proposed clinic aims to provide a more accessible and controlled environment for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments.</p>
