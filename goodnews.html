          <p>The North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) dispatched fighter jets to intercept a civilian aircraft that violated a temporary flight restriction zone over former President Trump's Bedminster, New Jersey, property. The military aircraft used flares to get the pilot's attention and escorted the plane out of the restricted airspace. This was one of five such incursions over the weekend, prompting NORAD to remind general aviation pilots to check for flight restrictions before takeoff. Officials emphasized that the flares are used with the highest regard for safety and pose no danger to people on the ground.</p>

          <p>Google DeepMind is advancing its artificial intelligence capabilities with a new model called Genie 2, which can generate playable, 3D interactive environments from a single static image. CEO Demis Hassabis demonstrated how the technology can transform a photograph into a game-like world that an AI agent or human can explore. This technology is seen as a crucial step in developing "world models" that can help AI understand and learn about the physical world. Such simulated environments could be used to train robots for real-world tasks more efficiently and safely than physical training alone.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elective egg freezing is rapidly gaining popularity among women, offering them the ability to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood, a choice some see as revolutionary as the birth control pill. The procedure involves hormone injections and a surgical retrieval, with an average cost of $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage and future IVF fees. While many women find it empowering, bioethicists caution that it is not a guarantee of a future baby, as there is a drop-off at each stage from thawing to birth. This article explores the personal stories, high costs, and societal implications of this growing trend.</p>

While highlighting the immense potential benefits, Hassabis also acknowledged significant risks, such as misuse by bad actors and the challenge of keeping powerful, autonomous AI systems aligned with human values. He stressed the need for international coordination and safety guardrails to manage the technology's development responsibly.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Brian Hagedorn, a conservative, has voiced concern over the record-breaking spending in the state's judicial elections, suggesting it reflects a "vote of no-confidence" in the court's impartiality. In a recent interview, he stated that the influx of money from both sides indicates that the public increasingly views the court as an extension of politics. Hagedorn, who is part of the court's 4-3 conservative minority, also commented on the court's long-standing "culture issue" of internal dysfunction and stated he is inclined to run for re-election when his term ends in 2029.</p>

          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake centered in Bergen County, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City metropolitan area on a Saturday night. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake occurred about 10 kilometers below the surface. While the tremor was minor and no significant damage or injuries were reported, it startled residents, with some reporting a loud boom and brief, sharp shaking. This event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the region in April 2024, though officials noted that such minor quakes are not cause for alarm.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight bound for Munich experienced an engine failure shortly after takeoff from Washington Dulles International Airport, forcing it to declare an emergency and return. The pilot of the Boeing 787 issued a "mayday" call as the aircraft was ascending, reporting a failure in the left engine. The plane landed safely back at Dulles, and none of the 219 passengers or 11 crew members were injured. The flight was subsequently canceled, and the airline made alternative travel arrangements for the affected passengers.</p>

          <p>The Krasheninnikov volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula has erupted for the first time in at least 400 years, sending a plume of ash thousands of feet into the air. The eruption occurred just days after a powerful 8.8-magnitude earthquake struck off the coast of the peninsula. Seismologists suggest the quake may have triggered the eruption, as the seismic waves could have disturbed the magma system of the volcano, which was already primed to erupt. An aviation alert was issued for the area, but there is no immediate threat to the sparsely populated region.</p>

          <p>Marvel's "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office in its second weekend, earning $40 million despite a steep 66% drop from its debut.

The weekend's new releases, "The Bad Guys 2" and "The Naked Gun," took the second and third spots with $22.2 million and $17 million, respectively. The overall summer box office is tracking ahead of last year, but the slow start to August highlights the need for upcoming films to perform well.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, driven primarily by economic factors rather than climate policy. Utilities like Florida Power & Light are leading the charge, taking advantage of rules that streamline the construction of solar farms, which are now often cheaper than natural gas. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits, which is expected to slow rooftop solar installations. Despite the growth, challenges remain, including the need for significant grid upgrades and the state's continued heavy reliance on natural gas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to introduce prison sentences of up to five years for people smugglers who use social media to advertise illegal crossings of the English Channel. The move aims to give law enforcement more tools to combat criminal gangs who promote their services online, often with false promises of a safe journey. The Home Office reports that a record number of migrants have made the dangerous journey this year, with a vast majority using social media to contact smugglers. The plan is part of the Labour government's broader strategy to address the "small boats" crisis.</p>
