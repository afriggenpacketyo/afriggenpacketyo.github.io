          <h2>Trump Claims 'Total Obliteration' of Iran Nuclear Program Amidst Conflicting Reports</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that U.S.-Israeli strikes had "totally obliterated" Iran's nuclear program, contradicting an early Pentagon analysis suggesting limited damage. Trump insisted the program was set back "basically decades," while Defense Secretary Hegseth supported Trump's assessment, attributing any conflicting reports to political motives and leaked preliminary intelligence. Democratic Senators Shaheen and Coons emphasized the need for answers and a return to negotiations, highlighting the potential for increased nuclear tensions. Trump also expressed optimism about future U.S.-Iran relations, stating a ceasefire was in place and likening the U.S. strikes to the atomic bombings of Japan to end World War II. The efficacy of the strikes remains a point of contention, but the president believes the war is over and Iran's nuclear ambitions are severely curtailed. Optimism regarding the long-term effects of the strikes and the future of U.S.-Iran relations remains cautious. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have remained relatively stable, hovering around 7% since early April, despite economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association, the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88% last week. This stability has done little to incentivize homebuyers, who continue to face high house prices and limited housing supply. While purchase demand is up 11% from last year, overall mortgage application volumes remain historically low, reflecting a cautious market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Union's General Court dismissed a lawsuit by Ryanair against German state aid granted to Condor airline during the COVID-19 pandemic. The case concerned ‚Ç¨400 million in loans provided by the state development bank KfW, which were approved by the European Commission in July 2021. Ryanair challenged this approval, arguing it discriminated against other airlines, but the court found the Commission acted lawfully. The judges found no evidence that the aid violated freedom of establishment or the free provision of services, though Ryanair may still appeal the decision to the European Court of Justice.</p>

However, Spain has deemed the 5% target "unreasonable," seeking an opt-out, while Italy has questioned the point of the alliance.
