          <p>With average credit card APRs near 22% and total balances exceeding $1.2 trillion, many Americans face difficulties affording September credit card payments amidst rising inflation and stretched budgets. This article outlines several proactive steps to avoid missed payments and potential credit damage. Recommendations include immediately contacting credit card companies to inquire about hardship programs, exploring debt management plans and credit counseling services, carefully considering balance transfers to cards with 0% introductory APRs, and evaluating debt consolidation loans to combine multiple high-interest debts into a single, more manageable payment. The overarching advice emphasizes taking swift action to prevent further financial strain and long-term credit score repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Key Senate contests are beginning to take shape for the 2026 midterm elections, with Democrats aiming to flip four seats to gain a majority against a Republican-held chamber. Over a third of Senate seats are up for election, including 13 Democratic and 24 Republican defenses, many in states President Trump comfortably won in 2024. The retirement of three Democratic senators creates possible openings for the GOP, while Democrats are eyeing competitive races in states like North Carolina, Georgia, New Hampshire, and Michigan. High-profile candidates, contentious primary challenges, and significant advertising spending are expected to define these crucial battles, which will ultimately determine control of the Senate.</p>

          <p>The Spanish Civil Guard successfully dismantled an illegal animal trafficking ring in Nules, Valencia, discovering over 150 exotic animals from 56 species at an unlicensed pet store. Two men, aged 30 and 35, were arrested and are being prosecuted for trafficking protected species and smuggling, having sold the animals online without the necessary permits. Among the rescued creatures were several endangered species with the highest international protection, including two ring-tailed lemurs, a Bali starling, and two Asian otters, alongside a zebra, kinkajous, and meerkats. Authorities also recovered three macaws, two of which had been reported stolen from a town in Almería. The estimated market value of the seized animals is nearly $81,500.</p>

          <h2>Gold Price Outlook for September: Factors Influencing Potential Fluctuations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 15:20:41 EDT</div>

          <p>This article explores whether gold prices, currently around $3,374.77 per ounce after significant gains in 2024, will fall in September, presenting a mixed outlook for investors. A potential decline in August inflation could lead to lower gold prices due to its inverse relationship with the dollar's purchasing power, reducing the need for alternative assets. Conversely, an increasingly likely Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September, with over an 87% chance, could cause gold prices to rise, as historically lower rates increase demand for the metal. Given this inherent uncertainty, the article suggests investors consider strategies like dollar-cost averaging or fractional investments to get involved, acknowledging that gold prices generally trend upward over time despite short-term fluctuations.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $815 million for Wednesday night's drawing, making it the seventh largest in the game's history, after no winning tickets were sold for Monday night's $750 million grand prize. The winning numbers from Monday's drawing were 16, 19, 34, 37, 64, with a Powerball of 22. The estimated cash value for Wednesday's jackpot is $367.9 million, before taxes, and could grow further as ticket sales increase. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of taking a lump sum payment or opting for a payout via an annuity, consisting of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year.</p>

Frisby also spoke for the first time about a lengthy, ultimately successful legal battle over accusations of stealing the company idea, describing it as "the darkest period of my life," marked by death threats and homophobic abuse from disgruntled shareholders.</p>

          <p>A "haboob," an Arabic term for a dust storm caused by outflowing winds from an incoming thunderstorm, recently engulfed the Phoenix area, disrupting travel and power for thousands. This article explains that haboobs form when strong downdrafts from cumulonimbus clouds hit dry ground, pushing outward and kicking up massive plumes of dust and debris ahead of the storm. They are common in arid and semi-arid regions globally, including the US Southwest, particularly under severe drought conditions. Haboobs significantly reduce visibility, posing extreme dangers for drivers, who are advised to pull off the road, stop, turn off all lights, and set emergency brakes to ensure safety.</p>

This event is not the first instance of Swift impacting the business world; her "Eras" tour previously generated a substantial consumer spending bump, which was notably documented by Wall Street analysts and even received a nod in the Federal Reserve's "Beige Book."

          <p>Frontier Airlines is aggressively expanding its network with 20 new routes this winter, many in key Spirit Airlines markets like Fort Lauderdale, aiming to capture customers from its struggling rival. Spirit recently warned it might not survive another year without more cash, facing challenges from changing customer tastes, oversupply of domestic capacity, and higher labor and other costs. Frontier CEO Barry Biffle indicated his airline expects to pick up the majority of Spirit's market share if the competitor collapses. Both ultra-low-cost carriers have struggled, also facing increasing competition from larger rivals like United, American, and Delta, which have rolled out their own no-frills basic economy tickets.

The pill, a potential needle-free alternative in the lucrative GLP-1 market, helped patients lose an average of 10.5% of their weight at 72 weeks and significantly lowered blood sugar levels, with most no longer meeting Type 2 diabetes criteria. While existing injections show greater weight loss, this oral option offers "unprecedented efficacy" for this patient group. Despite mainly gastrointestinal side effects, its convenience and potential for broader access and lower pricing make it a significant development in obesity and diabetes treatment.</p>

          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of a $100,000 certificate of deposit (CD) versus a high-yield savings account for savers looking to protect and grow their money without stock market volatility. While CD rates are fixed and predictable throughout their term, high-yield savings account rates are variable and can change, especially with future rate cuts. The article provides examples showing that, depending on the term length (e.g., 3, 6, 9 months, or 1 year), either a CD or a high-yield savings account could earn slightly more interest. It emphasizes that CD earnings are guaranteed, offering stability, whereas high-yield savings accounts offer flexibility. Savers are advised to carefully calculate potential earnings and consider their liquidity needs. (not investment advice)</p>

The property was once owned by Friedrich Kadgien, a senior Nazi official who fled to South America after WWII. The artwork, listed on a database of lost wartime art, was identified when Kadgien's daughter put the house up for sale. Lawyers for Goudstikker's estate are now working to reclaim the painting, which is one of over 1,100 works forcibly sold from his collection.

The ruling comes amidst a nationwide wave of mid-decade redistricting battles, spurred by President Trump's push for Republican gains in states like Texas and Indiana, and Democratic counter-efforts in California.

          <p>Despite the S&P 500 index's strong performance in 2025, experts advise investors to consider diversification due to the market's narrowness. Morgan Stanley's Lisa Shalett notes that the "Magnificent Seven" technology stocks accounted for a disproportionate 26% of earnings growth, while the remaining 493 companies saw only 3% profit growth. This high concentration, with the top 10 holdings representing approximately 40% of the index, means S&P 500 investment is largely a bet on tech and AI. Experts suggest diversifying into smaller stocks, international and emerging markets, or equal-weight S&P 500 indices to mitigate risks and capture broader growth opportunities beyond the dominant tech sector.
