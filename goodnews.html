          <p>The Pittsburgh Steelers and Minnesota Vikings are set to make history by playing the NFL's first-ever regular-season game in Dublin, Ireland. This marks a significant step in the league's international expansion efforts, with the game broadcast on NFL Network. Both teams enter with 2-1 records, and the Vikings will play a second consecutive game across the pond in London next week. Aaron Rodgers, in his first season with the Steelers, will face a familiar opponent from his Green Bay Packers days, while Carson Wentz starts for the Vikings due to an injury to J.J. McCarthy.</p>

          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% stake in the Chicago Bears, valuing the team at a record $8.9 billion, a significant increase from its $6.4 billion valuation last year. This internal transaction, involving the McCaskey and Ryan families, reflects the soaring value of NFL franchises. The Bears are also exploring building a new domed stadium in Arlington Heights, which could further boost revenue from non-NFL events. This deal underscores the robust financial health and growing valuations within the National Football League. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Canada's Supreme Court has temporarily halted the planned culling of nearly 400 ostriches at Universal Ostrich Farms in British Columbia, which was ordered due to an avian flu outbreak. This decision provides a reprieve for the birds while the owners appeal the Canadian Food Inspection Agency's (CFIA) order. The case has garnered international attention, with high-profile figures like US Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy intervening. The CFIA argues the cull is necessary to prevent virus mutation and human health risks, but the farm owners have vehemently opposed it.</p>

          <p>Lithium Americas stock surged 95% after reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the Canadian mining company. This move is part of renegotiating a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a crucial project for North American lithium supply. The administration aims to secure a "small stake" to create a cash buffer and reduce taxpayer risk, reflecting a broader strategy to gain direct ownership in critical mineral supply chains. This potential investment highlights the strategic importance of lithium for electric vehicle batteries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A dramatic police pursuit across multiple counties ended in Buena Park, California, when an armored BearCat vehicle rammed a suspected stolen big rig to stop it. The chase involved several tense moments, including the big rig's passenger interacting with pedestrians and picking up an item from an SUV. The use of an armored vehicle is unusual for pursuits, highlighting the unique challenges posed by a large truck. Ultimately, two men exited the vehicle at gunpoint and surrendered, bringing the dangerous incident to a close without reported serious injuries.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's "One Battle After Another" is an invigorating political thriller, loosely adapting Thomas Pynchon's "Vineland" with a fun and fizzy approach to ongoing struggles for liberation. The film centers on a fictional revolutionary group, the French 75, led by Teyana Taylor's powerful Perfidia Beverly Hills, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing her "pathetic" lover, Bob. Anderson reorients the story around race and modern societal tensions, while delving into themes of political corruption and the relentless nature of the fight against oppression. The review praises the film's unique sensibility, performances, and its refusal to offer easy answers.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their equity are weighing $100,000 home equity loans against HELOCs, especially as the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates. While both options are now cheaper than personal loans or credit cards, a HELOC currently offers slightly lower monthly payments due to its variable rate, which could further decrease with future Fed cuts. However, home equity loans provide predictable fixed rates, offering stability in an evolving economic climate.

European captain Luke Donald's team is engaging in a charm offensive, signing autographs and showing respect to the locals, hoping to temper the vitriol. However, American players and fans alike expect "absolute chaos" and "hardcore USA" chants once the tournament officially begins, with President Trump's expected appearance potentially amplifying the fervor.</p>
