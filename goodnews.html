          <h2>Android Phones Form Global Earthquake Early Warning Network</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 21:15:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has effectively transformed billions of Android phones into the world's largest earthquake detection network by utilizing their built-in accelerometers. These sensors can detect the initial, subtle P-waves of an earthquake, allowing the system to send alerts to users seconds before the more destructive S-waves arrive. This technology, which has detected over 11,000 earthquakes since 2021, provides a crucial window of time for people to seek safety. While this feature is integrated into Android's "Safety & emergency" settings, iPhone users can access similar alerts through third-party apps like MyShake.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 21:01:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) has agreed to a nearly $6.5 million settlement in a lawsuit filed by Jewish students and a professor. The lawsuit alleged that the university permitted an antisemitic and hostile environment during pro-Palestinian campus protests, where Jewish students were allegedly blocked from parts of the campus and threatened. As part of the settlement, which followed a Department of Justice finding that UCLA violated civil rights laws, the university will fund Jewish community groups and antisemitism-fighting initiatives. UCLA acknowledged it had "fallen short" and committed to fostering a safer and more inclusive campus environment for all students.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 20:37:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>High-level officials from the United States and China have agreed to continue working towards extending a 90-day tariff truce following two days of negotiations in Stockholm. While both sides described the talks as "constructive," U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that any final agreement to prevent tariffs from escalating again would require President Donald Trump's approval. The negotiations aim to avert a return to the tit-for-tat tariffs that disrupted global trade earlier in the year. Discussions also covered broader economic issues, including China's dealings with Russia and Iran and U.S. concerns over critical mineral exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Sexual Assault Charity to Launch Separate Service for Biological Women After Transgender Inclusion Dispute</h2>

          <p>A sexual assault crisis charity in Brighton, UK, will introduce a new support group exclusively for biological women, following a legal challenge and public debate over its trans-inclusive policies. The Survivors' Network faced a lawsuit from a woman who felt uncomfortable in a support session attended by a trans woman. In an agreement reached before the case went to trial, the charity will now run the new service alongside its existing groups, which remain open to trans and non-binary individuals. The move acknowledges that some survivors require a single-sex space based on biology for their healing, with the new pilot program funded by the local Police and Crime Commissioner's office.</p>

          <h2>Phoenix Fire Department Adopts Low-Tech Ice Immersion Method to Combat Deadly Heatstroke</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to rising heat-related fatalities, the Phoenix Fire Department is successfully using a simple yet highly effective method to treat heatstroke victims: cold water immersion. The protocol involves placing a person with a dangerously high core temperature into a large bag filled with ice and water to rapidly cool them down during transport to the hospital. This technique, originally developed by the military, cools patients three to five times faster than traditional methods, critically reducing the risk of brain damage and organ failure. The program's success in Phoenix, which saw a drop in heat-related deaths last year, is setting a national example for other cities facing intensified heatwaves.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators has introduced a resolution to support the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) amid reports that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. may disband it. The resolution emphasizes the crucial, evidence-based work of the independent panel, whose recommendations guide free preventive care coverage for millions of Americans under the Affordable Care Act. Senators expressed concern that disrupting the task force could undermine public health and lead to recommendations not based on science. The move is intended to publicly pressure the administration to preserve the panel, which provides essential guidance on screenings for cancer, heart disease, and other conditions.</p>

          <p>For the first time in five years, the Los Angeles Zoo is now home to Tasmanian devils, welcoming two males named Danny Zuko and Crush. The animals arrived from a conservation organization in Australia and are now on view at the Animals of Australia exhibit. Tasmanian devils, indigenous only to the island of Tasmania, are the world's largest carnivorous marsupials and are known for their powerful bite. The species is currently classified as endangered due to threats from a contagious cancer called Devil Facial Tumor Disease, as well as conflicts with humans and other predators, making their presence at the zoo important for conservation awareness.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has been inundated with thousands of ideas from the public for its first major banknote redesign in 50 years. The central bank is considering moving away from featuring historical figures to new themes like nature, innovation, or key historical events. Suggestions have included everything from the Angel of the North sculpture to dolphins and the famous Sycamore Gap tree. The high level of engagement, particularly from young people who increasingly use cashless payments, demonstrates the cultural significance of banknotes as a symbol of national identity and celebration. The bank is reviewing the feedback before making a final decision on the new designs.</p>

          <p>The UK government has pledged to build up to 40,000 new homes over the next decade on disused railway land as part of its "brownfield first" development strategy. The £1 billion plan aims to transform former goods yards and industrial sites into vibrant communities, with initial projects slated for Manchester, Newcastle, and Cambridge. A new development company, Platform4, will be created to streamline the process. However, critics note that the target is a small fraction of the government's overall housing promise and that the construction industry already faces significant hurdles, including planning delays and regulatory backlogs that are holding up tens of thousands of homes.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests American Public Is Increasingly Skeptical of Tax Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 18:59:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling indicates a potential shift in American political attitudes, as a majority of the public now opposes the latest Republican tax cut legislation. This contrasts with decades of political orthodoxy where tax cuts were considered a reliable political winner. This article suggests several factors for this change, including a lower overall tax burden compared to the past, rising income inequality, and a growing public awareness that tax cuts do not pay for themselves and contribute to the national debt. While voters may be souring on cuts, particularly those benefiting the wealthy, it does not mean they are ready to embrace broad tax increases, posing a future challenge for fiscal policy.

          <p>The city of New Orleans has introduced the Crescent City ID program, a municipal identification card designed to promote inclusion and provide proof of identity for all residents. The program is particularly aimed at assisting vulnerable communities, including undocumented migrants, the homeless, and LGBTQ+ individuals, who may face barriers to obtaining traditional state-issued IDs. The initiative, championed by immigrant rights groups, is seen as a supportive measure for the city's migrant population amid the Trump administration's nationwide crackdown on "sanctuary" policies. To protect applicants, the city plans to store minimal personal information, addressing fears of data being subpoenaed by federal authorities.</p>
