        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article highlights 16 intriguing abandoned locations worldwide that have been repurposed into popular tourist attractions, offering a unique glimpse into history and decay. From the Maunsell Sea Forts in England, built for WWII defense, to the SS Ayrfield shipwreck in Australia, now a floating mangrove forest, these sites captivate visitors. Other examples include Italy's Poveglia island, a former quarantine station turned mental hospital known for paranormal activity, and the relocated Rubjerg Knude Lighthouse in Denmark. The list also features the diamond ghost town of Kolmanskop in Namibia and China's replica "Paris of the East," Tianducheng, showcasing how forgotten spaces can blend eerie fascination with historical significance.</p>

          <p>Barbara Rae-Venter, a retired patent attorney, has pioneered the use of investigative genetic genealogy to solve long-standing cold cases, including the infamous Golden State Killer. Her method involves building family trees from crime scene DNA to identify perpetrators and missing persons, a technique she initially used to help adoptees find biological parents. This article highlights her success in identifying Joseph James DeAngelo, responsible for at least 13 murders and more than 50 sexual assaults, and later Dennis Gribble, a sexual assault perpetrator, leading to convictions decades after the crimes. While raising privacy concerns, the approach has proven highly effective in bringing justice to victims and their families.</p>

          <h2>Secret Service Enhances Security Measures Following Trump Assassination Attempt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:44:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>One year after the attempted assassination of President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has significantly upgraded its security protocols. The agency now deploys military-grade drones for enhanced aerial reconnaissance and has established mobile command posts to improve direct communication with local law enforcement, addressing critical failures from the previous incident. These substantive advancements aim to prevent a repeat of the July 13, 2024, event where a gunman wounded Trump and tragically killed a rallygoer. Six Secret Service personnel were suspended following an internal investigation, underscoring the agency's commitment to implementing comprehensive reforms for future protection.</p>

          <h2>UK Transport Secretary Pledges to Make Electric Cars More Affordable</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 10:20:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has pledged that the government will make electric cars cheaper for consumers, though she refrained from confirming direct grants. She highlighted a £25 million package for "cross-pavement gullies" to aid charging for homes without driveways, alongside £63 million for broader charging infrastructure. This initiative aims to boost EV sales, which currently lag behind mandated targets, addressing key consumer concerns over high upfront costs and "range anxiety." The government seeks to accelerate the transition to electric vehicles ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, demonstrating a commitment to environmental and automotive policy.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a political economist and Beijing policy adviser, asserts that Chinese think tanks must adopt an "indigenous knowledge system" and be "self-centred" to effectively explain China's practices and predict its future. He argues that unlike academic research often rooted in Western textbooks, think tanks should focus on empirical research of public policies within Chinese practice. This approach, he believes, is crucial for truly projecting China's soft power globally and contributing to carbon neutrality and other national goals.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples outlines five often-neglected weekday habits that foster stronger relationships, even amidst busy schedules. These include establishing a "mini morning routine" for brief connection, sending thoughtful check-ins during the day, and prioritizing individual "me time" to de-stress before reconnecting with one's partner. Additionally, happy couples intentionally carve out daily "us time" free from distractions and conclude their day with a quiet emotional check-in to prevent issues from festering. These small, intentional rituals are presented as powerful tools to maintain intimacy and prevent minor issues from escalating, contributing to overall relationship satisfaction and stability.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have achieved a breakthrough by developing a method to convert methanol, derived from industrial waste or hydrogenated carbon dioxide, into white sugar using enzymes. This biotransformation system, detailed in Science Bulletin, offers a sustainable way to produce sucrose without relying on traditional sugar crops that demand extensive land and water resources. The team also adapted the method to create other complex carbohydrates like fructose and starch. This innovation presents a promising strategy to address environmental and population-related challenges, contributing significantly to carbon neutrality by transforming CO2 into food and other valuable chemicals.</p>

While IUDs are a popular and effective birth control method, many patients report significant pain during insertion, a concern often dismissed by medical professionals. However, new recommendations from the CDC and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now urge doctors to discuss pain management options, including topical creams and anesthetic shots, with patients beforehand. This shift signifies a crucial step towards validating and alleviating patient discomfort during gynecological procedures, promoting improved patient care and trust.</p>
