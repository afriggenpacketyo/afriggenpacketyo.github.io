The 37-year-old star shared the news on Instagram, noting that she has been undergoing tests recently and expressed optimism by focusing on the 'early' stage of the diagnosis. She humorously mentioned that she views the surgery as a dramatic way to get a boob job and plans to return with new music after a brief absence.

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in the city, led to the closure of a significant portion of the city center, including hotels, care homes, and bridges. Cologne was a major target during WWII, experiencing numerous bombing raids, including the British Royal Air Force's first "thousand-bomber raid" in 1942. The bombs, two 200-pound and one 100-pound, were discovered in the Deutz district, prompting the large-scale evacuation to ensure public safety.</p>

Muncy's recent offensive surge has compensated for his defensive struggles, making him a key contributor to the team's success. Freddie Freeman ultimately secured the win with a walk-off double in the tenth inning, capitalizing on a defensive misplay by the Mets.</p>
