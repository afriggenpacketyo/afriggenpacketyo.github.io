          <p>The pilot of a SkyWest flight performed an 'aggressive maneuver' to avoid a collision with a B-52 military aircraft while on approach to Minot, North Dakota. The pilot later explained to passengers that the military plane was on a converging course and that air traffic control, which operates visually without radar at that airport, had not provided a warning. The Air Force confirmed its B-52 was in the area for a pre-approved flyover and stated the tower did not advise its crew of the inbound commercial flight. The FAA is now investigating the incident, which resulted in a safe landing but was a startling experience for all aboard.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Encourage Global Economic Liberalization</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article argues that while President Trump's universal tariffs are widely criticized, they may have a positive side effect by exposing and prompting the removal of self-defeating internal trade barriers in other countries. Nations and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union have long-standing domestic regulations that hinder their own economic potential. The pressure from U.S. tariffs has reportedly spurred significant movements to dismantle these internal barriers, particularly in Canada and China. This could lead to greater economic freedom and efficiency, representing an unforeseen silver lining to the contentious trade policies.</p>

          <p>Universal Music Group (UMG), the world's largest music company and home to artists like Taylor Swift and Drake, has filed for a secondary listing on a U.S. stock exchange. The company, which is already publicly traded in the Netherlands with a valuation of nearly €50 billion, submitted a confidential filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The move comes as U.S. stock markets are reaching record highs and follows encouragement from major investors like Bill Ackman, who believe a U.S. listing will enhance the company's value and trading liquidity. UMG represents a vast catalog of iconic artists and major record labels.</p>

          <p>Texas officials have successfully accounted for most of the more than 160 people who were initially reported missing after devastating floods along the Guadalupe River. The top executive in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, stated that only three individuals remain unaccounted for. The majority of those reported missing were tourists who had left the area and returned home without checking in. The flash floods killed at least 135 people, with most fatalities occurring in Kerr County, where the river rose dramatically and washed away buildings. This sharp revision in the number of missing persons is a common pattern following large-scale disasters.</p>

          <p>Musician Billy Joel has provided an update on his health two months after announcing his diagnosis with Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH), a rare brain condition. Speaking on a podcast, the 76-year-old singer said he feels 'good' but is still working on his balance as he undergoes physical therapy. The condition, which involves a build-up of fluid in the brain, forced him to cancel a series of concerts earlier this year. Despite the concerning diagnosis, Joel and his family have expressed hope for a swift recovery as he prioritizes his health and follows medical advice.</p>

While acknowledging their potential for gains, Cramer advised investors to exercise discipline and take profits when they occur. He believes these names are likely to continue their rally until a wave of new IPOs increases market supply. (not investment advice)</p>
