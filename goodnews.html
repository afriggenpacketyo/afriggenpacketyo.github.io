          <p>Influential financial advisor Ric Edelman is now recommending that investors allocate between 10% and 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a dramatic increase from his previous advice. He attributes this change to crypto's evolution into a mainstream asset and the declining efficacy of the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond portfolio model. Edelman argues that cryptocurrencies provide a unique opportunity for higher, non-correlated returns essential for modern long-term investment strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

This analysis posits that Trump views military force not as a method for regime change, but as a powerful tool to create leverage for negotiations. His quick pivot from aggressive action to de-escalation suggests a continued reluctance to become entangled in prolonged foreign conflicts.</p>
