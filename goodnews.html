          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against an Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick of tries in a dominant team performance that saw eight tries in total. The game also saw the return of Owen Farrell as a substitute, though the team faced injury concerns for Luke Cowan Dickie and Garry Ringrose. The decisive win provides the Lions with significant momentum heading into the crucial Test week.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering authorizing a new round of funding for Ukraine, which would be the first such approval during his new term. This potential policy shift comes as Russia intensifies its aerial attacks on Ukrainian cities and could signal a message to Moscow. While Trump has previously criticized the level of U.S. spending, he has recently expressed frustration with Russia's actions. The administration is also continuing to press European NATO allies to increase their share of financial and military support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>After complaining of chest pains, a 13-year-old boy named Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, an extremely rare and life-threatening genetic condition that causes severe heart failure. Doctors discovered his heart was functioning at just 7%, and he soon required a pacemaker, defibrillator, and ultimately a heart transplant, a journey his mother had also experienced. Now recovering, Micah and his mother have founded Transplant Teenz, a nonprofit virtual community to provide the support for other teenagers awaiting organ transplants that he felt was missing.</p>

          <p>This article makes a strong case for allowing children to engage in more free, unstructured, and even risky physical play. It argues that modern parenting trends, driven by safety concerns and societal pressures for quiet behavior, are depriving children of essential developmental experiences. The author posits that such 'wild' play is crucial for building robust physical health, superior cognitive skills, and mental well-being. By avoiding over-restriction, parents can help their children develop better movement quality, which can prevent injuries and foster long-term health.</p>

          <p>In an interview, author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the societal pressure on women to maintain a certain appearance creates a significant, recurring financial drain she calls the "hot girl hamster wheel." She explains that spending on aesthetic services like hair color and acrylic nails functions as a depreciating asset, requiring continuous investment just to maintain the look. Tassin advocates for a "hot girl detox," urging women to critically assess these expenses and redirect the saved money, time, and energy toward wealth-building goals like investing.</p>
