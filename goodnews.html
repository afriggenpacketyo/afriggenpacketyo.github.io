          <h2>German Intelligence Classifies AfD as Extreme-Right</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:40:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany's domestic intelligence agency has officially classified the Alternative f√ºr Deutschland (AfD) party as right-wing extremist, a move likely to be challenged in courts. The agency stated that the AfD's views on ethnicity and ancestry are incompatible with Germany's democratic order, specifically citing the party's stance on citizens with a "migration background from predominantly Muslim countries." This classification allows for increased monitoring of the party through informants and surveillance, though a formal ban would require action from parliament, the government, or the constitutional court. The deputy leader of the Social Democrat SPD supports a ban on the AfD, emphasizing the importance of upholding Germany's post-war constitution.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, although they decreased compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by fears of tariffs impacting global demand. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the negative impact of lower oil prices. The company's global production business saw a profit increase of approximately 19% year-over-year, primarily attributed to growth in the Permian and Guyana regions, as well as cost savings. Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases during the quarter.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 07:32:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As debates intensify over President Trump's policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could benefit higher earners. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 imposed a $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, which is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. Lawmakers from high-tax states are pushing for raising or repealing the SALT cap, and Trump has expressed support for SALT relief. Any changes to the SALT deduction will likely be part of a broader tax package, with negotiations influenced by budget constraints and competing priorities.</p>

          <p>Early results from local elections in England show Reform UK gaining a seat from Labour in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election after a recount. Andrea Jenkyns of Reform UK became the first mayor of Greater Lincolnshire, winning with over 40% of the vote. Labour retained three existing mayoralties, with Reform coming second in all of them, albeit with reduced majorities in Doncaster and North Tyneside. These local elections function as a referendum on the governing party, with Reform's gains indicating a potential shift in the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has dropped its plans to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to align the legislation with a recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman.

The decision comes after an expert group recommended separate legislation to address abuse and violence against women. The government has also shelved plans for a new law banning conversion therapy, hoping for a UK-wide solution instead.</p>

          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined TikTok 530 million euros for violating GDPR by sending European user data to China. The DPC found that TikTok failed to ensure an equivalent level of data protection for EEA users' personal data accessed by staff in China. TikTok has been ordered to bring its data processing into compliance within six months, with potential suspension of transfers to China if compliance isn't achieved.</p>
