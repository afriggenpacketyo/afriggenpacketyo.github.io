          <p>A Chinese national, Haoxiang Gao, who was charged with illegal voting at the University of Michigan in October 2024, has fled the United States, according to the FBI. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus, and was subsequently charged with unauthorized elector attempting to vote and making a false affidavit. Despite a judge ordering him to surrender his passport and remain in Michigan, Gao boarded a flight to Shanghai using a different passport. The case highlights rare instances of non-citizens voting in federal elections, with analysis indicating only 30 suspected cases out of 23.5 million votes cast in reviewed jurisdictions. Optimism regarding the integrity of the American voting process remains moderate in light of this incident.</p>

          <p>According to Steve Stoute, a marketing executive trusted by figures like Jay-Z and Lorraine Twohill from Google, conflict and disagreement are essential for a business's success.

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from gun rights advocates, effectively allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in place. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, expressing a desire to address the issue nationwide, while Justice Kavanaugh indicated the Court is likely to weigh in on the legality of AR-15s in the near future. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons, particularly restrictions on gun kits.
