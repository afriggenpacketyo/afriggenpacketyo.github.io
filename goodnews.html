          <p>Shares for Canadian minerals explorer Trilogy Metals experienced a dramatic surge of over 200% in premarket trading following a White House announcement. The U.S. government is investing $35.6 million in the company, securing a 10% stake as part of a strategic initiative. This partnership aims to develop domestic supplies of copper and other critical minerals located in Alaska's Ambler mining district, signaling a significant push for resource independence.

          <p>The Metropolitan Police have successfully dismantled a major international criminal network suspected of smuggling up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones from the UK to China over the past year. The investigation, which began after a single victim tracked their stolen iPhone to a warehouse, led to 18 arrests and the recovery of over 2,000 devices. Authorities believe this gang was responsible for exporting a significant portion of all phones stolen in London, where phone theft has nearly tripled in the last four years.</p>

          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index hit a record high for the second consecutive day, buoyed by a technology stock rally on Wall Street. The surge was largely attributed to AMD's stock skyrocketing after announcing a major deal with OpenAI, which is seen as a significant challenge to chip industry leader Nvidia. Despite the Nikkei's early gains, it closed flat, while Japanese Government Bond yields rose to their highest levels in over a decade, reflecting a complex and volatile market environment.

          <p>China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province, a project designed to leverage seawater for natural and efficient cooling. The facility consists of 1,300-tonne data cabins submerged 35 meters deep, which significantly reduces the energy consumption and operational costs associated with traditional land-based centers. This initiative is part of Hainan's broader strategy to develop a "blue economy" by integrating advanced technology with marine resources, with plans to expand to 100 data cabins.</p>

          <h2>Exhibition Merges Ancient Chinese Maritime Artifacts with Western Impressionist Art</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 03:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A unique art exhibition is creating a dialogue between artifacts recovered from a Tang dynasty shipwreck and Western art, particularly the works of Impressionist painter Claude Monet. The curator was inspired by a Monet painting of merchant ships, seeing a parallel between the global journey of goods and the borderless nature of art. This convergence aims to illustrate how both maritime culture and artistic expression serve as vessels that travel across diverse places, sharing their stories and inspiring people through a continuous cycle of exchange.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has raised its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, up from a previous prediction of 4%, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. This revision comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and is part of a broader upgrade for the East Asia and Pacific region. The bank notes that China's economy has been buoyed by government stimulus and strong export growth, though it expects this momentum to slow, projecting a reduced growth rate of 4.2% for 2026.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has seen its UK sales skyrocket by 880% in September compared to the previous year, making Britain its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 cars, with its plug-in hybrid Seal U SUV being the most popular model, contributing to a record month for EV sales in the UK overall. BYD's success is partly attributed to the UK not imposing the high tariffs on Chinese EVs that have been implemented by the EU and the US.</p>

The rally featured aggressive baserunning and key two-out hits from Will Smith and Shohei Ohtani, turning a 1-0 deficit into a 4-1 lead that they would narrowly hold onto for the win.</p>

          <p>The Minnesota-born Mexican restaurant chain Chi-Chi's has made its return, opening a new location in St. Louis Park nearly two decades after the last U.S. restaurant closed. The original chain, founded in 1975, grew to over 200 locations before facing bankruptcy and a damaging hepatitis A outbreak in 2004. The revival, made possible through an agreement with Hormel Foods, which owns the trademark, was met with enthusiasm, as reservations for the opening day were completely booked by eager and nostalgic customers.</p>
