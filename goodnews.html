          <p>A federal judge is expected to rule on Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with Apple facing a significant financial hit. While Google risks losing search traffic, some analysts believe unwinding these costly deals could free up resources to fuel its artificial intelligence growth. The Justice Department is also pushing for restrictions on exclusive AI distribution deals and data-sharing mandates, aiming to foster greater competition in the evolving search landscape. This pivotal decision could reshape the internet's future, shifting dynamics from traditional contracts to generative AI innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A CBS News analysis of Washington, D.C. crime data reveals a nearly 50% decrease in violent crime during the three weeks following President Trump's deployment of federal troops and law enforcement. The analysis indicates that federal agents were primarily deployed in areas with higher crime rates, contradicting some reports. While the White House touts over 1,000 arrests and firearm seizures, local leaders like Mayor Muriel Bowser have questioned the necessity of the increased National Guard presence. The study highlights the complex factors influencing crime trends and the differing perspectives on the effectiveness and impact of the federal intervention.</p>

          <p>Shares of luxury winter-clothing maker Canada Goose rose nearly 15% following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received offers to take the company private. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly made verbal bids, valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion. Bain Capital is awaiting further offers, with due diligence expected to be swift once a buyer is selected. This development could represent a significant return for Bain Capital, which took control in 2013, despite the company's current valuation being well below its 2018 peak. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store shares rose significantly after the company announced it would scrap its controversial new logo and reinstate its original branding. The decision followed widespread criticism from social media users and a direct call from President Donald Trump to revert to the classic design. The proposed redesign, which removed the iconic 'Uncle Herschel' character, was widely panned as 'generic' and 'soulless' by consumers, particularly conservatives. The company stated it listened to guest feedback, affirming its commitment to its core values and country hospitality.</p>

The company narrowly surpassed Wall Street's revenue expectations and raised its full-year sales outlook, despite anticipating higher tariff costs. Abercrombie is actively diversifying into new categories and forging partnerships, such as with the NFL, to sustain growth amidst a competitive retail environment and shifting consumer spending habits.

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that the Department of Transportation (DOT) will reclaim full management of Washington D.C.'s Union Station, aiming to enhance safety and beauty while reducing costs. Although the DOT has owned the transit hub since the 1980s, its control has been diminished by various leases and agreements. This move is part of the Trump administration's broader anti-crime crackdown in Washington, which has seen a significant federal presence, including National Guard deployments at the station. The DOT plans to renegotiate agreements and reinvest station income into capital improvements like security and lighting, with renewed control expected in September.</p>

          <p>Democrats are celebrating a significant victory in an Iowa State Senate special election, where Democrat Catelin Drey won in a district previously carried by President Donald Trump by 11 points. This win breaks the Republican supermajority in the chamber, which has practical implications, as Republicans can no longer confirm the governor's appointees without Democratic support. While Republicans attribute the outcome to low turnout and national Democratic funding, the results suggest increased Democratic voter engagement heading into next year's elections. This marks the second time this year Democrats have flipped an Iowa State Senate seat in a GOP-leaning area.</p>
