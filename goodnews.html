          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials for broader use. This decision means that many healthy Americans may not have access to updated shots this fall. The FDA's new leadership, under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., aims to balance rapid access for vulnerable populations with the need for more evidence for those at average risk. This approach aligns with other developed countries that limit boosters to older adults and those with underlying conditions. </p>

While Walmart affirmed its commitment to low prices, the company cited the magnitude of tariff increases as beyond any retailer's ability to absorb. Other companies like Microsoft and Subaru have also cautioned about tariff-related price hikes. </p>
