          <p>Amazon reported strong first-quarter results but issued lighter-than-expected guidance for the second quarter, attributing the cautious outlook to uncertainty surrounding tariffs, trade policies, and potential recessionary fears. CEO Andy Jassy acknowledged the difficulty in predicting the impact of President Trump's tariffs due to their fluctuating nature. Despite the challenges, Jassy expressed optimism that Amazon could emerge stronger, leveraging its broad selection, low prices, and speedy delivery, similar to its performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Amazon's advertising revenue was a bright spot, growing 19% year over year, while AWS revenue grew 17%, slightly below expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported mixed first-quarter results, with revenue growth slowing amid concerns over President Trump's tariffs, causing share prices to decline in after-hours trading. The company's North American retail business experienced slower growth, and Amazon included "tariff and trade policies" among factors that could make forecasts uncertain. While overall sales grew 9 percent, reaching $155.7 billion, and profit increased by 64 percent to $17.1 billion, the company's outlook for the current quarter anticipates lower operating profits due to the impact of tariffs on consumer behavior and supply chains. The company spent over $24 billion on capital expenses in the first three months of the year, about $2 billion less than the previous quarter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Marvel's "Thunderbolts*" describes it as a jokey and moody film that caters to dedicated fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The article notes the movie elevates supporting characters like Yelena (Florence Pugh) and Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) into a team of misfits tasked with stopping a corrupt CIA director. While the film embraces a punk-rock snark and features violence, it's ultimately shielded by a sense of unseriousness. Pugh's performance as Yelena is highlighted as a standout, and the movie explores themes of trust and trauma through a lens inspired by after-school PSAs rather than comic books.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Chamber of Commerce has requested the Trump administration to provide an "automatic exclusion" from new tariffs for U.S. small businesses that import goods from abroad, arguing that these businesses lack the capital to absorb increased costs. In a letter to the Treasury Secretary, the Chamber warned that tariffs could cause "irreparable harm" to small businesses and potentially trigger a recession. The Trump administration's tariff policies have already raised economists' concerns about a potential economic downturn, with small businesses potentially forced to pass costs to consumers or face financial ruin. The letter also cites a TD Bank survey, noting that 43% of small business owners said their companies would not survive if they fell short on revenue for three to four months.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will ask the CDC to develop new guidance for treating measles with drugs and vitamins, despite his recent remarks promoting unproven remedies. Kennedy has faced criticism for downplaying the severity of measles and inflating myths about vaccines, which remain the only proven method of prevention. The CDC has stepped up its warning against overuse of vitamin A, which does not cure measles infections but can be useful for reducing the risk of severe illness, as high levels of vitamin A can be toxic. Experts have cautioned against using budesonide and clarithromycin for measles, as they are not antivirals and decisions to use these drugs were best left up to doctors managing measles hospitalizations on an individual basis.</p>

This expansion is part of the Trump administration's effort to militarize the boundary with Mexico to help stem the flow of migrants, even as crossings have dropped. The Pentagon has deployed nearly 8,000 active-duty troops, spy planes, and Navy warships to the border in compliance with President Trump's order to increase the military's role.</p>

          <p>President Trump has removed Mike Waltz from his position as national security advisor and nominated him as ambassador to the United Nations, with Secretary of State Marco Rubio serving as interim national security advisor. The move follows criticism of Waltz for mistakenly adding a journalist to a Signal chat where sensitive military plans were discussed. Sources indicate that Trump respects Waltz but was concerned about the Signal situation and vetting of National Security Council staff. The UN ambassador position requires Senate approval, and Waltz may face difficult questions during confirmation hearings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is seeking the Supreme Court's intervention to strip temporary protected status (TPS) from over 300,000 Venezuelan migrants in the US, potentially leading to their deportation. The Justice Department is requesting the Supreme Court to put on hold a federal judge's order that halted the decision by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to terminate TPS for Venezuelans. A federal appeals court previously declined the administration's request to pause the judge's order, which stated that the secretary's action would inflict irreparable harm and was potentially motivated by unconstitutional animus. The Trump administration has been carrying out crackdowns on legal and illegal immigration, with many Venezuelans unlawfully arrested and illegally detained.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to allow the removal of protections for hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan immigrants under the Temporary Protected Status program. This request follows a federal judge's block on the administration's plan to remove the protections, arguing that the move violated administrative procedures and was influenced by racial bias. The administration argues that the law creating the program specifically bars judicial review of executive branch decisions. The Supreme Court has been involved in several emergency applications related to Trump's immigration policies, including cases involving wrongful deportations and the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>Block reported first-quarter results that missed Wall Street expectations and issued a disappointing outlook, leading to a significant drop in the company's stock price. Revenue decreased by approximately 3% from the previous year, and gross profit also fell short of analysts' forecasts. The company provided weaker-than-expected profit guidance for the second quarter and full year, citing challenging economic conditions and President Trump's sweeping tariffs on imported goods. While Block delivered its most profitable quarter ever, the company is adopting a more cautious stance on the macro outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York lawmakers are considering a measure that would dramatically weaken their oversight over religious schools, potentially a major victory for the state’s Hasidic Jewish community. The proposal, which could become part of a state budget deal, has raised concern among education experts, including the state education commissioner, Betty Rosa, who said such changes amount to a “travesty” for children who attend religious schools that do not offer a basic secular education. The potential deal is the result of years of lobbying by Hasidic leaders and their political representatives.</p>
