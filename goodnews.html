        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The latest Consumer Price Index report revealed that U.S. inflation rose at a 3.0% annual rate in September, a figure slightly below economists' expectations. This moderation in price increases was largely influenced by a 4.1% jump in gasoline prices, while core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, also showed a cooling trend. The data is a key factor for the Federal Reserve's upcoming interest rate decision, with markets now anticipating a rate cut to support a softening labor market. The report's release was prioritized despite the government shutdown for its role in calculating Social Security adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase benefits for approximately 75 million recipients. This adjustment translates to an average monthly increase of about $56 for Social Security retirement beneficiaries, starting in January. The COLA is designed to help benefits keep pace with inflation, ensuring that recipients can manage rising living costs. This year's increase aligns with expert projections and is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment in 2025, falling close to the 20-year average of 2.6%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United forward Anthony Gordon has been a standout performer in the Champions League, scoring in three consecutive games and earning praise from figures like manager Jose Mourinho. However, his domestic form has been a different story, as he has yet to score or register an assist in the Premier League this season despite strong underlying statistics. This article explores the perplexing contrast between his European success and his struggles in the top flight. The 24-year-old's challenge now is to translate his big-game mentality to consistent week-in, week-out performances to help lift Newcastle's domestic goal-scoring tally.</p>

          <h2>Fossil Study Suggests Dinosaurs Were Thriving in North America Before Asteroid Impact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 08:23:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research challenges the theory that dinosaurs were in decline before the mass extinction event 66 million years ago, suggesting they were thriving in North America right up to the asteroid strike. By analyzing fossils from the Kirtland Formation in New Mexico, scientists dated the remains to just 400,000 years before the impact, a brief period in geological time. The diversity of species found, including Tyrannosaurus rex and the colossal Alamosaurus, indicates robust and distinct dinosaur communities. While the findings provide a snapshot of a specific region, they counter the narrative of a gradual decline and paint a picture of an abrupt, catastrophic end for a flourishing ecosystem.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has called off a plan to deploy over 100 federal agents to San Francisco for a large-scale immigration enforcement operation. The decision followed widespread condemnation from California leaders and street protests, including a gathering outside the U.S. Coast Guard base in Alameda where the agents were to be staged. Trump stated on social media that he spoke with San Francisco's mayor, Daniel Lurie, and agreed to give the city a chance to address its issues independently. The move marks a sudden reversal of the administration's plan to expand its immigration crackdown to the Bay Area.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Procter & Gamble reported first-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street estimates, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. The consumer goods giant earned an adjusted $1.99 per share on $22.39 billion in revenue, though overall sales volume remained flat, indicating waning demand in some categories. The company observed a split in consumer behavior, with higher-income shoppers buying in bulk while others stretch their budgets by using products to the last drop. P&G also revised its forecast for tariff-related costs downward, though this could change following President Trump's recent termination of trade talks with Canada. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The portrayal of aliens in popular culture, from the little green men of the 1950s to modern cinematic creations, has consistently mirrored shifting societal fears and preoccupations. This article explores how these extraterrestrial figures have served as metaphors for everything from Cold War paranoia and corporate greed to contemporary issues like migration and the rise of artificial intelligence. Social scientist Christian Peters explains how iconic alien imagery became entrenched through media and alleged eyewitness accounts. As AI becomes more integrated into daily life, it is now being described as a form of 'alien intelligence,' representing a new, non-biological 'other' that evokes both fascination and unease.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay for the L.A. Affairs column, a writer recounts her experience of using dating apps to find a woman to join her and a male friend for a three-way encounter. The search, however, led to an unexpected and more profound outcome: the formation of deep, supportive female friendships. Instead of a casual sexual experience, she connected with three different women—Natalia, Genesis, and Lindsay—who became her confidantes, partners-in-crime, and sources of empowerment. The author reflects that the genuine love and connection she was seeking were ultimately found not in a romantic or sexual arrangement, but within these powerful platonic bonds.</p>

          <p>Liverpool manager Arne Slot has expressed no concern over forward Mohamed Salah's recent dip in form, stating that the Egyptian winger's goal-scoring prowess is the "last thing" he worries about. Despite being the team's top scorer last season, Salah has only scored three league goals this term and was benched for a recent Champions League match. Slot attributed the slow start to several factors, including the integration of new summer signings and the departure of right-back Trent Alexander-Arnold. He remains confident that Salah, who has gone seven Premier League matches without a non-penalty goal, will soon return to his prolific ways.</p>

          <p>First baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr., who recently signed a landmark $500 million contract, has been instrumental in leading the Toronto Blue Jays to their first World Series appearance in over three decades. The Canadian-born slugger, son of Hall of Famer Vladimir Guerrero Sr., has fulfilled a long-held promise to bring a championship back to Canada's only MLB team. His commitment has energized the city and the country, which had previously seen star players leave for more lucrative U.S. markets. The Blue Jays are now set to face the Los Angeles Dodgers in a highly anticipated series, pitting Guerrero Jr. against superstar Shohei Ohtani.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece frames the recent theft of jewels from the Louvre Museum not as a national tragedy, but as a thrilling and almost charmingly audacious caper. The author argues that the non-violent, daylight robbery, executed with mopeds and a ladder, is a gift to the world, reminding people of adventure and ingenuity. The article points out the irony that the stolen items, valued at around $102 million, have gained more fame through the theft than they ever had on display, similar to the Mona Lisa's theft in 1911. By contrasting it with violent robberies, the author suggests this heist was a blithe occurrence where no one was hurt and some out-of-the-box thinkers may have earned a handsome reward.</p>

          <p>The total assets managed by the global hedge fund industry have reached an all-time high of nearly $5 trillion, according to a new analysis by Hedge Fund Research. This historic growth was driven by a combination of strong investment returns and the largest quarterly net inflow of new capital in 18 years during the third quarter. The industry saw its assets swell by $238.4 billion, including $33.7 billion in new allocations from institutional investors. This surge is attributed to rising M&A activity, successful investments in the technology and AI sectors, and growing expectations of lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

This article provides an overview of current national average CD rates, while highlighting that top online banks offer significantly higher rates, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs exceeding 4.25% APY. It explains that short-term CDs currently provide better yields than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. To secure the best rates, savers are advised to explore online banks and consider laddering CDs of different terms. (not investment advice)</p>
