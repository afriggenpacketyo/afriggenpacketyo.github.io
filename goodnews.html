        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is prepared to meet with Iran following the U.S. bombing of three Iranian nuclear sites, urging Iran to pursue diplomacy. Rubio warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be a "suicidal" move for Iran, emphasizing that the U.S. has no current plans for further attacks unless provoked. He clarified that the U.S. mission aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, not to attack the Iranian people or seek regime change. Rubio added that the U.S. is ready to defend its interests and personnel in the region.</p>

          <p>Kenan Yildiz scored two goals, leading Juventus to a 4-1 victory over Wydad in their Club World Cup Group G match in Philadelphia. Juventus took an early lead with an own goal forced by Yildiz, followed by a spectacular strike from Yildiz himself. Wydad managed to reduce the deficit, but Yildiz scored again in the second half, and Du≈°an Vlahoviƒá added a penalty to secure the win. The result eliminates Wydad, while Juventus will qualify for the last 16 if Al Ain fails to beat Manchester City.</p>

          <p>As war spreads between Israel and Iran, the Iranian diaspora in Los Angeles is finding comfort in local Persian restaurants and neighborhoods. Azizam restaurant in Silver Lake is offering complimentary tea and backgammon to provide a safe space for Iranians to relax and connect. While many Iranian Americans fear for their families in Iran, they also hope to bridge the divide between the two countries. The community is finding solace in restaurants like Azizam and neighborhoods like Tehrangeles, which offer a sense of cultural connection and support during these turbulent times.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a crucial breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. India was building a lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a 96-run advantage at the close of play. Brook's innings, marked by outrageous strokes and dropped catches, ended when he top-edged a hook, but he propelled England to virtual parity. The match is finely poised, with India holding a slight advantage heading into the final days.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran and struck three key Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high on Sunday on bets that Washington's entrance into the conflict with Tehran would help it to come to an end, despite the Iranian Foreign Minister's insistence that the country could not return to diplomacy "while under attack." Egypt's benchmark EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing 2.7% higher on Sunday. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Toxic Phrases Parents Should Avoid to Encourage Children to Listen</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 13:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda identifies five toxic phrases that instantly make children refuse to listen. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, Raouda suggests using alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy, validate their emotions, and encourage problem-solving. By shifting to language that fosters respect, emotional safety, and involvement, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels natural and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>
