          <p>Tom Cruise shared fond memories of working with his ex-wife Nicole Kidman on Stanley Kubrick's "Eyes Wide Shut," noting that he suggested Kidman for the role. Cruise called the experience very unique, especially the constant rewriting and reshooting to find the film's tone. The article also touches on Cruise's more recent rumored romance with Ana de Armas, highlighting sightings of the two together in London. Despite speculation, a source indicated they were working on a project with director Doug Liman, and not romantically involved.</p>
