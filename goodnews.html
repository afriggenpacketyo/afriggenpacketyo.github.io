          <p>A DW fact-check meticulously debunked several assertions made by President Trump during his UN General Assembly address, labeling them as inaccurate or misleading. Trump's claims of ending seven wars were found to be false, with many conflicts he cited remaining unresolved or volatile, and his role disputed. The article also corrected his statements on Germany's energy policy, clarifying that Germany completed its nuclear phase-out and increased renewable energy use. Furthermore, his long-standing claim of a $500 million bid for UN headquarters renovation was deemed misleading, as no official record of such a bid exists.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel made an emotional return to his late-night show following a brief suspension, clarifying that he never intended to trivialize the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Through tears, Kimmel criticized what he called "anti-American" threats to free speech, particularly from figures like President Trump and FCC head Brendan Carr, who had called for his suspension. He highlighted the importance of free expression in a democracy, noting that some local ABC affiliates, controlled by Nexstar and Sinclair, still refused to air his broadcast. The article details the controversy surrounding his initial comments and the broader debate on media freedom.</p>

          <p>Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has publicly revealed that she has been the target of "sexist briefings" while campaigning for the Labour Party's deputy leadership, a contest against former Commons Leader Lucy Powell. Phillipson, who was retained in her Cabinet role by Sir Keir Starmer despite rumors, dismissed suggestions of being Downing Street's preferred candidate as ironic given the negativity. She also expressed concern that some individuals within Sir Keir's top team and the wider party feel marginalized, emphasizing the need for greater unity and teamwork. This article sheds light on persistent issues of sexism and internal political dynamics within the UK's political landscape.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg officially announced that Instagram has achieved a remarkable milestone, now reporting three billion monthly active users globally. This significant growth underscores the continued expansion of the photo-sharing application, which Meta acquired for $1 billion in 2012. The last public disclosure of Instagram's user figures in October 2022 showed it had crossed two billion monthly users, demonstrating accelerated growth in the past few years. With this latest achievement, Instagram now stands alongside Facebook and WhatsApp as one of Meta's platforms to exceed the three-billion-user mark, cementing its status as a pervasive and influential force in the digital communication sphere.</p>

          <p>Ford Credit, the financial arm of Ford Motor, is introducing special financing options for consumers with subprime credit scores, specifically those below 620, to stimulate sales of its crucial F-150 pickup truck before the end of the third quarter. This program extends lower interest rates, typically offered to buyers with higher credit ratings, to a riskier segment of the market. While designed to make vehicles more accessible and reduce inventory, such initiatives increase the potential for loan defaults, particularly in an uncertain economic climate. The article highlights that Ford Credit utilizes its own scoring model beyond FICO and addresses broader affordability concerns within the automotive industry, where high interest rates and rising vehicle prices are prevalent.

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel made an emotional return to "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension by ABC, using his monologue to clarify and express regret over comments regarding the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Kimmel stated it was "never my intention to make light of the murder" nor to assign blame to any specific group, acknowledging that his remarks may have been perceived as ill-timed or unclear. The suspension was prompted by criticism from figures like FCC Chair Brendan Carr and some local affiliate stations. Kimmel passionately defended the importance of free speech and condemned attacks on journalists, even as a portion of the country's local channels continued to preempt his broadcast.</p>

          <p>Astronomers, utilizing the James Webb Space Telescope, have detected a mysterious and colossal object in the distant universe that could potentially be a primordial black hole, a discovery poised to fundamentally rewrite existing cosmological theories. Unlike black holes that form from collapsed stars, a primordial black hole would have originated from quantum fluctuations mere moments after the Big Bang, predating the formation of the first stars. The article details how this "naked" object, observed primarily surrounded by hydrogen and helium, challenges the standard model of cosmic evolution. If its primordial nature is confirmed, this finding would necessitate a significant re-evaluation of how the universe evolved, marking a profound advancement in scientific understanding.</p>

Goodell underscored the rapidly evolving media landscape as a primary driver for seeking greater flexibility and an earlier renegotiation window.

Konsa acknowledged the team's failure to execute the high defensive line that Emery has instilled as a core tactical principle. Despite a challenging start to the Premier League season, marked by five winless games and an early Carabao Cup exit, Konsa maintains that the club is not in "crisis," expressing confidence that the team will soon improve their score.
