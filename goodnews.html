          <p>A federal judge has granted final approval to a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow colleges and universities to directly pay athletes, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement permits schools to share up to $20.5 million with athletes annually and allocates $2.7 billion to compensate former players who were previously restricted from earning revenue. The agreement addresses antitrust cases challenging NCAA compensation rules dating back to 2016, with payouts determined by sport and career length, potentially reaching nearly $2 million for some athletes. The settlement also establishes a clearinghouse to ensure fair market value for NIL deals exceeding $600, aiming to prevent pay-for-play arrangements. The optimism score for this article is 75.</p>

          <p>South Korea's newly elected progressive president, Lee Jae-myung, is expected to adopt a more cautious approach to Taiwan and prioritize strengthening economic ties with Beijing. Lee's election follows the impeachment of his predecessor, Yoon Suk-yeol, and signals a potential shift in Seoul's foreign policy. While Yoon emphasized commitment to the US alliance and trilateral cooperation with Washington and Tokyo, Lee is anticipated to be more friendly towards China and North Korea. Despite these potential changes, continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan is also expected. The optimism score for this article is 60.</p>

French President Emmanuel Macron supports this vision, emphasizing the need for Europe to become a more self-sufficient force amid growing tensions between global superpowers.
