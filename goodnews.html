          <p>The Met Gala 2025 will celebrate menswear and Black style, aligning with the Costume Institute's 'Superfine: Tailoring Black Style' exhibition which is inspired by Monica L Miller's book 'Slaves to Fashion: Black Dandyism and the Styling of Black Diasporic Identity.' The event, hosted by Anna Wintour alongside co-chairs Pharrell Williams, Lewis Hamilton, Colman Domingo, A$AP Rocky, and LeBron James, promises to showcase the significant role of Black style in fashion history. Attendees can expect references to Black style's influence on menswear, particularly dandyism, from the 18th century to the present. The gala will take place on May 5th in New York City, with live streams available on Vogue's digital platforms and other news outlets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is prioritizing the appointment of judges who align with his administration's stance on immigration, particularly regarding deportation processes. He emphasized the need for judges who would not require trials for every illegal immigrant, citing the impracticality of conducting millions of trials. Trump views his overhaul of U.S. immigration policies as a key campaign promise, expressing frustration with judges he perceives as delaying these efforts. He claimed that some judges are 'radicalized' and that the Supreme Court will not stand for lengthy trials for criminals who have entered the country illegally, as he believes it would threaten the nation's stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dustin May's struggles with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers fell to the Braves 4-3, ending their seven-game winning streak. May gave up two two-run home runs to Austin Riley off poorly executed sweepers, overshadowing his otherwise effective performance. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Bryce Elder, failing to provide May with sufficient run support, despite a late home run from Miguel Rojas. May has yielded 14 runs in his last three outings, highlighting the importance of consistently landing his sweeper for his success as a pitcher.</p>

          <p>Australian stocks experienced a downturn following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's re-election, marking his second consecutive term in 21 years. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 fell by 0.47%, reversing previous gains, amid global macroeconomic uncertainties. The Australian dollar, however, saw a rise of 0.45% against the US dollar. This is happening while most Asian markets remained closed for holidays. Oil prices also plunged after OPEC+ agreed to raise production for a second consecutive month, while U.S. futures edged down after strong gains on Wall Street the previous week.</p>

          <p>The Trump factor is significantly influencing global politics, particularly in recent elections where right-wing parties aligned with MAGA principles have faced setbacks in Canada and Australia. In both countries, center-left incumbents surged ahead of conservative oppositions, who struggled to distance themselves from Trump's policies. Voters appear to be considering Trump's impact on their own countries when making decisions. This trend suggests that anti-Trump sentiment may be contributing to political outcomes worldwide, though the effect is not uniform, as seen in Germany.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As egg freezing becomes increasingly popular among women seeking to preserve their fertility, some experts caution against viewing it as a guaranteed solution. The procedure is costly, with no guarantees of success, and presents risks to women who become pregnant at older ages. There are concerns about the emphasis on profits in the fertility industry, with critics accusing companies of prioritizing revenue over patient well-being. While egg freezing can be a good option for some, experts advocate for policies that support women in having children at younger ages.</p>
