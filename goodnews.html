          <p>Federal prosecutors in California have moved to dismiss charges against Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester who was accused of assaulting border patrol agents during an anti-ICE demonstration. Mojica, who said he was brutally attacked by law enforcement, was facing eight years in federal prison. US attorney Bill Essayli filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, and charges were also dropped against another protester arrested at the same time. Civil rights advocates scrutinized the prosecutions, arguing that authorities misrepresented events and criminalized free speech. Mojica said he felt a huge relief and that the truth always comes out in the end.</p>

          <p>Pavel Durov, the founder of Telegram, intends to leave his multi-billion-dollar fortune to his more than 100 children, as stated in an interview with Le Point. Durov, who recently drafted his will, wants his children to live normal lives and build themselves up independently. He has six children conceived naturally with three different partners and at least 100 more through sperm donations. Durov also shared details about his rigorous daily workout regimen and his avoidance of alcohol, coffee, tea, sugar, and smoking, as French authorities have charged Durov, alleging Telegram is used for criminal purposes, including the propagation of child sexual abuse material and for drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Diego Luna revealed that before his role in "Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," he was primarily offered roles portraying drug dealers in Hollywood. The Mexican actor noted that Hollywood productions were not "sending messages" that he could be himself in roles where he could see himself reflected. Luna also recalled being asked to "clean up" his accent early in his career, a question that is no longer part of the conversation. Luna's presence in American productions has helped increase Latinx representation in Hollywood, though they still account for a small percentage of lead roles.</p>

The BRICS grouping, seen as a counter to Western-led forums, provides Putin with a diplomatic avenue amidst international isolation over the Ukraine invasion, as Russia has also proposed deepening military, security, trade and nuclear ties with Indonesia.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for another 90 days, marking the third such delay. The video-sharing app has faced scrutiny over its future due to a US law requiring a ban unless sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, over national security concerns. Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law, with a new deadline set for September 17. TikTok expressed gratitude for Trump's support and continued collaboration with Vice President Vance's Office, as authorities in Beijing will likely need to approve any sale or partial sale of the app.</p>
