The company reported adjusted earnings of $1.25 per share on $30.31 billion in revenue, partly boosted by the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney. Despite this strong performance, Comcast continued to lose broadband customers, with 226,000 dropping the service amidst heightened competition. However, the company saw record growth in its mobile segment, adding 378,000 lines, and its theme parks division revenue surged by 19% following the opening of Epic Universe, indicating strength in its content and experiences business.

          <p>Following their parallel success during the pandemic, vaccine pioneers Moderna and BioNTech are now pursuing distinctly different business strategies, leading to a major divergence in their stock performance. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA technology, investing its windfall in a broad pipeline of new vaccines, but has seen its stock slide amid cost-cutting measures. In contrast, Germany-based BioNTech has used its profits to diversify through acquisitions, notably in promising cancer drug technologies, resulting in significant stock gains. This strategic split highlights differing philosophies on how to sustain growth in a post-pandemic market, with Moderna focusing on its core platform while BioNTech hedges its bets across multiple therapeutic areas.

          <p>CVS Health reported strong second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street estimates, leading to a significant jump in its share price. The company announced adjusted earnings of $1.81 per share on revenue of $98.92 billion and subsequently raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. The positive performance was driven by strength in its retail pharmacy business and improvements in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been managing higher medical costs. While the company's health services segment saw a decline, the overall results reflect progress in its turnaround plan, which includes significant cost-cutting measures and a new prescription drug pricing model aimed at improving efficiency and value.

The company reported adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion, beating the LSEG consensus of $3.87 billion, and announced it will continue its share buyback program with another $3.5 billion over the next three months. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the performance amidst a challenging macroeconomic environment, highlighting the company's momentum in its transformation strategy. The results reflect Shell's focus on value creation and cost discipline, which has helped its stock outperform many of its U.S. and European rivals this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A China-led international research team has discovered the deepest and most extensive chemosynthesis-based communities ever found, located up to 9,500 meters below the surface in the northwest Pacific Ocean. These hidden oases of life, consisting of tubeworms and molluscs, thrive in total darkness by deriving energy from chemical reactions involving methane and hydrogen sulfide seeping from tectonic plate faults. This remarkable finding challenges existing models of life at extreme limits and deep-ocean carbon cycling. The researchers suggest that such ecosystems might be more widespread in deep-sea trenches than previously thought, opening new avenues for understanding life's resilience on Earth.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation, including a bill signed by President Trump, will significantly enhance Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts, which are tax-advantaged savings plans for individuals with disabilities. A key change, effective in 2026, raises the age of disability onset for eligibility from 26 to 46, opening the program to millions more people, including veterans and those with adult-onset illnesses. The new laws also make permanent several tax advantages, allow rollovers from 529 college savings plans, and improve the Saver's Credit for low-income contributors. These updates are designed to help disabled individuals save for expenses like housing and healthcare without jeopardizing their government benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Eli Lilly's Mounjaro Demonstrates Heart Health Benefits in Comparison to Older Drug Trulicity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 06:59:04 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its popular diabetes drug, Mounjaro, showed significant heart health benefits in a late-stage trial comparing it directly with Trulicity, an older diabetes treatment from the same company. The study found that Mounjaro was not inferior to Trulicity in reducing the risk of major cardiovascular events and also demonstrated a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and superior kidney protection. These results are expected to bolster Mounjaro's position as a first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes, especially as Trulicity's patent is set to expire in 2027. The company plans to submit the data to global regulators for expanded approval. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's communications regulator, Ofcom, has opened formal investigations into four companies operating a total of 34 pornography websites over their compliance with new age verification rules. These rules, part of the Online Safety Act, mandate that sites with adult content must use effective tools to prevent children from accessing them. The targeted companies have a combined monthly visitor count of over nine million, and Ofcom has prioritized them based on user numbers and the potential risk of harm. This enforcement action comes amid a broader crackdown on online platforms and a public debate over the effectiveness and privacy implications of the new age-check requirements.</p>

          <p>The founder of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, Liang, was part of a team that received a best paper award at the prestigious Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference. Their winning paper detailed a "native sparse attention" mechanism, a core innovation that enhances the efficiency and reduces the cost of DeepSeek's AI models. This recognition comes as Chinese researchers are increasingly outperforming their U.S. counterparts in basic research within computational linguistics. At this year's ACL conference, over half of the first-named authors on accepted papers were from China, highlighting the country's growing influence and leadership in the field of artificial intelligence.</p>
