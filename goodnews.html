          <p>Ford announced a $2 billion investment in its Louisville, Kentucky, assembly plant to produce a new line of affordable electric vehicles. The plan, which includes a new $30,000 electric pickup truck slated for 2027, aims to compete with Chinese manufacturers and represents a significant strategic shift for the American automaker. This investment is part of Ford's "Universal EV Program" and will utilize new U.S.-assembled LFP batteries, though the plant's retooling will result in a net reduction of about 600 jobs. The move comes as Ford navigates changing EV policies and increased global competition.</p>

          <p>In an unusual arrangement, chipmakers Nvidia and AMD have agreed to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. This deal allows the companies to sell their H20 and MI308 chips, which were previously restricted, securing their access to the lucrative Chinese market. While analysts view the move as a net positive for the companies, it sets a strange precedent and raises questions about future U.S. tech policy and China's reaction. The agreement underscores the Trump administration's transactional approach to managing strategic technology exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The online retail landscape is on the verge of a major transformation as generative AI platforms like ChatGPT are expected to integrate direct checkout functionalities. This would allow consumers to complete purchases within the AI chat interface, eliminating the need to visit a merchant's website and creating a more frictionless shopping experience. Experts suggest this shift could disrupt the e-commerce value chain, threatening the business models of payment processors and online marketplaces like Amazon by controlling the initial product discovery phase. The development signifies a move towards AI-driven "personal assistants" that manage the entire shopping journey.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge on Monday following news of a production halt at a key Chinese mine. The suspension occurred at the Yichun Project, operated by battery giant CATL, after its mining permit expired. This mine accounts for approximately 4% of the projected global lithium supply for 2025, and its temporary closure is expected to tighten the market and drive up prices. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume operations as soon as possible. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to release grand jury transcripts related to the case of convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell. Judge Paul Engelmayer characterized the move as a potential "diversion," stating the materials were redundant and would not add meaningful information to the public record. The judge argued that releasing the documents, which consist mainly of summary testimony from law enforcement, would undermine the principle of grand jury secrecy without serving a significant public interest. The ruling comes amid political pressure for more transparency in the Jeffrey Epstein case.</p>

          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are experiencing a potential rebirth by replacing vacant anchor stores with non-traditional tenants like churches, entertainment complexes, and high-end restaurants. This strategy of "reprogramming the box" aims to transform malls into community hubs that draw in diverse crowds for experiences beyond traditional retail. Landlords are subdividing large, former department store spaces to create a mix of tenants that encourage "cross-shopping" and increase foot traffic. This evolution, coupled with a nostalgic appeal for younger generations, is helping once-dying enclosed malls find a new path to relevance and profitability.</p>

          <p>Stargazers can enjoy one of the year's best celestial displays as the Perseid meteor shower reaches its peak on the nights of August 11 and 12. The shower, known for its fast and bright meteors, is caused by debris from the comet Swift-Tuttle burning up in Earth's atmosphere. While a bright Sturgeon Moon may reduce visibility of fainter meteors, the shower will still be visible to the naked eye in areas with clear, dark skies. For the best viewing experience, experts recommend finding a location away from city lights and allowing your eyes to adjust to the darkness.</p>

The iconic sound of a modem connecting was the soundtrack to the early internet for a generation, as AOL became the dominant service provider in the late 1990s with over 23 million subscribers. The service has since been rendered largely obsolete by faster broadband and fiber optic connections, with only a small fraction of households still relying on it.

          <p>With interest rates still relatively high, savers are weighing the benefits of certificates of deposit (CDs) against high-yield savings accounts (HYSAs). Experts advise that HYSAs are best for those who need liquidity and may require access to their funds for emergencies, as they offer flexibility without penalties. Conversely, CDs are recommended for those who want to lock in the current high rates for a set term, as they typically offer a slightly better return and protect against future rate drops. For those with larger sums, a strategy of splitting funds between both or using a CD ladder can offer a balance of growth and accessibility. (not investment advice)</p>
