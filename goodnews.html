          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $815 million for Wednesday night's drawing, making it the seventh largest in the game's history. This increase follows Monday night's drawing, which saw no winning tickets for the $750 million grand prize. A single winner could choose between a lump sum cash payment of $367.9 million before taxes or an annuity paid over 30 years. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million, and tickets cost $2 in 45 states, D.C., Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea finalized several significant agreements in Washington, including a $150 billion investment pledge from South Korean companies in the U.S. and Korean Air's nearly $50 billion purchase of 103 Boeing aircraft and GE Aerospace engines. U.S. President Donald Trump and South Korean President Lee Jae Myung also discussed new energy cooperation, including a partnership to develop Alaska's natural gas reserves. These announcements follow a July trade deal that reduced U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports, strengthening economic ties between the two nations. The leaders also touched on regional security and the potential for future talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists claim a significant breakthrough in making airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft virtually invisible to adversaries. These vital command nodes, typically vulnerable due to their powerful radar emissions, can now employ a new frequency diverse array (FDA) technology. This method assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, making the signal chaotic and obscuring its directional origin from a distance. This innovation represents a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and operational effectiveness of these high-value military assets.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, at 45, made a determined return to the US Open, battling Karolína Muchová for two intense hours before falling 6-3, 2-6, 6-1 in the first round. Playing on the 28th anniversary of her US Open debut on Arthur Ashe Stadium, Williams showcased her enduring passion and attacking style despite recent wrist injury struggles for her opponent. Post-match, she expressed pride in her performance, attributing her inability to maintain a high level to a lack of recent match practice. Williams also opened up about her long struggle with fibroids and a recent myomectomy surgery, finding motivation in playing pain-free.</p>

          <p>SpaceX was forced to scrub the 10th test flight of its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket for the second consecutive day, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. The mission aims to test fixes and upgrades following three previous catastrophic failures earlier this year. A successful flight is crucial for accelerating the launch cadence, particularly for autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a requirement for NASA's planned moon landing by 2027 and future Mars missions. Despite the delays and engineering challenges, SpaceX founder Elon Musk and NASA officials express confidence in the team's ability to achieve these ambitious goals.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is projected to continue its path over the central Atlantic Ocean for the next few days, posing no immediate threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm began weakening Monday night, located approximately 550 miles east-northeast of Bermuda with maximum sustained winds of 50 mph. Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, is forecast to remain over open waters and could transition into a post-tropical cyclone before dissipating on Wednesday. This hurricane season has been predicted to be above-normal by NOAA, with Fernand following Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 strength without making landfall.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in China have conducted a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the procedure's feasibility, though further tests are required. Scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in Guangzhou reported that a genetically altered pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained viability and functionality for 216 hours without infection or rejection. This xenotransplantation breakthrough addresses the global organ shortage crisis, especially for lungs, which present unique challenges due to their complexity and direct contact with external air.

          <p>Scientists in Singapore have industrialized the production of remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, envisioning them as a tiny army for disaster search missions. A recent article in Nature Communications detailed improvements in the robotic cockroach's control, increasing its turning ability from 70 to over 80 degrees, and verifying this precision through experiments. This pioneering concept of an "insect robot factory" aims to reduce mass production time and cost for practical applications. The development holds promise for navigating collapsed structures and locating survivors in hazardous environments where human access is difficult or dangerous.</p>

          <p>A district court judge in Utah has ruled that the state's Republican-controlled legislature must redraw its congressional boundaries for the 2026 elections, deeming the current map unlawful. The 2021 map divided Salt Lake County, a Democratic stronghold, among four districts, leading to all electing Republicans by wide margins. The judge found that the legislature circumvented a voter-established independent redistricting commission, which was designed to prevent partisan gerrymandering. Republican lawmakers have indicated they will appeal the decision, potentially delaying the adoption of new maps until 2028, creating uncertainty for the GOP's slim majority in the U.S. House.</p>

The Raiders, in urgent need of a backup quarterback after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, acquired Pickett for his 25 starts with the Pittsburgh Steelers and his Super Bowl LIX-winning experience as Jalen Hurts' backup with the Philadelphia Eagles. Pickett's hamstring injury in training camp hampered his competition for a backup role in Cleveland, where Joe Flacco is the starter.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding for U.S. schools, including allocations for after-school programs, teacher training, and English-language learner support. This decision follows a multi-state lawsuit led by California's attorney general, which accused the administration of illegally withholding congressionally-allocated funds. The White House had previously indicated a review found instances of federal education money being "grossly misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda." The delayed funds, frozen weeks before the school year, had created uncertainty for programs benefiting approximately 1.4 million children, predominantly from low-income families.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a medical doctor and BBC presenter, challenges conventional wisdom about posture, asserting that rigidly sitting "up straight" can be detrimental. He proposes three dynamic rules for better back health: prioritize movement, build strength, and adopt a positive mindset. Instead of static positions, regular breaks, stretching, and varied movements are crucial. Strengthening core and back muscles through simple exercises like pilates or yoga supports the body naturally. Furthermore, recognizing the emotional and psychological links to pain, such as stress from work, is essential for holistic back care, suggesting that easing one's schedule can be as important as physical adjustments.</p>
