          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets like cryptocurrency and private equity in 401(k) plans. This move is seen as a victory for the alternative asset industry, which has advocated for access to the trillions of dollars in retirement funds. While proponents argue it offers diversification, the inclusion of such assets, known for higher fees and less transparency, introduces new risks for individual retirement savers.

          <p>President Trump has nominated Stephen Miran, a past critic of the Federal Reserve, to its Board of Governors. Miran, who previously served in the Trump White House, would fill a term expiring in January 2026. His nomination is notable due to his past advocacy for devaluing the dollar and his strong pro-crypto stance. The appointment requires Senate confirmation, which is unlikely before September, and would place him on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order, pausing further construction at the controversial "Alligator Alcatraz" immigrant detention center in the Florida Everglades for 14 days. The ruling came after environmental groups and the Miccosukee Tribe argued the facility was built without required environmental impact studies, threatening a sensitive ecosystem and sacred tribal lands. While the facility can continue to house detainees, the order prevents new construction while the court considers a more permanent injunction. State officials have vowed to fight the ruling.</p>

          <p>The film "Weapons," from "Barbarian" director Zach Cregger, is reviewed as a compelling and intentionally messy horror film that splices together multiple narratives. The story centers on the mysterious disappearance of 17 third-graders from a small town, leaving one boy behind. The review praises the film's structure, which reveals the story through the overlapping perspectives of six flawed characters, including those played by Julia Garner and Josh Brolin. While not all of its ideas hold up post-viewing, the article commends the film's tense atmosphere, strong performances, and satisfyingly discontented ending.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that while a debt collector can legally freeze a bank account, they cannot do so arbitrarily. They must first file a lawsuit and obtain a court judgment against the debtor, a process that takes months and allows the individual to respond. Even with a judgment, federal and state laws protect certain funds from garnishment, including Social Security, disability, and veterans' benefits. If an account is frozen, individuals have options, such as filing an exemption claim with the court or negotiating a payment plan with the collector to have the freeze lifted.</p>

While OpenAI highlights its power, some ethics experts express concern that AI capabilities are outpacing governance and regulation. The launch comes amid intense competition in the AI space, with questions remaining about profitability and whether the technology's advances are revolutionary or merely evolutionary.</p>

Over 43% of those polled now hold a negative six-month outlook for the stock market. Some market strategists view this sharp rise in pessimism as a contrarian bullish indicator. The theory suggests that when investors are overly bearish, they have likely already sold stocks and are holding cash, creating potential buying power that could drive the market higher.

          <p>A federal jury in California has ruled that Meta violated the state's Invasion of Privacy Act by collecting sensitive user data from the period-tracking app Flo. The class-action lawsuit alleged that although Flo promised user data would be private, it shared information about users' reproductive health with companies like Meta and Google through their software development kits. While other defendants settled, Meta chose to go to trial and lost. The verdict is seen as a significant statement on the protection of digital health data, though Meta has stated it disagrees and is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>Even with a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated for September, opening a high-yield savings account remains a worthwhile strategy for savers. While rates may dip slightly, they are still projected to be substantially higher than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Experts note that any rate reductions are likely to be gradual and small, meaning these accounts will continue to offer significant earning potential. Furthermore, they provide crucial flexibility for accessing funds without penalty, which is valuable in an unpredictable economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

The statement was made as new U.S. tariffs on imports from approximately 90 other countries took effect. An extension of the truce would temporarily pause the escalating trade conflict between the two economic superpowers, which has seen both sides impose steep tariffs on each other's goods throughout the year.
