          <p>A young Philadelphia Phillies fan received special baseball treats, including an autographed bat from outfielder Harrison Bader, after a home run ball was controversially taken from him. Viral footage showed the ball landing in the stands, with the boy's father initially securing it for his son, only for a woman to demand it back, claiming it was hers. Both the Phillies and Marlins teams, recognizing the importance of such a moment for a young fan, stepped in to gift the boy with merchandise and a personal meeting with Bader. This gesture aimed to salvage the experience, providing a positive outcome for the fan amidst the dispute.</p>

The party's recent conference showcased rising figures like Westminster councillor Laila Cunningham, a lawyer and former Conservative defector, and Lancashire County Council leader Stephen Atkinson, highlighting efforts to broaden its appeal. Reform UK plans to field 5,000 vetted candidates for upcoming elections in London, Wales, and Scotland, viewing this as an essential building block towards a general election.

          <p>Davey Johnson, a revered figure in Major League Baseball, has died at the age of 82, as announced by the Mets' longtime public relations official, Jay Horwitz. Johnson was a four-time MLB All-Star infielder, winning two World Series titles with the Baltimore Orioles during his playing career in 1966 and 1970. He later achieved significant managerial success, famously leading the 1986 New York Mets to a World Series championship, and his 595-417 record remains the best of any manager in franchise history. Inducted into the Mets Hall of Fame in 2010, Johnson's extensive career also included managing the Cincinnati Reds, Orioles, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Washington Nationals.</p>

          <p>Dr. Bex Bennett, a former soldier who experienced mortar fire in Iraq, co-founded "Sisters in Service" to advocate for greater recognition and support for female military veterans. The community interest company, which has recruited 160 members across the UK, helps women who performed dangerous front-line roles and now work in healthcare, to support each other. Dr. Bennett highlights that many people still hold "very outdated ideas" that only men deploy to the front line, leading to unique challenges for women post-service, including feelings of isolation and misconceptions from the public. The group aims to provide a "cathartic" space for shared experiences, fostering connection and mutual support that traditional veteran spaces may not offer.</p>

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoys, including inflatable tanks and flat-pack artillery, to deceive Russian forces and conserve valuable ammunition and resources. These full-scale models, ranging from British-made M777 howitzers to imitation drones, are designed to mimic real military equipment, drawing enemy fire and forcing Russia to waste expensive weaponry. Volunteers play a crucial role in supplying these cost-effective imitations, with plywood M777 decoys costing around $500-$600, often targeted by much more expensive Lancet kamikaze drones. The successful deployment of these decoys often involves faithfully recreating realistic positions, sometimes even fooling visiting commanders, demonstrating their effectiveness as a strategic tool in the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>London-born Carlo Acutis is set to become the first millennial saint in a ceremony presided over by Pope Leo, following his beatification which was postponed due to the death of Pope Francis. Known as "God's influencer," Carlo, who died at 15 from leukemia, utilized his love for technology to create websites documenting miracles as a means of spreading Catholic teaching. His canonization follows the attribution of two miracles to him, including a woman's breast cancer remission after praying for his intercession. The Vatican has fast-tracked his sainthood, hoping to energize and inspire faith in young people. His baptismal church in Chelsea, London, and his preserved body in Assisi, Italy, have become significant pilgrimage sites, drawing thousands of followers who connect with his modern approach to faith.</p>

A fortunate winner can choose between an annuitized prize of the full estimated amount, paid over 29 years, or a lump sum cash value of $826.4 million before taxes. Tickets cost $2 and are available in 45 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, fueling widespread excitement despite the challenging odds of 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Dame Anna Wintour is stepping down as editor-in-chief of US Vogue, transitioning to global editorial director, raising questions about the magazine's future relevance in an increasingly digital and fast-paced media landscape. Wintour, known for her intuitive understanding of the zeitgeist and her groundbreaking decision to feature pop stars and diverse figures on covers, has been credited with maintaining Vogue's prominence for nearly 40 years. Her successor, Chloe Malle, reportedly plans to focus on less frequent, themed issues, aiming to make print editions more collectible. While some critics argue Vogue's influence has diminished with the rise of platforms like TikTok and Instagram, others, including fashion journalists, maintain its enduring brand power.</p>

          <p>The EU is set to gradually introduce its much-delayed new digital Entry/Exit System (EES) this autumn, beginning October 12, to track non-EU citizens entering and leaving the 29-country Schengen Area. This system, replacing manual passport stamping, aims to strengthen security and ultimately make travel smoother, though concerns persist about potential long queues during the initial registration process. For their first use, travelers will register biometric information, including fingerprints and a photo, at kiosks or with border officers, depending on their entry point. The EES registration will be valid for three years, with details verified on subsequent trips, and its phased rollout is intended to mitigate significant disruptions, with full implementation expected by April 2026.</p>

Among the first visitors were prominent figures like John Elkann of the Agnelli family and fellow fashion designer Donatella Versace, reflecting Armani's immense impact on the industry.

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a suspected double bomber on the FBI's most wanted list, faces extradition to the US after evading authorities for 21 years. He was found last year in an isolated cottage in north Wales, having used the alias Danny Webb. San Diego is the prime suspect for a series of bombings in the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003, with his alleged actions linked to animal rights extremist groups. Former FBI agents revealed "missed opportunities" to arrest him earlier, including discovering a suspected "bomb-making factory" in his abandoned car after a 65-mile rush-hour chase. His five-day extradition hearing at Westminster Magistrates Court in London will determine his return to face federal charges.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses secured their spot in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their impressive winning streak to 30 games. Despite the dominant scoreline, coach John Mitchell noted an "untidy" attacking performance and early struggles with their usually potent driving maul and set-piece, which were uncharacteristically scattergun in the first 30 minutes. Australia's intensity and tactical kicks unsettled England's defense, offering potential insights for stronger rivals like Canada and New Zealand in later stages. However, England's defense remained outstanding, keeping Australia scoreless in the second half for their third successive shut-out in the tournament. They now face Scotland in the quarter-finals, with Mitchell emphasizing the need for improved consistency in the upcoming knockout rugby matches.</p>

Executive Vice President Peter O’Reilly emphasized that this isn't a "one-and-done" event but a long-term commitment to year-round engagement, aiming to become a true global sport property. Despite soccer's dominance in Brazil, nearly 50,000 fans, overwhelmingly in Chiefs jerseys, attended the game, demonstrating the "pebble-in-the-pond effect" of building new fan bases. The league is investing in reach, streaming games free globally, and encouraging individual teams to engage with international markets, with Commissioner Roger Goodell noting 36 million fans in Brazil and seeing positive results in fan growth.
