          <p>Uber has announced a new pilot program in the U.S. that will allow women drivers and riders to preferentially match with each other. The feature, launching next month in select cities including Los Angeles and San Francisco, is designed to enhance comfort and safety on the platform. While not a guarantee, it increases the likelihood of women being paired together. This initiative follows similar features launched in other countries and comes as ridesharing companies face ongoing scrutiny over safety and sexual assault incidents involving their platforms.</p>

          <p>China maintained its lead in the global shipbuilding market, securing 68.3% of new vessel orders in the first half of the year, though this marks a decrease from nearly 75% in the same period last year. The total order volume also fell by 18.2%, a decline analysts attribute to shipowner caution regarding orders for oil and LNG tankers. This hesitation is linked to the United States' prominent role as a major exporter of oil and LNG. Despite the dip, experts believe China's competitive advantages in the sector remain strong.

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Claim Breakthrough in Stealth Aircraft Design, Citing US X-47B Drone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 09:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from the China Aerodynamics Research and Development Centre claim to have overcome a major challenge in stealth aircraft design that they say contributed to the cancellation of the U.S. Navy's X-47B drone program. Their new software platform reportedly allows for a vast number of design variables without increasing computational load, breaking the so-called "dimensionality curse." By applying their system to the X-47B model, they achieved significant theoretical improvements in aerodynamics, stealth, and propulsion. This innovation could have major implications for the future of military aviation technology.</p>

          <p>Meta is rolling out new safety features for its platforms, including Instagram, to better protect teenage users from exploitative content and predatory behavior. The updates will provide teens with more information about accounts they interact with and streamline the process for blocking and reporting suspicious users. This move follows increased pressure from policymakers and accusations that the company fails to shield young users from harm. Meta also reported removing over 600,000 accounts linked to predatory actions and placing teen accounts into stricter default privacy settings to limit unwanted contact.</p>

          <p>George Finch, a 19-year-old member of the Reform UK party, has become the youngest council leader in the United Kingdom, taking charge of Warwickshire County Council. Finch, who had planned to become a history teacher, has faced criticism from opposition councillors for his age and lack of professional experience, which he dismisses as "ageist." He became interim leader after his predecessor resigned and has already engaged in local issues, such as a dispute over a Union Jack dress at a school. Finch believes his appointment demonstrates that Reform UK is a party of meritocracy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis suggests that President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff strategy is achieving tangible results, exemplified by the recent trade agreement with Japan. The deal, which sets a 15% tariff on many Japanese goods, is viewed as a significant win for the White House, potentially influencing other economic blocs like the European Union. While Japan secured a better outcome than the threatened 25% tariff, the deal highlights a broader acceptance of U.S. protectionist measures. However, questions remain about the long-term economic impact, as U.S. consumers will likely bear the cost through higher prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two former City traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for interest rate manipulation quashed by the Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among 19 traders jailed in the UK and US for rigging the Libor and Euribor benchmark rates, which influenced global borrowing costs. The traders argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The Supreme Court ruled their original trials were unfair due to misdirection of the jury, making the convictions unsafe.</p>

          <p>Researchers in South Korea have developed a temporary tattoo-like sticker that can quickly and discreetly detect the presence of GHB, a common date-rape drug. The silicone sticker contains an indicator that changes color from yellow to red almost instantly upon contact with a droplet of a beverage containing the drug. This innovation offers a more subtle alternative to existing test strips, allowing for rapid detection in social settings like bars and clubs. While promising, experts note that further development is needed to ensure reliability and expand its detection capabilities to other substances.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China is positioning itself to be a global leader by dominating the clean energy sector, a critical capability in a world facing climate instability and economic uncertainty. As the world's largest producer of solar panels and electric vehicles, China is driving a green revolution that could redefine global governance. The cost of solar power has dropped dramatically, and China's integrated, high-quality supply chain makes it difficult for other nations to compete.

This has sparked a discussion on whether they should be promoted to the starting eleven or if manager Sarina Wiegman should stick with her successful formula of using them as "finishers."

At 19, she was given a suspended sentence, while her attacker received a lighter one for trespassing. Inspired by the #MeToo movement, Choi, now in her 80s, sought a retrial to clear her name, which was granted by the Supreme Court in 2024. Prosecutors have now asked the court to acquit her, with a final verdict expected later this year.</p>
