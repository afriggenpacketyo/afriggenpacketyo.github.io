          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch, and likely his father Rupert Murdoch, are expected to be part of the American investor group acquiring TikTok's U.S. operations. In a television interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as key figures in the deal, describing the participants as "American patriots." The announcement comes as the White House and Beijing continue to negotiate the final terms of the sale, which is intended to address national security concerns. Details confirm the new company's board will be majority American and Oracle will manage U.S. data. (not investment advice)</p>

Wilson had an exceptional season, finishing in the top five in points, rebounds, blocks, and steals, and leading the league in scoring for the second consecutive year. An emotional Wilson credited her teammates for the honor, which comes as she leads the Aces into the WNBA playoff semifinals against the Indiana Fever.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 match to clinch the series 2-0, the first-ever T20 series between the two nations. Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad, played a pivotal role with a score of 55 runs, guiding England to their target of 155 with 17 balls to spare. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup effectively on a slower pitch in Malahide. The victory caps a successful series for the English side after the second match was canceled due to rain.</p>

          <p>London held a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a major section of Oxford Street, a move Mayor Sadiq Khan hopes to make permanent to revitalize the famous shopping district. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," saw a half-mile stretch closed to vehicles, offering a glimpse of a future with increased footfall and space for public events. While many pedestrians welcomed the change, some local councillors and residents raised concerns about potential traffic congestion on smaller side streets and accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges. The mayor's office plans to consult on detailed proposals for a permanent pedestrianization scheme.</p>

          <p>The Amur Tiger Center in Russia has released dramatic footage showing the awesome power of two rehabilitated Amur tigers as they were freed back into the wild. The video shows the massive sibling tigers, a brother and sister, reacting with intense fury, swatting and biting at their cage doors just before their release. The display of natural ferocity highlights the challenges and dangers involved in wildlife conservation efforts for such powerful predators. Amur tigers, the largest tiger subspecies, are endangered due to poaching and habitat loss, with an estimated wild population of only 500 to 600.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage due to a new payment arrangement. For the first time, each American player will receive a $500,000 stipend, a controversial move that contrasts with the European team's tradition of playing for free. Donald posited that if the paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, facing high ticket prices, might turn on them. He confirmed that his players unanimously rejected the idea of being paid, emphasizing their motivation comes from representing Europe and inspiring future golfers.</p>

          <p>For the first time in almost 100 years, hundreds of swimmers plunged into the Chicago River for an organized one-mile swim, marking a major milestone for the once-heavily polluted waterway. The event highlights decades of environmental progress, driven by the Clean Water Act and local cleanup efforts, that transformed the river from a toxic sewer into a recreational asset. Historically, the river was so foul that its flow was famously reversed in 1900 to protect the city's drinking water. The successful swim symbolizes a renewed connection between Chicagoans and their river, which now supports wildlife and public enjoyment.</p>

          <p>UCLA's interim football coach, Tim Skipper, is hiring veteran assistant Kevin Coyle to join the defensive staff for the remainder of the season. The move is intended to stabilize the team's defense, which has struggled significantly in its 0-3 start, following the recent departure of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe. Coyle, 69, has extensive experience as a defensive coordinator in both college football and the NFL, including a previous successful stint working with Skipper at Fresno State. The Bruins hope Coyle's arrival will help improve a unit that currently ranks among the worst in major college football.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-setting rally may have further to run. The surge has been fueled by optimism around artificial intelligence and easier financial conditions, with some analysts arguing that strong earnings prospects and AI-driven productivity gains justify high valuations. Jeff Krumpelman of Mariner Wealth Advisors noted that today's tech-oriented S&P 500 is fundamentally different from historical benchmarks. However, other experts caution that further rate cuts could fuel a speculative "melt-up" detached from fundamentals, potentially leading to a sharp correction. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this decline, which can impact overall health. However, Epel suggests this damage is reversible through simple, sustainable lifestyle changes. She recommends practices such as eating more fruits and vegetables, incorporating short meditative breaks, increasing Omega-3 intake, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork. These small, daily actions can help restore cells and create an anti-inflammatory state.</p>

          <p>A child development expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include talking openly about emotions, demonstrating empathy in daily life, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Rather than lecturing, these parents validate their children's feelings and help them recognize social cues. They also treat mistakes as learning opportunities and teach children how to repair relationships after conflict, building a foundation of emotional safety and resilience.</p>

The move is also seen in the context of broader geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, with Beijing likely viewing such diversified partnerships among its allies favorably.</p>
