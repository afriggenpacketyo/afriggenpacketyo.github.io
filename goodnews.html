          <p>Iowa Democrat Catelin Drey defeated Republican Christopher Prosch, winning an open state Senate seat and breaking the GOP's supermajority in the chamber for the first time in three years. This victory marks the second time this year Democrats have flipped a Republican-held Senate seat in Iowa, including a district President Trump won by over 11 points. The win gives Iowa Democrats more power to block Republican initiatives, such as stopping the governor's nominees, which require two-thirds support for confirmation. Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin stated this shows Iowans are ready for change.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a 10th-century ivory walrus tusk figurine, believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking. Measuring just 1.2 inches, the figure depicts a well-groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neat hairstyle, contrasting with typical Viking art. Curator Peter Pentz suggests the figure, possibly a board game piece representing a king, challenges the perception of Vikings as savage. Its detailed carvings and unique smiling expression make it an extraordinary discovery, offering a rare glimpse into individual Viking representation.</p>

          <p>Mitch Brown, a former Australian Rules player for the West Coast Eagles, has made history by becoming the first openly gay or bisexual man in the AFL's 129-year history. Brown revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly contributed to his retirement decision and hopes his public announcement will foster a safer environment for others. He described a "hyper-masculinity" culture within the AFL, recalling homophobic comments and the absence of safe spaces for discussing sexuality. His coming out follows recent high-profile homophobic incidents in the league, urging a change towards celebrating positive male role models.</p>

          <p>European markets are expected to open higher, with traders focused on Nvidia's upcoming quarterly earnings report, which serves as a key indicator for the global technology and AI sectors. This rebound follows a decline influenced by political instability in France, where opposition parties refuse to back Prime Minister Bayrou's budget, threatening a confidence vote. Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed after China's industrial profits showed a narrowed decline. Investors are also monitoring new, steep U.S. tariffs on Indian exports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton's challenging first season with Ferrari, marked by performance struggles and self-doubt, has ignited discussions about the impact of aging on athletes and his adaptation to current F1 car designs. While raw statistics show a narrowing gap to teammate Charles Leclerc, Hamilton's confidence in the car's rear stability during braking remains an issue. The article explores how F1 car design changes since 2022, favoring ground effect over previous flat-floor aerodynamics, may not suit his traditional driving style. As Hamilton turns 40, the question arises whether his struggles are due to age or a mismatch with current vehicle characteristics.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new passive residual heat removal system, enhancing the safety of its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling fast nuclear reactors. This breakthrough, conducted by the China Institute of Atomic Energy, is a significant step in developing fourth-generation nuclear plants with closed-loop fuel cycles. Fast reactors are more fuel-efficient and can breed new fissile material from spent fuel, using liquid metal coolants. The tested system aims to make these integral fast reactors more meltdown-proof, supporting fundamental research into ultra-high-temperature materials for nuclear and aerospace applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits saw a reduced decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a significant recovery from steeper drops in previous months, attributed to Beijing's efforts against price wars. Profits for major industrial firms fell 1.7% in the first seven months of the year, with mining heavily impacted, but manufacturing and utilities showing improvement. Statistician Yu Weining noted that government policies to recover consumer price levels have boosted corporate profitability, particularly in raw-material manufacturing. This "anti-involution" campaign, aimed at excessive competition, is seen as both political and economic, though analysts expect continued deflation until market consolidation occurs.

The US was the top destination for global business travelers in the first half of 2025, accounting for 15% of all business air travel bookings. This trend is consistent despite broader negative travel sentiment in other regions and ongoing global economic tensions, including Trump's tariff policies.
