          <p>Elon Musk announced that Saudi Arabia has approved the use of Starlink for aviation and maritime purposes within the region.

Starlink, operated by Musk's SpaceX, aims to provide satellite internet services, while Tesla's robotaxis represent the company's ambition to expand into autonomous transportation solutions.</p>

          <p>Ramaco Resources, a Kentucky-based coal miner, may play a significant role in reducing U.S. dependence on China for rare earth elements, crucial for national defense. The company discovered a large deposit of rare earth oxides at a Wyoming coal mine acquired in 2023, estimated to contain 1.7 million tons. This discovery could help the U.S. wean itself off imports from China, which currently supplies 70% of the country's rare earths, and establish a new domestic facility to produce these critical minerals.</p>

          <p>The New World Screwworm (NWS), a fly eradicated from the U.S. in 1966, has reemerged as a potential threat following an outbreak in Mexico, leading to a shutdown of cattle, horse, and bison imports along the southern border. The NWS fly lays eggs in open wounds of warm-blooded animals, and the larvae burrow into the flesh, causing extensive damage and potential death. While rare, humans can also be affected, especially those traveling to South America and the Caribbean, spending time among livestock, or having open wounds, highlighting the need for preventive measures and vigilance.</p>
