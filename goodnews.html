          <p>England's women's cricket team has advanced to the World Cup semi-finals after a tense four-run victory against co-hosts India. Heather Knight's century was instrumental in setting a target of 289, providing a strong foundation for England's total. Despite a powerful innings from India's Smriti Mandhana, a late-game collapse under pressure prevented the hosts from securing the win. The victory continues England's winning streak in the tournament, while India now faces a critical situation, needing to win its remaining matches to have a chance at qualifying.</p>

The report suggests that Salesforce's AI platform is enhancing business operations without replacing its core software, while concerns are growing about OpenAI's high spending on consumer products. It also posits that the AI chip market is large enough for companies like Nvidia, AMD, and Broadcom to coexist successfully, while advising skepticism towards the current hype surrounding nuclear and quantum computing stocks.

          <p>A new book titled "The Biblio Diet" suggests that foods mentioned in the Bible can form the basis of a modern dietary plan to improve health and potentially reverse diseases. The authors, a doctor of natural medicine and his co-author, advocate for a diet rich in items like red meat, olive oil, whole-grain sourdough, and figs, while avoiding foods labeled as "unclean" in Leviticus, such as pork and shellfish. They also emphasize the importance of spiritual practices like fasting and forgiveness, viewing physical health as a way to honor one's faith and body.</p>

          <p>While smoking prevalence has significantly declined in Southeast Asia over the past two decades due to strong public health policies, the fight against tobacco is not over. Population growth has led to an increase in the absolute number of smokers, and Indonesia remains a notable exception with high smoking rates and significant industry influence on policy. Furthermore, the region now confronts the rising popularity of e-cigarettes, particularly among adolescents. Countries are divided on how to regulate vaping, with some implementing outright bans while others face political resistance to stricter controls.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to resume processing student debt cancellation for millions of borrowers under two income-driven repayment plans, following a lawsuit by the American Federation of Teachers. The Education Department had previously paused forgiveness under the Income-Contingent Repayment and Pay as You Earn plans, citing a court order that halted a separate program. This agreement ensures the government will once again deliver on congressionally mandated debt relief for public service workers and other eligible borrowers. The administration also clarified that forgiveness granted in 2025 will be exempt from federal taxes.</p>

          <p>UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has suggested that the government is considering a cut to the 5% VAT rate on household energy bills to address the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. While not confirming any specific plans ahead of the November Budget, he acknowledged the affordability challenges faced by the public. Miliband emphasized that the long-term solution to high bills is a transition to home-grown clean energy, reiterating a Labour pledge to lower average bills by 2030. Scrapping the VAT on energy could save the average household approximately £86 per year.</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, the newly elected leader of the Green Party of England and Wales, has defended his party's proposal for a wealth tax as a necessary measure to tackle deep societal inequality. The plan includes an annual tax of 1% on assets over £10 million and 2% on assets over £1 billion. Polanski argued that while the revenue is important, the primary goal is to create a fairer society by placing the largest burden on those with the "broadest shoulders." He also stated that capital gains tax should be aligned with income tax to ensure unearned wealth is taxed similarly to earned income.</p>

Organizers led the flock through the city center, which sits on an ancient migration route, and paid a symbolic fee in medieval coins for the animals' passage, upholding an agreement from 1418.

          <p>After more than a week of deadly border clashes, Pakistan and the Taliban-led government of Afghanistan have agreed to an immediate ceasefire. The agreement, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, aims to establish mechanisms for lasting peace and stability in the region. The fighting, the most severe since the Taliban's return to power in 2021, was fueled by Pakistan's accusations that the Taliban harbors armed groups that attack its territory. Under the new deal, both sides have committed to ending hostile actions and refraining from targeting each other's forces or civilian infrastructure.</p>

She also highlights Spain's affordable and accessible healthcare system, a greater sense of public safety, and a more relaxed social culture that places less pressure on traditional life timelines for marriage and children.

          <p>An opinion article praises two federal district court judges for their decisions to block the Trump administration's attempts to deploy National Guard troops to Portland and Chicago. The judges ruled that the administration's justifications for the deployments, which described the cities as "war-ravaged" and under siege, were "untethered to the facts." The article contrasts the courage of these lower court judges with what it describes as the Supreme Court's deference to the president. It argues that such judicial oversight is crucial to upholding constitutional law and preventing the normalization of military intervention in civil affairs.</p>
