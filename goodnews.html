          <p>A mother is advocating for pea and lentil proteins to be legally mandated on food labels after her nine-year-old son, Rex, suffered two severe anaphylactic shocks from unexpected ingredients in common foods like hot cross buns and ice cream. Pea is not currently among the 14 allergens required to be listed by law in the UK and EU, leading to a "game of roulette" for affected individuals. Experts and other allergy sufferers, including those with pine nut allergies, support expanding the allergen list to improve safety and ensure allergies are taken seriously by the public and food service staff. This article highlights the growing frustration and anxiety faced by families dealing with less common but severe food allergies.</p>

          <p>Time Out's annual survey, filtering responses from Gen Z individuals, identified the top 10 best cities for this demographic to live in, based on factors like food, nightlife, culture, and livability. Melbourne, Australia, secured the second spot, lauded for its diversity, inclusivity, and vibrant arts scene, with a significantly lower cost of living than New York City. New York City, the only US city on the list at number four, scored highly for walkability and culture but was criticized for its affordability.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the UK Parliament's e-petitions system marks its tenth anniversary, this article examines its effectiveness in influencing policy. While some joke petitions have garnered attention, the system has led to tangible legislative change, notably "Finn's Law," which increased protections for service animals after a police dog was stabbed. However, many petitions, even those with millions of signatures like calls to reverse Brexit, do not result in immediate government action, leading to public frustration and questions about the system's true impact. Despite perceived shortcomings, proponents argue it remains a vital "bridge between the public and Parliament" for direct democratic engagement.</p>

          <p>The article explores the rising trend of "preventative botox" among individuals in their 20s and early 30s, who seek anti-wrinkle injections to pre-empt signs of aging. Sydney Brown, 25, began treatments at 23, believing it boosts confidence and may prevent more invasive surgery later. However, experts like Nora Nugent of BAAPS caution against starting too young, calling it a waste of money as there are few lines to treat, and raising concerns about societal pressure and mental health. The article highlights the importance of consulting accredited medical practitioners and considering the long-term, unresearched effects of early and continuous treatment.</p>

          <p>Patrick Cantlay and Tommy Fleetwood are tied at the top of the Tour Championship leaderboard, setting the stage for an exciting final day. Cantlay surged with a back nine of 31, including four birdies in his last five holes, to match Fleetwood's 16 under par. Fleetwood, who had an excellent run of four consecutive birdies but also a double bogey, responded well to remain in contention for his long-overdue win on American soil. The article highlights the intense competition and high stakes for both players, with Cantlay also looking to solidify his Ryder Cup captain's pick.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Madurai Kamaraj University in India, in collaboration with Face Lab in the UK, have digitally reconstructed the faces of two 2,500-year-old male skulls excavated from Kondagai, near the ancient site of Keeladi. These reconstructions reveal features of Ancient Ancestral South Indians with traces of Middle-East Eurasian and Austro-Asiatic ancestries, providing clues about early inhabitants and migration routes. The findings support the claim of an independent urban civilization in southern India dating back to 580BC, challenging existing narratives about the Indian subcontinent's first major civilization. This article highlights a significant archaeological discovery that enriches understanding of India's diverse history and ancestry.</p>
