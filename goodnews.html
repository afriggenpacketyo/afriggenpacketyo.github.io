        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government is considering new regulations that could allow local councils to take control of unfinished housing sites from developers who fail to complete projects within set time frames. These rules are part of a broader plan to construct 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, requiring developers to commit to delivery schedules and submit annual progress reports. Developers who repeatedly miss targets may face penalties and be denied future permissions, with fines potentially reaching thousands of pounds per unbuilt home. Housing charity Shelter supports the plans, accusing developers of deliberately delaying construction to inflate prices and avoid building social housing, while emphasizing the need for increased social housing construction by councils and housing associations.</p>

          <p>President Trump delivered a lengthy and politically infused speech at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, addressing the graduating class of 2025. Trump used the opportunity to highlight his administration's efforts to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs, asserting that the military's role is to dominate foes and spread democracy through force. He also discussed immigration, praised figures like golfer Gary Player and real estate developer William Levitt, and claimed to have faced more investigations than Al Capone. The speech followed controversy from a previous West Point address where Trump's ability to walk down a ramp was questioned, this time exiting via a staircase.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi's Palme d'Or win at Cannes is celebrated as a victory for a courageous filmmaker who has faced imprisonment and censorship for his art and activism. Panahi's film, "It Was Just an Accident," is described as a humane, sharp, and witty drama that reveals the impact of political oppression on everyday Iranian life. The film tells the story of a mechanic who suspects a driver involved in an accident is a former torturer, and despite facing decades of censorship, Panahi has continued to create acclaimed works, and this Palme d'Or is a well-deserved recognition of his resilience and talent.</p>
