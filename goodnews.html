        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first rice crop in an experimental trial in east England, a development previously considered impossible. Ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and farmers Sarah and Craig Taylor cultivated nine varieties, including basmati and risotto, benefiting from the hottest summer on record. This ambitious project, led by the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, aims to explore future food security and climate change adaptation. Growing rice on peat soils could also help lock away greenhouse gases, offering a dual solution for environmental and agricultural challenges.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David Ellison, are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media landscape, challenging established dynasties like the Murdochs. Larry Ellison's close ties with President Trump have reportedly facilitated Oracle's increased role with TikTok and David Ellison's acquisition of Paramount. The Ellisons are also rumored to be preparing a bid for Warner Brothers Discovery, potentially creating one of the largest media giants. These moves raise concerns about media concentration and political influence, drawing scrutiny from lawmakers and critics.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on the impact of foul-smelling shoes on the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, initially aimed at designing better shoe racks, revealed that odor, caused by bacteria, was the primary reason people kept footwear outdoors. They developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes shoes in minutes, eliminating the 'rotten-cheese-like' smell. The whimsical yet inventive scientific endeavor highlights a universal domestic problem and its surprising solution.</p>

          <p>Europe holds a commanding 11½-4½ lead over the United States heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup, needing only 2.5 points to secure victory. This is Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, making a US comeback statistically improbable, as no team has overturned a deficit greater than 10-6. Captain Luke Donald, aiming for a historic second away win, remains cautious but acknowledges the team's dominant performance. The article analyzes key matchups, including Scottie Scheffler vs. Rory McIlroy, and Europe's strategic lineup for Sunday's singles matches, despite an injury concern for Viktor Hovland.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, former personal lawyer to President Trump. The lawsuit stemmed from Giuliani's baseless claims of widespread fraud and election rigging involving Dominion's machines during the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows similar agreements with Fox News and Newsmax, marking another legal and financial setback for Giuliani. His actions after the 2020 election have led to disbarment, a $1.36 million legal fee order, and a $148 million payment to defamed Georgia election workers.</p>

          <p>Starbucks Workers United rallied at two Los Angeles locations, part of a national effort to pressure the company into resuming stalled contract negotiations. The protests follow Starbucks' announcement to close hundreds of stores and lay off nearly 1,000 employees. The union claims Starbucks has implemented new policies, like a revised dress code, without proper bargaining, and has rejected a previous company proposal for annual raises. Workers are preparing for a potential strike, emphasizing their demand for fair contracts and input on company decisions, while Starbucks maintains its competitive pay and benefits.</p>

          <p>Tesla's new family-friendly Model Y L has achieved stunning success in China, selling out through October just after its August 2025 launch. Over 35,000 orders were placed on launch day, with new deliveries not expected until November. This surge is crucial for Tesla, which has faced global sales challenges due to increased competition and strict automated driving regulations in Europe. By expanding cabin space and lowering the price, the Model Y L broadens Tesla's appeal, accelerating electric vehicle adoption and contributing to reduced heat-trapping transportation pollution.

          <p>Europe established a formidable 11½–4½ lead over the United States after day two of the Ryder Cup, requiring only 2.5 more points to retain the cup. This marks Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, putting them in a dominant position for a historic away victory. The day was marred by unsportsmanlike conduct from American fans, who directed personal insults at European players like Rory McIlroy and Shane Lowry. Despite the contentious atmosphere, European players delivered strong performances, with Tommy Fleetwood nearly matching the US's total points on his own.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article investigates the efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging, consulting dermatologists and individuals who use them. While some users report brighter skin and stronger hair/nails, experts like consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth remain skeptical due to the complex journey collagen peptides must make through the body to reach skin cells. Studies funded by the wellness industry suggest benefits, but independent research shows no significant effect. Dermatologists recommend marine collagen over vegan options, but ultimately advise sunblock, a healthy diet, and quitting smoking as more impactful anti-aging strategies than costly supplements.</p>
