        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This CBS News article reports that President Trump signaled a potential openness to lowering tariffs on China, suggesting an 80% tariff "seems right" ahead of trade talks in Switzerland. The move comes after Trump announced tariffs of up to 145% on Chinese imports, prompting retaliation from China. Analysts suggest the market is expecting a reduction below 80%, and a failure to achieve this could trigger a negative market reaction. The article also notes Trump's recent trade deal with the United Kingdom, raising hopes for progress in negotiating agreements with other major trading partners.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports that Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 and intended for Venus, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. Due to a rocket malfunction, the spacecraft has been adrift in space for 53 years. Experts predict the re-entry to occur, with the spacecraft potentially surviving impact due to its protective heat shield. While the exact landing location is unknown, its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude. If recovered, any surviving pieces legally belong to Russia.</p>

          <p>This Los Angeles Times article reports on the annual statewide mussel quarantine in California, which went into effect this month. Public health officials warn against eating sport-harvested mussels due to naturally occurring toxins that can cause paralytic shellfish poisoning and domoic acid biotoxins. The quarantine extends along the California coastline from Oregon to the Mexican border and lasts through Oct. 31. Commercially grown mussels from certified companies are exempt because they are subject to frequent testing. Consuming toxic shellfish can be deadly, and there are no known antidotes.</p>

          <p>This ABC News article reports that Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration due to a column she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Judge William Sessions criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, highlighting declarations attesting to her peaceful and compassionate character. Ozturk testified about her humanitarian work and the challenges she faced in detention, including asthma attacks.</p>

          <p>This BBC article details the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, from an immigration detention facility in Louisiana, hours after a federal judge ordered her release. Ozturk's detention, following her co-authorship of an opinion piece critical of Israel, sparked nationwide protests. Judge William Sessions lambasted the government's case against her, stating her detention threatened the speech of millions of noncitizens. The ACLU praised the ruling, emphasizing that no one should be imprisoned for expressing their beliefs. Ozturk's case is among several involving international students detained for pro-Palestinian activism.</p>
