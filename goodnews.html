          <h2>Japan Introduces Gasoline Subsidy to Lower Prices Before Election</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a new gasoline subsidy aimed at reducing prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. This measure is being introduced ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. The subsidy program, allocated around 1 trillion yen, could potentially last until the end of March 2026. It targets a wholesale gasoline price reduction of 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further weekly reductions planned to reach the 10-yen target by mid-June. The price reductions are expected to reflect at gas stations in two to three weeks.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent discussed currency issues related to ongoing tariff negotiations, agreeing that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar will not be a point of contention in trade talks. Kato expressed concerns about the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on the global economy. Japan is considering concessions on U.S. tariff rates to expedite a mutually beneficial deal.

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the "sell U.S." narrative strengthens, spurred by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has touted emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, pointing to improved U.S.-China trade relations and attractive valuations. A decline in confidence in U.S. assets has fueled this bullishness, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Index outperforming the S&P 500 year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen consumer groups are calling on the European Union to take action against seven low-cost airlines, including easyJet and Ryanair, over their baggage fees. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses the airlines of "misleading" passengers and creating "confusion" at check-ins. The groups argue that these baggage fee practices breach EU consumer law and are seeking an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, demanding sanctions for the "illegal" practices. The BEUC advocates for a standard luggage allowance to be included in the ticket purchase.</p>

          <p>Southern California experienced the brunt of a heat wave this week, with slightly lower temperatures expected for Thursday and Friday. Woodland Hills hit 95 degrees Wednesday, which was among the hottest temperatures recorded in Los Angeles County, but the mercury remained below levels necessary to topple heat records. A low-pressure system is expected to bring the return of May gray and cooler temperatures by Friday, with the possibility of overcast beach weather on Memorial Day. The article reports that the region is not under a red flag alert since recent rains lowered the risk of widespread wildfires.</p>
