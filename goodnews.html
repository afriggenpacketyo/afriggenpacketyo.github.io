          <p>In a groundbreaking legal move, the sister of Christopher Pelkey, who was killed in a 2021 road rage incident, used an AI-generated likeness of her brother to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The AI avatar conveyed a message of forgiveness, which the judge praised. This unprecedented use of AI has sparked debate, with critics raising concerns about potential manipulation and deception in legal proceedings. While some legal experts found no ethical or legal issues, others cautioned against the use of AI in court, citing the risk of inflaming emotions and the potential for altered content.</p>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a new trade pact with the UK, but details remain limited and analysts suggest the benefits are narrow. The 10% import tax on most UK goods will remain, while the US agreed to roll back some import taxes on sectors like cars and steel. In exchange, the US anticipates expanded sales of American beef, ethanol, and other agricultural products in the UK. While officials from both countries hailed the agreement as a breakthrough, some analysts noted that the changes were marginal and that the deal primarily serves as a political victory for Trump.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are advocating for a revision of World War II history, suggesting that the conflict's start date should be moved back to Japan's 1931 invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This shift aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism and challenge the perceived Western-centric view.
