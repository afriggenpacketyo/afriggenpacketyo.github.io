          <p>This opinion article suggests that Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic approach to international relations amid global dysfunction. As a leader of a major economic power that bridges competing ideologies, Prabowo can champion a model of "constructive pragmatism." This philosophy prioritizes cooperation over confrontation, leveraging the growing influence of middle-power nations to navigate a world often paralyzed by the competing agendas of superpowers. The article posits that Indonesia's unique position could provide a practical road map for a more functional global order.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential for improving strained China-U.S. relations by focusing on their shared history as allies during World War II. Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, it highlights forgotten stories of cooperation, such as the American "Flying Tigers" who aided China and the Chinese villagers who protected downed U.S. airmen. The piece suggests that remembering this common struggle against fascism could offer a foundation for building better bilateral ties from the ground up. It frames this shared past as a potential formula for fostering mutual understanding and goodwill in the present day.</p>

          <p>The town council of Machynlleth, Powys, has denied a proposal from a local hotel to silence the town's 150-year-old clock during nighttime hours. The hotel owner argued that the clock, which chimes every fifteen minutes, leads to regular complaints from guests who are unaccustomed to the noise. However, councillors maintained that the chimes are an integral part of the town's character, a sentiment echoed by some local residents. The decision means the historic clock, recently restored for £55,000, will continue to sound 24 hours a day, preserving a local tradition over commercial concerns.</p>

          <p>Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," continues to explore themes of disappointing romantic partners, this time from her new position as a top-tier pop star. The album follows her breakout success with "Short n' Sweet" and finds her lamenting a new gallery of inadequate men with her signature witty and sharp lyricism. Musically, the album blends '70s-era pop influences with modern dance and country touches, created with her consistent team of collaborators led by Jack Antonoff. While not every track is as strong as her previous work, songs like "Goodbye" and "House Tour" showcase her continued artistic growth and clever songwriting.</p>

          <h2>Manchester United's Narrow Victory Over Burnley Highlights Persistent Goalkeeping Concerns</h2>

          <p>While Manchester United secured a dramatic 3-2 victory against Burnley with a late penalty, the performance underscored significant and ongoing issues with their goalkeepers. Goalkeeper Altay Bayindir made a critical error that led to Burnley's second goal, following similar mistakes by Andre Onana in previous matches. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledged the pressure on his goalkeepers, stating they are "struggling a little bit" in the high-stakes environment at the club. The win provides temporary relief but fails to mask the urgent need for stability in a key defensive position as the team faces a difficult schedule.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While no single international standard exists, medical and psychological experts generally agree on a precautionary approach to children's screen time, tied to their developmental stages. For the youngest children (under 3), experts recommend a screen-free environment to encourage exploration and self-regulation of attention. As children grow, limited and supervised screen time is advised, with an emphasis on content quality and parental interaction over strict time limits. The primary concern is that excessive screen time displaces crucial activities like physical play, social interaction, and language development, which are essential for building motor skills and emotional intelligence.</p>

          <p>Everton manager David Moyes has lauded the performance of Jack Grealish, who has been instrumental in the team's recent victories since joining on loan from Manchester City. Grealish provided two assists in a 3-2 win at Wolverhampton, repeating his performance from the previous week and earning man-of-the-match honors. Moyes noted that Grealish, who struggled for playing time at his parent club, is thriving with more attention and game time, bringing a creative edge to the team. The player's resurgence at Everton has reignited discussions about his potential return to the England national team ahead of the World Cup.</p>

          <p>Residents in Newtown, Powys, took matters into their own hands to save thousands of fish that were stranded in a shrinking puddle after a local brook dried up due to prolonged drought. A local man, Dave Lister, discovered the fish "gasping for air" and, after receiving no immediate response from the environmental agency, organized a group of friends to move the fish to a nearby river. Natural Resources Wales later stated that moving fish during such extreme conditions can cause more harm than good. However, the residents felt their actions were necessary to prevent the fish from perishing in the rapidly evaporating water.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Coco Gauff has secured her spot in the second week of the US Open for the fourth consecutive year after a convincing 6-3, 6-1 victory over Magdalena Frech. After two tense, three-set matches earlier in the tournament, Gauff appeared more settled and confident, particularly with her serve, which has been a source of inconsistency recently. The win sets up a highly anticipated fourth-round match against two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka. This will be their first meeting at the tournament since 2019, when Gauff was a 15-year-old wildcard.</p>
