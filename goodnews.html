          <p>Two men in England, Daniel Graham and Adam Carruthers, have been convicted of criminal damage for cutting down the iconic Sycamore Gap tree in Northumberland in September 2023. The tree, believed to be around 200 years old, was a beloved landmark near Hadrian's Wall, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The Crown Prosecution Service stated that the men recorded a video of themselves cutting down the tree and relished the public outcry they caused. The National Trust expressed gratitude for the conviction, emphasizing the strong connection between people and natural heritage, and the men are slated to be sentenced on July 15.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is presenting "Superfine: Tailoring Black Style," an exhibition exploring 300 years of Black sartorial history. Curated by Monica L. Miller and Andrew Bolton, the exhibition assembles garments, accessories, paintings, and videos to illustrate the evolution of Black fashion and its cultural significance. The article describes how the exhibit examines themes like ownership, disguise, freedom, and respectability through both historical garments and contemporary designs from brands like Louis Vuitton and Balmain. The reviewer finds that Frederick Douglass‚Äôs tailcoat is an especially powerful emblem of Black expression and resistance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK and the US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on specific goods traded between the two countries. Tariffs on UK car imports have been cut to 10% for up to 100,000 cars annually, and tariffs on steel and aluminum imports into the US have been scrapped, though quotas may apply. While the UK will allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free, the government insists that hormone-treated beef will not enter the UK. The agreement does not affect the UK's digital services tax, and negotiations on pharmaceuticals are ongoing.</p>

While the UK has agreed to allow up to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef imports from the US tariff-free, the rules on food standards remain unchanged.

          <p>The US and the UK have struck a preliminary trade deal that cuts tariffs on British-made cars, eliminates duties on steel and aluminum, and opens the UK market to American farmers. While not a comprehensive trade agreement, the deal aims to smooth trade ties between the two countries, with the UK reducing tariffs on US ethanol to zero. However, Britain maintains its ban on US chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef, and outstanding issues on pharmaceuticals and the digital services tax remain.

          <p>Japan Rugby League One is planning to change its player registration rules to increase playing time for domestic players, starting in the 2026-27 season.
