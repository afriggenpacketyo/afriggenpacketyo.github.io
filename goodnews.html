          <p>Novo Nordisk announced a Q1 net profit exceeding expectations, reaching 29.03 billion Danish kroner, but has revised its full-year sales growth forecast downward due to increased competition affecting its Wegovy sales.

          <p>A new bill is set to be introduced in Parliament in England and Wales that could add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This legislation aims to prevent offenders from avoiding the consequences of their actions, providing victims' families with a sense of justice and recognition. The bill will apply to cases in the Crown Court, including those where offenders are removed for disruptive behavior. While the Prison Officers Association acknowledges the risks involved in compelling attendance, they suggest alternative measures such as restricting family visits and parole eligibility.</p>
