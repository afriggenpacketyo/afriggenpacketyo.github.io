          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring its infamous "Blue Screen of Death" error message, a staple of the Windows operating system for over four decades. The notorious crash screen will now feature a black background and display a more condensed, simplified error message. This change is part of a broader effort by the company to improve the resilience of Windows and streamline the user experience during unexpected system restarts, a move prompted in part by a major 2024 IT outage.</p>
