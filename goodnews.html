          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with outfielder Juan Soto regarding his effort running to first base after two plays where he appeared to not hustle. The first incident occurred when Soto watched his hit bounce off the Green Monster for a single, and the second was a ground ball where he was easily thrown out. Soto defended his hustle, stating he has been hustling hard. Mendoza acknowledged Soto's belief that he was hitting a home run on the play with the Green Monster, but stated that he still needs to run hard regardless. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a temporary trade truce between Beijing and Washington, a survey reveals that 95% of Chinese exporters are planning to increase exports to markets outside the U.S. due to lasting scars from the trade war. The U.S.-China "decoupling" remains a likely scenario in the medium term, as Chinese exporters seek alternatives and American firms shift production out of China. Companies expect a hit on export turnover this year due to U.S. tariffs, even after the recent tariff reduction. Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, is a top choice for Chinese businesses seeking to move production overseas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen, a long-time critic of President Trump, recently voiced strong disapproval of the administration from a British stage, calling it "corrupt, incompetent and treasonous". Trump responded by labeling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggested that Springsteen and Beyonc√© should be investigated for illegal campaign donations related to their support for Kamala Harris. Springsteen has consistently challenged his audience politically throughout his career, addressing issues such as immigration and police brutality, sometimes angering conservative fans. Despite Trump's attacks, Springsteen repeated his criticisms the following night.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's Chief Financial Officer Richard McPhail told CNBC that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing the company's scale, partnerships with suppliers, and productivity improvements. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales come from the U.S., and they have diversified their import sources, aiming for no single country outside the U.S. to represent more than 10% of purchases by next year. This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which anticipates raising prices to cover tariff costs. Home Depot missed Wall Street's first-quarter earnings expectations but beat sales estimates.</p>

President Trump announced his intention to nominate Kushner to the position in November, calling him a "tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker".

          <p>A Chinese scientific study suggests that the ancestor of animals and plants was a hydrogen-metabolizing cell that existed before the Great Oxidation Event. The research indicates that the last common ancestor of eukaryotes lived around 2.72 billion years ago under oxygen-deficient conditions. Eukaryotes are cells or organisms characterized by a membrane-bound nucleus, forming the foundation of complex, multicellular life. Understanding the origins of eukaryogenesis could provide insights into the evolution of life and have implications for the exploration of life in outer space.</p>

          <p>In Sonora, Mexico, the Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) is working with ranchers to conserve jaguars by compensating them for cat sightings on their land. The Viviendo con Felinos program pays ranchers for photos of jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats, turning them from perceived threats to valuable ecosystem features. This approach has proven successful, with the population of jaguars in the reserve and surrounding ranching region remaining stable or growing. The program has expanded the protected area and fostered a shift in attitudes among ranchers, making them more tolerant of wild cats and their potential impact on livestock.</p>

          <p>This article recounts the 1965 Cambridge Union debate between William F. Buckley Jr. and James Baldwin on the topic of race in America. Buckley, a conservative intellectual, and Baldwin, a celebrated writer on racial injustice, presented contrasting views on the American dream and the Black experience. The debate highlighted the deep divisions in American society and the challenges of achieving racial equality. While Buckley focused on logic and individual responsibility, Baldwin emphasized the systemic nature of racism and its impact on Black lives.</p>
