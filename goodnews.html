          <p>Liverpool has finalized the acquisition of Swedish striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle United for a British record transfer fee of £125 million, which could rise to £130 million with add-ons. The 25-year-old signed a six-year contract after a protracted negotiation process that concluded on the final day of the transfer window. Isak expressed his motivation to "create history and win trophies" with his new club, where he will wear the number nine shirt. This move follows Newcastle's recent signings of other forwards, indicating a strategic shift for the club.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, the CEO of a Polish paving company, has publicly apologized after a video of him taking a hat from a young boy at the US Open went viral. Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed tennis player Kamil Majchrzak was throwing the hat to him, calling his action a "huge mistake" and not his intention to take a souvenir from a child. He has since returned the hat to the boy. Majchrzak, who won the match before the incident, also reunited with the young fan over the weekend to give him new merchandise.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has secured Manchester United winger Jadon Sancho on a season-long loan, agreeing to cover a significant portion of his substantial wages. The deal includes bonuses that could result in United receiving full wage coverage for the 25-year-old England international. Sancho, who had previously turned down a move to Roma, has not played for Manchester United since August 2024, having spent the last 18 months on loan at other clubs. The move is part of a busy deadline day for Villa, which also signed defender Victor Lindelof.</p>

She states that she feels "it's close to the end" and reflects on her choice to prioritize her personal story over her career, fearing the industry would "swallow people whole" as it did with Marilyn Monroe. After her home was destroyed in a mudslide, Novak moved to Big Sur and focused on painting for survival.

          <p>Arsenal has strengthened its defense by signing Ecuadorian international Piero Hincapie from Bayer Leverkusen on a season-long loan. The deal includes a £45 million option to make the transfer permanent next summer. Hincapie, 23, was a key part of Leverkusen's recent Bundesliga and German Cup-winning squad. This move is Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta's eighth signing of the summer and is seen as a direct replacement for defender Jakub Kiwior, who has been loaned to Porto. The signing aims to make the Gunners' squad more competitive for the current season.</p>

          <p>Benny Safdie's new film, "The Smashing Machine," stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA champion Mark Kerr. The movie explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss in 1997, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship anxieties. Johnson's performance is noted as a perfect physical match for the role, supported by Emily Blunt as his girlfriend. While the film is praised for its insightful moments of vulnerability, the review suggests it doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of the story or elevate itself beyond a solid sports drama.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has cautioned the U.S. team not to expect the "same pairings or the same lineup" at the upcoming event at Bethpage, despite his team being nearly identical to the one that won in Rome two years ago. Donald confirmed that 11 of the 12 players from the victorious 2023 squad will return. He emphasized that playing away from home presents a "different challenge" requiring a "different strategy," especially since Europe has not won on American soil since 2012 and suffered a heavy defeat in 2021.</p>

          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has published a satirical short story targeting a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of her iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some schools. Atwood's new story sarcastically describes two "very, very good children" who grow up and have a family "without ever having sex," mocking the premise of the ban. This is her latest criticism of the policy, which reflects a growing trend of book challenges moving from the U.S. into Canada.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains at the start of the month, with the aerospace and defense sector performing particularly well. The rise was spurred by news of a £10 billion order from Norway for British-made warships, which will be built by BAE Systems, causing its shares to climb. In the health-care sector, Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk's shares also increased following the release of trial data suggesting its weight-loss drug Wegovy is more effective than rivals at reducing heart disease risk. Meanwhile, Asian markets were mixed as investors analyzed new manufacturing data from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals How Human Activity Caused Domestic Animals to Grow and Wild Animals to Shrink</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 13:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones from southern France has found that human influence, particularly since the Middle Ages, has caused a divergence in the body size of wild and domestic animals. Researchers discovered that as humans fragmented forest habitats and intensified hunting, wild species like deer and foxes became smaller. In contrast, domestic animals such as cattle, pigs, and chickens grew larger due to increased human control, selective breeding, and specialized management practices. This research highlights the profound and lasting impact of human activities on the evolution of other species.</p>
