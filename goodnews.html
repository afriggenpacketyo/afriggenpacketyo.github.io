          <p>Chinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its stock reach a record high after the successful launch of its new electric vehicle, the YU7 SUV. Priced competitively to undercut Tesla's Model Y in China, the YU7 received over 200,000 pre-orders shortly after its debut. The vehicle boasts a longer driving range than its Tesla counterpart and incorporates advanced AI features, though it reportedly lags in driver-assist capabilities. This launch intensifies the ongoing EV price war in the Chinese market, marking a significant step in Xiaomi's expansion from consumer electronics into the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Khaman Maluach, a 7-foot-2 center from South Sudan, had an emotional reaction after being selected in the 2025 NBA Draft.

Maluach, who fled conflict in his home country and began playing basketball at age 14, is the highest-drafted player from NBA Academy Africa.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers executed multiple trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately selecting 6-foot-8 forward Adou Thiero from Arkansas with the 36th pick. The team views Thiero as a 'super athletic wing' who can provide much-needed athleticism alongside Luka Doncic, drawing comparisons to OG Anunoby. To secure the pick, the Lakers traded their 55th pick and cash to Chicago for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to Minnesota for the 36th selection. The move addresses a key team need without giving up future assets.</p>

          <p>A large, bright meteor, also known as a fireball, was witnessed across Georgia and South Carolina on Thursday afternoon before exploding over Georgia. The event generated sonic booms that were heard by residents on the ground. According to NASA, the meteor was approximately three feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and was traveling at 30,000 miles per hour when it entered the atmosphere. The explosion released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT. Experts suggest the rare daylight fireball could be part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower.</p>

          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a neighborhood suffering from the 'Urban Heat Island' effect, a local environmental group is pioneering solutions on a single 'cool block.' The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with heat-reflecting materials, and painting rooftops white to lower temperatures. This urban laboratory aims to create a template for other densely populated areas struggling with extreme heat, which is intensifying due to climate change. Researchers are studying the project's effectiveness, noting that such green initiatives can reduce peak urban temperatures significantly.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has indicated that the 90-day pause on its 'reciprocal tariffs,' which is set to expire on July 9, could be extended. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt stated that the deadline is 'not critical' and that the president could prolong the pause if U.S. trading partners continue to negotiate in good faith. The remarks came as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks. The policy affects about 60 trading partners, including Japan, which faces a potential total tariff rate of 24 percent on its goods. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Allen Frances, a prominent psychiatrist, is reflecting on his role in the significant increase in autism diagnoses over the past few decades. In a New York Times piece, Frances discusses how changes he helped lead in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) broadened the criteria for autism. This expansion, intended to identify more severe cases, inadvertently led to a 60-fold increase in diagnoses by including milder presentations under the same umbrella. His commentary explores the complex consequences of evolving diagnostic standards in mental health.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that offers a potential cure for a life-threatening genetic disorder called APDS. The condition, which affects the immune system, claimed the lives of her mother, grandmother, and other relatives. The drug is the first targeted treatment for APDS, which was only identified in 2013 by Cambridge researchers with help from the patient's family. The treatment works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly and giving patients the chance to live a normal life.</p>
