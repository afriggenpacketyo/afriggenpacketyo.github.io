          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 00:32:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's practice of granting citizenship based on real estate investments, effectively banning the last 'golden passport' program in the EU. The court found that such policies undermine the solidarity and mutual trust between member states, treating nationality as a mere commercial transaction. Maltese Prime Minister Abela defended the program, noting it had generated significant revenue, but pledged to rework the system to align with the court's decision. While purchased passports are now ruled out, 'golden visas,' offering residence permits for major investments, remain an option in many EU countries, raising concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks.</p>

The vote tally was 212 in favor to 6 against, with most of the eligible voters believed to be Starbase workers. Musk celebrated the approval, noting it is now a real city. The creation of the city has drawn criticism from those who worry it will expand Musk's control over the area, including the potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches, while SpaceX says this authority would streamline launch operations.</p>

          <p>A survey in Japan reveals that nearly 30% of people in common-law relationships have chosen not to marry due to the country's surname law, which requires couples to adopt the same last name upon marriage. The rate is higher among those in their 20s, with over 60% indicating they would switch to legal marriage if separate surnames were allowed. While the opposition party calls for the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the move, fearing it would affect traditional family values. Common-law couples lack the benefits of legal couples, such as tax deductions and inheritance rights.</p>
