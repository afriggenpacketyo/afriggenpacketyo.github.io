          <h2>Analysis Suggests China Shock Had Positive Impacts on America</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion article challenges the long-held belief that the "China shock" negatively impacted the American economy by stealing jobs and collapsing the manufacturing labor market. The author contends that the availability of cheap Chinese goods has made life more affordable for average Americans, despite concerns about job losses. The piece questions the validity of research claiming significant job losses due to Chinese competition, suggesting that the benefits of affordable goods may outweigh the drawbacks. The article presents an alternative perspective on the economic relationship between the United States and China. Optimism is moderate, with a balanced assessment of economic impacts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite reporting strong quarterly results, CrowdStrike experienced a sell-off due to mixed guidance, prompting analysts to raise the price target for the stock. The company's revenue and annual recurring revenue (ARR) exceeded expectations, and management announced a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The CEO highlighted the accelerating adoption of the Falcon Flex subscription model, indicating strong demand for cybersecurity solutions. Analysts believe the post-release decline presents a buying opportunity, as cybersecurity remains a critical expense for corporations amid increasing AI-driven cyber threats.
