          <p>Amid trade war concerns and rising costs, thrifting is gaining popularity among Americans as a way to save money and reduce textile waste. The secondhand market is expected to more than double by 2028, growing significantly faster than the broader retail sector. Small businesses are capitalizing on this trend, with sewing classes experiencing increased demand. Thrift stores are evolving into curated, boutique-like experiences with a focus on mission-driven initiatives, fostering a sense of community and acceptance. This movement reflects a growing awareness of sustainability and mindful consumption.</p>

          <p>Official campaigning for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election has started, drawing attention as a prelude to this summer's House of Councillors race, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's popularity remaining low. With no party holding a majority in the assembly, focus is on whether the LDP can retain its seats, amid approval ratings sometimes dipping below the "danger level." Parties are aggressively using social media to appeal to voters, especially unaffiliated ones. Major issues at stake include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals, child-rearing, and regional concerns, with around 300 candidates running in the election. The outcome of this election could significantly influence the political landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese solar firms are expanding overseas to survive U.S. tariffs, even with a temporary trade truce. High tariffs on solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the U.S. are driving this shift. Companies are diversifying production, with plans to expand in the Middle East, Africa, the U.S., and Europe. Executives emphasize that localizing production abroad is crucial for long-term survival. The industry is adapting to uncertain trade conditions by establishing production bases outside of China.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England will be the first to offer a 'Trojan horse' therapy that delivers toxic drugs directly into cancer cells, significantly halting the progression of myeloma for nearly three times longer than current treatments. This advanced chemotherapy reduces side effects while hitting cancer with a larger dose. Paul Silvester, an early recipient, described the therapy as "life-changing," enabling him to pursue activities like visiting Hadrian's Wall. The treatment, belantamab mafodotin, works by binding a lethal chemotherapy drug to an antibody that targets and kills cancerous plasma cells, offering new hope for myeloma patients.</p>

          <p>A car crash in Blue Ash, Ohio, was reportedly caused by a cicada flying into the driver's window, startling the driver and causing them to lose control. The driver hit a pole while attempting to remove the cicada, resulting in no injuries. Police joked that "the suspect fled the scene," referring to the cicada. The cicada invasion, occurring every 17 years, has disrupted the Cincinnati area, with peak activity expected to decline in early July. The article also provides information on which counties are experiencing the heaviest cicada emergence and the behavior of these insects.</p>

          <p>Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi is spearheading efforts to lower rice prices in Japan, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move comes after Koizumi's unsuccessful leadership bid, with analysts suggesting his communication skills and reformist approach could benefit the LDP in upcoming elections. Koizumi has taken steps to release government rice stockpiles at reduced prices, drawing attention to agricultural sector issues. While praised for capturing public imagination, critics warn that his actions could backfire if they fail to improve living standards. The success of this initiative could significantly impact Koizumi's political career.</p>
