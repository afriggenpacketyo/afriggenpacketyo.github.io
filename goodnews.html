          <p>Musician Cardi B took the stand in a civil trial where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, an allegation she denies. Her animated testimony and sharp responses during cross-examination have gone viral, with clips circulating widely on social media. The case centers on a verbal altercation where the guard claims the rapper, who was pregnant at the time, spat on her and cut her with a fingernail. Questions from the opposing lawyer about her wigs and nails also drew significant online commentary and debate.</p>

          <p>Ethan Wargo, a nine-year-old from Sycamore, Illinois, has gained local fame by setting up a stand offering free compliments to passersby. Inspired by a character in a "Dog Man" graphic novel who had an insult stand, Ethan decided to do the opposite to spread positivity. After a slow start, a social media post by his father helped the stand become a popular stop for community members seeking a kind word. The simple, heartwarming gesture has been widely praised for its positive impact on the community's morale.</p>

          <p>The Department of Defense is reportedly considering measures to expedite the reinstatement of service members who were discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine. Officials are also weighing whether to grant honorable discharges to those whose only infraction was vaccine refusal, which could make them eligible for benefits. The move follows an executive order from President Trump to reinstate those who requested it and comes amid frustrations from former service members about a slow and difficult process to return to service after the Biden-era mandate was rescinded by Congress.</p>

          <p>Legacy coffee chains like Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling to appeal to younger consumers, who are increasingly drawn to trendier, visually appealing drinks like matcha lattes offered by newer cafes. This shift in consumer preference, driven by social media trends and a desire for "affordable luxury," is challenging established brands. Analysts note that with the rise of home coffee machines, chains must offer unique experiences to attract customers. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, has acknowledged the brand's performance issues as it faces competition from both artisanal shops and viral new chains.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry's upcoming visit to the United Kingdom has fueled speculation about a possible reconciliation with his father, King Charles III, amid a long-standing family rift. While a meeting is not confirmed, recent signs, including a reported meeting between their communications teams, suggest a slight easing of tensions. Trust remains a major obstacle, and a reunion with his brother, Prince William, is considered highly unlikely. However, the King's recent cancer diagnosis and Harry's public statements about wanting to reconcile have created what some see as the best opportunity in years for father and son to reconnect.</p>

          <p>Pennsylvania State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. His protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he blames on Republican inaction in the legislature. Kenyatta argues the funding crisis is harming students, seniors, and workers who rely on public transit. He frames his march as part of a "time-honored American tradition" of protest to highlight the issue and pressure lawmakers to act on bipartisan funding proposals.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The court upheld a lower court ruling, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges found that the Homeland Security Secretary does not have the authority under the governing statute to vacate a prior extension of TPS. The decision insulates the program from what the court called "electoral politics," providing relief for beneficiaries who feared deportation.</p>
