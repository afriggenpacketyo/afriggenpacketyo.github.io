          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was awarded the Order of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, the nation's highest civilian honor, during a two-day diplomatic visit. The award recognizes the deep historical and cultural ties between the two countries, which date back to the 19th century when Indian indentured laborers arrived in the Caribbean. The visit focused on strengthening strategic partnerships, with India promising investments in Trinidad and Tobago's energy, health, and security sectors. Modi also announced that sixth-generation citizens of Indian origin would now be eligible for Overseas Citizen of India cards.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are not planning to alter their trade deadline strategy despite a knee injury to third baseman Max Muncy, which is expected to sideline him for six weeks. Initial fears of a season-ending injury were alleviated when an examination revealed only a bone bruise with no ligament damage. The team's management expressed relief and confidence that Muncy will return with more than a month remaining before the playoffs. In the interim, the Dodgers will utilize internal players like Tommy Edman, Kiké Hernández, and Miguel Rojas to cover the position, avoiding a desperate search for an external replacement.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 22:23:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several shark sightings in the waters off Far Rockaway, Queens, led to the temporary closure of a beach on the Fourth of July. Drones and lifeguards monitored the sharks, which were observed swimming very close to beachgoers, prompting officials to ensure public safety during the holiday. New York City's Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, Kaz Daughtry, confirmed the sightings and the brief closure, highlighting the use of technology to monitor the situation. This event follows recent reassurances from Governor Kathy Hochul about enhanced shark surveillance measures along the state's beaches for the summer season.</p>

          <p>As the United States targets China's dominance in the shipbuilding industry, South Korea and Japan are positioning themselves to increase their market share. South Korea's new presidential administration has identified the domestic shipbuilding sector as being in a "major crisis" and has pledged support to revitalize it as a core national industry. Policy guidelines focus on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through digitalization and automation. The strategy aims to re-establish South Korea as a global maritime power, moving beyond its traditional strengths in shipbuilding to lead in future vessel technology.</p>

          <p>A family that relocated from Salt Lake City, Utah, to the small town of Justin, Texas, shares the cultural and financial adjustments they've experienced. While they were shocked by the significantly higher property taxes in Texas compared to Utah, they found the lack of state income tax to be a major difference. The family appreciates the slower pace of life and more diverse, inclusive culture in their new town, though they miss the mountains and accessibility of Salt Lake City. Overall, despite the trade-offs, they report being happier and have successfully integrated into the small-town community.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent feature article delves into the changing perceptions of showing emotion, specifically crying, in the workplace. While traditional views often label it as unprofessional or a sign of weakness, many now see it as a display of emotional intelligence and humanity. The article includes anecdotes from both men and women who have cried at work due to stress, frustration, or personal issues, with some feeling it fostered a more supportive environment. Career experts suggest that employers who show compassion are more likely to retain motivated staff, though some acknowledge a lingering bias against emotional displays could still affect promotion prospects.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research reveals that tiny marine creatures called zooplankton are crucial in mitigating global warming by locking away vast amounts of carbon. These animals gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then migrate deep into the ocean to hibernate, burning the fat and releasing carbon dioxide far from the atmosphere. This seasonal migration process sequesters an estimated 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of 55 million cars. The study highlights the underappreciated but vital role these small organisms play in regulating the planet's climate.</p>

          <p>A same-sex pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are successfully raising a chick at Chester Zoo in the UK. Zookeepers gave the pair one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. This event highlights a positive development for the Humboldt penguin species, which is listed as vulnerable to extinction. The zoo is celebrating a successful breeding season with ten new chicks in total, contributing to the international breeding program designed to maintain a healthy and genetically diverse population in conservation zoos.</p>

          <p>Hamas has formally submitted a "positive response" to the latest Gaza ceasefire and hostage release proposal, indicating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official clarified that while Hamas accepts the general framework, it has requested key amendments. These include a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if permanent ceasefire talks fail, and that all humanitarian aid be distributed exclusively by the UN. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day truce with a staggered release of hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, but Israel's and the U.S.'s acceptance of the new conditions remains uncertain.</p>
