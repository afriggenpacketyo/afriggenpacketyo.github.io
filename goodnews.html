          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 12:10:35 EDT</div>

          <p>A New York judge has issued a landmark ruling, permitting the use of advanced whole genome sequencing DNA testing in the trial of Rex Heuermann, the alleged Gilgo Beach serial killer. This decision sets a significant legal precedent, marking the first time such cutting-edge forensic evidence could be admitted in a New York court, with potential implications for future cases across the state. Prosecutors view this as a major victory, as the technology has reportedly connected Heuermann, his ex-wife, and daughter to nine hair strands found on the remains of six victims. Despite defense challenges regarding the lab's licensing and the method's accuracy for degraded samples, the court's decision underscores the evolving role of sophisticated DNA analysis in complex criminal investigations, potentially reshaping how cold cases are pursued.</p>

This new functionality allows viewers to select start and end points for video segments, saving them to their "My Netflix" tab for easy rewatching or sharing. The update coincides with the release of the second part of "Wednesday" season 2, aiming to capitalize on viral content creation, similar to the immense popularity of Wednesday's dance scene from the first season. This move is part of Netflix's broader strategy to revamp its brand, including a redesigned homepage and a TikTok-like vertical video feed, following a period of stagnation.</p>

          <p>BBC economics editor Faisal Islam provides an analytical perspective on UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves's challenging path leading up to the November 26 Budget. The article emphasizes Reeves's dual ambition to raise funds for public services and implement structural reforms for economic growth, while asserting her authority amid recent personnel changes in Downing Street. Islam notes Reeves's dismissal of the "£50bn black hole" figure and her criticism of tax speculation, highlighting potential tensions with the Office for Budget Responsibility. The piece suggests a difficult period ahead for the chancellor, balancing fiscal rules, potential spending cuts, and the impact of bond markets.</p>

          <p>Former Senator John E. Sununu is reportedly considering a bid for the U.S. Senate in New Hampshire's 2026 midterm elections, attracting attention from top national Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader John Thune. This development comes after his brother, former Governor Chris Sununu, decided against a Senate run earlier this year. Republicans are hopeful to flip the seat, left open by retiring Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen, to expand their Senate majority. The article notes the competitive and expensive nature of the race, with other Republicans already in the field, and highlights the broader strategic importance of the New Hampshire seat in the upcoming elections.</p>

          <p>England international Grace Clinton, a midfielder for Manchester United, is reportedly close to a move to rival club Manchester City before the transfer deadline. With only a year left on her contract and no renewal agreed, the 22-year-old has attracted significant interest. This potential transfer involves England midfielder Jess Park moving in the opposite direction, with United viewing Park as a high-quality replacement. The article notes United's desire to cash in on Clinton rather than lose her for free next year, following previous departures of key players after contract expirations.</p>

The article explains that smart devices, like internet-connected TVs, can be significant culprits, consuming up to 40 times more energy in standby mode than regular televisions.

The FBI explicitly warns against using its data for city rankings due to numerous influencing variables like population density and economic conditions.

This article compares the affordability of Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, considering interest rates, repayment terms, and fees. While HELOCs currently offer slightly lower variable rates, home equity loans provide fixed rates and predictable payments. Experts note that a potential Federal Reserve rate cut could make HELOCs more attractive, but warn of payment increases if rates tick up.
