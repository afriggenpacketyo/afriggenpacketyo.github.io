          <h2>Taiwan's National Palace Museum Faces Tourist Decline Amidst Cross-Strait Tensions</h2>

          <p>The National Palace Museum in Taipei is experiencing a significant drop in visitors due to strained relations between Taiwan and Beijing. The museum, which houses treasures evacuated from mainland China, saw a record high of 6.14 million visitors in 2016, including 3.32 million from mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau. However, in 2024, only 50,000 visitors came from these regions, leading to a total of 2.87 million visitors for the year, with South Korea and Japan being the largest overseas groups. Despite this decline, the museum's director remains committed to reaching a target of 3.5 million visitors in 2025.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to curb the rise of the Hong Kong dollar, which had exceeded its trading band against the US dollar due to increased capital inflow. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion in its first market intervention in two years. This action comes before the US Federal Reserve's meeting, where interest rate cuts are expected. Bankers anticipate similar interventions if the US lowers interest rates, potentially drawing more capital into Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is implementing administrative reforms to reduce government spending, modernize the state, and boost economic growth. Spearheaded by new party chief To Lam, the reforms involve merging ministries, closing state-run media outlets, and cutting approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. The changes also include reducing the number of provinces and municipalities. Analysts suggest these reforms are intended to address dysfunction created by the anti-corruption campaign and to consolidate political power ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress in 2026.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, designed to bolster the country's private economy, which is set to come into force on May 20. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures. Observers and entrepreneurs are closely following the implementation of the law to determine whether the measure has teeth. Of particular interest is how the law will impact the ability of firms to take local-level governments to court, and how it will protect the private sector from fines.</p>
