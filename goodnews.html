          <h2>Amber Heat Health Alert Issued Across England as Temperatures Rise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 06:16:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An amber heat health alert has been issued across England as temperatures are expected to exceed 30C, posing risks to health and social care services. The UK Health Security Agency warns of likely impacts on the health service, including increased demand and difficulties managing medicines. There is a concern for internal temperatures in care settings exceeding recommended thresholds, and a possible rise in deaths, particularly among those aged 65 or over or with health conditions. The rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe. This alert system focuses on health risks and uses four levels of warning.</p>

          <p>China's embassy in Israel announced it will begin evacuating its citizens via the Egyptian border starting Friday, following the safe evacuation of hundreds from Israel and 1,600 from Iran. The decision comes after discussions between the Chinese and Egyptian foreign ministers. Evacuees must possess valid Chinese passports or identification, travel documents from Hong Kong or Macau, or a mainland-issued travel permit for Taiwan residents. Israel and Iran have been engaged in an air war for seven days, with missiles impacting strategic and residential areas since Israel's preemptive strike on Iran last Friday.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the House of Representatives for the time being, ensuring that elections for both chambers of parliament will not be held simultaneously in July. This decision came as opposition leader Yoshihiko Noda stated he would not submit a no-confidence motion against Ishiba's Cabinet, aiming to prevent delays on crucial political matters. Ishiba expressed readiness to dissolve the lower house if the opposition submitted a no-confidence motion, but some parties were hesitant due to being unprepared for a general election. Amidst the conflict between Israel and Iran, analysts anticipate rising crude oil prices, which would negatively impact Japan, while U.S. tariffs weigh on the country's export-driven economy.</p>

          <p>President Trump is downplaying concerns about division within his MAGA base regarding potential military action against Iran, stating his supporters are more in love with him than ever. This comes amid escalating tensions between Israel and Iran. While some prominent MAGA figures argue against US military involvement, citing Trump's America First policy, others support action to prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Vice President JD Vance defended Trump, assuring that the president is only interested in using American military to accomplish the American people‚Äôs goals. The debate highlights the shift in the Republican Party under Trump's leadership regarding foreign military engagements.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, is being observed with most businesses remaining open, though some exceptions exist. Banks and the stock market will be closed, while retail locations like Walmart, Target, and Costco will operate under normal hours. The U.S. Postal Service will be closed, but UPS and FedEx will maintain regular delivery services. Juneteenth commemorates the day in 1865 when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom, marking the end of the Civil War. Remembering to check local store hours is important before heading out, as they may vary.</p>

          <p>Pasadena's Rose Bowl will replace its traditional Fourth of July fireworks show with a drone show, marking a significant change for the venue. The move comes amid concerns about fireworks causing unhealthful air, with the South Coast Air Quality Management District noting that pollution levels of fine particles soar on July 4 and 5. Unlike the fireworks show, the drone show will not be visible from outside the Rose Bowl area, and there will be no soccer match this year. Other parts of California, like San Diego and San Francisco, will continue with fireworks shows, while Long Beach may discontinue its fireworks display in favor of drones in the future.</p>

          <p>This commentary draws a parallel between Juneteenth and the current immigration raids, emphasizing the importance of legal empowerment. It argues that law is not just for lawyers but should be understood and used by the people to protect their rights. Examples are given of communities organizing to defend immigrants and federal workers learning administrative law. The author suggests that legal empowerment can address the root causes of authoritarianism and build trust in institutions. The law protects our rights as individuals, but learning and using law on your own can be intimidating, especially under a government that is hostile toward basic rights.</p>
