          <p>The family of a man who allegedly threatened a mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is being credited with preventing a potential tragedy. After seeing 49-year-old Billy Joe Cagle live-streaming his intentions, his family immediately alerted the police, citing his struggles with mental health. Authorities were able to locate and arrest Cagle at the airport, where they discovered an AR-15-style rifle in his truck. Atlanta's mayor praised the family's quick action, emphasizing that the "See Something, Say Something" principle worked to avert a crisis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A high court in Colombia has overturned the witness tampering conviction of former President Álvaro Uribe, who had previously been sentenced to house arrest. The court ruled that the charges of bribery in a criminal proceeding were not proven "beyond a reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evidence evaluation in the initial conviction. Uribe, who served from 2002 to 2010, was accused of bribing former paramilitary members to lie about his alleged connections to their groups. The acquittal marks a significant turn in a politically charged case that has strained relations between Colombia and the United States.</p>

          <p>The opportunity to open certificate of deposit (CD) accounts with high interest rates is diminishing as the Federal Reserve continues to cut rates. While rates are lower than in previous years, they remain competitive compared to traditional savings accounts, offering a secure way to lock in returns. Financial experts suggest that with further rate cuts anticipated, savers looking to capitalize on current CD rates should act promptly. The article notes that it could be years before rates reach these levels again, making now a critical time for those considering this type of savings vehicle. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is reviewing "strategic alternatives," including a potential sale of the entire company, after receiving unsolicited interest from multiple parties. This move comes just months after the media giant revealed plans to split into two separate companies by mid-2026. The board will now evaluate various options, which could include proceeding with the planned separation, selling the whole company, or pursuing separate transactions for its Warner Bros. and Discovery Global businesses. The news caused the company's stock to jump, fueling speculation on Wall Street about a major industry consolidation.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially launched ChatGPT Atlas, a new web browser built around its generative AI technology, positioning it as a direct competitor to Google Chrome. The browser integrates ChatGPT into the user experience, allowing for seamless interaction like summarizing pages and completing tasks via a companion sidebar. CEO Sam Altman stated the launch represents a "once-a-decade opportunity to rethink what a browser can be about," highlighting features like memory for personalization and an "agent mode" for autonomous actions. The announcement immediately impacted the market, causing shares of Google's parent company, Alphabet, to decline.</p>

          <p>Strong quarterly earnings from aerospace firm RTX Corp. are seen as a positive indicator for Honeywell's aerospace division, a key business segment for the company. The robust demand and significant backlog reported by RTX suggest a healthy market, which could benefit Honeywell ahead of its own earnings report and planned corporate split. In contrast, the CNBC Investing Club is downgrading its rating on Texas Roadhouse stock. The decision stems from concerns over persistently high beef prices, which continue to pressure the restaurant chain's profit margins despite a recent rally in its share price.

          <p>The current controversy over President Trump's new ballroom is the latest in a long history of renovations at the White House. The building has been continuously modified by its occupants to suit their needs and tastes. Past major projects include Theodore Roosevelt's 1902 addition of the West Wing and Harry Truman's complete gutting and restructuring of the interior in the early 1950s, which added a bowling alley. Other notable changes, such as Franklin D. Roosevelt's indoor swimming pool and Jacqueline Kennedy's historical restoration, show that presidents have long left their personal mark on the executive mansion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Qualifying for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which can eliminate unsecured debts, is primarily determined by an individual's income relative to their state's median for their household size. If an applicant's income is below this median, they typically pass the "means test" automatically. However, those with income above the median may still qualify after a more detailed calculation that subtracts allowable living expenses to determine disposable income. For individuals who do not qualify, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement programs, or debt management plans offer other paths to financial relief without the same long-term credit impact.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels are expected to hire former player Kurt Suzuki as their next manager, according to multiple reports. Suzuki, who concluded his 16-year playing career with the Angels in 2022, has since worked as a special assistant to the team's general manager. He will become the fifth manager to lead the team since 2018, replacing Ron Washington, who missed much of the 2025 season due to health issues. The move comes as the organization seeks to reverse a decade of losing seasons and rebuild after a franchise-worst record in 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Using weighted vests to intensify workouts can offer benefits like increased calorie burn and improved cardiovascular workload, but it also comes with risks. According to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor before using them, as it acts like a mini stress test on the heart. While some believe they improve bone health, studies are inconclusive. Proper fit is crucial to avoid stress on joints, and users should start with a light weight—around 5% of their body weight—to prevent injury and avoid being thrown off balance.</p>

The EU's trade chief described the export licensing requirements as "unjustified and harmful," as these materials are critical for Europe's high-tech and green industries. The talks will also aim to de-escalate tensions surrounding the Dutch government's effective takeover of the Chinese-owned chipmaker Nexperia due to national security concerns.

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, called Mango House, has developed a financially sustainable model by primarily serving refugee and immigrant patients on Medicaid. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic uses a walk-in system, in-house pharmacy, and other efficiencies to see a high volume of patients while keeping costs low and staff well-paid. By focusing almost exclusively on Medicaid, the clinic has mastered its billing system and avoids the complexities of private insurance. This unique approach challenges the conventional wisdom that Medicaid is an unprofitable payer and offers a potential model for serving low-income communities effectively.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles judge has ruled that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, along with Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram head Adam Mosseri, must testify in person at an upcoming trial. The lawsuit alleges that social media companies knowingly designed addictive features that cause mental health harm to younger users. The judge denied motions from the companies to prevent the CEOs from taking the stand, stating their testimony is "uniquely relevant" to establishing potential negligence. This ruling marks a significant development in the wave of litigation holding tech giants accountable for the impact of their platforms on children's well-being.</p>
