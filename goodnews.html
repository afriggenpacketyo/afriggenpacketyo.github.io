          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that the central bank is likely to implement two more interest rate cuts this year, emphasizing that a significant slowdown in hiring poses increasing risks to the US economy. Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics, Powell noted that while inflation remains elevated due to tariffs, broader inflationary pressures are absent. He also suggested the Fed might soon cease shrinking its balance sheet. Powell defended past asset purchases during the pandemic, acknowledging that "with the clarity of hindsight, we could have—and perhaps should have—stopped asset purchases sooner."</p>

          <h2>Aviation Experts Reassure Public on Air Travel Safety Amidst Government Shutdown</h2>

          <p>Despite flight delays caused by air traffic controller shortages during the government shutdown, aviation experts affirm that air travel remains safe. Controllers and TSA officers are working without pay, leading to increased sick calls and longer wait times, but the FAA is implementing measures like slowing traffic to prioritize safety. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy acknowledged the "incredibly frustrated" controllers and the ripple effect of staffing issues. While inconvenient, experts emphasize that pilots ultimately determine flight safety, and airline pilots, who are not federal employees, would not take off if conditions were unsafe.</p>

          <p>The International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicts the UK will be the second-fastest-growing G7 economy in 2025, outperforming most rivals except the US, with modest growth rates of 1.3%. However, the IMF also forecasts the UK will face the highest inflation among G7 nations this year and next, driven by rising energy and utility bills. Chancellor Rachel Reeves acknowledged the economy feels "stuck" but aims to reassure investors. The IMF's global outlook notes the impact of US tariffs and a weakened dollar, but suggests the worst consequences of a global trade war have been tempered.</p>
