          <p>Artificial intelligence company OpenAI is significantly increasing the size of its secondary share sale, offering eligible current and former employees the chance to sell stock worth approximately $10.3 billion. This is a substantial increase from the initial target of $6 billion and values the company at $500 billion, a notable rise from its previous $300 billion valuation. The transaction, set to close in October, includes participation from major investors like SoftBank and Thrive Capital. This move provides liquidity for employees, reducing pressure for an immediate public offering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funding for Harvard University was illegal. The court determined the action was retaliatory, stemming from the university's refusal to comply with administration demands for policy changes related to governance and diversity programs. Judge Allison Burroughs noted that the administration's sudden focus on antisemitism as a pretext for the freeze was arbitrary, as the decision was made before any investigation into the issue on campus. The ruling vacates the funding freeze and bars its enforcement.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached in North Carolina that prevents approximately 98,000 voters from being removed from the rolls, settling a lawsuit filed by the Department of Justice. The DOJ had sought to disqualify voters who registered without providing a driver's license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Following intervention by the Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups, a consent order was proposed. This agreement allows the affected voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue without disenfranchisement.</p>

However, its third-quarter revenue forecast, while still indicating strong growth, was perceived as a potential slowdown by investors.

          <p>Netflix is updating its "Moments" feature on mobile devices to give users more creative control over sharing content. The enhancement allows viewers to select specific start and end points for clips from shows and movies, which can then be saved and shared. This update, coinciding with the new season of the popular series "Wednesday," aims to capitalize on the viral potential of key scenes. The move is part of Netflix's broader strategy to create a more dynamic and engaging mobile experience, alongside other recent initiatives like a redesigned homepage and a password-sharing crackdown.</p>

          <p>Canadian tennis player Felix Auger-Aliassime has reached the US Open semifinals for the first time since 2021 after a hard-fought victory over Australia's Alex de Minaur.

The match was characterized by nerves and numerous errors from both players, with a combined total of 93 unforced errors. For de Minaur, this marks his sixth Grand Slam quarter-final appearance without advancing to the next stage, continuing a frustrating pattern in major tournaments.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares declined by 4% in after-hours trading despite the company reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The company's revenue grew by 10% year-over-year to $10.24 billion, but its guidance for the upcoming third quarter fell slightly short of forecasts, signaling ongoing concerns about meager growth. Salesforce has struggled to benefit from the AI boom in the same way as its tech peers, and its stock has underperformed this year. The company is now looking to its Agentforce AI software to help reinvigorate its performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>American Eagle Outfitters saw its stock soar over 20% after reporting fiscal second-quarter earnings that significantly beat Wall Street expectations. The company credited its success to strong product offerings and highly effective marketing campaigns, particularly its partnership with actress Sydney Sweeney, which it called its "best" to date. Despite some controversy, the campaign, along with another featuring Travis Kelce, drove a notable increase in customer acquisition and positive sales trends. The retailer also re-issued a positive full-year guidance, anticipating comparable sales to be approximately flat, an improvement on previous forecasts.</p>

          <p>Researchers in Morocco have discovered more complete remains of Spicomellus, an ankylosaur from over 165 million years ago, revealing a creature with extraordinary body armor. The dinosaur, roughly the size of a small car, possessed long neck spikes, large spikes over its hips, and a feature never seen before: ribs with spikes fused directly to the bone. This discovery challenges previous understandings of ankylosaur evolution, suggesting they developed complex armor much earlier than believed. Scientists speculate the elaborate spikes were used for both defense against predators and for attracting mates.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision, a judge has ruled that advanced DNA testing evidence can be used in the trial of accused Gilgo Beach serial killer Rex Heuermann. This is the first time such cutting-edge forensic technology, which can analyze degraded and rootless hair samples, will be admissible in a New York State court. Prosecutors used the method to link Heuermann and his family members to hair strands found on the remains of multiple victims. The defense immediately challenged the ruling, arguing the lab is not licensed in New York, but the decision is seen as a major victory for the prosecution.</p>

While the odds of winning remain astronomical at 1 in 292.2 million, the final payout varies significantly by state. Winners in states with no income tax on lottery prizes, such as Florida and Texas, would receive the largest share. Conversely, high-tax states like New York would see the smallest after-tax payout.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury has issued a preliminary list of 68 occupations that will be eligible for President Trump's "no tax on tips" deduction. This new provision, part of a recent tax bill, allows qualifying workers to deduct up to $25,000 in tip income annually from 2025 through 2028. The list is expected to be finalized after a public comment period and aims to provide clarity on who qualifies for the tax break, which was a key campaign promise. The deduction is designed to reduce the taxable income for workers in many service industries, though it phases out for higher earners. (not investment advice)</p>
