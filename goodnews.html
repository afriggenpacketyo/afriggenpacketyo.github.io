          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in injuries to nineteen people, with four in serious condition. The ship's masts clipped the bridge as it passed underneath, causing parts of the masts to fall onto the deck. Emergency services responded to the scene, and the bridge did not sustain any damage according to the mayor of New York. The Mexican Navy is investigating the incident, which occurred during a goodwill visit by the ship to New York City. </p>

          <p>The Justice Secretary is reportedly developing plans to expand unpaid work programs for convicted criminals, potentially involving them in tasks such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. The proposal aims to make punishment more than just a "slap on the wrist," with offenders working for free and their earnings going to a fund for victim's groups. The Justice Secretary describes herself as a "card-carrying member" of her party's "law and order wing", emphasizing the importance of tough community orders. </p>

The vaccine is fully approved only for adults 65 and older, or those 12 to 64 with health conditions increasing their risk from COVID-19. This decision reflects skepticism about vaccines from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other officials, and the FDA is requiring additional trials. Novavax originally showed its vaccine was safe and effective in a clinical trial, and the FDA had been on track to grant full approval without restrictions. </p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th out of 26, despite strong vocals and praise from former winner Conchita Wurst. The song, a mix of musical styles, was deemed too busy and lacked consistency, hindering its connection with viewers. While the staging was fun, it lacked the impact of other performances. Despite the disappointing result, the UK's performance laid a good foundation with strong vocals, engaging staging, and a positive representation of the country. </p>

          <p>A photographer has spent a decade capturing the diversity and beauty of Britain's back garden wildlife. The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found "under our noses", said Andrew Fusek Peters. Hundreds of his images feature in a new book. Mr Fusek Peters started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, perfecting a technique to "make time stop" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight. </p>
