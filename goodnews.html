          <p>Amidst a truce between India and Pakistan following cross-border strikes, China faces a challenging balancing act in the region. China prioritizes de-escalation to protect its geopolitical and economic interests in South Asia, even as its public expresses support for Pakistan. The Chinese Foreign Ministry has urged restraint, recognizing that its own border security with India depends on regional stability. A brewing crisis involves India's suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, potentially leading to hydrological warfare and regional destabilization. Despite historical tensions, China and India share common ground as Brics members, cooperating on issues like Russia's war with Ukraine.</p>

Newsom stated that allowing people to die on the streets is not compassionate and that it is time to reclaim streets and sidewalks. The effort is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding.</p>

          <p>President Trump appointed Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, as acting librarian of Congress, leading to a staff revolt. Library staff refused access to two Justice Department officials selected by Blanche for key roles, citing the need for congressional input. The officials, designated for top positions in the U.S. Copyright Office and as deputy librarian, were denied entry, leading to a standoff. Robert Newlen, the principal deputy librarian, is recognized as acting librarian until Congress provides direction. Representative Joseph D. Morelle criticized the move as an executive branch power grab and called for an investigation into unauthorized access to congressional data.</p>

Police are also examining a vehicle fire on May 8 and a fire at a property entrance in Islington on May 11 to determine if they are linked to the Starmer incident.

          <p>Zillow reports that renters now need at least $80,000 annually to comfortably afford the typical apartment rental, a significant increase from $60,000 in 2020. In major metropolitan areas like Boston, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, San Diego, San Francisco, and San Jose, renters need to earn $100,000 or more. New York City tops the list, requiring an annual income of roughly $135,000 to comfortably afford rent. The national housing supply shortage is a key factor driving up rents, with wage growth lagging behind. Experts suggest expanding programs like the Low Income Housing Tax Credit to increase affordable housing supply.</p>

          <p>House Republicans acknowledge they do not anticipate receiving a full analysis from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) before marking up legislation proposing massive changes to Medicaid. Despite this, a letter from the CBO confirms that the panel's recommendations would meet its target of $880 billion in savings over the next decade. President Trump has urged Republicans to unify around the bill, citing prescription drug cuts and tariff money as factors to consider. Democrats highlight prior CBO analyses suggesting millions could lose Medicaid insurance by 2034, while Republicans insist their policy revisions are not fully encompassed in those figures.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has suspended all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS), a flesh-eating parasitic fly.

Eradication efforts, such as releasing sterile flies, are underway.

          <p>The U.S. and China reached a temporary truce in their trade war, reducing tariffs in a "90-day pause," but this move highlights the contradictions in Trump's trade strategy. While significant tariffs risk economic damage, modest tariffs may not be impactful enough to rebalance the global trading order. The current global trading order is entrenched, making it difficult to dislodge without severe economic pain. Trump's team appears to be seeking a "Goldilocks tariff level," but this may be impossible to achieve. These tariffs are not expected to restore manufacturing in the U.S. or reduce dependence on China.</p>

          <p>China and the United States agreed to reduce tariffs drastically for 90 days as they continue to negotiate a more permanent trade deal, providing welcome news for investors. The temporary truce will see the United States lower tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, and China reduce its import duties on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. However, supply shortages and price increases on Chinese products may still affect American consumers due to weeks of uncertainty. Shipping costs are expected to increase as manufacturers attempt to make up for lost time. The 90-day deadline could fuel further market volatility.</p>

          <p>Homeowners may find a home equity line of credit (HELOC) a viable financing option in 2025, especially for home projects, given the tax-deductible interest. HELOCs have variable interest rates, requiring borrowers to calculate future repayment costs tied to available rates. HELOCs can be the cheapest home equity borrowing option compared to home equity loans, cash-out refinances, reverse mortgages, personal loans, and credit cards. However, it's crucial to consider individual financial health before using a HELOC, as it uses the home as collateral, and failure to repay could result in foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then roll back tariffs on Chinese products highlights the limitations of his aggressive trade approach. The tariffs caused significant trade disruptions, leading companies to reroute business and Chinese factories to shutter. The recent agreement reduces tariffs, but the absence of other concessions from China raises doubts about the worth of the disruptions. Trump's approach of manufacturing trade crises to extract quick concessions faces challenges against an economic power with similar might. The U.S. has determined that it does not want to decouple its economy from China.</p>

          <p>Stocks surged higher after the United States and China agreed to temporarily lower tariffs on each other, marking a significant step back in the trade war. The S&P 500 gained 3.3 percent, its best day since April 9. The United States would reduce the tariff on Chinese imports to 30 percent from its current 145 percent, while China would lower its import duty on American goods to 10 percent from 125 percent. The recovery in markets comes after a period of volatility spurred by presidential announcements about trade policy. However, some economists warn that trade policies could reignite inflation.</p>
