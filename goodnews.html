          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a century-old shipwreck off its coast as a nursery to reintroduce rare flat oysters to the North Sea. Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the vessel's hull, hoping to re-establish reefs that purify water and support broader marine biodiversity. These oyster reefs, once abundant, were decimated by overfishing and disease. The protected status of the shipwreck as cultural heritage prevents fishing, making it an ideal location for this marine restoration effort.</p>

          <p>Peaches are being recognized by health experts for their significant benefits, particularly during the summer. Composed of about 89% water, they provide excellent hydration and contain essential electrolytes like potassium, which supports heart health and muscle function. The fruit is also rich in fiber, vitamin C, and antioxidants such as flavonoids and carotenoids, which can aid digestion, boost immunity, and protect against inflammation. Pairing peaches with protein or healthy fats can help stabilize blood sugar levels due to their natural sugar content.</p>

          <p>José Adolfo Macías Villamar, the infamous leader of the "Los Choneros" gang known as "Fito," has been extradited from Ecuador to the United States. This marks the first direct extradition of an Ecuadorian national to the U.S. from their home country. Macías, who had previously escaped prison, faces federal charges in New York for international cocaine distribution and weapons smuggling. His gang is classified by the U.S. as a violent organization linked to Mexican cartels, responsible for significant violence and drug trafficking throughout the region.</p>

          <p>China is on course to achieve its goal of operating 50,000 kilometers of high-speed rail by the end of the year, according to its Minister of Transport. The country has already reached 48,000km, which constitutes over 70% of the world's total high-speed rail mileage. This extensive network now covers 97% of Chinese cities with populations exceeding 500,000. Officials attribute the record 2.24 billion passenger trips in the first half of 2025 to rising travel demand, improved service quality, and the enhanced connectivity provided by the expanding network.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a national inquiry into the violent 1984 confrontation between police and miners known as the "Battle of Orgreave." The event, one of the most contentious episodes of the year-long miners' strike, resulted in numerous injuries and the arrest of 95 miners, whose prosecutions later collapsed amid allegations of falsified police evidence. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the inquiry aims to address unanswered questions that have persisted for 40 years. Campaigners, who have long sought justice, expressed cautious optimism about finally uncovering the truth.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Rugby Union has named Steve Tandy, formerly the defence coach for Scotland, as the new head coach for the Wales men's national team. The 45-year-old Welshman will take charge until at least the 2027 World Cup, succeeding Warren Gatland. Tandy faces the significant challenge of rebuilding a team that has struggled recently, briefly falling to a record-low 14th in world rankings. His appointment is seen as a long-term strategic move by the WRU to bring stability and return the team to competitive form on the world stage.</p>

          <p>Ryanair is contemplating an increase to the bonus it pays gate staff for intercepting passengers with oversized luggage, a move aimed at enforcing baggage rules more strictly. Currently, staff receive about €1.50 per bag, and CEO Michael O'Leary stated the incentive could be raised to help "eliminate the scourge" of excess baggage, which causes boarding delays. The discussion comes as the budget airline also navigates potential impacts from the ongoing U.S.-EU trade dispute, though its CFO expressed hope that a 1979 civil aviation agreement would exempt aircraft from new tariffs.</p>

          <p>An independent review of England and Wales' water sector has recommended a major overhaul, including the dissolution of the economic regulator, Ofwat. The report, led by Sir Jon Cunliffe, concluded that government, companies, and regulators were all to blame for the current state of the industry, marked by sewage spills and rising bills. It proposes creating a single, unified regulator for water in both England and Wales. The review also calls for reforming how companies self-monitor pollution and for giving the regulator more control over company ownership.</p>

          <p>Kraft Heinz is reportedly considering a major strategic shift by spinning off a significant portion of its grocery business, including legacy brands like Velveeta and Oscar Mayer. This move would effectively undo the 2015 mega-merger, creating a separate entity potentially valued at up to $20 billion. The company's stock has struggled for years as consumers move away from some processed foods. The potential split would separate slower-growing Kraft products from more internationally viable brands like Heinz ketchup, in an effort to unlock shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A decades-old effort to make housing more affordable by reforming manufactured home regulations may finally be gaining traction in Congress. Advocates are pushing to eliminate a 1974 rule requiring these homes to be built on a "permanent chassis," a steel frame that adds cost and design constraints while serving little modern purpose. Removing this five-word mandate could make factory-built homes cheaper, more attractive, and easier to integrate into neighborhoods. As the housing crisis intensifies, this simple legislative fix is being reconsidered as a practical way to increase housing supply.</p>
