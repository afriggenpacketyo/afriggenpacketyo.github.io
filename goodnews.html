          <p>A nine-year-old springer spaniel named Maple is using her specialized detection skills to help scientists at Michigan State University combat a threat to honeybees. After retiring from a career sniffing out human remains for law enforcement, Maple was trained to identify American foulbrood, a deadly bacterial disease that kills honeybee larvae and can devastate entire colonies. Wearing a custom protective bee suit, Maple's work is crucial for early diagnosis and management of the disease, contributing to efforts to protect vital pollinator populations that are in decline globally.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Defends LA28 Olympics Amidst Political Criticism</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that Los Angeles should not withdraw from hosting the 2028 Olympic Games, despite criticism of LA28 Chairman Casey Wasserman's recent appearance with President Trump. The author frames Wasserman's engagement with the administration as a necessary part of his job to ensure the event's success, rising above partisan politics for the good of the city. The article invokes the legacy of the city's previous successful Olympics in 1932 and 1984, contending that this history is too meaningful to abandon over political disagreements or financial fears.</p>

          <p>According to a report from UBS, global investors are increasingly directing capital into China's $25 trillion domestic bond market as they seek alternatives to U.S. dollar-denominated assets. This trend, driven by institutional investors like central banks and pension funds, is seen as part of a broader 'de-dollarisation' movement. Foreign holdings in yuan-denominated bonds have rebounded significantly since a low in March 2023, supported by simplified investment procedures from Beijing regulators and the inclusion of Chinese bonds in major global indices.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has indicated he is open to a deal that would permit Nvidia to sell a less powerful version of its advanced Blackwell AI chip to China. This move follows lobbying from Nvidia's CEO, who argues that selling U.S. chips to China makes Chinese firms dependent on American technology, preventing domestic competitors like Huawei from filling the void. The potential deal would involve reducing the chip's performance by 30-50% and comes after Nvidia agreed to pay the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from other chip sales to China.

          <p>The Farmers' Almanac has released its long-range forecast for the 2025-2026 winter, predicting a return to an 'old-fashioned' season with 'dramatic swings and widespread wintry weather.' The theme for the season is 'Chill, Snow, Repeat,' with most of the country expected to experience cold or very cold temperatures. For the Southeast, including Tennessee, the almanac predicts average winter temperatures but with numerous wet periods. The publication uses a proprietary formula based on factors like solar patterns and historical data to make its popular, though often debated, predictions.</p>

          <p>The Swiss sportswear company On has raised its full-year revenue guidance after reporting a 32% increase in second-quarter sales, beating Wall Street estimates. The popular sneaker brand, which has been gaining market share from competitors, now expects higher annual sales and an improved gross margin. This strong performance comes despite the company raising prices to offset new U.S. tariffs on goods imported from Vietnam, where it sources about 90% of its products. The company stated it has not seen a slowdown in consumer demand following the price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will be ending its dial-up internet service, a technology synonymous with the early days of the web in the 1990s. The service, known for its distinctive series of beeps and static noises during connection, will cease operations on September 30. Dial-up played a crucial role in closing the 'digital divide' by using existing phone lines, and AOL's free trial CDs became a ubiquitous part of American culture. While largely replaced by broadband, a very small percentage of households in rural areas still relied on the service.</p>
