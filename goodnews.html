        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House did not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations, a power not superseded by the president's remit to safeguard the economy. The Trump administration has appealed the ruling, which stems from a lawsuit brought by small businesses importing goods. The court's decision has been welcomed by global markets, with Asian stock markets and US stock futures rising following the announcement. </p>
