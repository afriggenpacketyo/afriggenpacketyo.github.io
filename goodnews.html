          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 20:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global Energy Monitor reports that China is leading in repurposing decommissioned coal mines into solar power projects, with 90 former mines operating as solar facilities and additional projects planned. This trend aims to advance clean energy while potentially mitigating the surplus of solar panels produced by Chinese manufacturers. Outside of China, several countries are also pursuing similar conversion projects, though most are in early stages. These projects offer a chance to combine land restoration, job creation, and clean energy deployment, transforming 'abandoning' into 'rebuilding' in a symbolic energy transition.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity on passport applications and includes the option to select "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a previous policy under the Biden administration that allowed for Americans to self-select their gender on their passport application. The ACLU, representing transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued the policy was discriminatory.</p>

          <p>Texas has stopped providing new funding for the construction of a U.S.-Mexico border wall, shifting from its previous multibillion-dollar commitment. Governor Greg Abbott's office cited President Trump's efforts to curb immigration as the reason for the adjustment, allowing the state to reallocate resources. The state has completed 65 miles of the wall, while the Texas border with Mexico spans approximately 1,200 miles. Remaining funds will support ongoing work through 2026 and be directed to the Texas Department of Safety and the Texas National Guard for border security efforts.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill includes requirements for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. The legislation grants authority to the Treasury Secretary, who projects the U.S. stablecoin market could grow significantly. While the bill faces hurdles in the House, its passage marks a milestone for the crypto industry and President Trump's digital asset ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The musical ‚ÄúReal Women Have Curves‚Äù will close its run on Broadway on June 29, less than two months after its official debut. Despite receiving positive reviews, the show struggled to compete at the box office, grossing below the expected amount for a large-scale Broadway musical. The musical, adapted from Josefina L√≥pez‚Äôs play and the 2002 HBO film, centers on Ana Garc√≠a, a driven teen with educational aspirations, who often bumps heads with her traditional and menopausal mother, Carmen. The story takes place inside a garment factory in the immigrant neighborhood of Boyle Heights.</p>
