        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate temporary legal protections for over one million people from Haiti and Venezuela. U.S. District Judge Edward Chen deemed Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's actions "arbitrary and capricious," arguing that sending these individuals back to their home countries would expose them to dangerous conditions. This ruling ensures that hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans and Haitians can retain their right to live and work in the U.S., overturning a previous Supreme Court decision that had led to deportations and family separations. The government is expected to appeal this decision, continuing the legal battle over these humanitarian protections.</p>

          <p>Major tech companies like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are locked in an intense competition for top AI researchers and engineers, offering unprecedented multi-million dollar compensation packages. This "AI talent war" is driven by the soaring costs of building advanced AI models, which can run into billions of dollars, making high salaries for specialized talent a relatively small investment. The limited supply of highly skilled AI professionals, particularly those with experience in large language models, has dramatically inflated wages. This trend poses a significant challenge for startups and traditional industries unable to compete with Big Tech's financial resources, potentially creating a massive opportunity gap across sectors.</p>

Both players have dominated the recent major tournaments, splitting the last eight Grand Slam trophies, and their upcoming match will also determine the world No. 1 ranking.

While Beijing avoids promoting a Cold War-era communist international movement, these interactions are a crucial component of its diplomatic strategy, particularly through the Communist Party's International Department. This ministerial-level department has cultivated connections with over 600 parties globally, serving as a key channel for diplomatic engagement. Its increasing role underscores China's efforts to expand its influence and foster relationships beyond traditional state-level interactions, reflecting a nuanced approach to global foreign policy.</p>

          <p>Following his U.S. Open semi-final defeat to Carlos Alcaraz, 38-year-old Novak Djokovic expressed his desire to play a full Grand Slam season next year but acknowledged the increasing physical toll. Djokovic, who has scaled down his schedule to focus on majors, faces a significant challenge from younger rivals like Alcaraz and Jannik Sinner, who now dominate the men's game. He admitted that best-of-five matches are becoming "very difficult" and that his "level of fitness wasn't enough for Carlos." The article questions whether his body will allow him to continue competing at the highest level as he chases a record 25th major title.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's yuan has recently rallied, primarily driven by stronger guidance from its central bank rather than market forces, even as the US dollar index remains relatively steady. Analysts suggest this controlled strengthening aims to avoid harming the competitiveness of Chinese exporters, especially amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The US dollar has not significantly weakened despite Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell hinting at a September interest rate cut. This dynamic highlights China's strategic currency management to balance domestic economic stability with international trade considerations, while global bond markets face pressure from major economies issuing new government bonds.

          <p>This article explores a growing trend among young Chinese, who, facing a difficult job market and disillusionment with traditional career paths, are increasingly opting for a "simple life." One individual's experience of being laid off from publishing and then finding an unfulfilling sales-oriented role highlights the shift away from relentless work culture. The narrative suggests that for this generation, the fear of joblessness has diminished, replaced by a realization that personal well-being outweighs the pressures of a demanding and often unrewarding professional life. This movement reflects a broader societal introspection on values and priorities in contemporary China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Prince Hisahito, the first male royal to reach adulthood in 40 years, celebrated his coming-of-age rituals, but his milestone highlights the bleak outlook for the world's oldest monarchy. As second in line to the Chrysanthemum Throne, he may be the last male heir, sparking an urgent debate about reversing the 19th-century male-only succession policy. With only two male heirs younger than the current Emperor, and a dwindling Imperial Family, the issue reflects Japan's demographic challenges. Despite public support for female succession, the conservative government panel has stalled on reforms, placing the burden of the monarchy's future largely on Prince Hisahito.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has firmly stated his commitment to running for reelection, dismissing reports that Trump advisors sought to nominate him as ambassador to Saudi Arabia to clear the mayoral race.

          <p>At 66, retired accountant Kent Broussard has achieved his lifelong dream of playing tuba for the Louisiana State University Tiger Marching Band, becoming the oldest member by 41 years.
