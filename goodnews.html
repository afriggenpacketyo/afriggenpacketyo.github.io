          <p>Marcel Ophuls, the German-born filmmaker renowned for his myth-shattering war documentaries, particularly "The Sorrow and the Pity," has died at the age of 97. His landmark film challenged the notion of widespread French resistance to Nazi occupation during World War II, interviewing ordinary citizens to reveal complex truths about collaboration and resistance. The film, initially banned from French television, sparked controversy and critical acclaim, paving the way for revisionist historical accounts of wartime France. Ophuls continued to direct documentaries, including the Oscar-winning "H√¥tel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie," exploring themes of hypocrisy and collective guilt. The article reflects on Ophuls's life, his family's flight from Nazi Germany, and his complex relationship with France, where he became a naturalized citizen and made his most significant contributions to cinema.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is visiting Canada, a move seen as underscoring Canada's sovereignty amid past suggestions by U.S. President Trump about annexing the country. Prime Minister Mark Carney invited King Charles to deliver the speech from the throne, outlining the government's agenda. The visit emphasizes Canada's distinct national identity and constitutional monarchy, differentiating it from the United States. While Canadians are largely indifferent to the monarchy, Carney aims to highlight the differences between the two nations, although the new U.S. ambassador downplays the need for such messages.</p>

          <p>George Lucas is directly overseeing the final stages of his Museum of Narrative Art in Los Angeles after years of delays and leadership changes. The museum recently parted ways with its director and eliminated several positions, with Lucas stepping in as head of "content direction." The museum's mission is to explore how narrative art influences societies, but some cultural leaders question its focus and vision. Despite the lack of a clearly defined mission, the museum's unique architecture and "Star Wars" affiliation are expected to draw large crowds.</p>

          <p>Driven by skyrocketing electricity demand from artificial intelligence, Big Tech companies like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are increasingly investing in nuclear fission startups. These companies are attracted to fission's potential for stable, 24/7 power and new small modular reactor (SMR) designs that promise to be more efficient and safer than traditional nuclear plants. Companies such as Kairos Power, backed by Google, and Oklo, supported by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, are developing SMRs to meet the growing energy needs of data centers. This trend highlights the resurgence of nuclear power as a reliable and predictable energy source for the tech industry.</p>

The eruptive plume contained ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair, prompting warnings for residents and visitors to exercise caution.

          <p>Human sexuality is diverse, and no one chooses their sexual orientation, which develops during puberty through an interplay of biological and psychosocial factors. Sexual orientation is not hereditary, but hormones and chemicals in the body, such as pheromones, may play a role. Our sexual preference does not change as we age, and conversion therapy has been proven unsuccessful. It is important to have an unprejudiced debate about sexual diversity, especially in societies where sexual minorities are excluded and persecuted.</p>

          <p>Amanda Litman, co-founder of Run for Something, argues that the Democratic party's reliance on seniority is a significant weakness. She advocates for younger leaders who are willing to challenge incumbents and propose alternative ways to rebuild the government. Litman's organization recruits and trains progressives age 40 and under to run for office, aiming to dismantle the gerontocracy. She believes that open conversations about retirement and primaries are essential for the party's renewal and ability to effectively challenge the Trump administration.</p>
