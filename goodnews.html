          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals a link between state-level tax revenue and cancer outcomes. Researchers found that states with higher tax income had increased cancer screening rates and decreased cancer mortality rates. For each $1,000 increase in tax revenue per capita, the population saw increases in colorectal, breast, and cervical cancer screening rates. Among those with cancerous tumors, each $1,000 increase in tax revenue per capita was linked to decreased death rates among White patients. Optimism score is 70.</p>
