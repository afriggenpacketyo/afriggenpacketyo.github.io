          <p>Dong Yu, a key figure in drafting China's economic blueprints, explains that raising national income is the fundamental goal behind the country's five-year plans. In an exclusive interview, the executive vice-president of a Tsinghua University institute discusses the historical context and future direction of these plans, including the upcoming 15th iteration. He asserts that while early plans had mixed success, the strategy since China's reform and opening-up has consistently aimed to build a robust national economy and improve citizen prosperity. The focus remains on sustainable progress and sector development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch are expected to be part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, calling them "American patriots." The potential sale is driven by a 2024 law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. arm over national security concerns. The White House has suggested a deal is imminent, which would place control of the popular app's data and algorithm in American hands. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Center fielder Jacob Young of the Washington Nationals made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in defeating the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a remarkable juggling catch, kicking the ball with his foot to regain control after it was dislodged from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. These defensive heroics helped the Nationals secure a 3-2 victory, dealing a significant blow to the Mets' playoff aspirations in the tight National League wildcard race.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung stated he would accept a deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production as a realistic interim measure. In a BBC interview, Lee argued that halting the annual production of new weapons would be a feasible alternative to the currently stalled goal of complete denuclearization. He expressed hope that Trump and Kim could resume negotiations, citing their "degree of mutual trust." This pragmatic approach marks a shift in policy, aimed at reducing tensions on the Korean peninsula amid the growing alignment of North Korea with China and Russia.</p>

          <p>The third Sunday of the NFL season delivered several dramatic finishes, with multiple games decided by blocked field goals in the final moments. The Philadelphia Eagles secured a wild 33-26 victory over the Los Angeles Rams after blocking a game-winning field goal attempt and returning it for a touchdown as time expired. Similarly, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the New York Jets 29-27 after the Jets had taken a late lead on their own blocked field goal return, only for Tampa to win with a last-second kick. Other notable results included the Cleveland Browns' comeback win over the Green Bay Packers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has officially approved a £2.2 billion plan to build a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a project aimed at boosting economic growth. The expansion involves converting the airport's existing northern runway for regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000. While the airport and government champion the project for its potential to create jobs, it faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local campaigners concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impacts. Gatwick has agreed to stricter noise controls and public transport targets to mitigate some of these concerns.</p>

          <p>A school principal in Summersville, West Virginia, had a startling encounter with a black bear that was captured on security camera footage. The video shows Principal James Marsh unlocking a school dumpster, only to be surprised by a bear's snout emerging from under the lid. The principal quickly retreats as the bear climbs out and runs off in the opposite direction. The incident, in which no one was harmed, serves as a reminder of the increasing frequency of human-wildlife encounters as natural habitats shrink. Experts advise securing all food and trash to avoid attracting animals to populated areas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal secured a late 1-1 draw against Manchester City thanks to a 93rd-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli, in a result that benefits league leaders Liverpool most. The article analyzes Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's unusually defensive tactics, where he shifted to a 5-5-0 formation after taking an early lead. This strategy, which resulted in City's lowest-ever possession statistic under Guardiola, nearly succeeded but was undone at the last moment. The analysis suggests that while City was fatigued from a heavy schedule, both teams ultimately fell short in a match that was more of a "slugfest" than a display of fluid football.</p>
