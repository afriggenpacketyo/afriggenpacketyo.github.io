          <h2>Trump Administration's Tax Bill Offers 0% Capital Gains for Some Investors in 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 11:26:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many investors are unaware they qualify for 0% capital gains taxes on assets held over a year, a benefit potentially expanded by new deductions in President Trump's tax bill for 2025. Financial experts suggest this presents a "golden opportunity" to realize profits without a tax bill, particularly for older Americans who may receive additional tax breaks. While current rates remain, analysts predict a slight decline by year-end, prompting advice for savers to lock in high CD rates now or consider a CD ladder strategy to maximize returns. The article provides detailed insights into navigating these tax and market conditions for optimal financial planning and emphasizes strategic timing for investment decisions.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts generally recommend setting thermostats a few degrees higher when away to balance energy efficiency, comfort, and humidity control, rather than turning the unit completely off. While turning AC off for long periods can save money, it risks mold in humid climates and increased wear on the system when restarting, as it strains to recool a warm house. Factors like climate, home insulation, and AC unit type influence the optimal approach, with smart thermostats offering automated savings. Simple measures like closing blinds, opening windows at night, and using ceiling fans also significantly contribute to keeping homes cool and reducing electricity costs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed the Department of Justice's unprecedented lawsuit against the entire Maryland federal court bench, which challenged a standing order temporarily freezing deportations for migrants filing habeas petitions. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen ruled that the DOJ's approach, suing a co-equal branch of government, went against legal precedent and the rule of law. The Trump administration argued the Maryland court exceeded its authority, but Cullen suggested typical legal avenues like appealing specific decisions or petitioning the judicial council were more appropriate. This decision upholds judicial independence and highlights tensions between the executive and judicial branches.</p>

          <h2>CD Account Interest Rate Forecast for Fall 2025 Amid Economic Uncertainty</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Savers are questioning the future of CD account interest rates, currently in the 4% to 4.5% range, amidst economic uncertainty. Financial experts largely anticipate rates to decline by late September into the fourth quarter, potentially falling 25 to 50 basis points, assuming the Federal Reserve restarts its rate-cutting cycle. However, rates could remain stable if the job market holds strong and inflation persists, or even rise if inflation significantly re-accelerates alongside robust job growth. Experts advise maximizing returns by securing current high rates, using a CD ladder strategy, and avoiding long-term commitments to navigate this unpredictable environment effectively.

          <p>EchoStar's stock surged over 75% after AT&T agreed to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from the telecom company for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash transaction. This deal, expected to close in mid-2026 pending regulatory approval, will add 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network across 400 U.S. markets. The transaction also aims to resolve Federal Communications Commission inquiries into EchoStar's 5G network compliance, following complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. The agreement further expands network services, enabling EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand, signaling a strategic win for both companies.

          <p>Eli Lilly's daily weight loss pill, orforglipron, successfully cleared its latest late-stage trial, demonstrating significant weight loss and blood sugar reduction in patients with obesity and Type 2 diabetes. This paves the way for global regulatory approval, potentially offering a needle-free alternative to existing GLP-1 injections. While existing injections show greater weight loss, the oral option's convenience, easier manufacturing, and lack of dietary restrictions could expand access to obesity treatments, especially given the high prevalence of obesity. Side effects were mainly mild to moderate gastrointestinal issues, and the drug is expected to launch globally around next year.</p>

          <p>The student housing market is experiencing a significant shift, with rent growth slowing and luxury amenities losing their appeal as economic concerns drive demand for more affordable options. Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, a major student housing owner, notes that students and parents are prioritizing cost savings over high-end features like hot tubs and golf simulators. There's a growing trend of investment towards large, flagship public universities, which are seeing record enrollment growth and a drop-off in new development due to higher construction costs. This creates opportunities for companies like Scion in the middle market, as functionality and convenience become paramount for students.</p>

          <p>Budget retailer Poundland has successfully avoided administration after the High Court approved its turnaround plan, preventing the company from running out of cash by early September. The deal involves a significant £90m cash injection from private equity firm Gordon Brothers, a three-year deferral of £276.5m in loans, and rent reductions for unprofitable stores. While 68 store closures and 1,000 job losses were previously announced as part of the restructuring, the managing director, Barry Williams, stated the decision would "stabilise the business" and refocus efforts on growth through revamped ranges and lower prices. This move secures the future of the 800-store chain and its remaining 14,700 staff.</p>

Beyond other dairy products like yogurt and cheese, non-dairy milks fortified with calcium, calcium-set tofu, and fortified fruit juices and cereals are excellent options. Canned fish with bones, such as salmon and sardines, also provide calcium, as do certain vegetables like kale, broccoli, and bok choy. If worried about calcium levels, especially for women, those with specific health conditions, or plant-based eaters, consulting a doctor about supplements is advised, prioritizing natural food sources.</p>

The influence of France has waned politically, with French troops largely withdrawn, yet close economic ties and the use of the CFA franc currency persist.

Despite thrilling draws in recent series against India and Australia, Langer questions England's ability to finish strong, especially given their poor record in Australia since 1987. He advises England to adopt an aggressive "Bazball" approach to put pressure on formidable Australian bowlers like Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins, emphasizing the courage required for such a strategy.

This approach, which contrasts with traditional Democratic "go high" rhetoric, suggests that electoral victory now requires digital dominance and a willingness to confront opponents directly on social media. The article argues that Trump's success has been fueled by the smartphone era's impact on attention spans and degraded discourse. However, it also emphasizes that pugilistic rhetoric must be matched with bold, authentically progressive policy initiatives to resonate with voters seeking a fighter on their behalf, rather than simply adopting a confrontational style.</p>

Despite the criticism, the PSL remains Starbucks' most popular seasonal beverage, generating significant revenue and inspiring countless pumpkin spice-flavored products. The article suggests that while the "pumpkin spice hot take" may have peaked, the drink continues to spark conversations about marketing, consumerism, and evolving social perceptions.</p>
