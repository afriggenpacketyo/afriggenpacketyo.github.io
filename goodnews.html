          <p>A Japanese nutritionist based in the U.S. shared her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting significant differences from American stores. She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional Japanese foods, including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse tofu and soy products, and seasonal local produce. The store also offered numerous healthy ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and an extensive range of green tea products. The article notes these items, often considered staples in Japanese cuisine for their health benefits, are less common or more expensive in U.S. locations.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old man, Christopher Kennedy, who was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) after a routine pre-surgery scan, has successfully undergone a double-lung transplant. Initially asymptomatic, his condition progressed to the point where he was given less than a year to live before the transplant became his only option. Despite initial hesitation and post-surgery complications, including an infection and a stroke, Kennedy has made a remarkable recovery with his lung capacity now at 98%. He has since returned to training hospital therapy dogs, a passion that has gained new meaning following his own medical journey.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to sources familiar with the matter, U.S. President Donald Trump is interested in visiting China this autumn, though a previously rumored September trip is no longer being considered. Officials from both Washington and Beijing are reportedly working to arrange a visit for October or November, possibly in conjunction with the APEC summit in South Korea. The discussions follow a recent meeting between the U.S. and Chinese foreign ministers that was described as positive. A potential summit between the two leaders would be a significant step in managing the complex and often tense relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Irina Krynina, a Russian accountant, left her life in Russia and moved to Ukraine with her daughters to support Russian prisoners of war after her own partner was captured. With logistical help from a Ukrainian helpline, she founded "Our Way Out," an initiative that helps relatives of Russian POWs make contact and sends parcels. Her project's YouTube channel, which features interviews with prisoners, has gained a large following and aims to show Russians the reality of the war. Despite facing condemnation from some in both Russia and Ukraine, Krynina continues her work, believing every prisoner exchange saves lives on both sides.</p>

          <p>China has launched a global action plan for artificial intelligence, advocating for international cooperation on the technology's development and governance. The announcement was made by Premier Li Qiang at the World Artificial Intelligence Conference in Shanghai, where he also proposed forming a global AI cooperation organization. This move comes just days after the U.S. released its own AI strategy, signaling an intensification of the tech race between the two nations. China's plan emphasizes its "AI plus" initiative to integrate the technology across industries and offers to assist other nations, particularly in the Global South, with AI development.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," is being hailed by critics as an unexpected and timely success, with the lead single "Daisies" climbing to No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100. The album departs from his previous pop sound, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced style with aqueous, muffled production. The Atlantic suggests the album's downtempo and melancholic yet intricate sound resonates with the current cultural mood, offering a soothing quality in contrast to more energetic pop. This shift in musical direction, his first since parting with manager Scooter Braun, appears to have successfully captured the zeitgeist.</p>

          <p>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) successfully avoided a proposed $400 million budget cut after the Senate rejected the rescission, a move that reassured global health advocates. However, the future of the highly successful program, credited with saving 26 million lives, remains uncertain under the Trump administration's broader foreign aid reductions. While this funding was preserved, the program's congressional authorization expired in March, and disruptions have already impacted services in some countries. Experts worry about proposed future cuts and shifts in focus away from comprehensive prevention and care for orphans, which could undermine decades of progress.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a massive public health initiative to combat dengue fever by releasing millions of mosquitoes infected with a bacteria called Wolbachia. This naturally occurring bacteria prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the Aedes aegypti mosquito, rendering it unable to transmit the disease to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói led to a 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the government to build a new factory capable of producing 5 billion of these "Wolbitos" annually. The ambitious plan aims to protect 140 million Brazilians over the next decade from dengue and other mosquito-borne illnesses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard conversation expert Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve their outcome. This brief moment of forethought allows you to consider topics, questions, and goals, making you appear more considerate and prepared. Brooks' research indicates that this mental preparation helps you stay present during the interaction, as your brain is less overwhelmed with trying to generate talking points on the fly. This simple strategy can help build stronger relationships and enhance communication skills in both personal and professional settings.</p>

The game was a tense, back-and-forth affair, with six tries scored in the first half alone. The Lions' victory, sealed after a nerve-wracking TMO review, marks the first time they have won the first two Tests of a series since 1997.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 36-year-old man sought advice from financial personality Dave Ramsey after his girlfriend of eight months requested a prenuptial agreement to keep their finances separate. The man expressed a desire to combine assets, while his girlfriend, who also owns property, preferred to protect her individual holdings. Ramsey advised the couple to slow down and address their fundamental disagreements on money, which he identified as a major cause of divorce. He suggested their differing views on a prenup indicate a deeper misalignment of values and trust that should be resolved before considering marriage. (not investment advice)</p>
