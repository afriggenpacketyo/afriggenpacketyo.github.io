          <p>The House is set to vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill after an all-night session, following the release of an updated version aimed at securing enough Republican votes. The bill addresses tax, defense, and energy priorities, and has faced opposition from various factions within the GOP, particularly regarding Medicaid and state and local tax deductions. The updated version includes changes to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, and increases the state and local tax deduction cap to $40,000 for households earning up to $500,000. While House GOP leaders are pushing for passage, the bill is expected to face challenges in the Senate.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the example set by Justice David Souter, who retired from the Supreme Court in 2009 while still capable, highlighting the importance of knowing when to step aside. French contrasts Souter's decision with the current trend of politicians and judges remaining in power well into old age, citing examples like President Biden, Senator Chuck Grassley, and Senator Mitch McConnell. He argues that the desire to cling to power is often fueled by enablers who benefit from a leader's position and by a public that prioritizes career success over other values. French concludes by praising Souter's humility and his focus on life beyond the court, suggesting a valuable lesson for current leaders.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto's early performance with the New York Mets has been under scrutiny despite the team's overall success, leading to debates about his effort and adjustment to New York. Despite a $765 million contract, Soto's performance, though above average, hasn't met the high expectations set by his previous seasons. However, advanced statistics suggest that Soto will likely return to his elite form, as his underlying metrics remain strong. The pressure of playing in New York and adjusting to a new team may be contributing factors, but Soto's track record suggests he will soon demonstrate why the Mets invested in him.</p>

          <p>New research has identified the genetic mutation responsible for the orange coat color in cats, solving a decades-long mystery. Two studies published in Current Biology detail how scientists collected DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners to locate the specific alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene. The mutation activates the gene in pigment cells, leading to the orange hue, and intersects with the same pathway responsible for red hair in humans, but in a different way. The community partnership with cat owners and spay-neuter clinics was crucial for the study's success and public engagement.</p>

          <p>Molly Conisbee, a historian and bereavement counselor, explores how past societies managed death and grief, offering insights for today's approach to mortality. She highlights that until the 20th century, most people died at home, and communities had elaborate rituals to protect the soul and console the grieving. While modern society has medicalized death, there's a resurgence of interest in old ways, such as death doulas and involving loved ones in caring for the deceased. Conisbee argues that embracing mortality can be liberating and encourages a compassionate approach to grief and mourning.</p>

          <p>China has urged the European Union to ensure a "fair" business environment following Brussels' proposal to impose a handling fee on small parcels entering the bloc, most of which originate from Chinese e-commerce firms. A Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson emphasized the importance of an open and inclusive trade environment for all parties. The proposed fee would add two euros to small packages valued at 150 euros or less sent directly to customers from overseas, and 50 cents for parcels sent to European warehouses, generating approximately 3 billion euros for Brussels' budget.</p>

          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is back online after being inaccessible to users for several hours due to the aftermath of a cyberattack. Customers have been unable to make online orders for weeks, and the retailer estimates the cyberattack will reduce this year's profits by around ¬£300 million. Some customer data, including telephone numbers and addresses, may have been stolen, but payment details and passwords remain secure. Police are investigating the attack, focusing on a hacking group known as Scattered Spider.</p>
