          <p>Sage Steele publicly condemned Ryan Clark for his remarks concerning Robert Griffin III's wife, calling them 'classless' and 'divisive'.

This is the latest in a series of disagreements between Steele and Clark, stemming from Steele's conservative views and past comments about Barack Obama.
