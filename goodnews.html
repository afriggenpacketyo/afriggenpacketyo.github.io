          <h2>UK State Pension Set to Rise by 4.7% Next Year</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 03:09:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is likely to increase by 4.7% next year, potentially raising payments by over £500 annually for recipients. This increase is driven by the "triple lock" policy, which raises the state pension by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) reported that total pay, including bonuses, grew by 4.7% in the three months leading up to July, making it the likely figure for the annual increase. However, rising pension amounts are pushing more pensioners into the tax net, as the standard rate of the new state pension is creeping closer to the frozen personal tax allowance, which currently stands at £12,570 and is set to remain at the same level until 2028.

          <p>The Trump administration is attempting to mitigate the fallout from an immigration raid at a South Korean-owned battery plant in Georgia, which led to the arrest of 475 workers and sparked concerns about foreign investment. President Trump emphasized that foreign workers are "welcome" to train the domestic workforce for companies building complex products. Washington has reportedly agreed to establish a new "visa working group" for South Korea, and Seoul is reviewing potential human rights violations during the enforcement. The incident, the largest enforcement operation in Homeland Security's history, has raised concerns among foreign businesses about their workforces in the U.S., with LG Energy Solution postponing the commencement of its Georgia EV battery plant. </p>

          <p>Donald Trump has filed a $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, alleging a "decades-long pattern" of intentional and malicious defamation. The suit targets specific journalists and accuses them of reckless disregard for the truth in a series of articles and a book. This action follows a similar $10 billion lawsuit against the Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, as well as previous settlements with ABC and CBS. Last week, the paper published a note bearing Trump's signature that appeared in a "birthday book" for the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The note is sexually suggestive, leading to renewed conversation about how much the president knew about Epstein's criminal behavior.</p>

          <p>The UK is preparing to welcome President Trump for a state visit, hoping it will provide a distraction from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's domestic issues. Starmer is grappling with cabinet resignations, protests over immigration, and internal party rumblings about his leadership. The visit will showcase British tradition and ceremony, with events at Windsor Castle, including a royal salute, carriage procession, and a state banquet. Trade will also be a focus, with meetings at Chequers to discuss tech partnerships, energy deals, and lower tariffs on steel and aluminum exports, as Starmer seeks to boost his approval ratings and solidify the "special relationship" between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Baker Mayfield led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a dramatic 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans, orchestrating an 80-yard drive capped by Rachaad White's touchdown run with just six seconds remaining. Mayfield's key 15-yard scramble on fourth-and-10 kept the game-winning drive alive, marking his second consecutive game-winning drive to start the season. The Texans had taken the lead with a late touchdown of their own, but failed on the two-point conversion attempt. Meanwhile, in another game, the Los Angeles Chargers defeated the Las Vegas Raiders 20-9, highlighted by Daiyan Henley's interception on the first play and a strong defensive performance.</p>

          <p>A long-awaited "Hillsborough Law" bill will compel public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters, with potential criminal sanctions for non-compliance. The bill aims to end the culture of cover-ups and learn from disasters like the Grenfell Tower fire and the Post Office Horizon scandal. It includes a professional and legal "duty of candour," requiring public officials to act with honesty and integrity at all times. The legislation is named after the Hillsborough disaster, where 97 football fans died, and is intended to ensure that no one suffers like the families affected by that tragedy. </p>

However, some experts are skeptical about issues including who will control TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm, as the data TikTok collects from Americans could help train the models that power China's military and intelligence capabilities tomorrow.</p>
