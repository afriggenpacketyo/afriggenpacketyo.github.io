          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams that falsely claim artificial intelligence can predict questions for the national college entrance examination (gaokao). The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have launched a joint campaign to investigate and eliminate "illegal and harmful information" related to the exams. Some social media accounts and private tutors are also falsely claiming access to "top secret" information from teachers involved in setting the exam papers. The high stakes of the gaokao, which determines university placement, make students vulnerable to such scams.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of roadworks, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2bn upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially drawn up in 1990, faced enormous overspends and major delays, but is now complete with the removal of the last traffic cone. The upgrade included building almost 70 structures and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate its environmental impact.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government began releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers to combat soaring rice prices, with consumers flocking to purchase the cheaper product. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were among the first to sell the rice at a discounted price. The initiative aims to alleviate the financial burden on households affected by the rising cost of rice. The government hopes direct sales to retailers will be more effective in curbing prices than previous auction attempts.</p>
