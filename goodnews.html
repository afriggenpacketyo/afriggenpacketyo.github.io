          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are collaborating on a massive artificial intelligence data campus in Abu Dhabi, which is poised to be the largest facility of its kind outside of the U.S. The project, spearheaded by Emirati firm G42 in partnership with several U.S. companies, will boast a 5-gigawatt capacity and span 10 square miles. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnik emphasized that American companies will operate the data centers, providing American-managed cloud services with strong security measures to prevent technology diversion. This announcement coincided with President Donald Trump's visit to the UAE as part of a broader Middle East tour.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's shares experienced a significant drop of 7.5% after the company's fiscal fourth-quarter earnings fell short of expectations, with revenue at 236.5 billion Chinese yuan and net income at 12.4 billion yuan. Despite a 7% year-on-year revenue increase, analysts had anticipated stronger performance from investments in artificial intelligence and e-commerce. The company is navigating macroeconomic volatility and trade tensions between the U.S. and China, which have affected consumer sentiment. Alibaba is investing aggressively in instant commerce and extended its partnership with Rednote to boost sales, while facing intense price competition from rivals like PDD and JD.com.

          <p>Walmart's CFO, John David Rainey, has cautioned investors about upcoming price increases on various items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. The company plans to absorb some of the higher costs but anticipates shoppers will see increases starting in late May, with more significant markups in June. Items like bananas, avocados, coffee, roses, toys, and electronics are expected to be affected. Walmart is also exploring alternative materials and sourcing locations to mitigate tariff exposure, while anticipating that consumers seeking value will turn to Walmart, potentially increasing its market share.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are proposing a bill to make the $2,000 child tax credit permanent and increase it to $2,500 from 2025 through 2028. The bill, if enacted, would provide a maximum refundable credit of $1,700 for 2025, with the credit value increasing with adjusted gross income (AGI) until it reaches $2,000 per child. However, critics argue that the plan excludes millions of low-income children and requires both parents to have a Social Security number, potentially disadvantaging some families. The tax break starts to phase out for married couples with AGI exceeding $400,000 and $200,000 for other taxpayers.</p>

Belgium currently has two nuclear power plants that generate around 40% of its power, with other European countries also considering a shift towards nuclear energy.</p>
