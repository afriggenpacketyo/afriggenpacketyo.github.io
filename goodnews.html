          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading but ultimately rose after the company announced a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The announcement came alongside an earnings report that showed operating income for the last three months of the financial year beating analyst estimates, despite being down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. The financial unit will be listed this year and classified as a discontinued operation in Sony's accounting, though Sony's outlook for the current financial year was described as lackluster.

          <p>President Donald Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Riyadh, a meeting facilitated by Saudi Crown Prince Mohanmmed bin Salman and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. This encounter, the first of its kind in 25 years, signifies a major shift for Syria following years of international isolation under former dictator Bashar Assad. Trump expressed hope for the new Syrian government's success and its ability to stabilize the country. Al-Sharaa assumed leadership after leading rebels in an uprising that ousted Assad's government, and the lifting of sanctions was met with opposition from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who fears potential threats from Syria under its new leadership.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established a new government department focused on streamlining the state apparatus, appointing Karsten Wildberger as its head. Wildberger's role, as the Minister for Digitalization and State Modernization, involves overseeing the state's IT infrastructure, drawing comparisons to Elon Musk's efforts in the US government. While Wildberger aims to enhance efficiency and digitalization, he emphasizes a collaborative approach and respects EU data privacy regulations. Unlike Musk, Wildberger is officially part of the government and subject to its compromises, with his powers also limited by Germany's federal system, requiring alliances with state governments.</p>

The company's revenue beat expectations, while net profit fell slightly short of estimates. Domestic games revenue saw a significant increase, driven by popular titles such as "Honor of Kings" and "Peacekeeper Elite," as well as newer games. Tencent also runs WeChat, a super app with over 1.4 billion monthly active users, which has allowed the company to monetize the platform through advertising, becoming a fast-growing business.</p>

          <p>China has issued a warning to the UK regarding its new trade deal with the US, suggesting that the agreement could compel British companies to exclude Chinese products from their supply chains. Beijing argues that the deal violates the principle that international agreements should not target third countries. The UK-US trade deal offers Britain relief from US tariffs on car and steel exports, contingent on compliance with strict American security requirements. China views these clauses as "poison pills" and a departure from efforts to rebuild bilateral ties, fearing they are designed to pressure allies into economically isolating China.</p>

          <p>Several key members of the Trump administration, including Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and others, are advocating for the implementation of work requirements for able-bodied adults receiving welfare benefits. They argue that welfare should be a short-term hand-up rather than a lifetime handout, emphasizing that too many able-bodied adults are not working. The proposed policy would require recipients to work, participate in job training, or volunteer at least 20 hours a week, with limited exceptions. Citing the success of the 1996 welfare reform, they believe work provides purpose, dignity, and strengthens communities. </p>

          <p>Over-the-counter drugs will soon be available at convenience stores in Japan, following the enactment of revised laws in parliament. While currently restricted to sales by pharmacists or registered sellers, the new legislation will permit designated convenience stores to offer these drugs, provided buyers receive online usage guidance from pharmacists. To address concerns about drug abuse, sales of certain high-risk medicines, such as cough and cold remedies, will be limited to one small package per person for young people. Measures to prevent overdosing and other forms of drug abuse will be enforced within a year.</p>
