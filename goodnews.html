          <p>Starbucks has confirmed the return of its popular seasonal beverage, the Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL), starting Tuesday, August 26th. This marks another year of the fall menu's launch creeping earlier into the summer calendar. Alongside the iconic PSL, which has been a major success for over two decades, the menu will feature new items like Pecan Cold Foam, aiming to boost sales after a recent reported decline. The company is banking on the popularity of its seasonal offerings to attract customers and reverse weakening in-store traffic trends.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Metropolitan Police have reported that this year's Notting Hill Carnival experienced "far fewer" incidents of serious violence compared to previous years. Over the two-day event, 423 arrests were made for offenses including drug possession and carrying offensive weapons, and two non-serious stabbings occurred. This is a notable decrease from last year, which saw multiple stabbings and two fatalities. Police credited proactive measures, including the controversial use of live facial recognition technology and stop-and-search tactics, for preventing more severe violence at the major cultural celebration.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett stated that his company, Berkshire Hathaway, is not seeking to purchase another railroad, dispelling market speculation. He confirmed a meeting with CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs to discuss increased cooperation between Berkshire's BNSF Railway and CSX to improve freight efficiency without a merger. This news followed a recent partnership announcement between the two rail giants for a new coast-to-coast service. The clarification caused CSX shares to fall, as investors had previously driven up the stock price on rumors of a potential Berkshire acquisition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A small craft store in Holdingford, Minnesota, has seen a massive influx of customers after the owner's 18-year-old grandson, Tyler Larson, posted about it on Facebook Marketplace.

Larson's heartfelt post, asking people to visit and chat with his grandmother, went viral and brought new life to the shop. The touching gesture has created a memorable summer for Forster, who now keeps a guestbook to track all her new visitors from around the country.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jack Draper won his first-round match at the US Open, defeating Argentine qualifier Federico Agustin Gomez in four sets.

Despite not playing his best tennis, Draper managed to secure the win and advance to the second round. He joins fellow Briton Cameron Norrie, who also advanced after his opponent, Sebastian Korda, retired due to injury.</p>

          <p>Despite the Trump administration's efforts to roll back electric vehicle incentives, including the $7,500 federal tax credit, some U.S. automakers are pushing forward with electrification. Ford recently announced a $5 billion investment in a new EV platform to produce an affordable electric pickup truck priced around $30,000, set for a 2027 release. This move is seen as a significant bet on the future of EVs, aiming to capture a mass market that has been priced out of expensive models like the F-150 Lightning. It signals that market forces and global competition may drive the EV transition, regardless of domestic political headwinds.</p>

Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to separate its beverage and newly expanded coffee units into two distinct, publicly traded U.S. companies. This move would effectively reverse the 2018 merger of Keurig and Dr Pepper Snapple, signaling a major strategic shift for the beverage giant. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix saw box office success with a limited, two-day theatrical release of a sing-along version of its animated hit "KPop Demon Hunters," with estimates ranging from $16 to $20 million in domestic sales. Despite the strong performance, industry analysts believe this does not signal a major shift in Netflix's streaming-first strategy. The company uses such theatrical releases primarily as promotional "events" to generate buzz and drive streaming viewership, rather than as a core revenue stream. This approach allows Netflix to create cultural moments for its biggest hits while avoiding the high marketing costs of traditional studio releases.</p>

In 2024, 16.3% of the state's workforce, or 2.67 million workers, were covered by a union contract.
