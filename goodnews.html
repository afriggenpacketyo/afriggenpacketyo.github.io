        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the most anticipated celestial events, is expected to peak on August 12-13. However, this year's spectacle will be significantly diminished by a bright waning gibbous moon, which will be 84% full. According to the American Meteor Society, the moonlight is projected to reduce visibility by at least 75%, lowering the expected hourly meteor count from around 50 to just 10-20. For better viewing, experts suggest looking for the meteors a week after the peak when the sky will be darker. The Perseids are caused by debris from the comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle interacting with Earth's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The LA Galaxy suffered a significant setback in their MLS season, losing 4-0 to the Seattle Sounders at home. The scoring began with an own goal by Galaxy defender Julián Aude in the 25th minute. The Sounders extended their lead in the second half, with Danny Musovski scoring twice and Snydell Brunell adding a fourth goal to seal the decisive victory. The loss comes after a successful run in the Leagues Cup for the Galaxy, but it severely damages their already slim chances of making the MLS playoffs. The match also featured a ceremony honoring the Galaxy's 2005 championship team.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's company, Tesla, has formally applied for a license to supply electricity to households and businesses in Great Britain. If approved by the energy regulator Ofgem, this move would position Tesla to compete with established UK energy firms as early as next year. The company aims to leverage its existing customer base of over a quarter-million electric vehicle owners and thousands of home battery users. This expansion into the energy market comes as Tesla faces declining EV sales in Europe and increased competition from other automakers, representing a strategic diversification for the company.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering a significant overhaul of driving laws in England and Wales to improve road safety. The proposed changes include mandatory eye tests every three years for drivers over the age of 70 when they renew their licenses. Additionally, the plan aims to lower the drink-drive limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These measures are part of a new road safety strategy prompted by concerns that current safety messaging is ineffective and follows a coroner's report criticizing the UK's lax driver licensing system.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Describe the 'Music' of Newly Formed Black Holes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, scientists explain that newly formed ones produce a unique form of "music." When a black hole is created, such as from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in spacetime vibrates and radiates gravitational waves as it settles into a perfect, stable shape. These vibrations, akin to the ringing of a bell, are a pure tone determined only by the black hole's mass and spin. This phenomenon offers a way to study these celestial objects during their brief, dynamic youth before they become completely introverted.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a national childcare subsidy program offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three, aiming to address its low birth rate. Analysts suggest the scheme's impact will vary significantly by region, potentially providing a greater economic boost to less affluent areas. For example, the subsidy represents over 13% of an average resident's annual income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in wealthy Shanghai. This disparity means the policy could stimulate consumption and potentially birth rates more effectively in smaller cities and rural communities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is making his most significant strategic bet yet, repositioning the Japanese conglomerate to lead the artificial intelligence revolution. Son predicts that artificial superintelligence (ASI), which he defines as AI 10,000 times smarter than humans, will arrive within a decade. To capitalize on this vision, SoftBank has made aggressive investments in the AI ecosystem, including acquiring chip designers Arm and Ampere Computing and planning substantial investments in OpenAI. This ambitious pivot aims to replicate the massive success of his early investment in Alibaba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his first PGA Tour victory in over two years, winning the St. Jude Championship in a tense playoff against American JJ Spaun. Both players finished the tournament at 16-under par.

The victory was a disappointment for England's Tommy Fleetwood, who had entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke short of the playoff.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures designed to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The plan aims to address a situation where there are significantly more graduates than available job vacancies in some areas. By cutting red tape, the new regulations will allow health trusts to recruit more proactively, even before vacancies formally arise, and to temporarily convert some support posts into midwifery roles. The Royal College of Nursing welcomed the news but stated the true test will be whether graduates can actually secure jobs.</p>

          <p>In the Los Angeles Chargers' 27-13 preseason win against the New Orleans Saints, quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance that appears to be closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Lance showcased his dual-threat ability, completing 7 of 14 passes and rushing seven times for 48 yards, including a five-yard touchdown run. In contrast, his competitor Taylor Heinicke looked rusty in his first preseason action. Another standout was defensive end Caleb Murphy, an undrafted free agent who recorded two sacks, making a compelling case for a spot on the 53-man roster.</p>
