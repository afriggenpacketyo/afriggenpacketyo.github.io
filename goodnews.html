          <p>A four-year-old girl from Mexico, identified as Sofia, who has been receiving critical medical treatment in the United States for short bowel syndrome, has been granted humanitarian parole for one year, allowing her and her mother to remain in the country. Sofia and her mother, Deysi Vargas, have been living in the U.S. since 2023, but recently received notices that their parole was being terminated. Her lawyers emphasized the systemic challenges that brought Sofia to the brink, highlighting the need for immigration system reform to protect those facing life-threatening harm. This decision ensures Sofia can continue receiving specialized IV treatments, which are only available in the U.S., allowing her to live a more normal life with her family. The humanitarian parole will expire on June 1, 2026. </p>

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has entered a fuel-efficient Earth-moon orbit, but claims that it is the first spacecraft to achieve this feat are being challenged by US and Canadian experts. The 3:1 resonant orbit, where Tiandu-1 completes three loops of the Earth for every circuit made by the moon, is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure. However, experts point to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a near-identical orbit in 2011, questioning whether Tiandu-1 can claim the title of being the first.</p>

          <p>The Okhotsk Tokkari Center in Mombetsu, Hokkaido, Japan's only seal sanctuary, focuses on rescuing injured or weakened seals and returning them to the wild. Staff members avoid naming or having direct contact with the seals to minimize emotional attachment, but bonds inevitably form. The center has helped over 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s, with staff ready to respond to reports of injured seals at a moment's notice. The seals are losing their habitat due to receding drift ice caused by global warming, which threatens their presence in Japan.</p>
