        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is set to launch a program offering illegal aliens commercial flights and a $1,000 stipend to encourage self-deportation from the United States. This initiative aims to reduce costs for American taxpayers, as the DHS estimates that deporting an individual currently costs over $17,000, while self-deportation with the stipend would cost around $4,500. Illegal aliens can access this assistance through the CBP Home self-deportation app, and the stipend will be paid upon verification of departure. DHS anticipates a significant increase in self-removals as a result of this announcement.</p>

          <h2>Shingles Vaccine Linked to Lower Risk of Heart Disease</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 19:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the European Heart Journal suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer protection against heart disease. Researchers found that individuals who received the vaccine had a 23% lower risk of cardiovascular events, including stroke, heart failure, and coronary heart disease, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly notable in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyles. While the study focused on a live zoster vaccine, the findings suggest potential benefits for heart health beyond preventing shingles. The CDC recommends the shingles vaccine for adults aged 50 and older.</p>

          <p>Sir David Attenborough, nearing his 99th birthday, is releasing a new film titled 'Ocean' that he believes is crucial for saving biodiversity and combating climate change. The film highlights the critical role of the ocean as the planet's support system and humanity's ally against climate change. It showcases the devastating impact of practices like bottom trawling on marine life and the release of carbon dioxide. Despite the grim state of the world's oceans, Attenborough remains optimistic, emphasizing the ocean's capacity to recover rapidly with proper conservation efforts, such as protecting a third of the world's oceans. The film aims to inspire leaders to take action at an upcoming UN conference.</p>

          <p>China's e-commerce giants like Alibaba, JD.com, and Meituan are engaged in a battle for consumers' wallets with the rise of "instant commerce," which combines online shopping with extremely fast delivery. Consumers in major cities can order a variety of products and expect delivery within an hour, often at subsidized prices. China's advanced transport network, logistics hubs, and AI-driven distribution systems facilitate this rapid delivery. However, investors are concerned about the intensified competition and its impact on profitability. The working conditions of delivery workers, who provide the "last mile" service, have also come under scrutiny.</p>

          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has moved to drop its appeal of a ruling that allowed KalshiEx, a commodities exchange, to offer bets on the outcomes of U.S. political elections. The agreement requires both sides to bear their own costs and attorney fees, and for Kalshi to waive all legal claims arising from the litigation. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed the decision as a victory for prediction markets. However, the financial reform advocacy group Better Markets criticized the CFTC's decision, calling it a "stark betrayal of the public interest."</p>
