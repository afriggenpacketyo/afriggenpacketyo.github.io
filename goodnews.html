          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in Fresno County, California, near Naval Air Station Lemoore. The pilot managed to eject safely from the aircraft before the impact and was not injured, with no other personnel affected by the incident. The jet, attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron, went down around 6:30 p.m., sparking a small grass fire that was subsequently contained. The cause of the crash is currently under investigation by naval authorities.</p>

The Shanghai-based company sold 73.8 million new shares to institutional investors at a slight discount. The proceeds are intended to fund the company's global expansion and increase its production capacity. This move follows a trend of other Chinese drug developers tapping into capital markets for significant funding, largely driven by interest from mainland investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award for the Archibald Prize, Australia's most respected portraiture award. Her winning piece is a portrait of Aboriginal musician William Barton, which she created by painting with her fingers. This unique technique was a response to a nerve injury that made holding a paintbrush difficult and painful for her. Spirovski expressed her joy and gratitude, stating the experience was a "beautiful reprieve and reward" after a challenging few years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a new law in California that increases penalties for soliciting 16- and 17-year-olds for sex. The law allows prosecutors the discretion to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense. This "wobbler" provision targets older predators while avoiding harsher penalties for all younger offenders. The bill was amended after initial controversy, with some lawmakers expressing concern that vague language could lead to profiling of minority and low-income individuals.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris has officially announced she will not be a candidate for governor of California in the next election.

The decision ends months of speculation about her next political move following her 2024 presidential campaign. Sources close to Harris suggest she wants to remain engaged on a national level and that this decision keeps the door open for a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>Hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a rival plan for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the proposal from the airport's own owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" plan features a shorter third runway, which the company claims would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The group estimates its plan would cost under £25 billion and could be operational by 2035, arguing it presents a lower-risk and more cost-effective solution. This marks the first time a competing bid has been formally submitted for the airport's expansion.</p>

          <p>Robinhood reported strong second-quarter financial results, beating analyst expectations for both revenue and earnings. The company's revenue grew 45% year-over-year to $989 million, while its user base and total platform assets also saw significant increases. Growth was driven by strong net deposits and higher valuations, with the company making progress in expanding beyond retail trading into wealth management and retirement accounts. Despite the positive report, the stock slipped slightly after the company provided guidance on future costs associated with its acquisition of Bitstamp. (not investment advice)</p>
