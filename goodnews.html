          <p>The CNBC Investing Club is adding Nike to its watchlist, viewing the sportswear giant as a potential turnaround story after a period of poor performance. The company has faced challenges, including a struggling Chinese market and losing its innovation edge to competitors, which led to a CEO change. New leadership under Elliott Hill is refocusing on core sports categories, restoring retail partnerships, and working to clear excess inventory ahead of the holiday season. Analysts are becoming more bullish ahead of the upcoming earnings report, seeing signs of a potential recovery for the iconic brand. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of borrowing against home equity has become marginally more affordable for homeowners. For a $100,000 loan, current rates result in slightly lower monthly payments compared to earlier in the year, though the decrease is not substantial. The article breaks down the estimated monthly payments for 10- and 15-year loan terms, comparing them to previous periods and also to variable-rate Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). While the savings are modest for now, further anticipated rate cuts could make these borrowing options more attractive in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bruce Pearl, the head coach of Auburn University's men's basketball team, is reportedly expected to retire before the 2025-26 season, with his son Steven Pearl slated to take over the program. The announcement comes amidst swirling rumors that Pearl may pursue a political career, potentially running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Tommy Tuberville. Pearl, who has been an outspoken supporter of Israel and former President Trump, has recently addressed the possibility of a political run. During his tenure, he achieved a 246-125 record and led the Tigers to two Final Four appearances, becoming a significant figure in college basketball.</p>

          <p>Shares of mortgage lender Better Home & Finance Holding Co. surged dramatically after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, known for his influence on Opendoor's stock, recommended it as his new pick. Jackson called the company "the Shopify of mortgages," suggesting it is revolutionizing the industry with artificial intelligence and has significant growth potential. The stock jumped over 176% at one point during Monday's trading session, reflecting the market's strong reaction to his endorsement. Jackson argued that Better Home is undervalued compared to similar newly public companies, projecting it could be a "350-bagger in 2 years" for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

While significant rainfall is not anticipated for the Los Angeles area, the atmosphere will remain unstable, creating the possibility of isolated storms, particularly on Tuesday and Wednesday. This weather pattern follows a week where remnants of a tropical storm caused minor flooding and debris flows in some mountain areas. Meteorologists are also monitoring Tropical Storm Narda, which could bring additional moisture and potential storms to the region by the upcoming weekend.</p>

          <p>Television host Phil Rosenthal and acclaimed chef Nancy Silverton are collaborating to open Max and Helen’s, a new diner in L.A.'s Larchmont Village named after Rosenthal's parents. The project aims to preserve a sense of community by reviving the classic American diner, offering elevated versions of comfort food staples like burgers, patty melts, and milkshakes. The menu, developed through extensive research and taste-testing, will feature Silverton's refined take on classics, including her mother's matzo ball soup and what Rosenthal calls the "best patty melt you ever had." The diner is expected to open in mid-October, focusing on high-quality ingredients and nostalgic recipes.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average cost of Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, in 2025 can vary widely, with monthly premiums ranging from as low as $32 for high-deductible plans to over $550 for comprehensive coverage. Most beneficiaries can expect to pay between $90 and $300 per month, depending on factors such as the specific plan chosen, age, location, and tobacco use. The article emphasizes that these plans are crucial for covering out-of-pocket costs that Original Medicare does not, such as copays and deductibles. To lower costs, consumers are advised to enroll when first eligible, compare plans carefully, and consider options with higher cost-sharing for lower premiums. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Michelob Ultra has officially become the best-selling beer in the United States, overtaking Modelo Especial, which had previously unseated Bud Light. According to new data, the Anheuser-Busch light lager now leads in both retail channels and in bars and restaurants. This shift marks a significant turnaround for AB InBev, which saw its flagship Bud Light brand lose the top spot two years ago following a conservative backlash. Modelo's decline in popularity coincides with challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and weaker demand from its core Hispanic consumer base, partly attributed to economic pressures and immigration policies.</p>

          <p>In a recent speech, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a detailed case for aggressively lowering the central bank's benchmark interest rate, arguing it is currently far too high. Miran, who dissented in last week's quarter-point rate cut by advocating for a half-point reduction, believes the federal funds rate should be closer to 2% rather than its current 4-4.25% range. He cited disinflationary pressures from changes in tax, immigration, and regulatory policies as reasons why monetary policy is overly restrictive. His stance places him significantly outside the consensus of his more cautious colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee.</p>

          <p>As gold prices surge to a record high above $3,700 per ounce, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset. The article outlines how to invest, with most experts recommending exposure through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of physical gold, such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD). This method is considered more efficient, liquid, and cost-effective than purchasing and storing physical bullion like coins or bars. Despite its strong performance, driven by low interest rates and geopolitical uncertainty, financial advisors generally suggest limiting gold allocation to a small portion, typically less than 3%, of a well-diversified portfolio.

This success has been attributed to strategic planning, including competitive ticket pricing starting at £5 for children, clever scheduling of all matches on weekends, and hosting double-header events.
