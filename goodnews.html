        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced a comprehensive review of parental leave and pay, aiming to modernize a system that advocates say has been neglected for years. The review will examine maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave policies, which have been criticized as flawed and insufficient. Campaign groups have welcomed the move, calling it a generational opportunity to create a system that better supports working families. Currently, concerns persist that many fathers cannot afford to take paternity leave, and the uptake of shared parental leave remains very low, highlighting the need for significant reform.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has formally requested that the Trump administration return 200 troops to California's command. These troops were federalized to respond to immigration-related protests, but their deployment has left the state's wildfire-fighting unit at just 40% of its normal staffing level as fire season begins. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the Guard, supports the request, emphasizing the critical need for these personnel to combat growing wildfires. The decision to redeploy the troops now rests with the California National Guard's adjutant general, pending federal approval.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has proposed that younger investors are significantly shaping current market dynamics by investing in companies with bold, exciting ideas rather than established firms focused on stock buybacks. He points to the performance of companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash, suggesting their appeal lies in innovative concepts that could yield substantial future earnings. According to Cramer, this new generation of investors is less preoccupied with Federal Reserve policies, creating a market driven more by compelling company narratives than by traditional institutional strategies. This shift rewards companies perceived as innovative and forward-thinking. (not investment advice)</p>

In an interview, Jassy explained that Amazon and its third-party sellers mitigated the initial impact by purchasing inventory in advance and absorbing some of the costs. He also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace discourages sellers from raising prices. Jassy also discussed the transformative potential of generative AI, stating that Amazon is embracing the technology, which he believes will eventually lead to most consumers having robots in their homes.

          <p>Energy bills for millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales are set to fall by 7% starting this week under the new Ofgem price cap. This provides some relief for consumers, translating to a reduction of about ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, energy analysts warn that prices are unlikely to decrease substantially more and could be impacted by geopolitical uncertainty in the Middle East this winter. Bills remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, and the regulator is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which could offer more stability and potentially greater savings than the variable tariffs governed by the price cap.</p>

By shifting production domestically, the company aims to avoid stiffer import tariffs and operate under its "zero distance" philosophy of building products closer to its consumers. The new plant is expected to be operational by early 2027, at which point the corresponding factory in China will cease production. (not investment advice)</p>

Emmett stated that although the debt was tied to a defunct former company, he chose to settle it personally because it was the right thing to do.
