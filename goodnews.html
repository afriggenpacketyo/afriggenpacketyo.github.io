          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML reported second-quarter earnings and net bookings that surpassed analyst expectations. The company, which is a critical supplier to global chipmakers like Intel and TSMC, posted net sales of 7.7 billion euros and net bookings of 5.5 billion euros, a key indicator of future demand. ASML is the sole producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines necessary for manufacturing the world's most advanced chips. The strong performance comes as the company navigates market uncertainty related to U.S. tariff policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, speaking at a supply chain expo in Beijing, lauded several Chinese generative AI models as "world class," highlighting their role in spurring global AI development. His praise comes as Nvidia announced it expects to soon resume shipments of its H20 AI chip to China, following assurances from the U.S. government. Huang emphasized the significant number of Chinese developers using Nvidia's platform and warned that U.S. export restrictions could inadvertently benefit competitors like Huawei. This development signals a potential easing of tech trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Burns, the former U.S. ambassador to China, stated at the Aspen Security Forum that Washington and Beijing are on a "creeping path towards some kind of a deal." He expressed rare support for the Trump administration's tariff strategy, suggesting that strong economic incentives and mutual self-interest will likely guide both nations toward a trade agreement. Burns highlighted the symbiotic nature of the economic relationship, with thousands of American companies in China and the U.S. being its largest export market, as a key reason for his optimistic outlook on the negotiations.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that a group of 11 House Republicans, who had initially voted with Democrats to block several cryptocurrency regulation bills, have agreed to reverse their position after a meeting at the White House. This dramatic turnaround ensures that the legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, will now advance for a final vote. The initial failure of the procedural vote was a rare, albeit temporary, defiance of Trump's directive by members of his own party. The development underscores the president's significant influence over the Republican conference on key policy matters.</p>

          <p>The National League defeated the American League in the MLB All-Star Game, which was decided for the first time by a home run swing-off after the game ended in a 6-6 tie. The AL had mounted a comeback from a six-run deficit to force the tiebreaker. In the swing-off, Kyle Schwarber hit three home runs to secure the 4-3 victory for the NL and was named the game's MVP. This new tiebreaker format was introduced to prevent games from running out of pitchers and provides a definitive conclusion to the annual exhibition.</p>

In contrast, sales in North America experienced a 9% decline, positioning the U.S. as a laggard in the electric transition for the month.

Both Governor Newsom and LA Mayor Karen Bass criticized the deployment as political theater and called for the remaining soldiers to be sent home immediately.
