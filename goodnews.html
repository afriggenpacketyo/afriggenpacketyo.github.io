          <p>A federal judge in Boston has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge criticized the administration's actions as an attempt to abolish the department outright, rather than a legitimate reorganization to improve efficiency. The ruling came in response to a challenge from state attorneys general, schools, and nonprofits, who argued that the president cannot unilaterally shut down a federal department created by Congress. The judge agreed, stating that the changes imposed by the administration would make it impossible for the Department to carry out its mandated functions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Most teachers and doctors in England have been granted a 4% pay increase following government acceptance of recommendations from pay review bodies. While education unions have welcomed the decision, they have also warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding to cover the costs. Health unions, however, have reacted with anger after NHS staff other than doctors were offered a smaller rise of 3.6%. The British Medical Association plans to ballot resident doctors over possible strike action, calling the rise "woefully inadequate." The government intends to fund the rises through a combination of existing budgets and improved productivity.</p>

          <p>Nike will be raising prices on some of its footwear, apparel, and equipment this week as part of a seasonal adjustment, with increases ranging from $2 to $10. The price hikes will primarily affect footwear priced between $100 and $150, as well as apparel and equipment. However, prices for Nike Air Force 1s, children's footwear, and Jordan apparel will remain unchanged. In a separate development, Nike will also begin selling its products directly on Amazon, leading to the cessation of sales by smaller sellers on the platform by July 19.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has ordered its last batch of "blanks" for pennies, signaling an end to the production of the one-cent coin. This decision comes as the cost of minting pennies has risen to 3.69 cents apiece, prompting the government to seek ways to reduce unnecessary spending. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually and will eventually lead to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. While pennies will remain legal tender, the shift is anticipated to streamline transactions and reduce waste, aligning with President Trump's call to eliminate wasteful spending.</p>

          <p>House Budget Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, introduced the Axing Nonmarket Tariff Evasion (ANTE) Act, targeting China's circumvention of U.S. tariffs by establishing production in third-party countries. The bill seeks to prevent subsidized and state-owned Chinese entities from using this tactic to evade tariffs imposed by President Trump. The legislation aims to ensure a level playing field for American producers and manufacturers by preventing the falsification of import origins. Senator Jim Banks, R-Ind., is introducing companion legislation in the Senate, emphasizing the need to stop the Chinese Communist Party from cheating American workers and manufacturers.</p>

While pennies will remain legal tender, the move may require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel.

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decline was driven by fewer people coming to work and study in the UK, as well as a decrease in the number of dependents accompanying visa holders. The ONS also noted that many people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased have now left the country. The government highlighted a significant increase in returns of failed asylum seekers and foreign national offenders, as well as a reduction in the asylum backlog and hotel use.</p>
