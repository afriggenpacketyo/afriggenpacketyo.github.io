          <p>A Colorado-based mother and social media influencer is offering advice on how families can save money on skiing and snowboarding. She highlights programs like the Epic SchoolKids Colorado Pack and the Colorado Ski Country USA pass, which provide free or heavily discounted access for elementary school children at numerous resorts. Additional recommendations include booking packages, skiing on weekdays, visiting smaller resorts, and renting equipment for children instead of buying it, as they quickly outgrow it. These strategies aim to make winter sports more accessible for families on a budget.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly reached a framework agreement concerning the ownership of TikTok, potentially transferring the platform to U.S.-controlled ownership. The announcement came from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent following high-level trade talks in Madrid, though commercial terms were not disclosed. This development marks a significant step in resolving long-standing U.S. national security concerns about the app's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The final details of the deal are expected to be settled between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping later in the week.</p>

          <p>CBS News has launched a new local station in Atlanta, built around a modern, immersive newsroom that eschews traditional news desks. The new venture, which hired 50 staff members in just five weeks, aims to combine the energy of a startup with the journalistic credibility of the CBS brand. Key hires, including anchor Jobina Fortson-Evans and reporter Brian Unger, were drawn by the opportunity to engage with the community and innovate in local news production. CBS News Atlanta will initially air newscasts at 6 p.m. and 11 p.m., with plans to expand its programming.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth company to reach a market capitalization of $3 trillion, joining Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple. The company's stock surged following a recent antitrust ruling where the penalties imposed by a judge were less severe than investors had feared. Despite facing increased competition from AI startups and regulatory pressure in the U.S. and Europe, Alphabet's shares have risen over 30% this year. The milestone reflects continued investor confidence in the tech giant's market position and future prospects, particularly in the field of artificial intelligence with its Gemini models.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock price increased by over 3% after the U.S. and China announced a framework agreement for the future of TikTok's U.S. operations. Oracle is considered a top contender to acquire or manage the social media app, a role that would build on its existing relationship of storing TikTok's American user data through its "Project Texas" initiative. The potential deal has boosted investor confidence in Oracle, which has also been collaborating with the Trump administration on major AI infrastructure projects. The company's stock has seen significant gains this year, recently bolstered by strong cloud revenue projections.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Renewable Energy Remains Most Cost-Effective Option for Production</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) indicates that renewable sources like onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the cheapest forms of energy to produce, even before accounting for government subsidies. While the upfront capital investment for renewables is high, their operational and maintenance costs are significantly lower than those for fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, which are also subject to volatile fuel prices. However, experts note that LCOE doesn't capture the full picture, as the intermittent nature of wind and solar requires backup power sources. The report also considers the impact of tariffs and tax incentives on overall project costs.</p>

          <p>One of the largest homes in the United States, the Pritzker estate in Los Angeles, is on the market for $175 million following the divorce of its owners, Hyatt heir Tony Pritzker and his ex-wife, Jeanne. The 50,000-square-foot mansion, which took six years to build, features 16 bedrooms, 27 bathrooms, a bowling alley, and a cliffside pool with panoramic city views. Initially listed for $195 million, a sale at its current price would still set a new record for the most expensive home sold in Los Angeles. The property's ownership structure, involving a series of trusts, was a point of contention during the divorce proceedings.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Expected to Cut Interest Rates; Experts Suggest Key Financial Moves</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:51:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to lower its benchmark interest rate this week, prompting financial experts to advise on how consumers can prepare. For those with high-interest debt like credit cards, a small rate cut won't provide significant immediate relief, making strategies like balance transfers or consolidation loans more effective. Savers are encouraged to lock in current high yields on certificates of deposit (CDs) before rates fall. The move could also benefit the housing market by making mortgages more affordable, while improving one's credit score remains the most impactful way to secure better loan terms.

          <h2>US Banks Borrow $1.5 Billion from Federal Reserve's Repo Facility</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-15 11:49:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. banks borrowed $1.5 billion from the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF), an action that suggests some minor tightness in short-term funding markets. The borrowing occurred on a deadline for quarterly corporate tax payments, which, combined with a large Treasury security settlement, increased the demand for cash. The SRF acts as a backstop to prevent disruptive funding shortages by allowing banks to exchange eligible collateral, like Treasuries, for overnight cash. Analysts view the current liquidity pressure as temporary and not indicative of a broader funding squeeze in the financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has bought roughly $1 billion worth of Tesla shares, a move seen by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle company. The purchase, his first on the open market since 2020, comes as Musk has been pushing for greater control of the firm to steer its focus toward AI and robotaxis. Tesla's stock has faced challenges this year due to increased competition and falling sales, but the shares jumped more than 6% following the disclosure of Musk's investment. The company's board has recently proposed new compensation plans to grant Musk a larger stake.</p>
