          <h2>India's Tiger Population Grows, But Conservation Efforts Face Ongoing Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:21:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While India is home to 75% of the world's wild tigers and has seen its population increase, significant risks to their survival persist. The article highlights that deforestation, agricultural expansion, and infrastructure projects are fragmenting tiger habitats, isolating populations and hindering their movement and breeding. Conservationists warn that focusing solely on population numbers overlooks the deterioration of the ecosystems tigers depend on, including the quality of their habitats and prey availability. Issues like human-wildlife conflict, imbalanced sex ratios in reserves, and proposed redrawing of sanctuary boundaries for mining operations pose serious threats to long-term conservation success.</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Identifies Common Misleading Statements Parents Tell Their Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:07:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist with over two decades of experience highlights six common but potentially harmful lies that well-intentioned parents often tell their children. Phrases like "if you put your mind to it, you can accomplish anything" and "big kids don't cry" can set unrealistic expectations and discourage healthy emotional expression. The article argues that such statements can inadvertently harm a child's self-worth, resilience, and relationships in the long run. Instead, the psychologist advises parents to adopt a more balanced approach by redefining success, validating all emotions, and teaching children that it is acceptable to ask for help and prioritize their own well-being.</p>

          <h2>Boeing Narrows Losses and Boosts Sales as Aircraft Deliveries Increase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 10:06:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing has reported a significant reduction in its quarterly losses, accompanied by a 35% jump in revenue, signaling a potential turnaround for the embattled aerospace manufacturer. The improved performance is largely due to the company delivering the most airplanes in a quarter since 2018, a crucial step as it recovers from years of crises. CEO Kelly Ortberg expressed optimism, stating that 2025 could be the company's "turnaround year" if it maintains its focus on safety and stability. Despite the positive signs, Boeing still faces challenges, including a delay in the certification of its 737 Max 7 and Max 10 models until 2026. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A researcher who has studied hundreds of companies transitioning to a four-day workweek has identified three key strategies for their success. According to economist Juliet Schor, these businesses effectively get the same amount of work done in less time by cutting down on inefficient meetings, re-engineering work processes for better efficiency, and eliminating low-impact tasks. For example, companies conducted calendar audits to shorten or delete unnecessary meetings and empowered factory workers to streamline their own workflows. By focusing on high-impact work and improving productivity, these companies have seen benefits like reduced burnout, higher engagement, and boosted profits.</p>

The arrival of the cubs at Manor House Wildlife Park provides a significant boost for the critically endangered species, of which fewer than 400 are estimated to remain in the wild. The birth is the result of a carefully managed European breeding program designed to ensure genetic diversity and the long-term survival of the species.
