          <h2>Changing Tastes of Gen Z Impacting China's Liquor Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 07:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's liquor industry is undergoing a transformation as younger generations shift away from traditional baijiu towards lighter, fruit-flavored beverages. In Baisha, farmers are increasingly growing green plums instead of sorghum, reflecting this change in consumer preference. Liquor brands are innovating to appeal to younger demographics, focusing on low-alcohol options and marketing drinking as a self-indulgent experience rather than a social ritual. Industry insiders believe this shift could disrupt the dominance of baijiu in the Chinese alcohol market, indicating a significant change in drinking culture.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS app in England will become the primary method of communication for millions more patients, with a ¬£50m investment to send test results, appointment reminders, and screening invitations directly to smartphones. This move aims to save the health service ¬£200m over three years by reducing reliance on traditional methods like letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, freeing up NHS phone lines. The NHS app is already used by over 11 million people monthly, with nearly 20 million opted in to receive healthcare messages, enhancing patient access and decision-making.</p>

          <p>Gaziantep, Turkey, is a city deeply passionate about baklava, with shops and even the airport adorned in colors representing the pastry's key ingredients. NPR toured the city with a food engineering professor to explore the history and cultural significance of baklava.

          <p>A woman working from home is facing conflict with her partner's ex-wife over her refusal to care for her stepdaughter during work hours. The woman argues that her job managing a finance team requires her full concentration, making it impossible to provide adequate childcare. She also notes that her stepdaughter often ignores her instructions, adding to the challenge. The situation has caused tension, with the ex-wife arguing that the woman should be available since she works from home, while the woman maintains that working from home is not the same as being a free daycare service.</p>

          <h2>Musk's Departure May Not Halt the DOGE Initiative</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 05:02:02 EDT</div>

          <p>Even after Elon Musk's departure from the Trump administration, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) is continuing its work. With members embedded in multiple agencies, the team's approach to transforming government is becoming "institutionalized," as one official put it. This suggests that the initiatives and policies implemented by DOGE may persist beyond Musk's involvement, potentially reshaping the federal government in the long term. The article focuses on the enduring impact of DOGE despite the recent conflict between Trump and Musk.</p>
