        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that following a low-calorie diet may lead to negative mental health effects, including depressive symptoms. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 29,000 adults and found that those on calorie-restrictive diets, even overweight individuals, experienced an increase in depressive symptom severity. The study also noted that people who followed nutrient-restricted diets saw a larger increase in symptoms, while men on any diet showed higher somatic symptom scores. While the article suggests potential risks, it also emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet and cognitive behavioral therapy to foster healthy habits.</p>

          <p>Uranium mining is experiencing a resurgence in the United States due to increasing electricity demand from AI models and a global push for cleaner energy. The U.S., once a leader in uranium mining, now imports over 95% of its uranium, but recent bipartisan support, including a ban on Russian uranium imports and federal funding, aims to expand domestic uranium enrichment. However, experts note that even with increased production, the U.S. will still rely on other countries for uranium due to limited reserves. Uranium mining companies are working to restart and ramp up domestic production, but face challenges in meeting growing demand. (not investment advice)</p>
