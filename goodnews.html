          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to mandate nutrition courses in American medical schools, threatening to withhold federal funding from those that do not comply. Kennedy believes that medical schools should focus more on preventing illnesses with food and less on treating them with drugs. While some medical schools claim to already offer sufficient nutrition education, others express optimism about the potential for improved standards. The move could significantly impact medical education and healthcare practices.</p>

          <h2>AI Finds Dead Sea Scrolls Are Older Than Previously Thought</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An AI program trained on radiocarbon dating suggests that some Dead Sea Scrolls might be older than previously thought, potentially reshaping our understanding of Judaism and early Christianity. The new method combines AI, radiocarbon dating, and handwriting analysis to more accurately estimate the age of ancient texts. The AI analysis found the manuscripts are older than previous estimates overall, suggesting dates in the early second century BCE, and sometimes slightly earlier. This suggests that scribes were copying multiple literary manuscripts before the rise of the Hasmonaean kingdom.</p>

Two companies confirmed they had received opening price offers from the government, initiating bargaining that could last through October. This is the second round of annual negotiations, authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act, and the lower prices are expected to take effect in January 2027.
