          <p>Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk announced that second-quarter sales for its popular weight-loss drug, Wegovy, surged by 67 percent. Despite this, the company's overall performance was mixed, with shares declining and a recent cut to its full-year outlook due to anticipated weaker U.S. sales for both Wegovy and its diabetes drug, Ozempic. Novo Nordisk is now implementing cost-cutting measures and sharpening its commercial focus amidst increased competition and pressure from the White House to lower U.S. prescription drug prices.

          <p>Saudi Arabia is leading a significant international effort to gain recognition for a Palestinian state, framing it as a path to regional stability. This diplomatic push, which has gained support from several European nations, is seen as a reboot of the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative and aims to create a two-state solution. While some critics view it as a move to improve the Kingdom's image, experts suggest it aligns with Saudi Arabia's long-term strategic interests, including economic diversification under its Vision 2030 plan. The initiative faces opposition from Israel and the U.S., but it represents a major diplomatic effort to resolve the long-standing conflict.</p>

          <p>With major players like OpenAI and Google launching AI-powered study tools, the landscape of education technology is rapidly changing. These new platforms, designed to act as tutors, are challenging established services like Chegg and Quizlet, which are now integrating their own AI features to stay competitive. While many students have adopted AI for tasks like outlining essays, some express concern about over-reliance and the potential for it to cheapen their education. This shift is also forcing professors to adapt their teaching methods, incorporating more in-class and handwritten assignments to ensure genuine learning.</p>

          <p>Mining and commodity trading giant Glencore has decided to maintain its primary stock market listing in London, providing a boost to the London Stock Exchange. After a formal review, the company concluded that a move to New York would not be value-accretive for shareholders at this time, despite arguments that a U.S. listing could offer higher valuations. The decision comes as the company reports a first-half net loss of $655 million, nearly triple the previous year, citing lower commodity prices and uncertainty from U.S. tariff policies.

          <p>A massive evacuation is underway in the eastern German city of Dresden after a 250-kilogram (500-pound) British bomb from World War II was discovered during demolition work on a bridge. Authorities have ordered approximately 17,000 people to leave their homes and hotels in the area to allow for the safe defusal of the unexploded ordnance. The evacuation zone includes several historical landmarks, such as the city's famous Frauenkirche (Church of Our Lady). This is the second such discovery in the same area this year, highlighting the lingering dangers from the war.</p>

          <h2>JPMorgan Analysts Project HSBC to Maintain Top Dividend Yield in Greater China</h2>

          <p>According to an analysis by JPMorgan, HSBC is expected to continue offering the highest dividend yield among banks in the Greater China region, projecting a return to shareholders of 9 to 11 percent this year. The forecast comes after HSBC announced a second-quarter dividend and a new $3 billion stock buyback program. JPMorgan analysts raised their price target for the bank's stock, suggesting that its capital buffer is strong enough to absorb potential impairments from its stake in Bank of Communications (Bocom) without affecting shareholder returns.

          <p>OpenAI has launched two new open-source artificial intelligence models, GPT-OSS-120b and GPT-OSS-20b, in a significant move seen as a direct challenge to China's current leadership in the open-source AI space. The company claims these new models are among the best and most usable in the world, marking a return to its open-source origins after its last such release in 2019. The launch comes as Chinese open-source models, like Alibaba's Qwen family, have been gaining global popularity, setting the stage for increased competition in the development and distribution of powerful AI tools.</p>

          <p>China's campaign to resolve risky local government debt has achieved its first major success, with the Inner Mongolia autonomous region being removed from a national watchlist. The region was one of 12 province-level jurisdictions flagged by Beijing for having dangerously high debt levels. The exit, confirmed in a local budget review, signals progress in the central government's efforts to control financial risks and restructure unsustainable debt held by local authorities. This development is a positive sign for China's broader strategy to stabilize its domestic economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Transitioning from Other Sports to the NFL is So Difficult</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent decision by Welsh rugby star Louis Rees-Zammit to end his pursuit of an NFL career highlights the immense difficulty crossover athletes face. Experts point to several major hurdles, including the complexity of learning an NFL playbook, which one former player described as more difficult than studying for the bar exam. Another significant factor is the sheer depth of athletic talent available in the U.S., particularly for "skill positions" like running back and wide receiver. While some, like offensive lineman Jordan Mailata, have succeeded, the transition requires a rare combination of elite physical traits and rapid learning ability.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy made a powerful return to the Los Angeles Dodgers lineup, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs in a 12-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. His performance provided a much-needed spark for the team, which had been in a significant offensive slump during the month he was sidelined with a knee injury. Muncy's comeback is a major boost for the Dodgers, who were relatively quiet at the trade deadline and are counting on the return of key players to reinvigorate their offense. The game also saw other slumping hitters show signs of life.</p>

          <p>At 87 years old, Buscarita Roa is one of the last two active members of the Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo, the grandmothers who have spent nearly 50 years searching for children stolen during Argentina's military dictatorship. The regime "disappeared" an estimated 30,000 people, and hundreds of babies were taken from their parents and given to military families. Roa, whose own granddaughter was taken in 1978 and found in 2000, recounts the decades of relentless searching and protest. With nearly 300 grandchildren still missing, she says the legacy of the Abuelas will be carried on by the generation they fought to find.</p>
