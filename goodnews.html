          <p>The UK government will underwrite a £1.5 billion loan to support Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) and its suppliers following a prolonged production halt caused by a major cyberattack. The attack, which occurred at the end of August, has cost the automaker an estimated £50 million per week and threatened the solvency of smaller businesses in its supply chain. Business Secretary Peter Kyle stated the loan guarantee is intended to protect thousands of jobs across the UK. This marks a significant instance of government intervention to mitigate the economic fallout from a cybersecurity incident on a major manufacturer.</p>

          <p>A new memoir by King Charles III's former butler, Grant Harrold, reveals details about Prince Philip's notoriously blunt and often profane communication style. Harrold recounts hearing the late Duke of Edinburgh exclaim, "Thank f--- that’s over," after Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s wedding. The article compiles anecdotes from various sources illustrating Philip's impatience and unfiltered opinions, which were often feared by palace staff but also seen by some as a genuine and endearing quality. His remarks were a well-known part of his public persona throughout his life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The biznaga, a species of barrel cactus, is facing extinction in Mexico due to its use in a traditional crystallized candy called acitrón. Despite a government ban on its sale, the candy remains popular and is widely available in markets, especially for use in the national dish, chiles en nogada. Biologists explain that the cactus grows extremely slowly, making commercial farming impractical and leading to illegal harvesting from the wild. Some chefs are now promoting sustainable alternatives, like candied squash, to preserve the endangered plant while honoring culinary traditions.</p>

          <p>Faced with soaring housing prices, which have risen 56% since 2020, a growing number of Americans are co-buying homes with friends or relatives. This trend is particularly prevalent among younger generations and single individuals who are priced out of the market on their own. Combining incomes allows buyers to overcome the significant "couple's advantage" in housing affordability, unlocking more purchasing options. While the strategy offers a financial solution, experts advise co-buyers to create formal legal agreements to navigate potential future complications regarding property ownership and shared expenses.</p>

          <p>Switzerland is holding a second national referendum on the introduction of an electronic identity card system. A previous proposal was rejected in 2021 due to concerns that private companies would manage the system and data. The revised plan ensures the e-ID system will be entirely state-run, optional, and will store data on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue it will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears about potential privacy erosion and data tracking, despite the new safeguards.</p>

          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to significantly restrict the use of leaf blowers and vacuums to curb noise and air pollution. If passed, the measure would completely ban gas-powered models within the city. Electric devices would be permitted only from October to December without special permission. Supporters of the ban cite the machines' loud noise, the fine dust they spread, and their harm to microorganisms, recommending rakes as an alternative. Opponents argue the ban is an example of excessive regulation that would create unnecessary difficulties.</p>

Housing Secretary Steve Reed is set to announce the plans, which aim to address the country's housing crisis and stimulate economic growth.

          <p>The Trump administration's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa fees could inadvertently boost the technology sectors in the Middle East, particularly in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. As the U.S. potentially becomes more restrictive, Gulf nations are actively trying to attract top global talent with high compensation packages, a tax-friendly environment, and long-term "golden visas." These countries are investing billions into becoming global AI hubs and offer a business-friendly climate that could outcompete other regions for skilled professionals. This shift could reshape the global distribution of tech expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has struggled to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season, scoring only once from a corner or free-kick. The club recently hired set-piece specialist Martin Mark from Danish club Midtjylland to improve their effectiveness in this area. The article notes a shift in strategy, including a significant increase in the use of long throws into the penalty box. Head coach Eddie Howe acknowledges that this aspect of their game needs work, especially ahead of their match against Arsenal, a team that has been highly successful.</p>
