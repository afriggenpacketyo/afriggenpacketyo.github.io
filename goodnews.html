          <p>Scientists at the Field Museum of Chicago have uncovered new details about a well-preserved Archaeopteryx fossil, revealing insights into early bird evolution. Using UV light and CT scans, the article reports that researchers identified soft tissues and anatomical traits indicating that Archaeopteryx, while capable of flight, likely spent more time on the ground and could climb trees. The fossil showed the presence of tertials, specialized feathers crucial for flight, suggesting their specific evolution for aerial locomotion. This discovery contributes to ongoing debates about Archaeopteryx's classification as a bird and its flight capabilities, emphasizing the fossil's significance in understanding the transition from dinosaurs to birds.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced better-than-expected revenue in its first earnings report since going public. The article reports that revenue soared 420% year-over-year, driven by a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite a widened net loss due to stock-based compensation, the company projects strong revenue growth for the upcoming quarter and the full year, requiring significant capital expenditures. CEO Mike Intrator attributed the increased capital spending to new clients and demand for infrastructure, while also stating that tariffs are not expected to have a meaningful impact. Investors initially reacted positively, but shares declined in extended trading as they tried to understand the company's metrics.</p>

          <p>The UK will now permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new legislation. According to the article, this move follows a previous ban prompted by a takeover bid of the Telegraph and the Spectator by a firm backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. The new law allows State Owned Investors (SOIs) to take a minority stake in UK newspapers, with the government stating that the changes would protect media plurality while helping publishers raise vital funding. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said that the balanced approach will remove a potential chilling effect on press sustainability.</p>

          <p>Engineers at NASA have successfully revived thrusters aboard Voyager 1, the farthest spacecraft from Earth, averting a potential communications blackout. The article reports that the fix to the vehicle's original roll thrusters, which had been out of action since 2004, could help keep the spacecraft operating until it can contact home again next year. The revival was necessary due to upgrades to an Earth-based antenna, which could have left the probe without a way to save the mission if the thrusters failed. The team's creativity and risk-taking enabled them to restart the long-dormant thrusters.</p>
