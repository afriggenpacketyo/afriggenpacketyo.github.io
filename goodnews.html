          <p>China has indicated its willingness to collaborate with the United States on addressing issues related to anti-drug efforts, particularly fentanyl, and the repatriation of illegal immigrants. This commitment was conveyed during a meeting between Minister of Public Security Wang Xiaohong and US Ambassador to China David Perdue in Beijing. Wang emphasized the need for "mutual respect" from Washington and expressed hope that the US would uphold an attitude of equality and address each other's concerns. Last year, both countries held meetings to discuss closer cooperation, establishing anti-drug hotlines for information sharing, and Perdue expressed his willingness to promote US-China relations and advance cooperation in law enforcement areas.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has expressed disappointment with the Ninth Circuit Court's decision to allow President Trump to maintain control of the California National Guard, while also claiming a victory in the court's rejection of Trump's assertion of unlimited authority. Newsom emphasized that the court rejected Trump's claim that he can federalize the National Guard at will without judicial oversight. The ruling stems from Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles to quell riots during demonstrations against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a move Newsom criticized as an authoritarian overreach.</p>

He specified that the children would not have access to their inheritance for 30 years, encouraging them to build their own lives and trust in their abilities. Durov also addressed criminal charges he faces in France, where he was arrested for allegedly failing to properly moderate the app to reduce criminality, describing the charges as "totally absurd".</p>

          <p>In rural Uganda, a tougher bicycle known as the Buffalo Bicycle is providing hope for better health coverage. These bicycles are supplied to "village doctors" who can use them to transport patients, deliver medication, and report issues to authorities. World Bicycle Relief, a Chicago-based nonprofit, promotes the Buffalo Bicycle in remote parts of Africa, collaborating with governments and NGOs to improve access to health services. The Buffalo Bicycle's heavy-gauge steel frame is durable in rough terrain, reducing the need for frequent repairs. CHEWs using the bicycles reported a 108% increase in households reached each week, and the time to reach health facilities dropped by nearly half.</p>

          <p>Recent fire exchanges between Israel and Iran have highlighted the effectiveness of Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system. This has renewed discussions about the U.S. President Donald Trump's proposed Golden Dome multi-layered missile defense system, a costly project aimed at defending the U.S. from ballistic, hypersonic, and cruise missiles. Private space companies, facing budget cuts at NASA, are vying for a piece of the project's pie, especially after Elon Musk's recent public feud with Trump left SpaceX's potential role in the scheme under question. The House Appropriations Committee unveiled the draft of its fiscal 2026 defense spending bill that features a $13 billion allocation for "missile defense and space programs to augment and integrate in support of the Golden Dome effort."

          <p>Chinese scientists have created an edible, washable protein-based coating that can extend the shelf life of fruits by 2¬Ω times. The coating reduces moisture loss and microbial growth, costing just 9 US cents per kilogram of fruit. Tested on 17 varieties of whole and cut fruits, including strawberries, tomatoes, kiwis, and mangoes, the coating effectively delays rot by almost a week or more. This strategy offers a promising solution to global food waste by providing an eco-friendly alternative to existing preservation methods.</p>
