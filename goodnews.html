          <h2>Child Nutritionist Offers Five Tips to Reduce Stress During Mealtimes with Fussy Eaters</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 20:19:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fussy eating is a normal developmental stage for more than half of children, and parents should not blame themselves, according to child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed. She recommends five key strategies to make mealtimes less stressful, including letting children choose whether to eat and avoiding labels like "good" or "bad" for food. Other tips include making mealtime enjoyable with non-food activities, being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite, and involving them in food preparation to build familiarity. The focus should be on modeling a balanced diet rather than pressuring the child to eat.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 20:09:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is presented as a joyful response to a difficult period in his life, incorporating cultural influences from his international tours, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. The article notes the inclusion of instruments like the sitar and tabla, and a collaboration with Indian superstar Arjit Singh. However, the review suggests that while these elements add new flavors, they are largely assimilated into Sheeran's familiar, frictionless pop style rather than deeply exploring new musical traditions. The album is seen as a commercially savvy effort that plays to his strengths but misses an opportunity for greater artistic adventure.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, mirroring gains from Wall Street where all three major U.S. indexes closed at record levels. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw increases, driven by growing investor optimism. This positive sentiment is fueled by easing inflation pressures and widespread expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will soon implement interest rate cuts. The rally reflects a broader global trend where the promise of easier monetary policy from central banks is boosting equity markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A program called Reflection Point is helping businesses build empathy and improve teamwork by functioning as a redesigned book club for the workplace. Employees gather to discuss curated short stories, allowing them to share life experiences and practice communication skills in a structured, non-confrontational setting. The initiative's founder, Ann Kowal Smith, emphasizes that these discussions provide a space for colleagues to practice the skills needed to work together effectively. Research cited from the Harvard Business Review suggests a direct link between corporate empathy and financial success, with more empathetic companies outperforming their peers.</p>

          <p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency company founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has reportedly priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, valuing the exchange at approximately $3.3 billion. The pricing was above the initially expected range, indicating strong investor demand for the company's stock, which will trade under the ticker "GEMI." The offering comes as Gemini has reported widening financial losses but also recently received a $50 million strategic investment from Nasdaq. The IPO's performance will be a key indicator of market appetite for crypto-related companies amid recent consolidation in cryptocurrency prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service is examining Denmark's cancer treatment strategy as a potential model for improvement, after the Scandinavian country dramatically boosted its cancer survival rates over the past 25 years. Denmark transformed its approach through significant investment in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict national standards for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and holding the system accountable. The Danish model also focuses on patient experience, with elements like at-home chemotherapy and counseling centers. UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has confirmed that insights from Denmark are being incorporated into a new long-term cancer plan for England.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down an apartheid-era law, ruling that it was discriminatory and unconstitutional to prevent husbands from taking their wives' last names. The court declared that the existing legislation, which only allowed women to change their name upon marriage, violated gender equality principles and was a "colonial import." The ruling noted that in many traditional African cultures, women retained their birth names. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the judgment, which was celebrated by some as progressive but criticized by others online.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's $12 trillion stock market are testing the government's ability to manage the rally without creating another boom-and-bust cycle. Beijing aims to cultivate a stable bull market that can serve as a reliable source of household wealth, shifting reliance away from the property market and boosting consumer spending. After a recent pullback moderated the rapid ascent, regulators may be hoping for a transition to a "slow bull" market. The goal is to avoid the volatility of the past and foster steady, long-term growth that supports the broader economy. (not investment advice)</p>
