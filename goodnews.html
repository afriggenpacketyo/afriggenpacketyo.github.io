          <p>Despite new travel restrictions implemented by the Trump administration, certain individuals, including World Cup players, dual citizens, and those with existing visas, are exempt from the ban. The proclamation, citing national security interests, restricts travel from several countries, but these exceptions allow for continued participation in international events and travel for individuals already vetted or holding specific statuses. This decision reflects a balance between security concerns and the need to maintain international cooperation and facilitate global events. The exemptions are intended to minimize disruption while still addressing potential security risks.</p>

          <p>A report by Renewables First, a Pakistani think tank, highlights how the influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants in Pakistan, creating stranded assets. Pakistan has become a major destination for Chinese solar panels due to a zero tax rate on imports. This transition to decentralized solar power is causing a strategic contradiction, where China's solar panels are outcompeting China's power plants. The report raises questions about the long-term economic implications and the need for a balanced energy transition strategy in the Global South. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is focusing on encouraging domestic tourism to revitalize regional areas, as inbound visitors outpace local travelers. The Japan Tourism Agency's annual white paper reveals that domestic trips have not returned to pre-pandemic levels, despite a record number of foreign tourists. The agency plans to promote a new style of travel that emphasizes engagement between travelers and local communities, aiming to foster repeat visits and a sense of belonging. Initiatives include facilitating opportunities for interaction and removing barriers to travel, such as reluctance to take time off work, which will ultimately help rejuvenate Japan's domestic tourism sector.</p>

The outcome of the referendum has cultural implications, as it could recognize the dignity and diversity of millions of should-be-compatriots, enriching the national story with new protagonists.

Through a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period, researchers gained insight into how feathers evolved during this era. An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs in the ancient world did not have the same ability to fly.</p>

The order halts restart efforts on the operation‚Äôs onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The ruling celebrates environmental groups and plaintiffs who argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process.
