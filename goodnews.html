        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that U.S. gas prices are set to decrease over the summer, potentially offering the cheapest fuel costs since 2021. An expert from GasBuddy suggests the national average could fall below $3 a gallon by September, following a temporary spike caused by Middle East tensions. The expected decline is attributed to factors like the end of the switch to more expensive summer-blend gasoline and increased production. This trend points towards a period of relief for American drivers at the pump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial planners suggest that outsourcing laundry can be a worthwhile expense if it aligns with your financial and personal priorities. The article advises calculating your personal hourly rate to determine if the cost of the service is less than the value of your time. Experts also recommend considering the emotional benefit; if outsourcing a dreaded chore reduces stress and prevents burnout, it can be a wise investment in your well-being. However, they caution that this convenience should not come at the expense of long-term financial goals like retirement or emergency savings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that Zohran Mamdani's victory in the New York City mayoral primary was significantly influenced by the grassroots Palestinian liberation movement. The author contends that years of activism have shifted public opinion, making Mamdani's vocal support for Palestine an asset rather than a liability, even within the traditionally pro-Israel Democratic establishment. The campaign's success is attributed to a coalition of organized activists who were already engaged in progressive politics and saw Mamdani as an alternative to politicians who overlook the Palestinian cause. His win is framed as a testament to the movement's growing influence on domestic politics.</p>

This corporate adoption is supported by growing regulatory momentum in Washington, with a bipartisan Senate bill aiming to establish rules for consumer protection and reserve requirements.
