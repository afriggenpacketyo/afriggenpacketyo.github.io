          <p>Al DiStefano, a 77-year-old man in Texas, has been reunited with his Fordham University class ring more than half a century after it slipped from his finger into the waters off Long Island, New York. The ring was discovered this summer by David Orlowski, an electrician using a metal detector, who decided to track down the owner rather than sell the valuable palladium it is made from. Through an online search and a university alumni Facebook page, Orlowski successfully found DiStefano, who called the ring's return a "miracle." The story highlights a heartwarming act of integrity and connection across decades and distance.</p>

          <p>"Saturday Night Live" is facing a significant cast shake-up ahead of its 51st season, with veteran Heidi Gardner and several other performers announcing their exits. Gardner, an eight-season regular known for her memorable characters, is leaving alongside featured players Michael Longfellow, Devon Walker, and Emil Wakim. The departures follow the show's 50th-anniversary season, after which producer Lorne Michaels indicated it was time for a change. These moves signal a period of reinvention for the long-running sketch comedy show as it prepares for a new era.</p>

          <p>Shares of buy-now, pay-later company Affirm surged after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue. The company's key volume metric grew significantly, driven by partnerships with major retailers like Shopify and Amazon, despite losing Walmart as a client. CEO Max Levchin highlighted continued strength in consumer spending and noted that the company's Affirm Card is gaining traction, with its usage volume growing 132%. The strong performance and optimistic guidance suggest robust momentum for the firm amid a competitive e-commerce landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. stock market concluded a successful August with a slight downturn, breaking a four-week winning streak for the S&P 500. Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the week's modest decline. Inflation concerns also lingered as the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation rising to its highest annual rate since February. Despite the weekly dip, the S&P 500 still posted a gain of roughly 2% for the month, with markets still anticipating a Fed interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Newly Discovered Fossils Reveal Ancient Armored Dinosaur with Fused Spikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 14:44:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered more fossils of Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, revealing it was an unusually armed "punk rocker" dinosaur that lived 165 million years ago. The new findings, published in the journal *Nature*, show that the herbivorous dinosaur had long bony spikes fused directly onto its rib bones, a feature never before seen in any other vertebrate. This discovery challenges previous theories about the evolution of ankylosaurs, which were thought to have developed their heavy armor later in response to large predators. The fossils, found in Morocco, paint a picture of one of the strangest dinosaurs ever discovered.</p>

          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won re-election decisively this week, four years after he says white officials locked him out of town hall and prevented him from serving. The election, the town's first since the 1960s, was held as part of a federal settlement after Braxton sued over the town's "hand-me-down" system of governance where mayors appointed their successors. In 2020, Braxton was the sole candidate but was blocked from taking office, leading to a prolonged legal fight. His victory is seen as a landmark moment for democratic representation in the small, majority-Black town.</p>

          <p>After a decade focused on smaller, more intimate tours featuring his original songs, "Weird Al" Yankovic is back with a large-scale production, "The Bigger & Weirder" tour. Yankovic explains that he stepped away from his famous parodies partly because he wanted to prove he was "more than just the parody guy" and because the fragmented pop music landscape made it harder to choose targets. Now, the 65-year-old musician has re-embraced the full spectacle, complete with costume changes, video screens, and an expanded band. The tour features his classic hits, demonstrating his enduring appeal and the meticulous craftsmanship behind his comedic music.</p>

          <p>Bank of America has increased its price target for Snowflake stock, viewing the company's recent strong quarter as a turning point in its transition into a comprehensive enterprise data platform. The company's product revenue grew 32% year-over-year, and its net revenue retention rate ticked up for the first time in 13 quarters, indicating increased spending from existing customers. Analysts noted that clients are now using Snowflake for a wider range of workloads beyond core analytics, including AI and data science, justifying its premium valuation compared to other large-cap software companies.

He contrasts his son's experience with his own first day of school in a dirt-floor building in rural Uganda, a stark reminder of the disparities in educational opportunities worldwide. The author, who was orphaned by the AIDS epidemic and later adopted by an American family, sees his son's milestone as the culmination of his own journey and the sacrifices made by many.

          <p>For seniors looking to tap into their home equity without sacrificing low mortgage rates through refinancing, several options remain viable. The article highlights three primary methods: reverse mortgages, home equity loans, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs). A reverse mortgage, available to homeowners 62 and older, allows for receiving payments from equity without requiring monthly repayments. Home equity loans offer a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, while HELOCs provide a flexible line of credit with variable rates, allowing homeowners to leverage record-high equity levels amid a challenging interest rate environment.
