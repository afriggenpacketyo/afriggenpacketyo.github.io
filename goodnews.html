          <p>Taiwan is collaborating with local and U.S. defense innovators to display uncrewed surface vehicle (USV) technologies that could be used for military purposes, strengthening its asymmetric warfare capabilities against China. A two-day USV demonstration at Suao port features 12 companies, with the government-backed National Chung-Shan Institute of Science and Technology organizing the event. Data collected will be used to develop a standardized control system and modular platforms for patrol, search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and logistics missions. The aim is to enhance flexibility, general applicability, and production scalability for both military and civilian applications.</p>

          <p>The film "Trans Los Angeles," directed by Kase Pe√±a, explores the diverse experiences of transgender individuals in Los Angeles through three vignettes, addressing issues like ICE raids, spirituality, sex work, and babysitting. Pe√±a, inspired by the lack of representation for trans stories, drew from personal experiences and community members' narratives. The film highlights the challenges faced by undocumented trans women, as well as the importance of community support. The director cast transmasculine actor Jordan Gonzalez in a cisgender role, challenging industry norms and promoting inclusivity.</p>

          <p>China is leading the world in converting decommissioned coal-mining sites into solar power projects, which could advance the clean energy transition and reduce a surplus of solar panels. According to Global Energy Monitor (GEM), China has 90 former coal mines operating as solar power facilities, totaling 14 gigawatts (GW), with an additional 46 projects (9GW) planned. Outside of China, 14 countries are pursuing similar conversion projects, targeting 11GW of solar capacity. These projects offer a chance to combine land restoration, job creation, and clean energy deployment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order that required Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. The ruling allows individuals to choose their gender identity when renewing or applying for passports, including selecting "X" for those who do not identify as male or female. The executive order, issued by Mr. Trump, reversed a policy under the Biden administration that allowed for self-selection of gender on passport applications. The ACLU sued the Trump administration over the policy, claiming it was discriminatory against transgender and nonbinary individuals.</p>

          <p>Coach Sean McVay indicated that the Rams' chances of trading for cornerback Jalen Ramsey are diminishing due to several "obstacles," including financial considerations. Ramsey is due to earn $24.3 million this season, and his salary-cap number will increase substantially in the coming seasons. McVay acknowledged the need for pre-existing plans to execute such a trade, referencing Matthew Stafford's contract adjustment and Davante Adams' signing. The Rams are set to open the season with a cornerback group that includes returning starters Darious Williams and Ahkello Witherspoon, with several others competing for playing time.</p>

          <p>Retailer Co-op is offering its members ¬£10 off a minimum shop of ¬£40 following disruption caused by a recent cyber attack. The grocery chain said it had not yet completely recovered from being targeted by hackers last month, which resulted in a significant amount of customer data being stolen. The one-off deal, which runs from Wednesday for a week, is open to existing Co-op members, and shoppers wanting to sign up, but not to staff. One analyst said the majority of customers do not spend ¬£40 or more per shop, so it would not appeal to many people. (not investment advice)</p>
