The organization, which is home to the world's largest assistance dog breeding program, was pleasantly surprised by the large number of arrivals.

          <p>New York Knicks player Josh Hart recently used social media to celebrate a reported increase in Christian faith across the United States. He re-shared a Fox News segment that highlighted rising Bible sales, increased downloads of religious mobile apps, and growing streams of contemporary Christian music. The post elicited a mixed reaction online, with many users praising him for his public display of faith and offering support against critics. Others, however, criticized him for amplifying what they considered a right-wing media talking point. Hart is coming off a successful season where he was a key contributor for the Knicks.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 1,500-year history, the Grand Sumo Tournament is being held outside of Japan, taking place this week at London's Royal Albert Hall. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as Rikishi, competing in a specially constructed ring made from 11 tons of clay shipped from Japan. Organizers have worked diligently to preserve the sport's deep cultural and religious Shinto traditions, including building a roof for the ring styled after a Shinto shrine. To make the culturally rich sport accessible to a Western audience, the venue is providing in-ear English commentary and video replays to explain the complex rules and techniques.</p>

          <p>Upgrade, a fintech startup founded by LendingClub creator Renaud Laplanche, has raised $165 million in a new funding round, bringing its valuation to $7.3 billion. The company, which has been cash-flow positive for three years, offers a range of financial services including personal loans, credit cards, and checking accounts. Having expanded its offerings and more than doubled its revenue since its last funding round in 2021, Upgrade's annualized revenue surpassed $1 billion in May. Laplanche indicated the new capital will bolster the company's balance sheet and establish a new valuation as it prepares for a potential IPO within the next 12 to 18 months.

          <h2>Instagram's Move Toward 'PG-13' Content Highlights Challenges of Creating an Age-Appropriate Internet</h2>

          <p>Instagram has announced new default settings for teen accounts that aim to filter content to a level similar to a "PG-13 movie," reflecting a broader trend of digital media platforms becoming more like television. This article explores the concept of an age-gated internet, with separate experiences for children, teens, and adults, but highlights the immense challenges of effective age verification. Current methods are often unreliable, circumvented by tech-savvy kids, and raise significant privacy and free speech concerns. While creating safer online spaces for children is a bipartisan goal, the path to a regulated, multi-tiered internet remains fraught with technical and civil liberties obstacles.</p>

          <p>The New York City mayoral race is heading towards a pivotal debate featuring three distinct candidates: Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, former Governor Andrew Cuomo running as an independent, and Republican Curtis Sliwa. Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, is the current frontrunner with a progressive platform that includes free bus service and city-owned grocery stores. Cuomo, a moderate Democrat, is attempting a political comeback after resigning in 2021 amid a sexual harassment scandal. The race has drawn national attention due to its high-profile personalities and the starkly different visions they offer for the future of America's largest city.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 06:31:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Uruguay's senate has passed a law to decriminalize euthanasia, making it the first country in Latin America to do so via legislative action. The law permits a healthcare professional to perform euthanasia for mentally competent adult patients suffering from an incurable illness that causes "unbearable suffering," without requiring a terminal diagnosis. This move reinforces Uruguay's reputation as one of the most socially liberal nations in the region, having previously legalized recreational marijuana, same-sex marriage, and abortion. While the Catholic Church voiced strong opposition, the country's secular culture allowed the bill to pass with a significant majority after five years of debate.</p>

          <h2>British Library Reissues Oscar Wilde's Reader's Card 130 Years After It Was Revoked</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-16 06:30:15 EDT</div>

          <p>The British Library has posthumously reissued a reader's card to the celebrated Irish writer Oscar Wilde, 130 years after his original was revoked following his 1895 conviction for "gross indecency." Wilde was excluded from the library's reading room due to his criminal charge for homosexual relationships. The new card, which will be collected by his grandson Merlin Holland, is intended to acknowledge the "immense suffering and injustices" Wilde faced. Holland called the gesture a symbol of forgiveness that his grandfather's spirit would appreciate. The library holds handwritten drafts of some of Wilde's most famous works, including "The Importance of Being Earnest."</p>

          <h2>Investigation Reveals How Alleged Thieves in Massive Brink's Heist Were Tracked</h2>

          <p>Investigators have detailed how they identified the suspects behind one of the largest jewelry heists in U.S. history, a theft of up to $100 million from a Brink's truck in 2022. A critical mistake was made when one alleged thief gave his burner phone number to a police officer after witnessing a traffic collision the night before the heist. Authorities used cell tower data to track pings from that phone and others along the truck's route, linking the suspects to the crime. In June, seven men were indicted for their alleged roles in the theft, with investigators recovering some luxury watches and cash, though the majority of the stolen goods remain missing.</p>
