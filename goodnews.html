          <p>China's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has introduced a new action plan to regulate the non-ferrous metals sector, aiming to curb intense competition and optimize industrial structure. The plan projects a modest 1.5% output growth for primary non-ferrous metals this year, a notable decrease from the previous 4.3%, shifting focus from quantity to quality. It emphasizes achieving an average annual growth rate of approximately 5% in value-added output. This initiative also calls for advancements in exploring critical resources like copper, aluminum, lithium, nickel, cobalt, and tin, alongside developing ultra-pure metals and enhancing battery recycling, addressing current challenges like depressed processing fees.</p>

The article argues that Europe's superior Ryder Cup culture, meticulous planning, and cohesive strategy, spearheaded by Captain Luke Donald, contrasted sharply with the U.S. team's self-centered leadership and flawed course setup decisions. Donald's focus on collective effort and data-driven partnerships proved decisive, allowing Europe to build an insurmountable lead. The analysis suggests the U.S. struggles to replicate Europe's team-oriented success, often performing better as individuals than as a unified squad.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene caused devastating floods in eastern Tennessee, a group of whitewater raft guides has transitioned to "professional trash ladies" to clean up the Nolichucky River. The hurricane's remnants, combined with heavy rains, caused unprecedented geological changes and forced most rafting companies to cease operations. Through state-funded relief grants, out-of-work guides are now paid to remove debris like car parts and household items from the riverbanks, filling large rafts with garbage. This community effort not only provides employment but also aims to restore the watershed, with hopes of reopening for the 2026 season.</p>
