          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers' Shohei Ohtani made his pitching return against the San Diego Padres, allowing a single run in one inning. Ohtani gave up singles to the first two batters before a sacrifice fly scored a run. His fastball reached 100 mph during the outing, which came earlier than initially expected due to the Dodgers' pitching injuries. Ohtani last pitched on August 23, 2023, and underwent elbow surgery a month later, making this a significant step in his recovery and return to his two-way role. The outing marked a milestone in Ohtani's career as he continues to balance hitting and pitching for the Dodgers. </p>

          <p>Firefighters in Ventura County, California, are working to contain two brush fires, the Howe fire and the Maria fire. The Howe fire, the larger of the two, has burned approximately 40 acres in steep terrain near Piru, with helicopters assisting in water drops. The Maria fire, located near Santa Paula, burned about 15 acres and has been contained, although crews continue to conduct clean-up operations. Mild winds are expected to carry smoke from the Howe fire eastward, and over 140 firefighters are on scene or en route to combat the blazes. </p>

          <p>Shares of South Korea's SK Hynix experienced a surge, reaching a two-decade high, following reports that SK Group intends to construct the country's largest AI data center. The data center, planned in partnership with Amazon Web Services in Ulsan, will involve SK Telecom and SK Broadband, along with support from SK Hynix. SK Hynix, a leading supplier of DRAM, has seen its shares rise nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom. Samsung Electronics' market cap has declined as it struggles to capitalize on AI-led demand, while SK Hynix has become a leader in high bandwidth memory for AI servers. </p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his pitching debut for the Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after nearly two years following Tommy John surgery. Ohtani pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits and a sacrifice fly, while also touching 100 mph with his fastball. Although his command appeared rusty, the event was momentous, demonstrating his arm's resilience after surgery. Manager Dave Roberts praised Ohtani's unique undertaking, and the Dodgers plan to gradually increase his workload in future appearances. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament is set to debate a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but allows it up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under specific conditions, requiring approval from two doctors. One amendment seeks to prevent investigations and prosecutions of women terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining penalties for medical professionals and violent partners. Recent data shows a record number of abortions in England and Wales, coupled with an increase in police inquiries related to suspected abortion offenses. </p>
