          <p>Oscar Piastri of McLaren emerged victorious at the Miami Grand Prix, marking his fourth win of the season, followed closely by his teammate Lando Norris after a heated battle with Max Verstappen. Piastri showcased exceptional skill, overtaking both Kimi Antonelli of Mercedes and Verstappen to seize the lead and maintain it until the race's end. Norris recovered impressively from an early setback, while George Russell of Mercedes secured the final podium spot, fending off Verstappen. Ferrari experienced internal team tensions as Lewis Hamilton's request to pass Charles Leclerc was initially denied before being accepted, however Hamilton could not capitalize on the opportunity.</p>

          <p>Dustin May's inconsistency with his sweeper pitch proved costly as the Dodgers lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-3, ending their seven-game winning streak. May allowed four runs, all scored on home runs by Austin Riley resulting from poorly executed sweepers. Despite striking out six and pitching 5 ‚Öî innings, May's recent performance has been disappointing, with 14 runs allowed in his last three starts. The Dodgers' offense struggled against Braves starter Bryce Elder, and despite late efforts, they couldn't overcome the early deficit.</p>

          <h2>Experts Caution Women About the Risks and Costs of Relying on Egg Freezing</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing to preserve their fertility, some experts caution against relying on the procedure, citing its high cost and lack of guarantees. Vardit Ravitsky, president of the Hastings Center, warns that egg freezing is a gamble with financial and medical risks, and even successful pregnancies can be riskier at older ages. Critics also argue that the emphasis on profits in private equity-backed fertility companies can create warped incentives, potentially pressuring doctors to encourage more cycles to generate more revenue. Despite the criticisms, egg freezing continues to grow in popularity.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is gaining popularity among young women as a means to preserve their fertility, offering a chance to delay motherhood without compromising their biological clock. The procedure, once primarily used for medical reasons, has become an accepted practice, with demand skyrocketing and investors recognizing its potential. While egg freezing offers women greater control over their reproductive timelines, experts caution that it is not a guarantee and comes with financial costs and medical risks. Despite concerns about commercialization and accessibility, egg freezing is seen by many as a revolutionary option for women to balance career aspirations with family planning.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing has become increasingly popular among women, allowing them to preserve their fertility and delay motherhood. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen. While it offers women more control over their reproductive choices, it is not a guarantee and comes with significant costs, averaging $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle, plus storage fees. Despite the expense, many women see it as a worthwhile investment in their future, providing them with options and reducing the pressure to find a partner or settle down.</p>
