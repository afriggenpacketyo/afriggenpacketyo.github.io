          <p>Los Angeles Opera concludes its season with a new production of Verdi's 'Rigoletto,' featuring baritone Quinn Kelsey in the title role and conducted by James Conlon. The production, directed by Tomer Zvulun, is a violent and politically disquieting interpretation set in fascist Italy. Despite some shortcomings in the set design, the performance is saved by the strong cast, particularly Kelsey and Lisette Oropesa as Gilda.
