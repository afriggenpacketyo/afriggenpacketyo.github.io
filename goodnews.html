          <p>Actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has shared that the only early symptom he experienced was a change in bowel movements, which he initially dismissed. The article emphasizes his story to raise awareness, as he considered himself healthy and was unaware the recommended screening age had dropped to 45. Medical experts quoted in the article confirm that such changes are a primary red flag and stress the critical importance of early screening and detection, as many colorectal cancers develop without obvious signs until they are advanced.</p>

The blaze, which has burned 5,370 acres near the Los Angeles county line, has stopped growing, and evacuation orders for residents have been lifted. The fire destroyed seven structures and resulted in injuries to three firefighters, one of them serious. Crews continue to monitor the area and strengthen containment lines amid ongoing hot temperatures and potential wind gusts, with some personnel possibly being released to handle other incidents.</p>

He emphasized that while the meeting is important, any final negotiations regarding territory or a peace deal must involve Ukraine, and NATO's military support for Kyiv will continue regardless of the summit's outcome.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explains that Apple's significant 13% weekly stock rally was largely fueled by a "short squeeze," where investors betting against the stock were forced to buy shares, driving the price up unexpectedly. This occurred despite prevailing negative sentiment among many traders regarding Apple's perceived lack of an AI strategy and potential regulatory headwinds from an antitrust ruling. The powerful squeeze obscured negative trends elsewhere in the market, highlighting how a few heavyweight stocks can distort the performance of major averages. (not investment advice)</p>

The film depicted the perilous 1970 Apollo 13 mission, which became known as a "successful failure" after the crew safely returned to Earth against all odds following an in-flight explosion.

          <p>The Japanese mindfulness practice of 'forest bathing,' known as shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a method for improving focus and lowering stress. The practice involves immersing oneself in nature and connecting with the environment through all five senses. Experts note that it contrasts with the typically distracting and stressful nature of modern daily life. The benefits can be achieved in any green space, from a national park to a local garden, and even short, 15-minute sessions can be beneficial for mental health.</p>

          <p>Branding agency founder Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that building a personal brand is a vital strategy for introverts to gain recognition and advance their careers. She defines a personal brand as simply what people know you for and suggests it can be developed through small, consistent actions like networking or posting online. Chan emphasizes that this allows introverts to shape their own narrative in the workplace, overcoming the tendency for their talents to be underestimated, and can be built through both professional and personal interests.</p>

          <p>A review of a new biography, "Electric Spark," examines the life of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that she should be remembered as one of modern Britain's most important religious writers. The article posits that Spark's conversion to Roman Catholicism was the central influence on her work, shaping her darkly comic and satirical style. Her novels often explore themes of divine power, free will, and judgment by creating a narrative relationship where she, as the author, plays a god-like role in the lives of her characters.</p>
