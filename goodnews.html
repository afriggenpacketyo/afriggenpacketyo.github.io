          <p>A federal judge ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, from immigration detention, citing concerns that her detention could chill the speech of noncitizens. Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, was detained for six weeks, allegedly in retaliation for an essay critical of Israel she co-wrote in a student newspaper. The judge emphasized that there was no evidence she posed a threat to American foreign policy interests beyond the op-ed. The judge said he wanted to give Ms. Ozturk maximum mobility so she could pursue the educational opportunities that she needed to complete her doctorate. Her lawyer accused the government of detaining her in retaliation for speech that is protected by the First Amendment.</p>
