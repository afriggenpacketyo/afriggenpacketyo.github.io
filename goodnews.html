          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA games on Ion, including the "WNBA on Ion" studio show, a weekly program dedicated exclusively to WNBA coverage. The value of the deal was not disclosed, but the original deal expiring at the end of 2025 was reportedly worth an average of $13 million annually. The partnership has already shown significant growth, with WNBA Friday Night Spotlight viewership increasing by 133% year over year and over 23 million unique viewers tuning in. This agreement follows the league's 11-year media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast-owned NBCUniversal signed last July, which values the WNBA's portion at about $200 million per year.</p>

Newsom's direct and clear message contrasts with his usual communication style, which often involves filler words and meandering thoughts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer sentiment in June improved more than expected, driven by optimism as President Donald Trump rolled back some tariffs. The resurgence ended six months of worsening attitudes, with year-ahead inflation expectations dropping from 6.6% to 5.1%. The improvement was reflected across all demographics, including age, income, political party, and geographic region. Trump's easing of tariffs and trade agreements with countries like China have eased costs on importers, which are often passed to consumers in the form of price hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thousands of "No Kings Day" protests took place across the U.S. to protest the Trump administration and counterprogram the military parade in Washington, D.C., marking the U.S. Army's 250th birthday. Organized by groups like Indivisible, the protests aimed to oppose what they perceive as overreach by the Trump administration on immigration enforcement, civil rights, and federal government cuts. Organizers chose not to protest in downtown D.C. to avoid potential retaliation, emphasizing that the protests should remain peaceful and nonviolent. At least two states, Texas and Missouri, called up the National Guard as a precaution against potential violence.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment in early June rebounded significantly, driven by a less pessimistic view of the economy and potential inflation surges as global trade war tensions eased. The University of Michigan survey showed across-the-board improvements, with respondents also reducing their outlook for near-term inflation. The headline index of consumer sentiment reached 60.5, exceeding expectations, while the one-year inflation outlook fell to 5.1%. The moves coincided with a softening in the heated rhetoric surrounding President Donald Trump's tariffs, contributing to the improved outlook.</p>

Other measures to reduce symptoms include good hygiene practices, avoiding triggers like cut grass, and vacuuming regularly.
