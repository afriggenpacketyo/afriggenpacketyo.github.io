        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is expected to rise by 4.7% next April, in line with the latest average earnings growth data, providing an increase of over £500 a year for many retirees. This adjustment is dictated by the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the pension increases by the highest of inflation, average earnings, or 2.5%. While the raise will benefit nearly 13 million pensioners, concerns are growing that the rising payments will soon push more retirees into paying income tax, as the personal tax allowance remains frozen until 2028.

          <p>European stocks opened lower on Tuesday, with major indices like the pan-European Stoxx 600, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB all registering losses. Market sentiment was primarily influenced by ongoing trade talks between the U.S. and China taking place in Spain. Investors are closely watching for outcomes, particularly after the announcement of a framework deal regarding the future of TikTok's U.S. operations. The cautious trading in Europe contrasted with a strong performance in Asia, where Japan's Nikkei 225 index surpassed the 45,000 mark for the first time.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's state visit to the U.K. is seen as a potential distraction for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government, which is currently facing numerous domestic challenges. These include recent cabinet resignations, mass protests over immigration, and declining approval ratings. The visit will feature significant pomp and ceremony, including events with the Royal Family, which is expected to appeal to Trump. Trade will be a central focus, with the U.K. hoping to finalize new deals on technology, energy, and reduced tariffs on steel and aluminum exports.</p>

          <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the Houston Texans 20-19 with a last-minute touchdown drive led by quarterback Baker Mayfield. Mayfield's 15-yard scramble on a crucial fourth-and-10 kept the game-winning drive alive, culminating in a touchdown with just six seconds remaining. In the later game, the Los Angeles Chargers secured a 20-9 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, largely due to a dominant defensive performance. The Chargers' defense intercepted Raiders quarterback Geno Smith three times, starting with a pick on the very first play from scrimmage.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will legally require public officials to be truthful and cooperative during investigations into major disasters. The bill includes a "duty of candour," making it a criminal offense for officials to conceal information or mislead inquiries. This legislation is a direct result of decades of campaigning by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster. The law aims to prevent future cover-ups and is also intended to apply to other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire and the infected blood scandal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are increasingly using apps and daily questionnaires to track players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" for health and performance. This data allows medical staff to make informed adjustments to training intensity, nutrition, and recovery protocols based on the different phases of a player's cycle. By understanding hormonal fluctuations, teams can help mitigate symptoms like fatigue and cramps, aiming to optimize player well-being and on-field performance. This approach represents a significant shift towards cycle-informed, rather than cycle-mediated, training in elite female sports.</p>

          <p>MSPs in the Scottish Parliament are set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the controversial proposal to eliminate the "not proven" verdict from criminal trials. This uniquely Scottish verdict has the same legal outcome as "not guilty" but is criticized for being confusing and stigmatizing. To balance the change, the bill also proposes raising the threshold for a guilty verdict to a two-thirds jury majority, up from the current simple majority. The legislation also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and a new victims and witnesses commissioner.</p>
