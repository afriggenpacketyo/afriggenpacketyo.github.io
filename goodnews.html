          <h2>Strait of Hormuz's Importance Highlighted Amidst Iran Tensions</h2>

          <p>The Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil trade route, has come into renewed focus amid tensions with Iran, particularly after the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. The waterway, located between Oman and Iran, connects the Persian Gulf to the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea, facilitating the transit of millions of barrels of oil and petroleum products daily. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) describes it as the "world's most important oil transit chokepoint," with Iran reportedly considering blocking it. While experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the strait, disruptions could severely impact global energy markets and economies.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz won the Queen's Club title, defeating Jiri Lehecka, and is now considered a strong favorite for Wimbledon. Alcaraz, who has won 18 consecutive matches, stated he came to London with no expectations but quickly adapted to the grass court. Winning Queen's is a positive sign for Alcaraz, as he won the title in 2023 and then triumphed at Wimbledon. Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash believes Alcaraz is the player to beat and a red-hot favorite for the upcoming tournament.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid secured a 3-1 victory over Pachuca in a Club World Cup Group H match, with goals from Jude Bellingham, Arda G√ºler, and Federico Valverde. Despite playing with 10 men after Ra√∫l Asencio's early dismissal, Real Madrid's win puts their campaign back on track following a previous draw. Pachuca's El√≠as Montiel scored a consolation goal in the 80th minute, but Thibaut Courtois's 10 saves ensured Madrid's victory. Real Madrid can clinch a place in the last 16 with a win or draw against Salzburg in their next match.</p>
