          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, though sentiment was weighed down by uncertainty surrounding U.S. tariffs. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both rose, with South Korean inflation data showing a slower increase than anticipated. This market activity follows a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that found most of President Trump's global tariffs to be illegal. Meanwhile, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined ahead of the release of its current account balance data. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite being the place where the Equalities Act was passed, the building presents numerous barriers, including heavy doors with round handles, long distances to accessible toilets, and physically demanding voting procedures. A parliamentary modernization committee is currently reviewing these issues, with its chair acknowledging that the House of Commons is "repeatedly falling short" on accessibility standards.</p>

Now an independent artist, Odell discusses the creative freedom he enjoys and how global political uncertainty has influenced the darker, more confessional themes on his new album, "A Wonderful Life."</p>

          <p>Spending by Premier League clubs during the summer transfer window has shattered previous records, surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The total outlay was driven by several big-money deals on deadline day, including Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool. This year's spending is significantly higher than last summer's £1.96 billion and exceeds the combined total spent by the top leagues in Germany, Spain, France, and Italy, highlighting the Premier League's immense financial dominance.</p>

          <p>An analysis explores how Liverpool executed the biggest spending spree by a single club in a transfer window, a stark contrast to their traditionally more cautious approach. This shift in policy was driven by several factors, including accumulated funds from a quiet previous year, significant commercial growth, and a strategic decision to capitalize on their recent Premier League title success. The club's ambition was also tragically impacted by the death of forward Diogo Jota, which necessitated signing replacements to bolster the squad.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a crucial human fossil discovered in a Greek cave over 60 years ago, to be at least 286,000 years old. This finding firmly places the skull in the Middle Pleistocene era and reinforces the theory that it belongs to *Homo heidelbergensis*, a species believed to be the last common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. The research resolves a long-standing debate and provides new insights into the complex, branching history of human evolution in Europe.</p>
