          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated to President Trump that Canada is not for sale during an Oval Office meeting, countering Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state. Carney emphasized the importance of partnership and collaboration between the two nations, despite Trump's continued interest in the idea of acquiring Canada. The meeting took place amidst strained relations due to U.S. tariffs on Canadian goods, with Trump asserting that tariffs would remain in place, setting the stage for potentially difficult trade negotiations. Trump also claimed that the U.S. subsidizes Canada significantly, a claim disputed by economic data, while Carney pledged to protect Canada's interests in future discussions.</p>

          <p>Amazon's Zoox autonomous vehicle unit has issued a software recall for 270 of its robotaxis following a crash in Las Vegas last month. The recall addresses a defect in the automated driving system that could lead to inaccurate predictions of other vehicles' movements, thereby increasing the risk of collisions, according to a report submitted to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. The incident occurred on April 8 and involved an unoccupied Zoox robotaxi colliding with a passenger vehicle, though no injuries were reported. Zoox has paused and since resumed driverless operations after implementing a software update to correct the identified issue.</p>

          <p>In a White House meeting with President Trump, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly rejected the idea of Canada becoming the 51st U.S. state, emphasizing that Canada is not for sale. This declaration followed Trump's remarks romanticizing the notion of merging the U.S. and Canada, which Carney countered by highlighting the importance of partnership and mutual benefits. Despite the lack of Canadian support for the idea, Trump insisted on not dismissing it entirely, while both leaders acknowledged existing tensions in trade relations. The meeting, the first since Carney's election, aimed to address these strains, with Carney underscoring Canada's commitment to its own terms in trade and security discussions.</p>

          <p>A declassified U.S. intelligence memo contradicts President Trump's assertions that the Venezuelan government, under Nicolas Maduro, controls the Tren De Aragua (TDA) criminal gang. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence concluded that there is no evidence of widespread, organized cooperation between the Maduro regime and TDA, and that Maduro views the gang as a threat. This contradicts the Trump administration's justification for deporting alleged gang members under the Alien Enemies Act. The memo also suggests that TDA is decentralized and unlikely to coordinate large-scale human trafficking or migrant smuggling, further undermining the administration's claims about the gang's power and reach.</p>

          <p>Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett advised young people to prioritize the people they associate with over starting salaries when building their careers. Speaking at the company's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett emphasized the importance of surrounding oneself with admirable and supportive colleagues, as habits are often adopted from those around you. He cautioned against focusing too much on initial paychecks and encouraged individuals to seek jobs they enjoy and from which they can learn. Buffett noted that he has had five bosses in his life and liked all of them, but ultimately decided he preferred to work for himself.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt on the rise and average interest rates near record highs, financial experts recommend building healthy borrowing habits, including limiting credit utilization to 30% of the credit limit. For example, if a consumer has a $1,000 credit limit, they should aim to spend no more than $300 to maintain a healthy credit score and avoid accumulating unmanageable debt. By keeping utilization low, borrowers demonstrate financial responsibility, which can lead to better interest rates on various financial products and prevent the accumulation of high-interest debt.
