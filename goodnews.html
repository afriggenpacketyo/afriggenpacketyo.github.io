        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced broad gains after U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order formalizing a reduction in Japanese auto import tariffs from 27.5% to 15%. This move, coupled with a confirmed $550 billion in Japanese investments for U.S. projects, significantly boosted market confidence across the region. Key indices, including Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix, along with South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200, all closed higher. The market optimism was further supported by Trump's statements hinting at tariffs on semiconductor imports from firms that do not shift production to the United States, which spurred a rally in several Asian chip manufacturing stocks.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK retail sales volumes saw a 0.6% increase in July, surpassing economists' forecasts, largely attributed to favorable sunny weather and the popularity of the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 tournament. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) highlighted robust growth in clothing, footwear, and online retail sectors. This positive economic news follows a delay in the figures' release and recent ONS acknowledgements of errors in past data, which have drawn scrutiny over statistical reliability. Despite the monthly uptick, sales over the three months to July were down 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, with analysts cautioning that these seasonal boosts are unlikely to be sustained.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenya is engaged in advanced discussions with the Export-Import Bank of China to restructure its debt, exploring a switch from dollar-denominated payments to the yuan. This strategic initiative seeks to extend loan maturities and ease the strain on Kenya's foreign currency reserves. If successful, the plan could substantially reduce interest rates on loans secured for the Standard Gauge Railway, potentially halving them from 6.37% in US dollars to around 3% in yuan. This proposed currency swap is viewed as mutually beneficial, providing Kenya with financial relief and supporting China's broader efforts to promote the internationalization of its currency.
