          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced "substantial progress" in U.S.-China trade talks after a weekend of meetings in Geneva, with additional details expected on Monday. U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer suggested a "deal" had been reached addressing national security concerns, but it remains unclear whether tariffs will be reduced. China's Vice Premier He Lifeng described the talks as "candid, in-depth and constructive," with an agreement to establish a "consultation mechanism." The talks aim to ease tensions following Mr. Trump's imposition of tariffs on Chinese imports. Economists have warned that the trade dispute could slow global growth and fuel inflation.</p>

          <p>Following the announcement of "substantial progress" in US-China trade talks, investors have expressed cautious optimism. Christopher Hodge of Natixis suggests that while a de-escalation was inevitable, any agreement is unlikely to dramatically open up Chinese markets. Jack Ablin of Cresset Capital views the news as slightly better than expected, but remains hesitant to "hit the 'buy' button." Eric Kuby of North Star Investment Management Corp. considers it a step in the right direction, but does not anticipate a dramatic market rally. Gennadiy Goldberg of TD Securities did not offer a statement in the provided article.</p>
