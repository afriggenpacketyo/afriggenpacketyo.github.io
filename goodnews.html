          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 06:30:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's struggling property market may be approaching its lowest point, with analysts observing hopeful signs of recovery. Credit rating agency Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast, now predicting a smaller decline in new home sales for the year due to better-than-expected performance in the first half. This stabilization is partly attributed to the consolidation of the market, where state-owned developers have significantly increased their market share. The improved flow of credit to developers and a reduction in the inventory of unsold homes are key factors fueling this cautious optimism for the sector's future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a decrease in its second-quarter revenue, attributing the drop to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The state-owned oil giant reported an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still surpassed analyst expectations despite marking the tenth consecutive quarter of declining profits. CEO Amin Nasser expressed strong optimism for the second half of 2025, projecting that oil demand will increase by over two million barrels per day. The company plans to increase capital expenditure and is also focusing on significantly boosting its natural gas production by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

His ideal day is a blend of simple pleasures and local exploration, starting with coffee and a run with his dogs in the Hollywood Hills. The itinerary includes two gluten-free breakfasts at Honey Hi, browsing books and art at Wacko, and enjoying a vegan burger from Crossroads. The day is punctuated by more coffee, a car nap, and shopping in the Arts District. It culminates in a cherished tradition with his wife: choosing the official "song of the summer" before enjoying more local food.</p>

          <p>Universal is expanding its popular Halloween-season events into a permanent, year-round attraction with the opening of Horror Unleashed in Las Vegas. The venue features four elaborate haunted houses, themed bars, and interactive character experiences, aiming to capitalize on the growing mainstream appeal of the horror genre. This move reflects a broader cultural shift, where horror is no longer confined to October, driven by successful year-round shows and films. While there are challenges, such as the high-cost and previous failures of similar concepts, Universal is betting that audiences are ready for permanent, high-production horror experiences beyond the traditional theme park setting.</p>

          <p>South Korea has started removing loudspeakers that broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across its border with North Korea, a move aimed at easing inter-Korean tensions. This action follows an order from President Lee Jae Myung, who advocates for reconciliation and sees warmer relations as an economic benefit. The loudspeakers, a feature of the contentious relationship since the 1960s, have been a source of friction, with North Korea viewing them as a provocation. While some North Korean defectors have cited the broadcasts as a reason for fleeing, border residents have complained about the noise and the risk of military skirmishes.</p>

          <p>Actress Bella Ramsey reflects on the challenges and growth experienced while filming the second season of HBO's "The Last of Us." Stepping into the lead role without co-star Pedro Pascal for most of the season was exhausting but ultimately fulfilling for Ramsey, who enjoys tackling difficult tasks. The season required extensive stunt work and exploring a more mature version of their character, Ellie, particularly through her relationship with Dina. Ramsey, who is nonbinary, also spoke about the gratification of their second Emmy nomination, seeing it as a form of visibility that can hopefully help other gender-nonconforming people feel seen and accepted.</p>

          <p>A journalist recounts their experiment using ChatGPT as a mediator for disagreements with their new boyfriend, reflecting a growing trend among Gen Z to use AI for dating advice. The initial sessions were fraught, as the AI's feedback, influenced by internet biases, seemed to favor the user and rely on stereotypes about emotional labor. After consulting with a human therapist and refining prompts to demand neutrality, the chatbot provided some simple, yet revelatory, insights into their communication dynamics. The author concluded that while AI can offer a quick analysis, it lacks the nuance, accountability, and true empathy of human connection, and can risk becoming a tool for avoidance rather than resolution.</p>

The move is part of a broader plan to boost investor confidence after the company faced significant financial losses and a struggling share price in recent years, despite a recent report of better-than-expected quarterly profits.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the storm is remembered as a pivotal moment that exposed deep flaws in the city's criminal justice system and sparked its transformation. Before the storm, the public defender's office was underfunded and part-time, but the post-Katrina chaos cleared the way for systemic change. Visionary lawyers and leaders rebuilt the office into a full-time, well-resourced organization with investigators and social workers. This evolution culminated in a 2020 city council vote to grant the Orleans Public Defenders funding parity with the district attorney's office, creating a fairer, more balanced system that has dramatically reduced the local incarceration rate.</p>
