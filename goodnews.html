        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book argues that Apple became overly dependent on China, a move described as a "calamitous mistake" given the country's authoritarian nature. However, some analysts, like Harvard's Meg Rithmire, counter that Apple had few realistic alternatives and that missing out on China's wave of innovation would have prevented it from becoming the company it is today. The debate centers on whether Apple was strategically trapped by China or if its deep involvement was a necessary, albeit complex, component of its global success and dominance in the tech industry.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has announced that the historic Griffith Park Pool, closed since 2020, will not reopen and is slated for demolition. A $28-million project will replace the 1927-era pool with two smaller, modern pools and a splash pad, with construction expected to start in 2026. The original plan to reopen the pool was scrapped after workers discovered a severe, unrepairable crack in its foundation that prevented it from retaining water. The new facility aims to provide year-round aquatic access for local communities that have long relied on the public pool.</p>

          <p>A new mural in North Hollywood celebrates Dodgers player Kik√© Hern√°ndez for his public support of the immigrant community in Los Angeles. The artwork was inspired by a social media post in which Hern√°ndez, a native of Puerto Rico, expressed his dismay at recent immigration sweeps and stated that all people deserve to be treated with dignity. The artist, Louie Palsino, created the mural to pay homage to Hern√°ndez for "standing up for what is right." The piece is located alongside other Dodgers-themed murals, solidifying the player's status as a fan favorite in his adopted city.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Los Angeles needs a new, technology-driven strategy to handle the pervasive issue of illegal fireworks, which pose fire risks and cause distress to residents and pets. The author suggests the city should follow the example of Riverside, which uses surveillance drones to capture violations in real-time and mail citations to offenders, reducing the strain on emergency services. The article contends that traditional education and enforcement have failed to curb the problem, and with major events like the World Cup and Olympics approaching, a smarter approach is essential.</p>

          <p>Shubman Gill, the captain of India's cricket team, delivered a masterful performance against England, scoring a century that was statistically the most controlled ever recorded in a Test match in the country. Gill's unbeaten 114 featured a false shot percentage of just 3.5%, far below the average of 12%, according to data from CricViz. This level of precision surpassed controlled innings from modern greats like Alastair Cook, Joe Root, and Steve Smith. The rookie captain's composed and near-perfect batting helped his team reach a respectable score on day one of the second Test.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is set to face a no-confidence vote in the European Parliament next week. The motion was initiated by a right-wing Romanian MEP over a perceived lack of transparency concerning text messages exchanged with Pfizer's CEO during COVID-19 vaccine negotiations. While the vote is largely symbolic and not expected to pass, as most major political groups oppose it, it underscores growing frustration within Brussels. If the motion were to succeed, it would require the entire European Commission to resign, a highly unlikely but constitutionally possible outcome.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's policy that suspended the right for migrants to apply for asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his authority by declaring an "invasion" and unilaterally supplanting immigration laws enacted by Congress. The judge stated that neither the Constitution nor existing statutes grant the president the power to create an alternative immigration system in this manner. The ruling has been stayed for 14 days to allow the administration to appeal, but it represents a significant legal setback for the president's hardline immigration agenda.</p>

Co-star Rachel Brosnahan, who plays Lois Lane, added that he would step in to help wherever needed. The film, directed by James Gunn, presents a more optimistic version of the character, a departure from darker recent portrayals, as DC Studios aims to reinvigorate the superhero genre.</p>
