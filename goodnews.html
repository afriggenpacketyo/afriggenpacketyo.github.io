          <p>The government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear plant in Suffolk, creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves called it a "landmark decision" to kickstart economic growth, while critics like Alison Downes condemned the move as a costly mistake. The final investment decision on the funding model is due later this summer, amidst opposition at local and national levels. The investment is part of a series of announcements ahead of the government's Spending Review.</p>

BYD, the biggest player in China, is expanding aggressively into European markets, while brands like Nio and Xpeng are also gaining prominence. Concerns about security risks, spyware, and hacking have been raised, leading to increased tariffs in the US and EU. European manufacturers are racing to develop their own affordable electric cars to compete with Chinese brands, emphasizing the need for innovation and adaptation in the global automotive industry.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tariffs Boost Business for Pennsylvania Toy Manufacturer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 18:43:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's tariffs have led to increased demand for The Rodon Group, a Pennsylvania-based plastics injection molding company that manufactures K'nex toys. Due to uncertainty surrounding the tariffs, companies are seeking domestic suppliers, resulting in a nearly 50% increase in demand for Rodon. The company's investment in automation has allowed it to compete with offshore manufacturers, but the CEO emphasizes the need for STEM education and workforce investment to sustain domestic production. This highlights the potential benefits and challenges of Trump's trade policies for American manufacturers. (not investment advice)</p>
