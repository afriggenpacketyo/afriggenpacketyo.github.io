          <p>The UAE's ADNOC is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's assets, particularly its LNG holdings, adding to the ongoing takeover speculation surrounding BP.  Bloomberg reports suggest ADNOC has also considered a full takeover but analysts believe a full acquisition is less likely.  This development is significant given ADNOC's growth and financial strength, and its existing relationship with BP. BP's strategic reset and divestment plans are also discussed in the context of this potential deal.</p>

          <p>India's central bank plans to tighten regulations for overseas remittances by resident Indians, prohibiting the use of funds for time deposits or interest-bearing accounts abroad.  This move aims to prevent passive wealth shifting and safeguard foreign exchange reserves.  The changes are part of a broader review of the Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), which allows residents to remit up to $250,000 annually.  The RBI's action reflects concerns about the increasing volume of outward remittances and potential misuse of the LRS. (not investment advice)</p>
