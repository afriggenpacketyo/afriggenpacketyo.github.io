          <p>In a surprise result, Labour's Davy Russell won the Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse by-election, defeating the SNP candidate. The SNP acknowledged the need to analyze the defeat and adjust their strategy for future elections. Reform UK finished third, pushing the Conservatives into fourth place, while Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar hailed the victory as proof that pollsters were wrong. Russell pledged to amplify the voices of the people at Holyrood, criticizing the SNP for failing to deliver for constituents, and the SNP's loss came after the first minister said the by-election was a ‚Äútwo-horse race‚Äù between his party and Reform.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock experienced a rebound after a significant drop fueled by a public feud between CEO Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Despite the prior day's $152 billion market cap rout, Tesla shares climbed, with analysts suggesting the investor base remains unfazed by the drama. There were reports of a potential call between Trump and Musk to reconcile, though a White House official denied any interest from Trump. The feud originated from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill. (not investment advice)</p>

Morgan Stanley estimates this automation effort, which includes AI-powered humanoid robots, could lead to significant cost savings.

Amazon is testing these robots at a "humanoid park" obstacle course in San Francisco, signaling a major step in the company's automation strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The U.S. faces a looming nuclear fuel supply gap due to the loss of Russian uranium, and Western enrichment capacity is dominated by non-American owned companies.

          <p>The Trump administration's efforts to reform government are driven by an anti-managerial ideology. This ideology views the modern American system as being usurped by a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats. This strand of political thought seeks to roll back the expansion of bureaucratic control in various areas of life. The article suggests that understanding this anti-managerialism is essential to understanding the Trump administration's efforts to transform institutions.</p>
