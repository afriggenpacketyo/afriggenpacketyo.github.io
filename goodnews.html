          <p>Buckingham Palace has announced that Donald Trump will undertake a second state visit to the United Kingdom from September 17 to 19, hosted by King Charles III at Windsor Castle. This visit is unusual, as second-term U.S. presidents are typically not offered a full state visit. The event, which will involve senior royals, is seen by the British government as a significant opportunity for soft diplomacy, particularly concerning the war in Ukraine and U.S. tariffs. A full ceremonial welcome and state banquet are planned, though public-facing events are expected to be limited due to security concerns.</p>

          <p>Lowrider culture in northern New Mexico is undergoing a significant transformation, moving from a public perception linked to gangs to being celebrated as a unique art form and a force for community healing. The article highlights the intricate craftsmanship of the customized cars and profiles key figures like artist Rob Vanderslice and community leaders Arthur and Joan Medina. Once banned in some areas, lowrider events are now embraced, with car clubs focusing on charity and mentoring at-risk youth. This cultural shift reflects a redefinition of rebellion, now centered on community development and preserving heritage in a region facing economic and social challenges.</p>

          <p>A nonprofit named Healing Justice is bringing together survivors of violent crimes and wrongfully convicted individuals from different cases to participate in healing retreats. Founded by rape survivor Jennifer Thompson, whose testimony led to a wrongful conviction, the organization aims to address the shared trauma experienced by both groups when the justice system fails. Through group sessions and art therapy, participants find common ground, helping victims understand the plight of the exonerated and allowing exonerees to process their unjust incarceration. The program demonstrates a powerful, unconventional path toward recovery for all parties harmed by a single wrongful conviction.</p>

          <h2>Psychiatrist Warns Late-Night TV Bingeing Can Harm Brain Health</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychiatrist Dr. Daniel Amen, the common habit of staying up late to watch television can be detrimental to brain health. He explains that sacrificing sleep prevents the brain from performing its essential nightly 'cleaning' process, which is crucial for memory consolidation and cognitive function. This lack of adequate rest can lead to poor decision-making the following day. Dr. Amen also notes that exposure to blue light from screens before bed suppresses melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. He advises prioritizing sleep and using blue-light blockers to maintain optimal brain function and overall well-being.</p>

          <p>In a recent address, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that despite personal political views, investors should recognize the forces driving the current stock market rally under President Trump. He posits that a combination of individual investor enthusiasm, deregulation at the agency level, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence are overwhelming institutional pessimism. Cramer suggests that while tariffs create short-term inflation, the long-term effects of AI on labor and efficiency will be a more powerful deflationary force, creating a bullish environment for stocks. He advises divorcing personal politics from investment decisions to capitalize on these trends. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," a raw and improvisatory project that leans heavily into his R&B and gospel-blues sensibilities. The album follows a tumultuous period for the artist, including a canceled tour and a new child, and its messy, unpolished sound is seen as a reflection of his life. Collaborating with artists like Mk.gee, the album features cooled-out grooves, reverbed beats, and even excerpts from his viral confrontations with paparazzi. The review suggests that while some moments are awkward, the album is an authentic and often beautiful exploration of a superstar embracing his quirky, less commercial side.</p>
