          <p>With persistent inflation impacting savings, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer an opportunity to earn returns that outpace inflation while locking in high rates for the CD's term. National average CD yields range from 1.69% to 1.99% APY for 1-year to 5-year terms, while top CDs offer rates between 4.00% and 4.41% APY for 6-month to 5-year terms. Online banks often provide the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs, and strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of both short-term and long-term rates.

          <p>An international study led by the University of Edinburgh suggests that the COVID-19 virus did not originate in Wuhan, China, but instead traces its origins to bat populations in northern Laos and southwest China's Yunnan province.

During a heat wave in Papua New Guinea, scientists measured 134 clownfish and found that most of them got shorter by a few millimeters.
