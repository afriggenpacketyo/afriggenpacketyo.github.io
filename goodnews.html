          <p>In a significant act of cooperation, Mexico has transferred 26 high-ranking cartel members to U.S. custody to face charges for crimes including drug trafficking and murder. The group includes key figures from the Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, such as Abigael González Valencia, a leader of the 'Los Cuinis' organization. This move comes amid increased pressure from the Trump administration for Mexico to crack down on criminal networks, though Mexican officials maintain the transfers were a sovereign decision aimed at disrupting cartel operations from within prisons.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Rams have seen their franchise valuation soar to $10.43 billion, making them the second most valuable team in the NFL, behind only the Dallas Cowboys, according to a new ranking from Sportico. This marks a dramatic turnaround from a decade ago when the team, then in St. Louis, was valued at less than $1 billion. The massive increase is largely attributed to the team's relocation to Los Angeles and the development of the state-of-the-art SoFi Stadium, which has become a major hub for sports and entertainment.</p>

          <h2>Small-Cap Stocks Rally as Investors Bet on Fed Rate Cut, Megacap Tech Declines</h2>

          <p>A market rotation occurred Wednesday as small-cap stocks surged while some of the largest technology companies saw declines. The Russell 2000 index, which tracks smaller companies, gained approximately 2%, driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates at its September meeting. Lower rates are expected to disproportionately benefit small caps, which often rely more heavily on borrowed capital, leading to a shift in investment away from the recently dominant megacap tech sector.

          <p>In response to concerns about rising prices from tariffs, Walmart is expanding its employee discount to cover a wider range of groceries.

Previously, the discount on most food items was only available during the holiday season. The move is seen as a way to support its workforce amid renewed inflation worries and to encourage employees to shop at its stores.</p>
