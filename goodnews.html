          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-01 07:01:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil announced second-quarter earnings that, while significantly lower than the previous year, managed to exceed Wall Street's forecasts. This performance was largely attributed to a surge in production that helped offset the impact of declining oil prices. The company achieved its highest output in over two decades, reaching 4.6 million barrels per day, with record production also noted in the Permian Basin. The results demonstrate the oil major's ability to leverage operational efficiency to navigate a weaker price environment.</p>

          <p>China has implemented a new anti-money-laundering rule targeting dealers of precious metals and gems, a first for a non-financial sector. The regulation requires reporting any cash transactions exceeding 100,000 yuan (about US$13,870) to a financial crime watchdog within five working days. This move aims to close a significant loophole that was being exploited for illicit financial activities, expanding supervision beyond traditional financial institutions and tightening the country's oversight on potentially suspicious transactions.</p>

          <p>Strict limits on liquids in airline hand luggage may soon be lifted across the European Union, as new, officially approved CT scanners are deployed in airports. This advanced technology provides high-resolution 3D images, allowing security to detect liquid explosives without passengers needing to remove items from their bags. While the EU Commission has authorized the change, implementation will be gradual and at the discretion of individual airports, meaning most travelers must still adhere to the 100ml rule for the time being.</p>

The production is a highlight of the Edinburgh International Festival, where Cox portrays the ghost of economist Adam Smith. In the article, Cox reflects on his working-class roots in Dundee, which he says informs his focus on social inequality and his desire to use his platform for protest, stating he believes in giving people a better chance in life.</p>

          <p>Chevron's second-quarter earnings saw a substantial 44% decline, influenced by lower crude oil prices and a financial loss related to its recent acquisition of Hess Corporation. Despite the drop in net income, the company's adjusted earnings per share surpassed analyst expectations, supported by a 3% increase in worldwide production. The completed Hess deal, which adds key assets in Guyana and the U.S., is expected to begin contributing to earnings in the fourth quarter.</p>

          <p>Starting October 12, the European Union will begin phasing out traditional passport stamping for non-EU travelers, replacing it with a new biometric Entry/Exit System (EES). UK visitors and other non-EU citizens will need to have their fingerprints and facial images scanned to cross an EU border, with the data stored for three years. While the system aims to tighten security and eventually speed up border crossings, the UK government has warned of potential initial delays during the rollout period.</p>

          <p>Billionaire Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, has sold his final equity stake in the firm and stepped down from its board. This move completes a long-planned management transition that began in 2022, though Dalio will continue to be a significant investor in the fund's strategies and serve as a mentor. The firm raised capital from existing investors and employees to facilitate the final sale of Dalio's ownership, concluding his direct management role in the company he founded in 1975.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from Vanguard indicates that having an emergency savings fund acts as a crucial buffer, protecting long-term retirement accounts. The study found that 401(k) investors with at least $2,000 in emergency savings are significantly less likely to take out loans or hardship withdrawals from their retirement plans. This is particularly important for hourly workers with volatile incomes, who are more prone to tapping into their 401(k)s early, a practice that severely hinders long-term retirement security.

          <p>In a new initiative to increase social mobility, the UK government will restrict its main civil service internship program to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves. Starting in summer 2026, eligibility will be determined by parental occupation, and successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, a primary pathway into senior civil service roles.</p>

          <p>In an innovative anti-poaching effort, scientists at a South African university are injecting rhino horns with a harmless radioactive substance. This material, part of the Rhisotope Project, makes the horns detectable by nuclear security scanners at borders and ports, even inside large shipping containers. The goal is to disrupt smuggling networks that traffic horns to Asian markets. With South Africa home to the world's largest rhino population, this new technology aims to protect the threatened species by devaluing the horns for poachers.</p>

          <p>Ella Berman's new novel, "L.A. Women," is set in the iconic Laurel Canyon scene of the 1960s and 70s, exploring the complex relationship between two female writers, Lane and Gala. The story, driven by Gala's mysterious disappearance, delves into themes of friendship, professional rivalry, and the pressures faced by women in a male-dominated culture. The review praises Berman's ability to capture how attachment can warp into envy and how the cultural landscape of the era conspired to pit the two protagonists against each other, forcing them to commodify their lives and relationships.</p>

          <p>This article explains the concept of parasocial relationships, the one-sided sense of intimacy people develop with public figures like celebrities, influencers, or podcasters. These connections feel social but are not reciprocal, an illusion fostered by mass media and the curated intimacy of social media. The piece traces the history of fandom from 'Beatlemania' to modern 'stan culture,' noting that while often positive, these relationships can become toxic when fans feel entitled to a celebrity's private life, blurring the lines between the public persona and the actual person.</p>

          <p>A new tax bill includes a significant provision allowing taxpayers who do not itemize to claim a charitable deduction for cash donations, a change set to begin in 2026. This tax break is valued at up to $1,000 for single filers and $2,000 for married couples filing jointly, expanding charitable giving incentives to the 90% of filers who typically use the standard deduction. Financial experts note that taxpayers should maintain proper documentation, such as receipts, to be eligible for this new benefit. (not investment advice)</p>
