          <p>A significant price war has erupted among China's top e-commerce and delivery platforms, including Alibaba, Meituan, and JD.com. Companies are offering deep discounts, coupons, and promotions on everyday items like milk tea and food delivery to capture market share. This intense competition has led to record order volumes, with Alibaba processing 80 million orders in a single day, as consumers eagerly take advantage of the heavily subsidized deals.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, breaking the $120,000 mark, driven by substantial inflows into U.S. spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally is further supported by growing institutional investment and anticipation of new, clearer cryptocurrency regulations from the U.S. Congress during what is being called 'Crypto Week.' Analysts suggest that this momentum, fueled by long-term institutional buyers, could push the price even higher in the near future, despite potential risks from broader economic policies.

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump is scheduled for a second official state visit to the U.K. in September, an unprecedented honor for a U.S. president. He and First Lady Melania Trump will be hosted by King Charles II at Windsor Castle, following an invitation from the monarch on the advice of Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government. The visit is seen as a strategic move by the U.K. to maintain a strong relationship with the Trump administration, though it may also attract protests and navigate delicate diplomatic issues.</p>

          <p>Singapore narrowly avoided a technical recession, reporting 1.4% economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, a significant reversal from the 0.5% contraction in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, potentially boosted by businesses front-loading exports ahead of tariff deadlines. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year.
