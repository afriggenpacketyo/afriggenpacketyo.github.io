          <p>The Washington Department of Natural Resources (DNR) used a firefighting helicopter to remove abandoned boats from Squaxin Island in Puget Sound. The operation, funded by a federal grant, removed 14 vessels and was the agency's largest of its kind. The DNR opts for airlifts to avoid disrupting the marine bed and surrounding environment. Squaxin Island is of cultural importance to the Squaxin Island Tribe, which supports the cleanup effort to maintain clean beaches and water. The DNR has removed over 1,200 derelict vessels since the program began in 2002, with at least 300 more remaining.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, published in Science Bulletin, examined feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. Researchers found that the development of feathers capable of generating thrust and lift was essential for birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly, though some could glide or have powered flight. The study underscores the significance of feather evolution in the development of avian flight.</p>

          <p>A UK study has found that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's gut can protect against dangerous infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute found that Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, seemed to halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. The study tracked over 1,000 newborns and analyzed their stool samples to identify which species were present and how common they were. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery. Further research is needed to understand how these bacteria interact with the immune system.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups and issued a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting efforts to restart an offshore oil operation near Santa Barbara. The order impacts the Santa Ynez Unit, which was shut down after a major spill in 2015. The judge ruled that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review. Sable officials said the decision would delay their restart timeline to August 1, 2025. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, emphasizing the need for public input and scrutiny, particularly given the history of oil spills in the area.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) says it's unknown whether these medicines could harm an unborn baby. Women should use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a certain period afterwards before trying to become pregnant. Weight-loss injections may make the contraceptive pill less effective in overweight or obese women. The MHRA is concerned that the popularity of these 'skinny jabs' means many women aren't using the drugs safely or getting the right advice.</p>
