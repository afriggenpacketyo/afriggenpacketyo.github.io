          <p>Ben Stokes led England's fightback against India after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. India held a narrow lead of 96 runs at the close of play after Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2. Brook's innings, which included some audacious shots, helped England recover from a deficit, although he missed out on a century after being caught while attempting a hook shot. Jasprit Bumrah's five-wicket haul kept India in the game, setting up a finely poised contest.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher after the United States launched strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by expectations that Washington's intervention would help end the conflict, despite Iran's insistence on not returning to diplomacy while under attack. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major regional gainer. Analysts suggest that the Gulf region's call for appeasement and peaceful resolution has helped it isolate itself from the conflict, minimizing market impact.</p>

          <h2>Effective Communication Strategies for Parents to Encourage Cooperation</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, Reem Raouda suggests five alternative phrases to replace toxic ones that cause children to refuse to listen. Instead of saying "Because I said so," parents should explain their reasoning to foster respect and understanding. Rather than threatening with privilege removal, offering choices and agency can encourage cooperation. Acknowledging and validating children's emotions, rather than dismissing them, promotes emotional safety and trust. The key is to create conditions where cooperation feels natural, building a stronger connection and raising emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Kevin Durant is reportedly being traded from the Phoenix Suns to the Houston Rockets, with the Suns receiving Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 draft pick, and five second-round picks in return. Durant, a 15-time All-Star and former NBA MVP, averaged 26.6 points for the Suns last season. The Rockets, seen as a rising force in the Western Conference, were reportedly Durant's preferred destination. The trade would make the Rockets Durant's fifth team in the NBA and pairs him with young stars like Amen Thompson and Alperen Sengun.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its robotaxi service, giving a select group of people the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis in Austin, Texas. The pilot program, likely involving a small number of cars in a geofenced area, aims to gather feedback from early access riders. Elon Musk has previously stated the cars will be "in the wild with no one in them," and plans to scale up the service rapidly. Safety concerns and regulatory scrutiny surround autonomous vehicles, with Tesla under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and facing calls to delay the launch until new safety laws take effect.</p>

          <p>NATO members have reached an agreement to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, a goal long advocated by President Trump. Spain initially opposed the measure but secured an exemption, deeming the 5% target "disproportionate and unnecessary." Except for Spain, all member nations have until 2035 to meet the 5% goal, allocating at least 3.5% to core military needs and 1.5% to related expenditures. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez cited domestic political pressures and a corruption scandal as reasons for seeking the exemption.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's head coach, Enzo Maresca, is grappling with how to best utilize his wealth of midfield talent, including expensive signings like Enzo Fern√°ndez and Mois√©s Caicedo. Maresca has experimented with different formations, but finding the right balance remains a challenge, particularly with the presence of Cole Palmer. A recent defeat against Flamengo in the Club World Cup highlighted the need for adjustments, as Maresca tested Reece James in midfield, a move that drew criticism. The competition for places among midfielders is fierce, raising concerns about potential frustration among players and the need for patient rotation.</p>
