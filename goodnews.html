          <h2>Eastern Europe's Lag in Women's Football Development Explored</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:42:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines why women's football in Eastern Europe lags behind Western counterparts, despite a global surge in the sport's popularity and investment. Experts cite deeply ingrained cultural norms, historical economic challenges post-communism, and a lack of significant investment in infrastructure and professionalization as key barriers. While UEFA initiatives are showing some positive results and participation is expected to grow, significant funding and a shift in societal attitudes are still required for the region to fully embrace and develop women's football. The piece highlights the stark contrast with men's football success in the region.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:36:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has appointed George Tidmarsh, a seasoned biotech executive and Stanford professor, as its new top drug regulator, overseeing the critical Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). This significant appointment occurs amidst a period of considerable change within the Health and Human Services department under Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has pursued deep staff cuts and introduced employees with skepticism towards vaccines. Tidmarsh's extensive background in the pharmaceutical industry and his prior critical stance on certain accelerated drug approvals suggest a potential shift towards a more rigorous regulatory approach, offering a degree of reassurance to the industry.</p>

          <h2>European Union's Share of China's Rare Earth Magnet Exports Surges in June</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports of rare earth permanent magnets, vital for electric vehicles, wind turbines, and other advanced technologies, experienced a notable increase in June compared to the previous month, though they remained lower year-on-year. A significant trend observed was the substantial rise in the European Union's share of these shipments, climbing to 43% in June from 32% in May. In contrast, the United States' share also grew but stayed at a lower 11%. This highlights a growing European reliance on China for these crucial materials, following a sharp decline in overall rare earth magnet export volume in April and May.</p>

          <p>A SkyWest flight operating as Delta Connection performed an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft during its approach to Minot, North Dakota. The pilot informed passengers that Minot airport's tower lacks radar, relying on visual cues, and no heads-up was given about the military plane. The B-52 was confirmed by the Air Force to be operating in the area after a flyover. The Federal Aviation Administration and Air Force are investigating the incident, which the pilot described as a "not fun day at work" but ensured a safe landing for all 76 passengers and four crew.</p>

          <p>Alaska Airlines and its subsidiary Horizon Air experienced a system-wide IT outage that grounded their fleets for approximately three hours on Sunday night, leading to over 150 flight cancellations. The airline attributed the disruption to the failure of a "critical piece of multi-redundant hardware" at its data centers, emphasizing that flight safety was never compromised. Operations have since resumed, though residual impacts are expected as aircraft and crews are repositioned. The airline clarified that the outage was not linked to a cyberattack that affected other carriers last month.</p>

Given China's substantial reliance on uranium imports—with 13,000 tonnes imported last year against only 1,700 tonnes produced domestically—this achievement could significantly enhance its self-sufficiency for both nuclear power generation and weapons programs.</p>
