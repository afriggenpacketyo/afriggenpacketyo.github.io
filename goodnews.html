          <h2>Japan to Invest Billions in Attracting Foreign Researchers</h2>

          <p>The Japanese government is allocating 100 billion yen to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create an elite research environment amidst global competition in fields like AI and semiconductors. The initiative intends to counteract the departure of researchers from the United States due to funding cuts and prioritization of American students. This policy package will fund existing programs, including Tohoku University's plan to recruit 500 researchers, and seeks to raise researcher salaries while reducing administrative burdens. Despite these efforts, Japan's ranking in highly cited scientific papers remained low last year, underscoring the need for further improvements in research output.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs by the United States, China is encouraging the use of domestic letters of credit (L/Cs) to help exporters shift their focus to the domestic market. These L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, provide payment security and enhance credit, addressing major concerns for Chinese firms. While international L/Cs are limited to physical goods, domestic L/Cs can also be used in the trade of services, offering greater flexibility. This strategy aims to mitigate the impact of trade tensions by facilitating domestic sales for affected businesses.</p>

          <p>Japan anticipates receiving special treatment from the United States regarding tariffs once a bilateral deal is finalized, according to Tokyo's top negotiator. This expectation follows U.S. President Donald Trump's indication of a potential rise in import levies on cars. Ryosei Akazawa expressed optimism that Japan would be treated differently from most countries after concluding negotiations with the U.S. The focus of the talks includes securing concessions on auto tariffs and removing other sector-based tariffs, while Trump aims to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan.</p>

          <p>India is taking steps to tap into its rare earth reserves to counter China's restrictions on rare earth exports. Experts suggest that India could become an alternative source for partners like the U.S., but it requires significant public and private investment. The recent shortage has highlighted China's dominance in rare earth production and processing, giving Beijing leverage over crucial minerals. India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal has called China's pause in exports a "wake-up call" and an opportunity for India to step up.</p>

          <p>An expert from the World Gold Council asserts that cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and stablecoins are not viable alternatives to gold, nor do they threaten its role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade emphasizes that gold's long-term demand remains strong due to concerns over U.S. dollar assets and geopolitical tensions. Unlike gold, cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities and lack the characteristics of a reliable hedge during market volatility. Reade dismisses the marketing of digital assets as "gold 2.0" and highlights their fundamentally different nature.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the United States has increased to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The average age of all mothers giving birth rose from 28.7 years old in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023, while the average age for first-time mothers increased from 26.6 to 27.5. Factors contributing to this trend include changing social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also notes a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, possibly due to delayed sexual activity or improved contraceptive practices.</p>
