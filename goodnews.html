        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump declared the U.S. will remove all sanctions on Syria to provide the country with an opportunity to stabilize under its new government, which took power after ousting Bashar al-Assad. Speaking in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Trump expressed hope that the new Syrian government would succeed in stabilizing the country and maintaining peace. He highlighted that his administration has already initiated steps to restore normal relations between the United States and Syria, marking the first such efforts in over a decade. The U.S. had previously designated Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism in 1979, with additional sanctions imposed in 2004 and 2011 following the Assad regime's crackdown on anti-government uprisings.</p>

          <p>Peter Coker Sr., an 82-year-old businessman from North Carolina, was sentenced to six months in jail for his role in a scheme to inflate the stock prices of Hometown International, a New Jersey deli, and E-Waste, a shell company. The scheme involved artificially inflating the companies' stock prices to make them more attractive for mergers. Coker Sr. was also ordered to serve six months of home confinement after his release, pay a $500,000 fine, and provide up to $644,000 in restitution. The case gained attention after Hometown International's market capitalization reached $100 million despite owning only a small, money-losing sandwich shop.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs, effectively lifting the trade embargo that had been in place for the past month, according to this New York Times article. The 90-day pause on tariffs is expected to reduce the chances of empty shelves during the holiday season and potentially limit price increases for American consumers, which caused stock prices to surge worldwide. However, the article notes that the agreement does little to alleviate the uncertainty surrounding U.S. trade policy, as trade policy remains in the hands of one man, and it is not a legally binding treaty ratified by Congress.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 13:23:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether credit card debt forgiveness, also known as debt settlement, remains a sensible strategy even as the economy shows signs of improvement. It argues that while inflation may be easing and the job market appears stable, many Americans still struggle with high-interest credit card debt. The article suggests that for those overwhelmed by their balances, settling for less than what's owed can offer a path out of a seemingly endless debt cycle. However, it also cautions that debt forgiveness comes with trade-offs, such as a hit to one's credit score and potential tax liability on forgiven amounts.</p>

          <p>Inflation retreated again in April, driven by lower prices for consumer staples like groceries and gasoline, but economists warn that tariffs imposed by President Trump could reignite inflation, according to this CNBC article. The consumer price index rose 2.3% in April from 12 months earlier, the smallest annual increase since February 2021. However, tariff policies currently in effect could cost the average U.S. household an extra $2,800 over the short run. Economists are uncertain about the ultimate impact of trade policies, but some suggest tariffs could add as much as 1 percentage point to the consumer price index.</p>

He notes that these drugs condition the brain to want less food, but stopping them can lead to weight regain.
