        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of recent polling data reveals a significant split within Generation Z, distinguishing between "Old Gen Z" (25-29 years old) and "Young Gen Z" (18-24 years old). Old Gen Z tends to be more Democratic and progressive, while Young Gen Z exhibits greater openness to Republican ideas and skepticism toward the status quo. This divide, influenced by factors such as the pandemic, social media, and the Trump presidency, challenges the assumption that younger voters are uniformly progressive. The article highlights how this split could impact future elections as Gen Z becomes an increasingly influential part of the electorate, and both parties will need to work to engage with them. Optimism is tempered by the uncertainty of future election outcomes given the shifting political landscape among young voters.</p>
