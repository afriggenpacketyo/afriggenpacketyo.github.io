          <p>Egg freezing is increasingly popular among American women seeking to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures rising significantly. While birth rates are low, egg freezing offers women the chance to delay motherhood without compromising their biological options. The process involves hormone injections, egg retrieval, and storage in liquid nitrogen, with costs ranging from $12,000 to $15,000 per cycle. Companies like Apple and Facebook offer egg freezing as a benefit, and women cite reasons such as career goals, finding the right partner, and reducing the pressure of the biological clock.</p>

          <p>Over half of first-time home buyers in the past year received financial assistance from their families, with an average contribution of ¬£55,572, according to Savills. This support, often called the "bank of mum and dad," helps young buyers navigate high mortgage rates and rising rental costs. Despite a slight decrease from the previous year's proportion, family assistance remains higher than most years since 2013. First-time buyers are leveraging family support to secure better mortgage deals amid challenging lending conditions.</p>
