          <p>After a mother persistently sought medical help for her toddler's series of unusual infections and symptoms, the child was diagnosed with a malignant rhabdoid tumor, a rare and highly aggressive cancer. Doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children discovered a large tumor in his liver, leading to an intensive and individualized treatment plan involving chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation. Now in remission, the two-year-old is under careful surveillance, and his family is adjusting to a new normal after the traumatic experience, emphasizing gratitude for every moment.</p>

The mission, which could launch as early as this year, will target a small asteroid millions of kilometers away with the goal of altering its orbit by a few centimeters. The plan involves sending both an impactor spacecraft to strike the asteroid and an observer spacecraft to monitor the results, marking a significant step in China's deep space exploration and planetary defense capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With gold prices surging to new records this year, investors are increasingly looking to the precious metal as a safe-haven asset amid economic uncertainty. Financial experts generally recommend gaining exposure through gold-backed exchange-traded funds (ETFs), such as SPDR Gold Shares (GLD), as a more liquid and cost-effective method than owning physical bullion. While gold can serve as a hedge against economic downturns, financial advisors typically suggest limiting its allocation to a small portion, under 3%, of a well-diversified investment portfolio.

          <p>Ten years after its Broadway debut, the cultural impact of Lin-Manuel Miranda's "Hamilton" is being reassessed as a filmed version hits movie theaters for the first time. Initially seen as a progressive, Obama-era celebration of the American experiment, the musical's legacy has become more complex, particularly during the Trump administration. Critics and academics now view the show through a more critical lens, questioning its portrayal of the founding fathers and acknowledging that its hopeful message feels different in today's more polarized political climate.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006, is scheduled to be canonized as the first Millennial saint, representing a modern figure for the Catholic Church. Known for his "normality" as an internet user who played video games and wore Nikes, Acutis also demonstrated deep, traditional faith, creating a website to document Eucharistic miracles. His story appeals to different factions within the Church, embodying both a relatable, contemporary faith and a devotion to the supernatural, as the institution seeks to engage younger generations.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. foreign aid cuts that closed many HIV clinics in Zambia, the Zambian government has partnered with local community leaders to restore access to life-saving medications. After an NPR report highlighted the dire situation, officials verified the issues and established a system to help patients register at government facilities, ensuring they receive free treatment. While this has brought relief, former patients and laid-off clinic workers now face severe food insecurity, as the U.S.-funded programs also provided essential provisions that have not been replaced.</p>

The medal, accepted by descendants, will be displayed at the Smithsonian, serving as a long-overdue acknowledgment of their heroism and sacrifice at a time of renewed debate over how American history is told.</p>

          <p>The increasing popularity of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is causing a measurable shift in consumer spending, with users reducing purchases of ultra-processed snacks and sugary drinks. This trend presents a new challenge for the food industry, as retailers adapt by offering healthier ready-made meals and stocking more fresh produce. While users of these drugs still crave indulgent foods, they consume them in smaller quantities, signaling a potential long-term change in the American diet that could reshape the market for traditional comfort and snack foods.</p>

          <p>In a rare move, the Trump administration has taken an approximately 10% equity stake in chipmaker Intel, making the government its largest single shareholder. This action converts billions of dollars in grants from the CHIPS and Science Act into ownership, aiming to boost domestic production of cutting-edge microchips for AI and national security. The investment is driven by strategic competition with China and the goal of reducing reliance on foreign manufacturers like Taiwan's TSMC, though it also raises concerns about government influence in a private company.
