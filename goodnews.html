          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which resulted in the deaths of seven civilians and three police officers, were sparked by demands for an end to high electricity tariffs, expensive wheat, and lucrative benefits for the political class. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to lower prices and reduce the size of its Cabinet. The alliance leader expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for intervening and urged protesters to disperse peacefully from the region's capital, Muzaffarabad.</p>

          <p>After more than 20 years of extensive restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been reopened to the public in Luxor's Valley of the Kings. The large tomb, discovered in 1799, belongs to one of the most prominent pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty, who ruled in the 14th century B.C. A Japanese-led project has meticulously renovated the tomb's wall paintings, which depict the pharaoh with ancient gods and scenes from the Book of the Dead. This reopening is part of Egypt's broader effort to revitalize its tourism sector, a crucial source of foreign currency for the nation's economy.</p>

Matthews, 32, overcame a difficult start and legal troubles by first starting cleaning and junk removal businesses before venturing into the food industry. He attributes his success to focusing on high-quality service and a strong business model, targeting the late-night food scene. Matthews is committed to employing other former felons, offering them opportunities based on their skills rather than their past records.</p>

          <p>Current Lyft CEO David Risher shared the story of his decision to leave a management role at Microsoft in 1996 to join a then-small online startup called Amazon. He recalled that Bill Gates called it one of the "stupidest" decisions he had ever heard, but Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's powerful vision. Bezos's obsession with the customer experience and his confident prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by 2000 were key factors. Risher was instrumental in that growth, helping expand Amazon beyond books into new categories as the company surpassed Bezos's revenue prediction a year early.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's new song, "Actually Romantic," has ignited widespread fan speculation that it is a diss track directed at fellow pop star Charli XCX. The lyrics describe another singer who calls Swift a "boring Barbie" and writes songs about hating her, which fans have connected to Charli XCX's song "Sympathy is a Knife." In a film accompanying her new album, Swift explained the track is a "love letter to someone who hates you," adding that she finds the amount of attention, even if negative, to be flattering. Neither artist has confirmed the subject of their respective songs.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired an approximate 2% stake in the cloud-based reporting software company, Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to enhance its operational efficiency, particularly in sales and marketing, to improve its profitability, which has lagged despite strong revenue growth. The firm is also calling for significant corporate governance reforms, including collapsing the dual-class share structure that gives founders outsized control, and is suggesting a review of strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. Irenic has proposed adding two new members to the board to oversee these potential changes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Urenco's uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico, the only one of its kind in the U.S., is expanding its capacity to meet a projected surge in demand for nuclear power. This resurgence is driven by the electricity needs of AI data centers and a renewed bipartisan push for domestic energy, alongside a looming ban on Russian uranium imports. The facility, which currently supplies about a third of U.S. demand, is increasing its capacity by 15% but faces bottlenecks in the broader nuclear supply chain. The expansion highlights a pivotal moment for the nuclear industry as it races to scale up after years of downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her on a path to become the country's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a conservative and China hawk, is a protégé of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and defeated the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. Her election is seen as a move by the LDP to regain public support after recent election losses and win back conservative voters. As prime minister, she will face immediate diplomatic and security challenges, with a top priority being the reinforcement of the U.S.-Japan alliance.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with an early-stage form of the disease after she proactively sought early screening options. A breast MRI, which followed a clear mammogram, detected two suspicious masses that were confirmed to be cancerous. Her story highlights the importance of self-advocacy and understanding personal risk factors, as standard guidelines recommend mammograms beginning at age 40 for women at average risk. Her oncologist credits Del Barrio's persistence for the early detection, which significantly improved her prognosis and treatment options.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91, adopted a plant-based diet over 50 years ago, a decision central to her ethical and environmental activism. She famously stopped eating meat after looking at a pork chop and connecting it to the fear, pain, and death of an animal. Goodall cited the environmental damage caused by meat production and the cruelty of factory farms as her primary motivations. She also noted feeling physically better after making the switch, aligning with research that links plant-based diets to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and a longer, healthier life.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the life and legacy of primatologist and conservationist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91. It highlights her transformative discovery in 1960, when she observed chimpanzees in the wild making and using tools, a behavior previously thought to be exclusive to humans. This finding, communicated to her mentor Louis Leakey, forced a redefinition of the distinctions between humans and other animals. The article commemorates the moment she earned the trust of a chimp named David Greybeard, a breakthrough in interspecies communication that fundamentally changed humanity's understanding of its place in the natural world.</p>

With tuition prices soaring, many parents are questioning whether a brand name alone is worth the financial strain, leading to a more dynamic hierarchy where schools can rise or fall in perceived value. This article explores how schools like Northeastern University have risen in prominence by focusing on unique offerings like co-op programs, while families are now more willing to compromise on prestige for scholarships and tangible career preparation for their children.</p>

With actual income and spending data available, individuals can make more impactful tax planning decisions, especially with recent changes to deductions for state and local taxes. Experts also advise creating a holiday budget now to avoid starting the new year with debt. Proactive steps taken before December 31 can help maximize tax strategies and ensure financial stability heading into 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
