          <p>Certificates of deposit (CDs) offer predictable returns, currently around 4%, making them an attractive option for savers. With economists anticipating Federal Reserve rate cuts by late 2025, locking in today's rates could be a strategic move for a $5,000 deposit. Earnings vary by term, ranging from approximately $53 for a three-month CD at 4.30% APY to over $1,000 for a five-year CD at 4.20% APY. CDs provide a guaranteed return without market volatility, making them suitable for emergency funds or short-term savings goals, but early withdrawal penalties should be considered before committing funds (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Nvidia has released its new Jetson AGX Thor robotics chip module, dubbed a "robot brain," as a developer kit for $3,499, with initial shipments beginning next month. This Blackwell graphics processor-based chip is 7.5 times faster than its predecessor, enabling advanced generative AI models crucial for humanoid robots and self-driving cars. CEO Jensen Huang views robotics as the company's largest growth opportunity outside of artificial intelligence, a sector that has already seen Nvidia's sales more than triple. While robotics currently accounts for only about 1% of Nvidia's total revenue, this segment is experiencing rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper (KDP) announced an approximately $18 billion deal to acquire Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's, aiming to boost KDP's struggling coffee business. Following the acquisition, expected in the first half of 2026, KDP plans to split its beverage and coffee units into two separate, US-listed companies. This move would effectively unwind the 2018 merger that created Keurig Dr Pepper. KDP shares fell 8% on the news, while JDE Peet's stock rose 15%. The deal, which offers a 33% premium to JDE Peet's shareholders, is projected to generate $400 million in cost synergies over three years.</p>

Since its inception in 2018, El Cine has hosted numerous sold-out screenings and community events, collaborating with institutions like the Los Angeles Public Library and the Academy Museum. The organization emphasizes accessibility, offering bilingual screenings and workshops for aspiring filmmakers to combat the perception that Latinos are only the "hands, not the minds" of the film industry. El Cine aims to diversify its offerings, appealing to both casual moviegoers and niche film enthusiasts, and continues to grow its programming and advocacy.</p>

          <p>Canadian investor Kevin O'Leary announced he was one of three buyers who acquired the record-breaking Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan sports card for nearly $13 million at auction. This signed collectible, featuring both NBA legends, surpassed the previous record for the most expensive trading card. O'Leary, along with Matt Allen and Paul Warshaw, formed a syndicate to purchase the card, which he views as a long-term investment, comparing it to holdings in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and gold. He believes the card will not re-enter the market in his lifetime and signifies the growing institutional nature of sports collectibles (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump's federal crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., has resulted in over 1,000 arrests and the seizure of 111 illegal guns, as the city experiences its 12th consecutive day without a homicide. U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro credited the deployment of federal agencies and a unified law enforcement force for reshaping public safety in the capital, which she described as previously one of the most violent cities. FBI Director Kash Patel noted significant contributions from FBI operations, including drug seizures. Trump also signed executive orders targeting cashless bail in D.C. and other jurisdictions, instructing federal prosecutors to pursue criminal charges to avoid such policies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent Premier League matches reveal evolving tactical approaches, particularly in how teams are countering high-pressing strategies. Manchester United's struggles against Fulham highlighted vulnerabilities when opponents overloaded the midfield and exploited spaces behind their back five. Meanwhile, Tottenham successfully attacked Manchester City's flanks to overcome their high press, demonstrating how wingers and midfielders can create numerical superiority and exploit defensive gaps. The trend of wingers pressing central defenders is opening up wide areas, forcing full-backs or central defenders to cover increased distances. These tactical adjustments suggest a dynamic season ahead as teams continue to adapt their offensive and defensive formations.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by the prevalence of "ghost jobs"—job postings without a genuine intent to hire—tech worker Eric Thompson has formed a working group to propose federal legislation. The Truth in Job Advertising and Accountability Act (TJAAA) aims to mandate transparency in job listings, requiring details like intended hire dates, whether a role is new or a backfill, and how many times it's been posted. The proposal also sets limits on posting duration and application review periods, with fines for violators. Thompson's advocacy seeks to address a widespread issue that wastes job seekers' time, pushing for a national solution as state-level efforts prove insufficient.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing a widespread "blind box" craze, where consumers purchase mystery items without knowing the exact variant inside, fueling significant profits for companies like Pop Mart. The elf-like Labubu dolls, created by artist Kasing Lung, are sold exclusively through Pop Mart in this format, encouraging repeat purchases among collectors. This phenomenon, which gained popularity during the pandemic, offers budget-friendly splurges for young Chinese consumers seeking a pick-me-up amidst economic uncertainties. The government, however, has issued warnings against "irrational consumption" and "addiction," particularly among minors, calling for stricter regulations on the trend.</p>

          <p>Amid uncertain economic conditions and expected Federal Reserve rate cuts, financial experts offer guidance on whether to choose high-yield savings accounts or stocks. High-yield savings are recommended for emergency funds, short-term goals, and risk minimization, providing principal protection and predictable returns, though real returns depend on inflation. Stocks are favored for those seeking potentially higher returns and planning for long-term goals, despite carrying market risk and volatility. Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are also presented as a viable alternative for locking in current rates for intermediate-term goals, offering guaranteed returns higher than savings accounts without stock market risk (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Nvidia is facing high Wall Street expectations as it approaches the second anniversary of the generative AI boom, which has seen its revenue more than triple and profits quadruple. The chipmaker, now valued at over $4 trillion, will release its fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts anticipating a 53% year-over-year revenue jump to $45.9 billion. Data center revenue, primarily from major internet companies and cloud providers, accounts for 88% of Nvidia's total sales, driven by its Blackwell line of GPUs.
