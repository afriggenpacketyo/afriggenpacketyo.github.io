          <p>Alaska Airlines experienced a system-wide ground stop due to an IT outage, leading to over 229 flight cancellations. The ground stop was lifted at 11:30 p.m. PT, and the airline is working to restore operations. Passengers are advised to check their flight status and a flexible travel policy is in place. The airline clarified that the outage stemmed from a data center failure, not a cyberattack, and it marks the second IT disruption for the airline this year, with a prior incident in July causing a three-hour halt. With operations now restored, the airline is working to reposition aircrafts and crews throughout its network to get back on schedule. </p>

          <p>The Booker Prize Foundation is introducing a new award for children's fiction, named The Children's Booker Prize, set to launch in 2026 with the first award given in 2027. The prize will celebrate contemporary fiction for children aged eight to twelve. The judging panel will include both adult and child judges, with author Frank Cottrell-Boyce as the inaugural chair. The initiative aims to promote children's reading and champion future classics, with at least 30,000 copies of shortlisted and winning books being gifted to children, as well as offering the shortlisted authors £2,500 each and the winning author £50,000. The award comes at a time when children's reading is reportedly at a 20-year low, with the National Literary Trust announcing the National Year of Reading 2026. </p>

          <h2>Retail Sales Reach Highest Level Since 2022</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 04:33:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retail sales volumes in Great Britain have increased for the fourth consecutive month, with a 0.5% rise in September, defying expectations of a decrease, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The growth was driven by online gold purchases and sales of new tech gadgets like the Nintendo Switch 2 and Apple's iPhone 17. Despite this positive trend, concerns remain about the British economy slowing down, and analysts caution that weak employment, high inflation, and upcoming tax rises may hinder the retail sector's ability to sustain this strength. The ONS gathers its figures from all of Great Britain's large retailers and a representative sample of smaller ones, and monthly figures for retail sales are generally more volatile than quarterly. The ONS statistics are used in deciding government policy, which affects millions, and are also used by the Bank of England to make key financial decisions, such as setting interest rates.

          <p>Munich residents are set to vote on whether the city should bid to host the Summer Olympics for the first time since 1972, including hosting the Paralympics. Other German cities like Berlin and Hamburg are also hoping to host the Games. The Munich Olympics campaign is promoting "Games with Heart and Soul," emphasizing sustainability with most venues near the Olympic Village. Opponents cite high costs, estimated between €18 to €21 billion, and potential increases in housing prices and environmental concerns. The International Olympic Committee could interpret the results of the referendum as a strong indicator of the general mood in Germany regarding the Olympics. </p>

          <p>The Republic of Ireland is holding a presidential election to determine the country's head of state for the next seven years. The race is primarily between Catherine Connolly, an independent candidate backed by left-wing parties, and Heather Humphreys, representing the center-right Fine Gael party. Connolly's campaign focuses on "peace," "unity," and "neutrality," while Humphreys presents herself as a "centre-ground, pro-European, pro-business" candidate. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew from the race after a rent controversy. Vote counting will begin on Saturday, with results expected later in the day at Dublin Castle. </p>
