          <p>President Trump marked Memorial Day by visiting the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery and delivering remarks. This annual tradition involves the president laying a wreath to honor those who died in battle. Earlier in the day, Trump posted a message on Truth Social wishing a "happy Memorial Day to all," while also targeting political opponents and criticizing immigration policies. The president also proclaimed that the U.S. will designate new holidays to commemorate the end of World War I and World War II in Europe, though Veterans Day already exists on Nov. 11. The solemn occasion is intended to honor those who died in uniform as a result of battle.</p>

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano resumed its sporadic eruption, shooting lava hundreds of feet into the air and releasing plumes of ash. Lava fountains from the mountain's north vent reached heights of over 1,000 feet, while the south vent saw fountains reaching over 800 feet. Lava flows remained within Kilauea's summit caldera, posing no immediate threat to residential areas. The volcano also released an eruptive plume containing ash, volcanic rock, and Pele's hair, prompting caution for residents and visitors due to potential hazards from wind-carried volcanic fragments.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated the sale of government rice stockpiles through direct contracts to reduce soaring prices, aiming for a retail price of around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. This action comes in response to criticism that the government has been ineffective in preventing rice prices from skyrocketing amid inflation. The plan involves releasing 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system to better control prices. The agriculture ministry has also established a special response team to address high rice price issues, reflecting the government's commitment to quelling public concerns (not investment advice).</p>

Her organization recruits and trains progressives under 40 to run for office, aiming to dismantle the gerontocracy. Litman suggests that younger leaders are more open to change and challenging established institutions. She advocates for open conversations about retirement and encourages separating work from personhood to improve overall engagement in politics. Litman believes primaries are essential for developing better politicians and that the focus should be on candidates with the skills and stomach to stand up to the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines is ending its long-standing "two bags fly free" policy, marking the first time in over half a century that the company will charge for checked bags. The change comes as baggage fees have become a significant revenue source for U.S. airlines. The airline has not yet announced the specific fees, but competitors typically charge around $35 to $40 for a first checked bag on domestic flights. Along with the new baggage fees, Southwest is also implementing major changes to its business model, including getting rid of open seating and introducing basic-economy tickets.</p>

          <p>The Kremlin has dismissed claims of potential Russian involvement in alleged arson attacks at properties connected to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as "ludicrous." Media reports suggested that UK security officials were investigating a possible link following three incidents earlier this month. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov stated that London tends to suspect Russia of involvement in all negative events happening in Great Britain, and these suspicions are typically baseless. Three men have been charged as part of a police investigation into the attacks.</p>
