          <p>Beginning in early 2026, the United Kingdom's driving theory test for cars and motorcycles will include questions on cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the use of defibrillators. The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) initiated this change, hoping to equip the 2.4 million people who take the test annually with critical life-saving knowledge. Since drivers are often the first to arrive at accident scenes, this measure aims to improve emergency response and prevent avoidable deaths. The official learning materials have already been updated to reflect this new focus on basic first aid skills, which can significantly increase survival rates from cardiac arrest.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has formally acknowledged that France employed "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the 1950s as the nation fought for its independence. In a public letter, Macron admitted France's responsibility for the deaths of several Cameroonian independence leaders and the loss of tens of thousands of lives. This admission follows a 2022 historical report commissioned by France, which detailed mass forced displacements and the use of brutal militias by French colonial authorities. The acknowledgment is part of a broader, though sometimes criticized, effort by Macron's government to confront France's complex and violent colonial history in Africa.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles police have arrested four teenagers suspected of ransacking actor Brad Pitt's home and targeting other high-profile individuals, including actors and professional athletes. The suspects, alleged street gang members aged 16 to 18, were apprehended after an investigation that began following the late June burglary at Pitt's Los Feliz residence. Authorities noted that criminals are increasingly using sophisticated methods like hidden cameras and Wi-Fi jammers to monitor potential victims. The police chief warned that public figures and anyone posting travel information on social media can inadvertently make themselves targets for such crimes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 20:06:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. stock market experienced a significant rally, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq composite approaching record highs, after new data showed inflation was slightly better than expected in July. The consumer price index report fueled investor optimism that the Federal Reserve may have the justification it needs to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. Traders increased their bets on a rate cut to a 94% probability following the news. Lower interest rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, potentially stimulating economic activity and further boosting investment prices across the market.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that U.S. inflation rose by 2.7% year-over-year in July, a figure slightly cooler than the 2.8% economists had predicted. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.2%, aligning with forecasts. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy costs, reached a five-month high at 3.1% annually. Food prices continued to climb, with groceries up 2.2% from the previous year, contributing to financial stress for many American households. The data provides a mixed but crucial signal for the Federal Reserve as it considers a potential interest rate cut in September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, including suspected "key operatives" of the powerful Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, to the United States. This marks the second major prisoner transfer this year as part of a collaboration to combat organized crime. The extradited individuals face charges in American courts for violent offenses and drug trafficking. The move comes as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to intensify its efforts against drug smuggling across the border. Mexican officials confirmed the transfer was contingent on none of the inmates facing the death penalty in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in sensitive and high-profile investigations. The policy change aims to increase transparency and combat misinformation that can arise in cases of significant public interest, such as the riots in 2024. While the decision to release such information will remain at the discretion of individual police forces, the move is intended to create more consistency and fairness. The Home Office welcomed the guidance, stating that public trust requires transparency from authorities.</p>

          <p>A report by a committee of UK Members of Parliament has recommended implementing free bus passes for everyone under the age of 22 in England. The proposal aims to help young people access education and employment opportunities, as rising fares and declining services have become significant barriers. The report highlighted that bus journeys in England have dropped in recent years while costs have outpaced inflation, particularly impacting those in smaller towns and rural areas. Proponents argue that a pilot scheme, similar to the one already active in Scotland, could stimulate local economies and remove a major financial obstacle for youth.</p>

          <p>Following a market rally that saw the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reach record highs, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to remain in the market despite geopolitical and domestic political concerns. He argued that investors who try to time the market by selling during periods of uncertainty often miss out on significant gains, like those seen on Tuesday. Cramer suggested that many of the issues causing pessimism are often resolved after stocks have already recovered. He believes that strong corporate profits and the ability of major companies to adapt to challenges are more important indicators for long-term investing. (not investment advice)</p>
