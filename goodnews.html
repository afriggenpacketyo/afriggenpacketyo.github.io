          <p>A Redditor shared a unique job interview experience where they were accidentally CC'ed on an internal email containing the interviewer's thoughts on their performance and a to-do list. The feedback noted a lack of enthusiasm and a subdued communication style, prompting the job seeker to consider adjusting their personality for an upcoming in-person meeting. The incident sparked a discussion among other users who shared similar accidental disclosures, ranging from positive evaluations to highly unprofessional comments, and offered advice on how to handle such unexpected transparency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at easing regulations for commercial rocket launches, directing the US transportation secretary to expedite environmental reviews for FAA launch licenses. The order cites inefficient permitting processes as a hindrance to investment and innovation in the US space market. This move could particularly benefit private space companies like SpaceX, owned by Elon Musk, which has faced scrutiny over environmental impact studies and licensing delays. Environmental groups have criticized the deregulation, warning of increased risks to people and wildlife from private rocket launches.</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low Alcohol Consumption Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, coinciding with increased public awareness of alcohol's health risks. Younger generations, particularly those aged 18 to 34, show a greater belief that even moderate drinking is harmful, contributing to the decline. The shift is also attributed to the growing social acceptability of not drinking, the popularity of sober challenges, and the rising cost of alcohol. While women's alcohol use has seen a more significant drop than men's, marijuana use remains relatively steady.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by Bill Chisholm, valuing the club at a reported $6.1 billion. This marks the second-largest sale price for a US sports franchise. Chisholm's group will initially acquire at least 51% of the Celtics, with plans to increase their ownership stake and buy out remaining minority shareholders by 2028 at a $7.3 billion valuation. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and longtime Celtics fan, will assume the role of the team's governor.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) reports a significant increase in chikungunya virus cases, with over 70 infections in the first half of the year, more than double last year's figure. All cases are linked to travel, primarily from the Indian Ocean region, particularly India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe and prolonged joint pain. The UKHSA is urging travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent and insecticide-treated bed nets, and to consider a vaccine.</p>

          <p>Australia and Vanuatu have reached a 10-year, A$500 million ($328 million) Nakamal agreement, aiming to strengthen security and economic ties. This deal, described as a "win-win situation," is a strategic move by Australia to expand its influence in the Pacific and counter China's growing presence. The agreement reportedly includes funding for data centers, climate change initiatives, and security enhancements for Vanuatu. While visa-free travel was discussed, it will be addressed in a subsidiary agreement. The pact underscores the "shared destiny" and mutual commitment between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado exhibiting black, horn-like growths have sparked online speculation about "zombie rabbits." Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the images are real, explaining the rabbits suffer from Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively harmless disease. Spread by fleas, ticks, and rabbit-to-rabbit contact, the growths typically disappear as the rabbits' immune systems fight the virus. The illness, which does not transmit to humans or other common pets, is believed to have inspired the mythical "jackalope" and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links.</p>

One firefighter was treated for apparent heat exhaustion while responding to the blaze, highlighting the challenges posed by summer heat. The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, is breathing a sigh of relief as record glacier-related floodwaters from the Mendenhall Glacier's "outburst flood" have receded. The Mendenhall River peaked at an unprecedented 16.65 feet, surpassing last year's record. City officials confirmed minimal flooding thanks to temporary "Hesco" barriers, which protected hundreds of homes. While the immediate threat is over, this annual flooding event, caused by a basin filling with meltwater behind the glacier, is expected to continue for decades. The community faces a long-term challenge, despite the success of current mitigation efforts.</p>

          <p>A growing number of business travelers are combining work with leisure by bringing family members on their trips, a trend known as "bleisure" travel. A TravelPerk survey found over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, have included loved ones. Motivations include reclaiming family time, combating loneliness on the road, and significant cost savings on travel expenses. While some companies quietly permit this, employees often don't broadcast their plans due to concerns about professionalism or policy grey zones regarding expenses and insurance. Companies are increasingly open to the practice if business objectives are met.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is significantly closer to losing his Infowars studio and brand, as a Texas state judge ordered its assets turned over to a receiver. This move paves the way for the sale of Infowars' property to pay the $1.3 billion defamation judgment owed to Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims' families. The families, who endured years of harassment due to Jones' false claims, hope the brand will be sold to a satirical site. While Jones vows to stay on air, this order represents a major step towards accountability and the potential end of Infowars as he knows it.</p>
