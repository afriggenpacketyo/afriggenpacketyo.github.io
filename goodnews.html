          <p>President Trump indicated a willingness to reduce tariffs on China to 80% before trade talks in Switzerland, a significant decrease from the current 145% but still higher than desired by investors. This move signals a potential shift in Trump's approach, as he previously stated he wouldn't lower tariffs to initiate negotiations. The talks aim to establish stability and a foundation for future agreements, amidst concerns over declining goods movement from China to the U.S. The article emphasizes the importance of China as a major U.S. trading partner, with substantial import and export volumes.</p>
