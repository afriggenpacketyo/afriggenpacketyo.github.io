          <p>The Marks & Spencer website experienced a complete outage, preventing users from browsing due to ongoing disruptions following a cyberattack the previous month. M&S estimates that the cyberattack will reduce this year's profits by approximately ¬£300 million, with online services expected to be affected until July. The retailer confirmed that some personal customer data, such as telephone numbers, addresses, and dates of birth, was stolen during the attack, but payment details and account passwords were not compromised. Police are investigating the incident and focusing on a notorious group of English-speaking hackers known as Scattered Spider.</p>

          <p>The European Union has stepped in to provide emergency funding to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty after the Trump administration withheld $75 million in designated funds. The EU's foreign policy chief announced a $6.2 million grant to support the network's independent journalism, while Sweden pledged an additional $2 million. This financial support aims to ensure the survival of Radio Liberty, which has been facing furloughs and programming cuts due to the funding crisis. The network provides non-ideological news coverage to countries in Eastern Europe and neighboring states where press freedom is limited.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng experienced a significant surge in Hong Kong, exceeding 10%, following optimistic earnings reports and a stronger-than-anticipated revenue forecast for the second quarter. The company's first-quarter revenue more than doubled compared to the previous year, fueled by robust sales, and Xpeng delivered 94,008 vehicles during this period, marking a fourfold increase in sales volume. This improved financial performance has narrowed the company's net loss and boosted its gross margin, with analysts anticipating Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter due to strong sales momentum and a pipeline of new models. The automaker aims to begin mass production of vehicles equipped with Level 3 autonomous driving features in China by year-end.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has initiated a revamped gasoline subsidy program designed to reduce prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures for consumers ahead of an upcoming parliamentary election. Under the new scheme, the government will provide a fixed sum regardless of prices, which have recently dropped below the previous benchmark. The subsidy aims to reduce the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week, with further reductions planned in subsequent weeks. With approximately 1 trillion yen allocated to the subsidies, the program could last until the end of March 2026.</p>

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate reflects economic fundamentals, amidst ongoing bilateral tariff negotiations. This acknowledgement suggests that the yen's recent weakness against the dollar is no longer a point of contention in trade discussions. During their meeting, Kato expressed concerns about the global economic and financial market impact of uncertainty created by the Trump administration's tariffs, while Bessent did not push Japan for specific exchange rate targets. Japan remains opposed to the additional tariffs imposed by the United States, particularly those targeting the automotive industry.</p>

          <p>Emerging markets stocks are gaining traction as the "sell U.S." narrative gains momentum, fueled by Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has identified emerging markets as "the next bull market," citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded emerging market equities, noting thawing U.S.-China trade tensions and attractive valuations. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index has outperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date, indicating a shift in investor confidence away from U.S. assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sixteen European consumer groups are pressing the EU to take action against seven low-cost airlines for their baggage fee practices, alleging they mislead passengers and cause confusion. The European Consumer Organisation (BEUC) accuses airlines such as easyJet, Ryanair, and Wizz Air of unfairly charging additional fees for hand baggage that doesn't meet their guidelines. Passengers can face extra costs of up to ‚Ç¨280 to bring on a suitcase. The groups have requested an investigation by the European Commission and national consumer authorities, seeking sanctions for these "illegal" practices and demanding a standard luggage allowance be included in ticket purchases.</p>
