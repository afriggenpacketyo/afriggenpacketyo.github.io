During his Senate confirmation hearing, Gor addressed concerns about recent strains in the relationship, describing them as mere "hiccups" and expressing confidence in a warmer partnership. He outlined his priorities, which include deepening defense and security cooperation through expanded joint military exercises and concluding critical defense sales. Gor also pledged to focus on opening Indian markets to more American goods and ending India's reliance on Russian oil purchases, reinforcing a strategic alignment with the U.S.</p>

          <p>David Ellison, CEO of the newly formed Paramount Skydance, is reportedly preparing a bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery, a move that would create a massive media and content conglomerate. While no formal offer has been made, news of the potential deal caused Warner Bros. Discovery's stock to surge nearly 30%. A merger would combine Paramount's franchises like 'Star Trek' and 'Mission: Impossible' with Warner Bros. Discovery's extensive library, which includes DC superheroes, 'Harry Potter,' and 'Game of Thrones.' The acquisition would also significantly expand Paramount's sports media rights, adding assets like NHL and MLB games to its portfolio.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>English golfer Matt Fitzpatrick finished his first round at the BMW PGA Championship with a strong six-under-par 66, partly due to a bizarre incident involving a potentially stolen ball. After his tee shot on the 18th hole went into the bushes just before a weather delay, his ball could not be found upon resumption of play. Witnesses reported seeing two individuals run out of the bushes with a golf ball, leading to the belief it was stolen. This allowed Fitzpatrick to take a penalty drop instead of playing his provisional ball, a situation he believes ultimately saved him at least one shot and resulted in a better score.</p>

          <p>Manchester United goalkeeper Andre Onana has officially joined Turkish club Trabzonspor on a loan deal for the remainder of the 2025-26 season. The move was completed just before the closing of the Turkish transfer window. Onana, who was signed from Inter Milan for £47.2 million in July 2023, had not featured in any of United's first three Premier League games under new manager Ruben Amorim. His only appearance this season was in the club's surprising Carabao Cup defeat to Grimsby, prompting the search for more regular playing time elsewhere.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has convicted former President Jair Bolsonaro for attempting a coup and leading an armed criminal group to undermine the 2022 election results. The trial, which has captivated the nation, revealed evidence of plots to prevent his successor from taking office, culminating in his supporters storming government buildings in January 2023. This landmark ruling is seen by critics as a crucial step in holding leaders accountable and protecting Brazil's young democracy, which was restored in 1985 after a military dictatorship. Bolsonaro now faces a lengthy prison sentence, though he is expected to appeal the verdict.</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Decline to Near-Yearly Low, Prompting Questions for Homebuyers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 16:12:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in nearly a year, with the average 30-year term now at 6.35%, creating a potential opportunity for homebuyers and those considering refinancing. This decline is largely attributed to expectations of an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential buyers to assess whether to act now or wait for potentially lower rates, acknowledging the risk that rates could rise again unexpectedly. For homeowners, it suggests that if current refinance rates are at least a percentage point lower than their existing mortgage, exploring a refinance could be beneficial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the United States and Japan will equally share profits from American-based projects funded by Tokyo's $550 billion investment until the initial amount is recouped. This investment is part of a new tariff deal where Japan faces a 15% baseline tariff. After Japan's investment is fully returned, the profit-sharing structure will shift to 90% for the U.S. and 10% for Japan. Lutnick explained that this arrangement allows the U.S. to fund domestic manufacturing priorities, such as nuclear power plants and antibiotics, without long-term cost to Japanese taxpayers, who benefit from lower tariffs.

          <p>Eastman Kodak has launched a new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras that has quickly sold out on its website. The palm-sized cameras, created in collaboration with Reto, are marketed as functional fashion accessories and feature filters that mimic the look of vintage film. The strong consumer demand, particularly from Gen Z, comes at a crucial time for Kodak, which recently warned of financial instability. The early success of the Charmera suggests the company has successfully tapped into a growing trend for nostalgic, pre-digital technology and the popular "blind box" purchasing model.</p>
