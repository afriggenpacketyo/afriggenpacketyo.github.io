          <p>Australian markets experienced a slight decline in early trading following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's reelection, marking his second consecutive term, a rare feat in the country's recent history. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 edged down 0.29%, reversing gains from the previous session, while the Australian dollar depreciated marginally against the U.S. dollar. Trading activity was subdued across most of Asia due to public holidays in Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and China. U.S. futures also edged down, contrasting with the strong performance on Wall Street last week, where the S&P 500 achieved its longest winning streak since 2004.</p>

          <p>Recent elections in Canada and Australia saw right-wing parties, inspired by Trump's MAGA playbook, face defeat, while centrists experienced a resurgence. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney campaigned on an anti-Trump platform, highlighting threats to Canada's sovereignty, while Australia's Anthony Albanese indirectly benefited from an anti-Trump sentiment. In Singapore, the incumbent People's Action Party leveraged concerns about Trump's trade wars to secure voter support. However, in Germany, Friedrich Merz, the new chancellor, has used Trump's policies to justify suspending spending limits, arguing for increased defense spending due to diminished American commitment to mutual defense.</p>

          <p>The Royal Family is hoping that VE Day commemorations this week will not be overshadowed by Prince Harry's recent interview, where he discussed his estrangement from his father and his desire for reconciliation. Events begin on Monday with a military procession through central London, followed by an appearance from members of the Royal Family on the Buckingham Palace balcony. King Charles and Queen Camilla will lead the nation in celebrating, commemorating, and giving thanks to the wartime generation, with the commemorations being the first to take place without any of the royals who were present 80 years ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As more women turn to egg freezing, some experts caution against relying on the medical procedure, citing costs and no guarantees. Vardit Ravitsky, president of the Hastings Center, worries that women may think egg freezing guarantees a baby. Stories like Evelyn Gosnell's, who froze her eggs three times without success, illustrate the risks. The expense is also a concern, with a single cycle costing upwards of $12,000, plus storage and thawing fees. Ravitsky suggests companies offer policies like paid parental leave to make it easier for women to have babies younger.</p>

          <p>More American women are freezing their eggs to preserve their fertility, with the number of procedures increasing more than six times over since 2014. The process, which only became an accepted practice 12 years ago, has allowed women to freeze both their eggs and, some say, their biological clocks. Egg freezing is expensive, with a single cycle costing an average of $12,000 to $15,000, plus another $500 to $1,000 each year for storage. While more companies are covering egg freezing, many women, like Tina Rampino, pay out of pocket.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is becoming increasingly popular among young women, with the number of procedures increasing more than six times over since 2014. Women are turning to egg freezing to increase the chances of having a baby when they're older, and to avoid rushing to find partners. A 2022 study found that 70% of women who froze at least 20 eggs before age 38 had a baby, but success rates dropped off considerably the older women were and the fewer eggs they froze. However, critics caution that egg freezing does not guarantee a woman will be able to have a child.</p>

          <p>Egg freezing is a medical procedure in which a woman's eggs are harvested, frozen and stored until she is ready to have children. The hope is that the eggs will produce a child, but that outcome isn't guaranteed. The procedure is extremely expensive, especially for the majority of women who don't have insurance coverage for egg freezing from their employer. Doctors sometimes recommend that a woman undergo multiple cycles of egg freezing to increase the number of eggs available for fertilization and implantation later on to up her chances of success, raising the cost even further.</p>
