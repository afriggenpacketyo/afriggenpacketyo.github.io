          <p>Hong Kong and Shanghai are set to enhance their financial collaboration by signing an agreement at the Lujiazui Forum. Financial Secretary Paul Chan Mo-po will attend the signing of an action plan aimed at fostering collaborative development between the two cities. The agreement is expected to outline cooperation in multiple layers and fields, with speculation that it will expand cross-border trading schemes and initiate trials of financial derivative products. This closer integration aims to bolster China's resilience against potential financial decoupling from the U.S. and geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>The Leipzig Bach Festival features contemporary arrangements of Johann Sebastian Bach's masterpieces that address themes of oppression and conflict. The "Queer Passion" focuses on the suffering of LGBTQ+ individuals, while the "Arabian Passion" promotes peace between the West and the East amidst Middle East conflicts. This year's festival, themed "transformation," explores how Bach's music can be adapted to reflect modern issues. The festival also celebrates the 75th anniversary of the Leipzig Bach Archive, highlighting Bach's enduring relevance in addressing contemporary social and political challenges.</p>

          <p>President Trump has requested funding from Congress for a "Golden Dome for America," a missile defense system inspired by Israel's Iron Dome. The Iron Dome is a network of interceptor missiles that has successfully intercepted thousands of rockets in Israel. However, experts note that building a similar system in the U.S. would be significantly more complex due to the country's size and the different types of missiles that would need to be intercepted. The scale and nature of potential threats to the U.S. pose substantial challenges compared to the Israeli context.</p>

He emphasized the importance of establishing clear targets within a specific timeframe to focus the club's efforts. While acknowledging the challenge, Berrada remains optimistic about the team's potential to achieve this ambitious goal.</p>

          <p>China showcased a scale model of its J-35A fifth-generation fighter jet at the Paris Air Show, marking its first overseas display of this advanced military aircraft. The J-35A, a land-based variant of the J-35, was developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation and is China's second fifth-generation fighter jet after the J-20. While the J-20 is not available for export, the J-35A is being marketed to developing countries, particularly in the Middle East and South Asia. China aims to boost export sales of its fighter aircraft, despite limited success in the European market due to political and military relations with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stopped between stations. JR East, the operator, anticipates resuming services around 7 p.m. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, was scheduled to arrive at Morioka station in Iwate prefecture. The suspension caused two other trains to halt between stations, disrupting travel for passengers in the region.</p>

          <p>Chris Woakes' return to the England team for the first Test against India at Headingley is seen as particularly important. At 36, he is the oldest player in the squad and brings valuable accuracy and movement to the attack. Amid the focus on high pace, Woakes is likely to bowl the first over for England, tormenting an Indian batting line-up with limited experience in English conditions. Woakes' experience and skill make him a key asset for England in the upcoming series.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, but did not address the expected removal of charges on steel imports. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the move a "very important day" for both countries. The UK government hopes the pact will shield British businesses from the impact of Trump's tariffs, though steel tariffs remain a point of contention.</p>

          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys this year, with spot prices surging 30%. Market experts attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical instability have fueled demand for gold as a safe store of value. While the dollar and U.S. Treasurys have historically served as safe havens, recent events have shaken confidence in these assets, leading investors to seek alternatives like gold.</p>
