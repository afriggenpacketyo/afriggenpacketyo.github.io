          <h2>Judge Blocks Trump Administration's National Guard Deployment to Los Angeles</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary ruling against the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard to Los Angeles, siding with California's challenge to the president's decision. Judge Charles Breyer stated that the president's actions exceeded his statutory authority and violated the Tenth Amendment, ordering the return of the National Guard to Governor Gavin Newsom's control. The ruling is on hold pending appeal, with Newsom urging Trump to end the militarization of Los Angeles. The case centers on the interpretation of Title 10, which outlines the circumstances under which the National Guard can be called into federal service.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California Governor Gavin Newsom's argument that the activation was improper. The order mandates Trump return control of the National Guard to Newsom by noon Friday, though the ruling may be appealed. This decision marks a setback for the White House in its efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and manage public opposition, as Trump had deployed the Guard and Marines citing a "rebellion against the authority of the government."</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China During the Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research indicates that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, challenging the conventional view that domestication first occurred in the Near East. Archaeologists analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs consumed humans' cooked foods and waste. This suggests that the domestication of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, coincided with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles in ancient Chinese society. The study offers new insights into the origins of animal domestication and early agricultural practices.</p>

          <p>Patrick Reed recorded an albatross, a double-eagle, during the first round of the US Open by holing out a 3-wood from 286 yards on the par-5 fourth hole. Despite this exceptional shot, Reed finished the round at 3-over 73, including a triple bogey on the final hole. This marks only the fourth albatross in US Open history since records began in 1983, joining a select group of golfers. Reed reflected on previous experiences with double eagles, including one he witnessed as a child and another he made at a tournament in Germany.</p>

Production abroad is considered key to their long-term viability, with firms diversifying their production bases in response to trade tensions. While a 90-day truce was reached, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are increasingly focusing on the Middle East and Africa for planned capacity expansion.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, has launched an initiative to lower rice prices, reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. This move comes as the public faces rising living costs and the LDP prepares for upcoming elections. Koizumi's actions, including releasing government stockpiled rice at reduced prices, aim to capture public imagination and address agricultural sector issues. Analysts suggest this could boost his political prospects and provide a lifeline for the LDP amid public frustration over rising prices.</p>
