          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was captured after escaping from an Arkansas prison where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault. Hardin, who impersonated a corrections officer to escape, was found 1.5 miles from the prison after a nearly two-week manhunt involving bloodhounds, horseback officers, drones, and a U.S. Border Patrol team. Investigators are eager to question Hardin about his escape, which involved a lapse in verification procedures by a prison officer. Hardin had previously pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to 50 years for a 1997 sexual assault, bringing relief to the victim's family upon his capture.</p>

          <p>In Arizona, Border Patrol agents discovered seventeen migrants crammed into an RV and a sedan amidst sweltering heat, leading to the arrest of a U.S. citizen for human smuggling. The migrants, all from Mexico and including a minor, were found in inhumane conditions with limited space, ventilation, and no access to running water, while the rest were wedged into a small sedan that was discovered during a vehicle stop. Authorities say this rescue likely prevented a tragedy, highlighting the dangers migrants face in the hands of smugglers who treat human lives as cargo. The rescued individuals are being processed for expedited removal, and investigators are working to determine whether others were involved.</p>

Hoffman had an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placed in her chest to prevent future cardiac arrests and began cardiac rehabilitation, later reuniting with the nurses to express her gratitude.

These drones have created problems for Russian ground forces by spotting and attacking troop gatherings, limiting Russia's advantage.

          <p>An NPR article examines the concept of federal rental aid with time limits, focusing on Delaware's approach, which includes a seven-year limit, work requirements, and a savings incentive. The Delaware program allows tenants to save money by keeping monthly payments flat, with extra funds going into a savings account. While some experts support time limits to encourage turnover, others argue they can be detrimental without adequate support, citing a failed experiment in Washington state. The success of Delaware's program is attributed to its comprehensive support system, including savings accounts and assistance with budgeting, childcare, and health insurance.</p>

          <p>An Atlantic article discusses President Trump's plan to hold a military parade in Washington, D.C., examining both the criticisms and potential benefits of such an event. While some critics view the parade as an authoritarian display of power, the author argues that it could offer an opportunity to celebrate the troops, counter misperceptions about the military, and boost recruitment. The article emphasizes the importance of ensuring the parade does not become a politicized event and instead serves to reconnect veterans with the country.</p>

          <h2>NHS App Expansion Aims to Streamline Patient Communication</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 06:54:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS app in England is set to become the primary communication method for millions more patients, sending test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones. The government projects this digital shift will save the health service ¬£200 million over the next three years, facilitated by a ¬£50 million investment in the app. While those without app access will receive text messages and letters, the goal is to reduce reliance on traditional methods and free up NHS phone lines. The upgrade is expected to improve patient access to healthcare management and reduce missed appointments.</p>
