          <p>The administrator of an Islamic religious and educational complex in Pakistan has refuted India's claim that the site is a terrorist hub, following a missile strike on May 7 that resulted in three deaths. Muhammad Azam, the administrator, asserted that the facility has no ties with any militant groups and is overseen by government-appointed administrators. The complex, formerly run by a militant group but now managed by the Pakistani government, includes schools, a seminary, a vocational center, dormitories, and a clinic. Azam urged the Indian government to engage in dialogue and resolve contentious issues through peaceful means.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area as a fast-moving wall of dust blanketed the city and suburbs. The National Weather Service confirmed it was only the second time in its history that it had issued a dust storm warning, with the first time being on May 7, 2023. The dust storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, significantly reduced visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Showers and thunderstorms mixed with the dust storm, resulting in reports of "mud rain."</p>

          <p>Angels Flight Railway in Los Angeles will increase its fares from $1.00 to $1.50, marking the first price hike since 2017. The increase is necessary to address rising costs related to insurance, maintenance, and labor. A souvenir round trip will cost $3, while L.A. Metro TAP Card users can continue to ride at half price. The railway, a historic funicular, has faced numerous challenges over the years, including maintenance issues and safety concerns, but has remained a beloved landmark.</p>

A new team has been established to lead the infrastructure and technological development required to combine AI predictions with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system would analyze historical weather data to generate more accurate forecasts for temperature, rainfall, and typhoon paths. Humans will still play an oversight role and issue final forecasts, even with the introduction of AI predictions.</p>

          <p>A sake brewery in southwestern Japan, Fujii Shuzo, with over 150 years of history, has begun offering a seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques. The seminar, part of a course organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to spread awareness and appreciation about sake beyond Japan. The seminar allows for hands-on experience of the traditional sake-making techniques that have been added to UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list last year. The brewery hopes to increase exports to Europe through this initiative, counteracting the shrinking domestic sake market.</p>
