          <p>Japan and the United States are continuing negotiations to reach a tariff agreement by mid-June, despite ongoing disagreements. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister for economic revitalization, expressed optimism after talks with U.S. officials, noting "further progress" was made. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, including a 14% country-specific tariff and a 25% tariff on automobiles. Japan has proposed joint efforts to strengthen supply chains, expand U.S. farm product imports, and simplify requirements for foreign-made cars, aiming for a deal that benefits both nations. The leaders of both countries plan to discuss the issue at the upcoming Group of Seven summit in Canada.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba is seeking to reform Japan's rice policy in response to rising rice prices and an upcoming national election. With rice prices having doubled, Ishiba aims to overhaul the production adjustment system to counter opposition parties advocating for consumption tax cuts. The government has already started releasing reserve rice to retailers to lower prices, and Ishiba has expressed a desire to boost rice exports to prevent overproduction. Some experts caution against using rice policy as a political tool, warning of potential market turmoil, while others support the move as a way to address public concerns and maintain farmer motivation. The government's stockpile of rice is around 1 million tons, with 312,000 tons released since March.</p>

          <p>Former NFL star Tom Rafferty, who played guard and center for the Dallas Cowboys from 1976 to 1989, has died at the age of 70.

The airline is delaying the acceptance of two Embraer 175 regional jets to avoid incurring additional tariff-related costs.
