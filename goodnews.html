          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples can reduce conflict and improve their relationship satisfaction by using a "relationship bank account." This involves making regular "deposits" through actions that prioritize the partner's happiness and create a sense of security. A positive balance in this account allows couples to handle disagreements more effectively, while a negative balance can lead to escalating fights. The expert recommends identifying what makes each partner feel loved and appreciated to determine the specific actions that will strengthen the relationship.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to invest $19 billion in a new nuclear power plant project, known as Sizewell C. This significant investment aims to create 10,000 jobs and provide a reliable source of electric power for millions of homes. While the project is expected to be expensive to build, it represents a strategic effort to enhance the UK's energy security and reduce reliance on foreign energy sources. The decision underscores the government's commitment to nuclear power as part of its long-term energy strategy.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has defended his government's decision to partially reverse cuts to winter fuel payments, attributing the change to an improved economy rather than political pressure. Under the revised policy, nine million pensioners in England and Wales with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less will receive the payment this winter. The government had previously announced it would remove the payments from more than 10 million pensioners, but faced pressure from charities, unions, and backbench MPs. The move has drawn criticism from opposition parties and think tanks, who question the economic rationale and potential complexity of the policy.</p>

The museum's governing board stated that all personnel decisions are made by the secretary, with oversight by the board, effectively pushing back against Trump's claim of authority. Trump had announced Sajet's firing on social media, citing her as "highly partisan and a strong supporter of DEI." The standoff underscores the ongoing tensions between the White House and cultural institutions over political interference and ideological alignment.</p>

While the software updates were significant, Wall Street was underwhelmed by the incremental AI features, sending the stock down.
