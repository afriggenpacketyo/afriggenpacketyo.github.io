          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to garner support for a budget package containing his legislative priorities, facing resistance from both conservative and moderate factions. Conservatives are pushing for steeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates oppose significant cuts to the program and want adjustments to the state and local tax deduction. Speaker Mike Johnson is attempting to bridge these divides before a Memorial Day deadline, but disagreements persist on key issues. Trump urged Republicans to unify behind the bill, warning against dissent, as the House Rules Committee convened to prepare the package for a floor vote.</p>

          <p>Norwegian energy company Equinor will resume construction on its Empire Wind 1 offshore wind farm in New York after the Trump administration lifted a prior halt on the project.

The decision came after discussions between Equinor and White House officials, seemingly involving a compromise related to a gas pipeline.

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission is considering allowing asset managers to offer ETF share classes of existing mutual funds, potentially giving investors more choice but also raising tax concerns. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief to offer this option. One of the SEC's hesitations in approving these relief applications appears to be concern that co-mingling the funds might result in ETF holders getting hit with an unexpected tax bill. Dimensional Fund Advisors has proposed updated guidelines to address tax impact issues, but the SEC has declined to comment.</p>

          <p>Home Depot announced it will maintain its current pricing levels, even as tariffs on goods from China remain in effect, following President Trump's criticism of Walmart for warning of potential price hikes. The home improvement retailer is working with suppliers to hold prices steady and shifting production out of China to avoid tariffs. More than half of Home Depot's goods are domestically produced, and the company aims to further reduce its reliance on China. This contrasts with Walmart's warning that tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has prompted questions about the stability of renewable energy sources and reignited debates over the phasing out of nuclear power. The blackout, believed to be one of the worst in Europe's history, occurred shortly after renewables accounted for around 70% of Spain's electricity production. While some have blamed the high reliance on renewables, experts suggest the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources. Solutions for improving grid stability include virtual inertia, better battery storage, and increased flexibility in grid systems.</p>

This strategy contrasts with Walmart, which has indicated it will raise prices to cover higher costs from tariffs. Home Depot maintained its full-year sales forecast, despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, and noted improved sales patterns as the quarter progressed.</p>
