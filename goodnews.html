          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he placed on an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A Westminster Magistrates' Court order confirmed the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, stemming from undeclared revenue from his online businesses. This forfeiture is in addition to £2.7 million previously seized from Tate and his brother by the same police force in December 2024 for similar tax-related offenses. The seized funds will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential supplies for their dorm rooms. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings and are often unaware of the basic necessities they will need, from bedding and towels to lamps and toolboxes. The organization, which started with a small Amazon wishlist, now supports over 140 students, allowing them to select their own items to personalize their new living spaces and helping to level the playing field on their first day of college.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are set to move from their current Adelaide Cottage residence to the larger, eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located within Windsor Great Park. The move keeps the family in Berkshire, allowing their three children, George, Charlotte, and Louis, to continue attending the nearby Lambrook School. The relocation follows the recent publication of royal finances, which announced cost-saving measures, and provides the family with a home nestled in a 4,800-acre park, aligning with Princess Kate's advocacy for the healing power of nature during her cancer treatment.</p>

Since acquiring the historic theater in 2022, the couple has worked to preserve its vintage charm while modernizing its business model by operating year-round and hosting community events like craft fairs and car shows. After an initial struggle, the business became profitable in 2024, generating nearly $550,000 in revenue and ensuring the preservation of a piece of film history.</p>

Starmer welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing robust security guarantees for Ukraine as part of any potential peace agreement and affirmed that allies will continue to support Ukraine and maintain pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market surged from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to data from Canalys. This shift is partly attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. By offering a wider range of devices at various price points, from low-end models to premium foldables, Samsung is effectively challenging Apple's long-held dominance in the high-end American market.

          <p>Fugitive Jamie Rothwell, who was running a multi-million-pound drugs and guns operation from Spain, was captured after law enforcement hacked the EncroChat encrypted phone network he used for his criminal enterprise. The international operation gave detectives access to messages exposing his role in trafficking weapons like AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting. A crucial breakthrough came when Rothwell, believing the network was secure, shared a selfie and a picture of the view from his Barcelona apartment, allowing police to identify and locate him, leading to his extradition and a 43-year sentence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy, developing emotional endurance—the ability to withstand stress without being overcome by negative emotions—is crucial for personal growth. She recommends three powerful steps: using a visual reminder that learning is a process, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments, and undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone. By practicing these techniques, individuals can learn to tolerate discomfort and see challenges as opportunities for development rather than signs of failure.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level since the question was first tracked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, with a growing number of people believing that even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is particularly pronounced among underage individuals, where self-reported drinking has fallen dramatically since the 1990s. This cultural shift is seen as positive for public health, potentially reducing alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social harms.</p>

The firm suggests that if a standalone turnaround is not viable, Avantor should consider a full sale of the company to maximize shareholder value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Yara Souza, an American student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first archaeological excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, a decorative piece about 1.5 inches long, was found near the route of a major Roman road and is believed to have been used by high-status individuals for religious or ceremonial purposes. The find is considered exceptional and may have been deliberately buried alongside a similar object discovered in the same area in 2021, offering new insights into early medieval life in the region.</p>
