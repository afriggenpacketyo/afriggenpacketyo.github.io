          <p>A family of three was dramatically rescued by the Coast Guard off Cape Cod after their 30-foot pleasure boat caught fire, forcing them to swim to a small island. They were stranded on Naushon Island for almost two days, sheltering in a barn, before the son ingeniously used the boat’s washed-up marine radio to send a mayday call. This critical action led to their successful rescue by a Coast Guard helicopter, transporting them to an area hospital. While one family member was in critical condition, the others were stable. This incident highlights the crucial importance of quick thinking and having quality emergency equipment during unforeseen maritime disasters.</p>

          <p>From 2026, menopause screening will be officially integrated into NHS health checks in England, which are offered to adults aged 40-74 every five years. This initiative aims to identify women who could benefit from advice, support, and treatments like hormone replacement therapy, drugs for hot flushes, or counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasized that this move will bring menopause into the mainstream, addressing a long-standing issue of women suffering in silence. Campaigners welcome the change but highlight concerns about low health check uptake in certain communities, stressing the need for broader accessibility and staff training.</p>

          <p>Eurovision star Sam Ryder has revealed a period of deep depression and feeling "worthless" after his debut album was rushed and his record label team was sacked following his 2022 success. Despite achieving a lifelong dream at Eurovision, the subsequent career turbulence led him to leave his label and go independent, facing a crisis of confidence and losing belief in music. Ryder found recovery by recommitting to his faith and moving to Nashville with his partner. His new album, "Heartland," reflects this journey, exploring themes of struggle while ultimately celebrating resilience and gratitude.</p>

Despite this strong financial performance, including a 9% revenue increase, IBM's stock unexpectedly dropped about 6% in extended trading.

          <p>The UK's inflation rate remained static at 3.8% in September, falling short of the expected 4% mark, suggesting a potential peak and a downward trend in the coming spring. This stability, despite inflation remaining high compared to other G7 countries, offers Chancellor Rachel Reeves unexpected fiscal breathing room. The article highlights that food price inflation has also peaked, potentially reducing self-fulfilling wage-price spirals and lowering the chances of immediate interest rate hikes. This more benign outlook could save billions from the Budget gap and signals that markets are not treating the UK as an outlier. (not investment advice)</p>
