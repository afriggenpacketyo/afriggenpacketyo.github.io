          <h2>National Park Service Debunks Viral Rumors of Mass Wildlife Exodus from Yellowstone</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 18:42:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Park Service has refuted viral social media claims that large numbers of wildlife are fleeing Yellowstone National Park, stating the videos are likely AI-generated and false. Wildlife experts confirm that animal movements are normal for the season and there is no mass migration underway. The rumors, which some users linked to a potential supervolcano eruption, have been dismissed by geologists who note the volcano's alert level remains "normal." Officials expressed concern that such misinformation can undermine public understanding of natural ecological processes.</p>

          <p>Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has announced that his country will no longer block the European Union's 18th sanctions package against Russia. Slovakia had previously held up the measures due to concerns about a separate EU plan to phase out Russian gas imports by 2028. Fico stated that Slovakia received necessary guarantees from the EU regarding future gas prices and supply, making it "counterproductive" to continue the blockade. The new sanctions, which require unanimous approval, target Russia's energy and banking sectors, including its Nordstream pipelines.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 18:31:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump was diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild leg swelling. Medical experts describe CVI as a common circulatory condition, affecting up to 40% of the U.S. population, where damaged veins in the legs struggle to return blood to the heart. This can lead to symptoms like varicose veins, swelling, and in severe cases, skin discoloration or ulcers. Treatment is typically non-surgical, focusing on compression stockings, exercise like walking to strengthen calf muscles, and lifestyle changes to manage the benign condition.</p>

          <p>The Long Beach City Council is considering a proposal to bring a new independent professional baseball team to the city's historic Blair Field. The effort is led by an ownership group that includes Paul Freedman, a co-founder of the successful Oakland Ballers. The proposed team would join the Pioneer League as an expansion franchise starting next season. Despite previous independent league teams in Long Beach having failed, proponents believe the city's strong baseball tradition and the stability of the Pioneer League create a new opportunity for success. The plan involves a collaborative partnership with Long Beach State, the ballpark's primary tenant.</p>

          <p>All-Star guard Damian Lillard is reportedly finalizing a three-year, $42 million contract to return to the Portland Trail Blazers, the team where he played his first 11 seasons. The deal is said to include a player option and a no-trade clause. Lillard, who was waived by the Milwaukee Bucks earlier in the month, chose to rejoin Portland despite interest from other playoff contenders. He is expected to miss the upcoming season while recovering from Achilles tendon surgery but will rejoin a retooling Blazers roster that now includes Jrue Holiday, Scoot Henderson, and Robert Williams III.</p>

          <p>The fentanyl crisis, a major public health and security issue in the United States, is likely to be integrated into upcoming trade negotiations with China, according to policy analysts. As a politically salient topic in Washington, it could be leveraged in broader bilateral talks, potentially serving as a new phase in diplomatic engagement. Some experts believe that addressing the issue could help ease economic tensions between the two global powers, following a 90-day truce established in May. Fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid, is the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 45.</p>

          <p>Mexican pop star Belinda has revealed that her recent song "Heterocomía" was a cathartic project, even though it is unlikely to be profitable. To create the track's introduction, she brokered an expensive deal with Disney to sample the theme from the 1970 film "The Aristocats." The song's lyrics, which transition from a whimsical opening to a tale of deception, are widely speculated by fans to be about her past relationship with a billionaire heir known for having heterochromia. While Belinda has not confirmed the rumors, she stated the artistic result was worth the cost, suggesting the "sweet revenge" was more valuable than royalties.</p>

          <p>Congress has passed the Genius Act, landmark bipartisan legislation that creates a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The bill, which passed the House after clearing the Senate, establishes rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies, aiming to provide consumer protection and foster innovation. Supporters argue the law will solidify U.S. leadership in digital payments by enabling faster, lower-cost transactions. The move aligns with the Trump administration's broader goal of supporting the cryptocurrency industry and easing regulations on the emerging sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto's emergence as an All-Star and the team's most dependable starter is attributed to the crucial experience he gained during last year's postseason. After an inconsistent rookie season, Yamamoto delivered a pivotal, five-inning scoreless performance in a winner-take-all playoff game against the San Diego Padres, which he called the most nervous start of his career. That high-pressure success became a major source of confidence, propelling him into a dominant sophomore season. He has become a clubhouse leader, admired for his work ethic and newfound stability on the mound.</p>
