          <p>The Trump administration has announced a 90-day extension on the deadline for a new trade deal with Mexico, delaying the imposition of broader 30% tariffs. Following a conversation with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, President Trump stated the current terms will remain, which include a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and a 50% tariff on key metals. This move provides temporary relief and continues negotiations, though economists have previously warned that such tariffs could lead to increased consumer prices in the United States.

          <p>Labubu dolls, plush monster-like creatures from Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, are experiencing a surge in popularity in the United States, becoming a sought-after fashion accessory and collectible. Driven by social media trends and celebrity sightings, the dolls have significantly boosted Pop Mart's revenue, with North American sales climbing 900% in the first quarter of 2025. Analysts describe the phenomenon as a "gateway" for consumers into Pop Mart's wider range of products, transforming the item from a simple toy into a cultural status symbol. The company's stock has soared, reflecting the brand's rapid expansion from a primarily Chinese market to a global one.</p>

          <p>A late-stage trial by Eli Lilly demonstrated that its diabetes drug Mounjaro offers significant heart and kidney health benefits compared to its older treatment, Trulicity. While Mounjaro met the primary goal of being no worse than Trulicity in reducing major cardiovascular events, it also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and superior kidney protection. These findings strengthen Mounjaro's case to become the preferred first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes, especially as Trulicity's patent is set to expire in 2027. The company plans to submit the new data to regulators, potentially expanding insurance coverage for the drug by 2026.</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not see artificial superintelligence as an imminent threat to the design software company. Field argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. This statement comes as Figma priced its IPO at $33 per share, valuing the company at $19.3 billion, after its planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was terminated due to regulatory hurdles. The CEO's comments position the company as resilient in an era of rapid AI development.</p>

CEO Mark Zuckerberg also detailed his vision for developing "superintelligence," reinforcing the company's massive investments in AI, including a $14.3 billion stake in Scale AI.

          <p>A 15-year-old boy named Majid Shaghnobi has become the first child with war-related injuries from Gaza to arrive in the United Kingdom for medical care. Majid suffered a shattered jaw from an Israeli tank shell explosion and will undergo reconstructive surgery at London's Great Ormond Street children's hospital. His arrival was facilitated by Project Pure Hope, a volunteer group of medical professionals, and follows a recent promise by the UK government to evacuate more seriously injured children. The case highlights the devastating impact of the conflict on children and the challenges of accessing specialized medical treatment outside the war-torn region.</p>

          <h2>UK Signals Potential Recognition of Palestinian State, Shifting Long-Held Foreign Policy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's government has indicated a significant foreign policy shift, suggesting it could recognize a Palestinian state as early as September. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated that recognition is the "inalienable right of the Palestinian people" and is being used as political leverage to push for a two-state solution. This change comes amid domestic pressure from protests and Labour Party supporters, and follows similar moves by other European nations like France. The policy marks a departure from Britain's historical stance of linking recognition to a final peace deal, reflecting the growing international and internal urgency surrounding the Gaza conflict.</p>

          <p>The launch of a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule carrying four astronauts to the International Space Station was scrubbed just 67 seconds before its scheduled liftoff on Thursday. The delay was caused by a cumulus cloud that violated weather rules over the Kennedy Space Center launch pad. The mission, designated Crew-11, includes astronauts who were rescheduled after issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule altered previous flight plans. The next launch opportunity is Friday, though forecasters predict potentially worsening conditions, further delaying the crew's journey to the orbiting laboratory. The crew remains ready for the next attempt.</p>

          <p>Chaplain Joon Park of Tampa General Hospital in Florida provides spiritual care to patients facing end-of-life crises, an experience he says often brings people closer to spirituality. Park, who found his own path to faith after a difficult childhood, believes death is a profoundly spiritual event where people question the meaning and value of their lives. He observes that in these moments, some patients find strength in a higher power while others express anger, both of which he validates as spiritual experiences. For Park, the hospital is a sacred space where the presence of love reflects the presence of God.</p>
