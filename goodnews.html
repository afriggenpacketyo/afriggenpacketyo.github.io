          <p>Following two days of trade talks in London, US President Donald Trump announced a wide-ranging deal with China to maintain a fragile truce established after previous talks in Geneva.

The move, fulfilling a campaign promise, aims to "restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula." In response, North Korea appears to have ceased its own loudspeaker broadcasts targeting the South, although official confirmation is pending. The broadcasts, which included propaganda messages and K-pop music, had resumed in June 2024 after North Korea sent trash-filled balloons toward the South.</p>
