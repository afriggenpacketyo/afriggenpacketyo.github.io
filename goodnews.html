          <p>The Kansas City Chiefs overcame a sluggish first half to defeat the New York Giants 22-9, earning their first win of the season. After struggling to find a rhythm early on, quarterback Patrick Mahomes connected with Tyquan Thornton for a key touchdown in the third quarter. The Chiefs' defense successfully contained Giants quarterback Russell Wilson, holding him to just 160 passing yards. The victory improves the Chiefs' record to 1-2, while the Giants fall to a challenging 0-3 start.</p>

          <p>China's five-year plans serve as the nation's primary roadmap for social and economic development, a practice adopted from the former Soviet Union in 1953. These strategic documents set quantitative goals and priorities that have guided the country's transformation from extreme poverty to the world's second-largest economy and a technological powerhouse. The plans are fundamental to understanding Beijing's long-term objectives, dictating which sectors and industries receive strategic focus. This system has been a consistent feature of Chinese governance for over seven decades, shaping its domestic policy and global economic impact.</p>

She now works as a fractional head of communications, a role where she is deeply embedded in multiple companies on a part-time basis, guiding their overall strategy. This transition to fractional work, which gained traction during the pandemic as companies sought leaner solutions, allowed her to increase her annual income from approximately $56,000 to $220,000. De Foe reports greater fulfillment and autonomy, stating she is happier and will never return to having a single boss.</p>

          <p>Most stock markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded higher on Monday, taking cues from a strong closing on Wall Street. Investor sentiment was also shaped by China's central bank deciding to keep its benchmark loan prime rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. Japan's Nikkei 225 saw a notable rise of 1.28%, while markets in South Korea and Australia also posted gains. Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index was a slight exception, trading marginally lower in the session. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media mogul Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan could be part of the American group set to take control of TikTok's U.S. operations. During a Fox News interview, Trump also mentioned Dell founder Michael Dell as a potential participant alongside Oracle's Larry Ellison. The deal is intended to resolve national security concerns about the social media platform's Chinese ownership by transferring control of data and security to an American-led board. This development comes after Trump stated he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had made progress on approving the final deal.</p>

          <p>A growing number of people are curating personal playlists as a form of therapy to navigate terminal illness and prepare for death. The practice is increasingly recognized in palliative care for its ability to evoke powerful memories, reduce anxiety, and create moments of connection between patients and their loved ones. Experts note that music can light up multiple parts of the brain, providing comfort even when a person is unconscious. For families, these shared songs can become a lasting source of solace and a way to keep the memory of their loved one alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research involving over 200 parent-child relationships suggests that children with exceptional social skills are often raised in environments where emotional safety and authentic connection are prioritized. The article identifies nine key things these parents do, such as openly discussing feelings, modeling empathy in daily life, and validating their child's emotions. Rather than simply memorizing polite phrases, children learn effective communication by observing their parents' behavior. These practices help children develop confidence, emotional regulation, and the ability to repair relationships after conflict.</p>

          <p>A pioneering project on the island of Nantucket is using genetic engineering to combat the spread of Lyme disease. Scientists are working to create a population of wild white-footed mice that are hereditarily immune to the bacteria that causes the illness. Since mice are the primary carriers, this would break the transmission cycle, as ticks feeding on the engineered mice would not become infected. The project, called "Mice Against Ticks," involves extensive community consultation to decide whether to proceed with releasing the modified animals into the ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has launched its inaugural class, positioning itself as a new model for higher education dedicated to the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded by prominent intellectuals concerned about the lack of ideological diversity and the prevalence of self-censorship on traditional campuses, UATX emphasizes open debate and intellectual rigor. The start-up university, which is currently offering free tuition, aims to create an environment where differing views are welcomed and challenged, rather than silenced. Its curriculum is rooted in Western civilization and seminar-style classes.</p>

The game marked a franchise milestone, as attendance for the season surpassed four million for the first time.
