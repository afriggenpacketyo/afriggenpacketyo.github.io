The ship's crew initiated a swift rescue, deploying a boat and recovering both individuals within minutes, an event captured on video by fellow passengers. While the family's identities remain undisclosed, the successful rescue was met with cheers and relief from onlookers. Experts note that survival rates for overboard incidents are typically low, highlighting the effectiveness of the crew's response and the father's immediate action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey revealed that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, defying forecasts of a contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, contrasting with the official government PMI which showed a third consecutive month of contraction for the broader manufacturing sector. This divergence may be explained by exporters front-loading shipments to avoid potential U.S. tariffs and pivoting to alternative markets in Southeast Asia and Europe. The data suggests some resilience in China's export sector amid ongoing trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has identified betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, as a key factor in slowing the aging process. The research, published in the journal Cell, found that betaine helps prevent inflammation and the aging of multiple organs. It appears to work by inhibiting a specific enzyme, revealing a molecular pathway that links physical activity to longevity. These findings could lead to new anti-aging strategies that simulate the beneficial effects of exercise.</p>

          <p>China's coffee market, now a $42 billion industry, is experiencing a new trend as cafes proliferate in rural and suburban areas, attracting urbanites seeking scenic, social-media-worthy experiences. While this boom reflects a significant cultural shift in the traditionally tea-drinking nation, some observers question its long-term sustainability. Many of these new cafes rely on novelty and unique settings to draw customers, who may not return after an initial visit. The trend highlights the rapid growth of coffee consumption in China, with imports having grown over 650% since 2020.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have made early moves in NBA free agency, agreeing to a two-year, $12 million deal with forward Jake LaRavia. This signing came shortly after the team lost a key role player, Dorian Finney-Smith, who agreed to a four-year, $53 million contract with the Houston Rockets. Finney-Smith had been a significant contributor for the Lakers, valued for his defensive versatility.

          <p>The U.S. military commander overseeing National Guard troops in Los Angeles has asked the Trump administration to return 200 of them to California's state command. The request comes as the state faces a new fire season with its specialized firefighting Guard unit at just 40% strength, partly due to protest-related deployments. Governor Gavin Newsom, who has legally challenged the federalization of the troops as illegal, supports the move to get them back to their critical firefighting duties. The decision highlights the tension between federal deployment for civil unrest and state-level emergency response needs.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has proposed that a new generation of younger investors is significantly influencing the stock market by rewarding companies with bold, forward-looking ideas rather than traditional metrics. He argues these investors are less concerned with Federal Reserve policy and more interested in the narratives of growth companies like Robinhood, Reddit, and DoorDash. According to Cramer, this has created an "idea market" where the potential of a company's story can drive its valuation, punishing more established firms that focus on conservative strategies like stock buybacks.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy stated that despite the implementation of widespread tariffs, the company has not yet observed a significant increase in prices for consumers on its platform. He attributed this stability to mitigation strategies, including Amazon and its third-party sellers making large forward purchases of inventory before the tariffs took full effect. Jassy also noted that the competitive nature of the marketplace, with millions of sellers, helps keep prices down as some will absorb costs to gain market share. This provides insight into how a major retailer is navigating the complex international trade environment.</p>

The new typical annual bill will be ¬£1,720, a drop of ¬£129. With future prices uncertain, the regulator is encouraging consumers to explore fixed-rate deals, which could offer more stability and potential savings compared to variable tariffs.
