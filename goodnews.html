          <p>Despite predictions of a slowing global economy in 2025, the aviation industry is projected to experience improved profitability. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts increases in revenue, operating profits, and net profits for the industry, driven by lower jet fuel costs and greater efficiency. Passenger load factors are expected to reach a record high of 84% due to ongoing supply chain challenges in the aerospace sector limiting fleet expansion. Jet fuel costs are projected to decrease from $99 per barrel in 2024 to $86 per barrel in 2025, resulting in a $25 billion reduction in the total fuel bill for airlines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after the companies announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The new entity will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies and is projected to hold A$13.1 billion in assets across real estate, private equity, and credit. The merger aims to simplify the structure, add scale, and create a more investable company, unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers. Brickworks shareholders are set to receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, a 10.1% premium over the stock's previous closing price. (not investment advice)</p>

The MLS Players Association expressed solidarity, stating that the league has refused to allocate a fair percentage of the large FIFA payments to the players. The current collective bargaining agreement stipulates that players can only earn 50% of bonuses from outside tournaments, capped at $1 million for the entire team. The players have sought to meet with MLS to make changes to the arrangement, but the league has not presented a reasonable proposal.</p>
