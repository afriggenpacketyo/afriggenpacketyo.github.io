        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American fund managers are actively lobbying Congress to amend Section 899 of the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," expressing concerns that this provision could trigger a rapid outflow of foreign investments from the U.S. The Investment Company Institute (ICI) warns that the bill, intended to penalize foreign-owned firms from countries with "unfair foreign taxes," inadvertently impacts most foreign investments in U.S. stock markets. The ICI suggests that foreign investors, seeking to avoid the tax, might quickly withdraw from U.S. equities, potentially depressing U.S. equity markets and harming both companies and investors. Foreign investors hold significant assets in U.S. markets, including stocks, government bonds, and credit, so this is something to keep an eye on. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts warn that the United States risks undermining its status as a global hub for talent due to increasing crackdowns on academia and restrictions on international students. The opinion piece highlights the significant contributions of immigrants to U.S. tech companies and the broader economy, noting that a large percentage of tech workers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born. Restricting international students could diminish the talent pool for U.S. graduate programs, particularly in STEM fields, as many STEM PhDs are conferred on international students. Some students are now considering academic opportunities abroad, which could lead to a brain drain from the U.S.</p>

Dobrindt said the government would allocate "substantial financial resources" to strengthen the defense mechanisms of Germany's security agencies.

          <p>Japan's government plans to release an additional 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers to address elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi expects the released rice to be sold at a lower price, aiming to alleviate public frustration over rising costs. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, prompting concerns about emergency preparedness.
