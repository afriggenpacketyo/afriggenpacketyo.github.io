          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report revealed strong sales growth, driven by its data center division and demand for GPUs in AI applications. However, U.S. export controls are hindering the company's potential in China, a $50 billion market, as restrictions on its H20 chip are causing developers to use homegrown alternatives like Huawei. Despite these challenges, cloud providers remain Nvidia's most important customers, accounting for half of its data center revenue. Looking ahead, Nvidia sees significant growth potential in AI inference, where its Blackwell chips can serve AI models to millions of customers by improving AI answers through reasoning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Karate Kid: Legends" struggles with an overabundance of characters, resulting in a disjointed narrative that fails to capitalize on its potential. The film attempts to blend elements from the original Karate Kid movies and the recent remake, but the two storylines clash, creating a frenetic and unsatisfying experience. Ben Wang's performance as the young martial artist is a highlight, but the movie ultimately relies too heavily on familiar tropes and sacrifices originality for the sake of including multiple "legends." The pacing is rushed, and the fight sequences are difficult to follow, diminishing the overall impact.</p>

Researchers hypothesize it could be a magnetar or a white dwarf in a binary system, but neither explanation fully accounts for the observed phenomena.
