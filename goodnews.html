The artifact was found in rubble near former infantry barracks and is believed to have been part of a larger ornamental arch built around 213 A.D. Experts suggest the stone would have originally been brightly painted, and its discovery highlights the grandeur and symbolic importance of Roman forts. The find is considered increasingly rare, and the piece is set to go on display at the Vindolanda museum next year.</p>

          <p>Tesla's electric vehicle sales in Australia rebounded in May, reaching their highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by record sales of the Model Y. The company reported a jump to 3,897 vehicle sales, a 9.3% increase year-over-year and a 675% surge from April. Despite this positive trend, Tesla's global sales have faced challenges due to increased competition and reputational damage linked to CEO Elon Musk. While Australia shows promise, analysts caution that this rebound may not indicate a broader global recovery for Tesla. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer Jessie J announced she has been diagnosed with early breast cancer and plans to undergo surgery after her performance at Capital's Summertime Ball. The 37-year-old shared the news on Instagram, noting she had been "in and out of tests" recently. She expressed optimism by focusing on the "early" stage of the diagnosis, and joked about it being a "dramatic way to get a boob job." She will be taking time off after the Summertime Ball to recover, and plans to return with new music. This decision to share her diagnosis publicly is to process it and to show solidarity with others facing similar challenges.</p>

          <p>The city center of Cologne, Germany, was largely evacuated as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs. Approximately 20,000 residents were ordered to leave the area, making it one of the largest defusal operations in the city's history. The evacuation included hotels, care homes, and the Deutz railway station. The operation is commonplace in Cologne, which was heavily bombed during World War II. Bomb defusals are nothing new in Cologne, as it was one of the major bombing targets for Allied forces during the Second World War.</p>

          <p>Fran Kirby, a significant player in England's women's football, has retired from her England career, and the timing is appropriate due to a series of injuries and illnesses that have affected her time. Despite Kirby's talent, she had to battle knee and ankle issues, a career-threatening pericarditis, and a knee injury that forced her to miss the 2023 World Cup. Kirby knew that the upcoming tournament in Switzerland would have been her last opportunity to play in another major tournament. Despite her retirement, Wiegman expressed gratitude for the time she got to work with Kirby.</p>
