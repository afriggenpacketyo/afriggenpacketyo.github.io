          <p>Ahead of Malawi's September elections, several presidential candidates have notably chosen women as their running mates, reflecting a push for greater gender inclusion in the nation's politics. This follows advocacy from civil organizations like the 50-50 Campaign, especially significant as women constitute over 57% of registered voters. However, some analysts express skepticism, noting that these women are in subordinate roles and often represent smaller parties, suggesting the move could be a strategic ploy rather than a fundamental shift. Voters appear more concerned with economic issues like food shortages and corruption than the gender of candidates alone.</p>

It contrasts national average yields with the significantly higher rates offered by online banks, which have lower overhead costs. The piece advises savers to consider short-term CDs, as an inverted yield curve currently makes their rates more competitive than long-term options. To maximize returns, it suggests strategies like shopping around at online banks and laddering CDs of varying terms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>WhatsApp has intensified its fight against fraud by removing over 6.8 million accounts linked to global scam networks in the first half of 2025. In response to increasingly sophisticated scams, the platform is introducing new safety tools, including a "group safety overview" for when a user is added to a group by an unknown contact. The app is also testing extra warnings for messages from unknown contacts to help users identify potential red flags. The article advises users to be cautious, verify identities, and utilize privacy settings to protect themselves from prevalent schemes.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a British meteorologist who vanished in Antarctica in 1959 at age 25, have been found and identified through DNA analysis. Bell fell into a crevasse while working for the British Antarctic Survey's predecessor and could not be recovered at the time. A Polish research team discovered his body and over 200 personal items near a receding glacier on King George Island. The discovery has brought closure to his family after 66 years and highlights a trend of such finds as global warming causes glaciers to melt.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market has seen a significant rally, with Bitcoin's price climbing to nearly $120,000, approaching its all-time high. Ether also experienced a surge, breaking the $4,000 resistance level and reaching its highest point since December 2021. This upward momentum is partly attributed to strong buying activity during Asian trading hours, potentially fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which enhances the appeal of hard assets. Consequently, stocks related to cryptocurrency, such as Coinbase and various mining companies, have also seen notable gains in value. (not investment advice)</p>

The article stresses that carrying a balance on these high-interest cards can easily negate the value of any rewards earned. It advises cardholders to choose between general travel cards and co-branded cards based on their specific travel habits and brand loyalty. For a card with a high fee to be worthwhile, users must ensure they are fully utilizing its perks, like free checked bags or travel credits.</p>

          <p>AOL has announced it will officially end its iconic dial-up internet service on September 30, bringing a definitive close to a defining technology of the 1990s. The company stated the decision was made after a routine evaluation of its products and services. While only a small number of households, approximately 163,000 as of 2023, still used the service, its distinctive connection sound and "You've Got Mail" greeting are remembered by millions. The move symbolizes the complete transition from the early days of the internet to modern broadband connectivity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is proposing a major overhaul of road safety laws, which could include mandatory eye tests for drivers over 70 when they renew their licenses. The potential changes, part of a new strategy to reduce road fatalities, also include lowering the drink-driving limit in England and Wales to match Scotland's stricter standard. This initiative follows a coroner's report that criticized the current self-reporting system for vision problems as the "laxest in Europe." While safety advocates support the measures, some older drivers have raised concerns about difficulties in securing timely medical appointments.</p>

          <p>Everton has reached an agreement with Manchester City for a season-long loan of winger Jack Grealish, who has struggled for playing time under manager Pep Guardiola. The 29-year-old, who joined City for a record £100 million in 2021, made only seven league starts last season. The move to Everton provides Grealish an opportunity to rejuvenate his career and secure regular first-team football ahead of a World Cup year. Although he would have preferred a Champions League club, the transfer allows him to take a central role at Everton's new stadium and aim for a return to the England squad.</p>

          <p>Ten years after China's surprise devaluation of the yuan sent shockwaves through global markets, its approach to managing its currency has become more sophisticated. Analysts note that Beijing now employs a diverse toolkit to handle exchange-rate volatility, reducing its reliance on depleting foreign reserves to defend the currency, a tactic used heavily after the 2015 reform. While the exchange rate is more market-based, it remains managed. The key challenge for the next decade will be to further internationalize the yuan and allow for greater market pricing without causing destabilizing swings in its value. (not investment advice)</p>

If you receive an unexpected payment from a stranger, you should not send the money back or engage with the sender, even if they become aggressive.
