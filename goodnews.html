          <p>David Sacks, a top crypto and AI advisor to President Trump, believes the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will pass with bipartisan support and could generate trillions in demand for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks stated that the existing $200 billion in stablecoins is currently unregulated, and providing a clear legal framework could rapidly increase demand for Treasuries. The GENIUS Act, designed to regulate stablecoins, has cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, indicating strong prospects for passage. This article suggests a potential boost for the U.S. economy through the regulation of digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While the Trump administration has welcomed Afrikaners as refugees, citing violence and discrimination in South Africa, some Afrikaners dispute claims of a "White genocide." Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp asserts that Whites are economically the strongest group in South Africa, holding a majority of boardroom positions and earning higher incomes than Black South Africans. Cattle farmer Nick Serfontein also dismisses the genocide claims, emphasizing that the land must be shared by both Black and White South Africans. This article highlights differing views within the Afrikaner community regarding their safety and treatment in South Africa.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, exceeding its previous record from January, driven by factors including softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. According to Coin Metrics, the price of Bitcoin was up 2% at $108,955.10, having earlier reached $109,857. Investors have been anticipating regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to propel prices higher, with public companies now holding $349 billion in Bitcoin. The Senate has also voted to advance legislation creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, adding to the positive momentum.</p>

          <p>Nike will resume selling its products directly on Amazon in the U.S. for the first time since 2019, a move driven by the need to distribute more directly to customers and have greater control over the shopping experience. The sneaker giant stopped selling its goods wholesale on Amazon six years ago due to rising concerns around counterfeit products. The new deal represents a win for Amazon, which has sought to attract more high-end brands to its platform, and a shift in strategy for Nike, which is investing in its marketplace to bring more products and services to consumers.</p>
