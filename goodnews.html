          <p>The veterinary profession is experiencing a shortage of professionals due to high turnover rates, rising student debt, and increased pet ownership during the pandemic. This shortage leads to overcrowded shelters, a rise in pet illnesses, and increased euthanasia rates. The high cost of veterinary education, with tuition at Western University costing around $67,000 per year, contributes to substantial student debt. Additionally, the field faces challenges related to veterinarian mental health, with studies showing a higher suicide rate among veterinarians compared to the general population. This article sheds light on the multifaceted issues impacting the veterinary industry.</p>

          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor, son of a former Pittsburgh mayor, won the Democratic primary for Pittsburgh mayor, signaling voter dissatisfaction with the city under its current progressive leader, Ed Gainey. O‚ÄôConnor will face Republican Tony Moreno in the general election, but Pittsburgh has not had a Republican mayor since 1932, making the Democratic primary tantamount to winning the election. Gainey's loss halted the momentum that progressives had enjoyed in this Democratic stronghold. O'Connor had positioned himself as a pragmatic candidate who would get the city working again.</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new test that dramatically reduces the time it takes to diagnose types of brain tumors, from weeks to just hours. The "ultra-rapid" method of genetic testing is described by surgeons as a "game changer" that could improve care and treatment for patients. The method has been used in 50 operations with a 100% success rate in diagnosing the exact type of tumor. Faster classification could allow patients to get radiation treatment or chemotherapy more quickly, reducing anxiety while waiting for results.</p>
