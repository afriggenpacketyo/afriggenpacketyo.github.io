        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of individuals, particularly from Gen Z, are using AI-powered dating assistants to improve their romantic prospects on apps like Hinge and Grindr. Services such as Rizz and Keepler offer users AI-generated conversation starters, replies, and even advice on how to handle being "ghosted." While proponents say these tools boost confidence and help break the ice, their rising popularity raises questions about authenticity in digital communication. Experts suggest the technology can be beneficial as a supplement, but not a substitute, for genuine human connection.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 08:30:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has announced that air travelers will no longer be required to remove their shoes during security screenings, ending a two-decade-old practice. The policy change is attributed to advancements in security technology, such as new CT scanners that provide more detailed 3D images of carry-on items. This move is framed as a sign of progress and a reflection of the receding threat of large-scale terror attacks, though concerns about domestic extremism and potential budget cuts remain. The original rule was implemented after the 2001 shoe-bomb attempt by Richard Reid.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 win against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick as the Lions ran in a total of eight tries in a dominant display in Adelaide. The victory provides a significant morale boost for the team, though concerns remain over a head injury to Garry Ringrose and a knee injury that saw Luke Cowan Dickie stretchered off. The comprehensive score reflects the Lions' sharp and ruthless performance on the field.</p>

          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering the authorization of new funding for Ukraine, a potential shift in his administration's stance on aid for the war-torn country. According to diplomatic sources, this move could be a strategic message to Russia following its recent escalation of drone and missile attacks. The administration has access to leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize foreign Russian assets to finance the aid. This consideration comes amid Trump's vocal criticism of past spending and his simultaneous pressure on European NATO allies to increase their financial support for Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>After experiencing chest pains, 13-year-old Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition that caused his heart to function at only 7%. The same condition was found in his mother, who had a heart transplant years prior. Following his own successful transplant, Micah and his mother launched Transplant Teenz, a virtual non-profit community to connect and support teenagers nationwide who are awaiting organ transplants. They created the group after realizing there were few resources available for adolescents facing similar life-threatening health crises and the stresses of the transplant process.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article in The Atlantic makes the case that modern society is depriving children of the benefits of free, unstructured physical play, likening it to the natural movement of wild animals. It argues that fears of injury and social norms promoting sedentary behavior are overriding the crucial need for movement, which is vital for physical health, cognitive skills, and mental well-being. Injury-prevention experts suggest that such play develops superior "movement quality," making children more resilient to injuries later in life. The piece encourages parents to allow for more playful risk-taking to foster robust development.</p>

          <p>Katie Gatti Tassin, author of "Rich Girl Nation," describes the significant and often overlooked financial burden of beauty standards on women, which she calls the "hot girl hamster wheel." She argues that recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare function as a depreciating asset, requiring continuous investment to maintain an "acceptable feminine appearance." Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their true impact and experimenting with cutting back. The money saved can then be redirected toward paying off debt, building savings, or investing for the future.</p>

          <p>A 26-year-old German backpacker, Carolina Wilga, has been rescued after surviving for 11 nights alone in the remote Western Australian outback. Police reported she became lost after her van got stuck in dense bushland, and she walked 24 kilometers in a disoriented state. She survived on minimal food supplies and by drinking water from puddles while taking shelter in a cave. Suffering from exhaustion, dehydration, and an injured foot, she was spotted by a passing driver and airlifted to a hospital in Perth in what authorities are calling a rescue based on "sheer luck."</p>

          <p>While many college students believe a finance degree offers the best career prospects, recent data suggests otherwise, showing lower unemployment rates for graduates in fields like art history and nutritional sciences. A survey by the CFA Institute found finance was perceived as the top major for job security, but New York Fed data indicates its unemployment rate is higher than that of philosophy or theology majors. This trend is partly fueled by the rise of AI, which has increased demand for creative thinking and soft skills, leading major firms like BlackRock to actively hire more humanities graduates.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, has sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, according to a recent SEC filing. This sale of 225,000 shares is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows him to sell up to six million shares by the end of the year. Huang's net worth has surged to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Warren Buffett, as Nvidia's market capitalization recently surpassed $4 trillion. The sale comes as the chipmaker continues to dominate the market for AI-powering graphics processing units. (not investment advice)</p>

Recent discoveries with the James Webb Space Telescope have supported theories that supermassive black holes in the early universe formed from collapsing gas clouds, not just dying stars. The article clarifies that black holes don't indiscriminately suck in everything and that our own sun is not massive enough to become one, while also touching on remaining mysteries like unexplained "little red dots" in the cosmos.</p>
