          <p>President Trump stated that U.S. Steel will remain under American control despite a planned partnership with Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. He emphasized that the deal is an investment and partial ownership, but control will stay in the U.S.A. Trump mentioned the partnership would create at least 70,000 jobs and deliver a $14 billion boost to the economy, with most of Nippon Steel's investment occurring over the next 14 months. The president's approval followed a review by federal agencies, though specific details of the acquisition scheme were not disclosed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump delayed the threatened 50% tariffs on all European Union imports into the US until July 9, following a "very nice call" with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen. Von der Leyen announced the tariff delay, stating it would allow more time for negotiations, and affirmed Europe's readiness to move ahead with trade talks swiftly. This decision marks a reversal from Trump's earlier warning that he would impose the tariffs on June 1 because discussions with the EU were "going nowhere." The article provides an overview of the key developments in the ongoing trade discussions between the US and the EU.</p>

The rise in detections is attributed to increased submissions and more aggressive policies against incentivized reviews, where companies offer rewards for reviews. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and moderate fake submissions.
