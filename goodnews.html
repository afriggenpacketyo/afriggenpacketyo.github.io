          <p>Jeopardy! host Ken Jennings shares his skepticism about current artificial intelligence, despite having competed against IBM's Watson computer in 2011. He admits that modern AI could easily beat Watson at Jeopardy!, noting how advanced the technology has become. Jennings emphasizes his preference for creative work that comes from a human mind, rather than AI. He acknowledges the fear of AI replacing creatives in Hollywood, which was a key issue during the writers' and actors' strikes. Musician will.i.am believes true artists have nothing to fear from AI, but those who chase algorithms might be replaced.</p>

          <p>Reform UK secured a narrow victory in the Runcorn and Helsby by-election, defeating Labour by just six votes after a recount. This marks Reform's first parliamentary by-election win. Sarah Pochin, the Reform candidate, overturned a significant Labour majority to take the seat, which became available after the previous Labour MP was convicted of assault. In addition to the by-election win, Reform also gained its first mayoralty in Greater Lincolnshire. Labour requested a recount due to the close initial tally. Nigel Farage, present at the count, stated that the result positions Reform as the main opposition to the Labour government.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform U.K. party achieved a significant victory in a parliamentary special election in Runcorn and Helsby, narrowly defeating the Labour Party. Sarah Pochin, the Reform candidate, won by six votes, marking a historic moment for the anti-immigration party. The victory suggests a potential shift towards a more polarized, multiparty system in British politics. While Labour retained some mayoralties, Reform performed strongly, indicating growing support. The election results reflect voter frustration with the economy and immigration concerns, potentially reshaping the political landscape.</p>

          <p>Roche has entered a $5.3 billion deal with Zealand Pharma to co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide, a novel amylin analog for weight loss, signaling Roche's intent to compete with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly in the obesity drug market. Amylin analogs mimic a hormone that increases satiety, differing from GLP-1 drugs that suppress appetite. Early clinical data suggests amylin analogs may offer comparable weight reduction with better tolerability and lean muscle preservation. The partnership will explore petrelintide as a standalone treatment and in combination with Roche's incretin asset, CT-388, with Zealand receiving upfront payments and potential milestone payments. The deal is viewed as a win-win, leveraging Zealand's expertise and Roche's commercial capabilities.</p>

          <p>Liverpool fans celebrating their club's title-clinching victory over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield caused seismic activity, according to university scientists. The most significant tremor, measuring 1.74 on the Richter scale, was triggered by Alexis Mac Allister's goal, which put Liverpool ahead. The data was recorded by University of Liverpool earth scientists using equipment used to detect earthquakes. The study revealed that the 60,415-strong crowd generated real seismic activity, particularly in response to goals scored during the game. Researchers hope the experiment will inspire a new generation of seismologists and innovative ideas for enhancing the stadium experience.</p>

The program's administrator, Dr. John Howard, was allegedly reinstated after public backlash, but questions lingered about his full authority. The restoration of certification means the program can once again review and approve claims from responders and survivors who have developed new conditions. Clinics can now resume treatment for patients whose care had been postponed. Media coverage and bipartisan pressure are credited for the reversal.</p>

          <p>Researchers have created the first laboratory analog of the 'black hole bomb,' a theoretical concept proposed by Roger Penrose in 1971. The experiment consists of a rotating aluminum cylinder placed inside layers of coils that generate magnetic fields, simulating the ergosphere of a black hole. The experiment demonstrated a clear amplification effect, based on the theories described decades ago. Because black holes cannot be probed directly, analogs such as this are an excellent way to understand their properties. The experiment could represent a significant step towards better understanding the physics of the most gravitationally extreme objects in the Universe.</p>
