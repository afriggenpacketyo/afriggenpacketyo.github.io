          <p>CureIS Healthcare, a managed care services company, has initiated a civil lawsuit against Epic Systems, a major electronic health record (EHR) provider, alleging a scheme to undermine CureIS's business.

          <p>A new book alleges that former President Joe Biden's aides covered up his 'physical deterioration' during his re-election campaign, even discussing the possibility of using a wheelchair. Biden's spokesperson has dismissed the claims, asserting that 'evidence of aging is not evidence of mental incapacity'. The book cites anonymous sources and claims Biden's condition was so poor that aides sought to limit his walking distances and ensure he used handrails. Biden abruptly ended his re-election campaign after a poor debate performance against Donald Trump, with some party insiders blaming him for exiting too late.</p>

Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. Hall of Fame Chairman Jane Forbes Clark stated that those affected by Manfred's ruling will be considered for Hall of Fame candidacy.</p>
