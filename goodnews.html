          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer urged investors to separate their personal politics from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He posits that despite personal reservations one might have about the president, the market has shown resilience, driven by individual investor confidence and pro-business policies. Cramer suggests that factors like deregulation, a favorable environment for mergers, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence are creating bullish conditions. He argues these economic forces may outweigh the inflationary risks of tariffs, creating opportunities for investors regardless of their political leanings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber released a surprise album titled "Swag," which critics describe as a raw, improvisatory, and deeply personal R&B project. The album moves away from polished pop, featuring murky production and even demo-like voice memos, reflecting a period of personal tumult for the artist. The article suggests this unpolished approach aligns with the modern pop trend of showcasing vulnerability and idiosyncratic impulses, similar to artists like SZA and Mk.gee. While some lyrical moments are noted as awkward, the album is largely praised for its beautiful, instinctual, and authentic sound.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has announced plans to significantly increase France's defense spending, citing unprecedented threats to freedom and peace in Europe. The annual defense budget is now set to reach €64 billion by 2027, a goal previously slated for 2030 and double the amount from when he first took office. In his traditional Bastille Day speech to the military, Macron pointed to Russia's war in Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and "uncertainty" from the United States as key dangers.

          <p>A woman in Denver has repurposed a 1940s fortune cookie factory into a free public art gallery named the Cookie Factory. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the derelict building nearly a decade ago and spent eight years renovating it into a space for community gathering and connection.

          <p>Following the deadly floods in Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell has stated that improving the nation's weather warning systems is a "national responsibility." The Washington Democrat, who chairs the committee overseeing NOAA, plans to send bipartisan recommendations to the president for upgrading forecasting infrastructure. She argues that a one-time investment in better technology, such as Doppler radar and data analytics, could provide earlier and more accurate warnings for floods, tornadoes, and fires. Cantwell emphasized that such federal investment is crucial to prevent future tragedies like the one that occurred in Kerr County.</p>
