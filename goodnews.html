          <p>Dr. Awais Aftab, a psychiatrist, acknowledges the transformative benefits of antidepressants for some patients, while also highlighting the less discussed challenges, such as sexual side effects and severe withdrawal symptoms. He points out the lack of high-quality research on safely tapering patients off antidepressants, despite millions taking them long-term. The article underscores the need for more research into the long-term effects and safe withdrawal strategies for these medications, advocating for a balanced perspective that acknowledges both the benefits and potential harms. It cautions against ceding the conversation to those who exploit patient suffering for political gain, urging the medical establishment to engage with patient concerns with scientific transparency.</p>

          <p>Voice of America (VOA) may resume broadcasting as early as next week, following a media watchdog's report that the Department of Justice indicated a phased return to work for VOA staff. This development follows an executive order by former President Trump that effectively gutted the network, prompting legal challenges from organizations like Reporters Without Borders. A federal appeals court upheld a temporary stay on the order, mandating the restoration of employees' accounts, and the DOJ email suggests that over 1,400 employees' accounts have been reactivated, signaling a potential return to normal programming for VOA.</p>

Albanese accused Dutton's party of emulating American-style politics, while emphasizing his government's improved relations with China and the removal of trade barriers.

          <p>Capital One's acquisition of Discover Financial could yield even greater benefits than initially anticipated if the company successfully expands Discover's payment network internationally. The acquisition allows Capital One to become both a credit card issuer and a payment network operator, similar to American Express. While Capital One plans to shift more of its Capital One-branded credit cards away from Mastercard and Visa, a key to achieving these benefits is moving payment volume onto the Discover network that previously ran on Visa and Mastercard, saving on some fees previously paid to those rivals to facilitate the transactions. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized that building international acceptance of the Discover network would create a "flywheel effect" for the combined business.</p>
