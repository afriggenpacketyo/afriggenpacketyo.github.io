          <p>Michelle Beadle has expressed being blindsided by the news that Stephen A. Smith's new programs will be taking over her time slot on SiriusXM Mad Dog Sports Radio. She admitted it was "a little embarrassing" to learn her show "Beadle and Decker" won't be airing at the same time. Beadle found out about the changes through The Hollywood Reporter's details on Smith joining SiriusXM. Smith's multi-year deal with SiriusXM is set to start September 2, featuring takes on sports topics and weekly current events.</p>

          <p>Palisades Charter High School held its graduation ceremony at the Hollywood Bowl after a fire damaged their high school campus earlier in the year. The event, relocated from their usual Stadium by the Sea, was described as bittersweet by students who missed their familiar venue. Speakers like Steve Kerr and Billy Crystal addressed the graduates, emphasizing resilience and growth in the face of adversity. The school secured the Hollywood Bowl through a donation from the Los Angeles Philharmonic, making the event possible despite the challenges.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found trapped in Burmese amber sheds new light on the evolution of flight feathers, an essential step that allowed early birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers were able to gain insight into how feathers evolved during this era through a detailed structural study of feathers dating back 99 million years to the Cretaceous period. An essential feature of the evolution of birds was the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria to colonize a newborn's body can significantly reduce the risk of lung infections. A study found that infants with Bifidobacterium longum in their gut microbiome were half as likely to be hospitalized with lung infections in their first two years. Researchers believe these bacteria interact with the immune system, aiding in its development and ability to distinguish between harmful and harmless microbes. The protective bacteria were more commonly found in babies born via vaginal delivery.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting restart efforts on its onshore pipeline system near Santa Barbara due to environmental concerns. The ruling delays the reactivation of the Santa Ynez Unit, which was shut down after a major oil spill in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. Sable is now targeting August 1, 2025, for first sales due to this delay.</p>

          <p>Drug safety experts are advising women using weight-loss injections like Wegovy and Mounjaro to stop if they are trying to conceive, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. There are concerns that these medications could harm an unborn baby, although the exact effects are not yet known. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises women to use contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward. There are also concerns that the weight-loss injections may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.</p>

The measures, which will be included in the annual basic policy on economic and fiscal management, are expected to clarify that the government will "review insurance coverage for foreigners."
