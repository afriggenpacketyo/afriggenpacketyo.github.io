        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Vox article delves into the complexities of animal instincts, challenging the notion that they are simply inborn, unlearned behaviors. Featuring an interview with neuroscientist Mark Blumberg, the article explores how behaviors typical to a species are shaped by a combination of genetic predispositions, environmental experiences, and explicit learning. Blumberg argues against the term 'instinct,' advocating instead for 'species-typical' behavior. The article uses the example of a tailorbird sewing leaves together to illustrate how behaviors are not solely rooted in the mind but are influenced by the system in which the animal operates.</p>

          <p>NPR reports that the acting administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Cameron Hamilton, has been replaced, amid turmoil following President Trump's repeated statements about eliminating the agency. Hamilton testified at a Congressional hearing that FEMA needs efficiency and reform but should not be eliminated. The move comes as FEMA enters its most demanding time of year, with the Atlantic hurricane season approaching. Trump is seeking to shrink FEMA's role by shifting disaster response responsibility to the states.</p>

          <p>CNBC reports that the U.K. and U.S. agreed to a trade deal with tariffs still in place, suggesting that Trump's 10% baseline tariff is likely to remain for other trading partners. Under the deal, the U.K. can export 100,000 vehicles annually at a 10% rate, with higher duties for additional vehicles. However, steel and aluminum exports are tariff-free. Analysts interpret this to mean that a 10% baseline tariff will remain with limited exceptions, indicating a potential template for future trade deals.</p>
