          <h2>NHS to Offer Free Chickenpox Vaccine to Young Children in England and Wales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 03:30:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Starting next January, the NHS in England and Wales will introduce a free chickenpox vaccine for all young children, given in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to safeguard youngsters from severe, albeit rare, complications of the varicella virus, and alleviate the financial burden on parents taking time off work. The Department of Health and Social Care estimates chickenpox causes £24 million in lost income and productivity annually in the UK. Health minister Stephen Kinnock highlighted the importance of protecting children's health and supporting working families. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) recommended the vaccine's introduction in November 2023, with experts predicting a dramatic reduction in overall chickenpox cases. This brings the UK in line with other countries like the US, which introduced the jab decades ago.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley experienced a learning curve during his US Open second-round loss to Alexander Zverev, including navigating Zverev's deliberate tardiness before their match. Fearnley, still early in his professional career, competed hard but was ultimately outplayed by Zverev's consistency, acknowledging his own struggles with capitalising on opportunities and hitting 12 double faults. He noted that top players often employ such mind games, a lesson he previously encountered with Novak Djokovic. Despite the defeat, Fearnley expressed optimism about his development, particularly his serve, believing he will overcome these challenges with continued experience in high-pressure environments.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly on the verge of securing RB Leipzig attacker Xavi Simons for 60 million euros (£51.8 million). The 22-year-old Netherlands international has already completed his medical in England, with an agreement in principle between the clubs expected to be finalized within the next 24 hours. This move follows Chelsea's earlier interest in Simons, though they are now pursuing a £40 million deal for Manchester United's Alejandro Garnacho. Simons is poised to become one of Tottenham's significant summer signings, joining Joao Palhinha and Mohammed Kudus, after the club's previous attempts to sign other attacking midfielders did not materialize.</p>

          <p>YouTube and Fox have successfully concluded a new distribution agreement, ensuring that Fox News, Fox Sports, and other Fox channels will continue to be available on YouTube TV. This deal resolves a standoff that had previously led to a short-term extension and warnings of a potential blackout, which could have impacted highly anticipated college football and NFL games. YouTube, owned by Alphabet, had stated that Fox was demanding significantly higher payments compared to other content providers. Although the financial terms were not disclosed, the Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr welcomed the agreement, highlighting its importance for sports fans. YouTube TV currently boasts approximately 9.4 million subscribers, making it a major player in media distribution.</p>

          <p>A delegation of senior US Senators, led by Republican Roger Wicker, has arrived in Taiwan to "re-emphasize the partnership and the security, friendship agreement" between the two nations. The visit occurs as both Taiwan and China seek trade deals with the US, and days before Beijing's major military parade. Senator Wicker pledged that the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act would strengthen provisions for Taiwan, whose government has already increased defense spending. The trip underscores US support for Taiwan, despite Beijing's objections and concerns in Taipei over potential shifts in US policy under a Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has formally requested to leave Old Trafford on a loan spell, a proposal that the club has firmly rejected. United officials have communicated to the 20-year-old England international that he is highly valued and expected to stay and contend for a position within the squad, specifically noting his competition with captain Bruno Fernandes. Mainoo, who recently played a full 90 minutes in an EFL Cup match but was an unused substitute in the opening Premier League games, has a contract until 2027, though negotiations for an extension have reportedly stalled. While he does not seek a permanent departure, his concern lies with the amount of Premier League game time he will receive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have successfully unveiled and tested a novel vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone, whose distinctive form bears a striking resemblance to the enigmatic "Gimbal" UFO previously spotted by US Navy pilots in 2015. This experimental aircraft marks a radical departure in aerodynamic design, centered around an elliptical, ring-like wing that integrates a straight central section, forming a closed-loop structure. Four rotors are strategically mounted at the junctions of these wings and vertical stabilisers, serving both as lift generators and structural reinforcements. While still in an experimental stage, this development promises to significantly enhance endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility in uncrewed flight, pushing the boundaries of advanced aerospace technology.</p>

          <p>DJ Admin, Rick Jansen, is the man responsible for entertaining Max Verstappen's "Orange Army" at the Dutch Grand Prix in Zandvoort, a role he cherishes despite the event's impending departure from the F1 calendar after 2026. Jansen describes Verstappen as an icon, treated like a god by his devoted fanbase, which creates a unique festival atmosphere at his dedicated grandstands. Having witnessed the sport's transformation under Liberty Media, Jansen's high-energy sets have become a fixture, even catching the attention of drivers like Charles Leclerc. However, rising ticket prices and repetitive grandstand locations are causing a slight decrease in fan attendance.</p>

          <p>Tencent Holdings is pursuing "aggressive" growth in the international cloud computing market, fueled by increasing overseas demand for Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) models. Senior executive vice-president Dowson Tong Tao-sang, CEO of Tencent's Cloud and Smart Industries Group (CSIG), noted that overseas cloud operations have been the company's fastest-expanding segment, achieving high double-digit growth. Tong emphasized significant opportunities to provide Chinese open-source AI models to international clients, particularly as markets seek to host large language models within their own regions. This strategic focus reflects Tencent's efforts to keep pace with rapid AI developments and intensify competition among tech giants.</p>

          <p>World No. 3 Coco Gauff battled through tears and persistent serving problems to secure a 7-6 (5), 6-2 victory over Donna Vekić, advancing to the US Open third round. Gauff's seven double faults in the first set led to an emotional breakdown on court, highlighting the psychological toll of retooling her serve during a major tournament. Despite the challenge, she regrouped, splashing water on her face and practicing serves during a medical timeout. Gauff drew strength from seeing Simone Biles in the crowd, viewing the ordeal as a shaping experience that will make her tougher for future challenges.</p>
