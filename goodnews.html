          <p>North Korea has successfully raised a capsized 5,000-ton naval destroyer, which had been damaged during a failed missile launch in May, according to state media. Leader Kim Jong Un has set a deadline for the ship's repairs to be completed this month, viewing it as a crucial asset. An investigation into the failed launch led to the arrest of four officials, with Kim Jong Un denouncing the incident as a "criminal act." The ship is North Korea's second known destroyer and is reportedly capable of carrying various weapons, including nuclear missiles, potentially developed with Russian assistance. The article indicates a focus on repairing and maintaining military capabilities in North Korea. The successful raising of the ship suggests a determination to overcome setbacks and continue military development.</p>

          <p>A U.S. judge has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a ban that would prevent Harvard University from accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were enforced. The order comes in response to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Donald Trump of waging a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security reasons and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.</p>

          <p>The Labour government is promising to introduce rules which would mandate developers to add solar panels to all new builds. Builders will be required to fit solar panels to the "vast majority" of new build homes in England under changes to be published this year, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has said. The Home Builders Federation said it backed fitting more panels but cautioned against introducing "burdensome" paperwork which it said could harm government efforts to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029.
