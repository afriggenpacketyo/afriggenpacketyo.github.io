          <p>Caesar Sengupta, CEO of the $92 million-funded startup Arta Finance, advises aspiring entrepreneurs that their greatest "superpower" is the ability to ground themselves amidst the chaos of building a company. Having spent 15 years at Google, Sengupta emphasizes that filtering out noise and managing the volatility of startup life is crucial for success and mental well-being. He personally advocates for simple strategies like daily meditation and using exercise as a form of mental escape to maintain focus and resilience in the demanding entrepreneurial journey.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the upper Yangtze. This action aims to restore the natural habitat for numerous rare and endemic fish species that have been severely impacted by decades of river fragmentation. The dams had blocked migratory routes, reduced water flow, and degraded spawning grounds, leading to a drastic decline in biodiversity. The project is considered a critical step toward reviving the ecological health of the region.</p>

          <p>Police in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player on social media. The player, widely reported to be former NBA star Montrezl Harrell of the Adelaide 36ers, received the abusive messages following a game in November 2024. Basketball Australia hailed the arrest as a "landmark moment" in the fight against online abuse in sports, emphasizing a zero-tolerance policy.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping to focus on strengthening business and trade ties between the two nations. The trip, which includes stops in Beijing and Shanghai, aims to build on recent progress in removing Chinese trade barriers that had cost Australian exporters billions. While seeking to enhance cooperation, particularly in areas like green energy, Albanese also emphasized his government's strategy of diversifying trade relationships with other regional partners. The visit marks a continued effort to stabilize diplomatic and economic relations.</p>

          <p>Sales of electric heavy trucks in China are surging, significantly impacting the country's diesel consumption and overall oil demand. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, new energy truck sales are estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year, capturing a quarter of the market. This rapid adoption, primarily for short-haul industrial use, has led analysts to revise diesel demand forecasts downward and accelerate predictions for when China's oil consumption will peak. The trend marks a major shift in China's transport sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling that would block the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate stops and arrests of individuals as part of its mass deportation plan. The lawsuit, filed by the ACLU and other rights groups, argues that federal agents have been unlawfully targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause. During the hearing, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong questioned the government's lack of specific evidence justifying the arrests. A final order could significantly impact federal immigration enforcement tactics in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has temporarily blocked President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children of undocumented immigrants and foreign visitors. The ruling came in response to a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, which argues the order violates the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. This decision was made in accordance with new Supreme Court standards on universal injunctions, allowing the legal challenge to proceed.

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole after 46 years in prison. The California Board of Parole Hearings ruled that the 74-year-old, who now goes by Anthony D’Amato, will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Bianchi and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., were responsible for the murders of 12 women in the 1970s, often impersonating police officers to lure their victims. Buono died in prison in 2002, while Bianchi is serving his sentence in Washington state.</p>

The hockey-puck-shaped vertebra, believed to be from a plant-eating dinosaur from 67.5 million years ago, was found in a core sample drilled over 750 feet deep during a geothermal energy study. Museum officials described the find as incredibly unlikely, comparing it to a "hole in one from the moon." While not a large specimen, the fossil is now on display, marking Denver's deepest and oldest dinosaur discovery to date.</p>

After analyzing 20,000 campaign messages, he argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, together—serve as powerful "emotional shortcuts" that resonate across cultures. While not a guarantee of victory, these words act as building blocks for messages that connect with voters' core emotions. The analysis suggests that these eight words offer timeless appeal in political communication.</p>
