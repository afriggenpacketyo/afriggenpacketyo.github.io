Karki, 73, becomes the first woman to lead the nation, tasked with organizing general elections within six months. The unrest, which saw over 50 people killed, was initially sparked by a social media ban but quickly escalated into a mass movement against the political establishment, culminating in protesters setting fire to parliament.</p>

          <p>Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, co-founders of the cryptocurrency company Gemini, have predicted that Bitcoin's value could surge to $1 million per coin over the next decade. They base this optimistic forecast on the belief that Bitcoin will disrupt gold's status as a primary store of value, referring to the cryptocurrency as "gold 2.0." The twins made the statement ahead of their company's successful initial public offering, asserting that despite its massive gains, the crypto market is still in its very early stages of growth.

The European Commission accepted the company's legally binding commitments, which will be in place for at least seven years, resolving a probe that began after a complaint from rival Slack. Under the deal, Microsoft will offer versions of its software without Teams at a reduced price and improve interoperability with competing products.</p>

          <p>Nearly five decades after his death in police custody, South Africa's National Prosecuting Authority will reopen a formal inquest into the death of anti-apartheid leader Steve Biko. Biko, who founded the Black Consciousness Movement, died in 1977 from a brain hemorrhage, which his family maintains was the result of torture by police, contrary to official claims of a hunger strike. The landmark decision to re-examine the case comes after years of frustration from Biko's family and others, as no one has ever been held accountable for his death.</p>

          <p>Amid rising inflation and fixed incomes, many retirees are exploring ways to access their substantial home equity without taking on new monthly debt. Options such as reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62 and older to borrow against their home's value, with the loan repaid only when the home is sold or the owner passes away. Another increasingly popular method is a home equity sharing agreement, where a company provides upfront cash in exchange for a share of the home's future appreciation, also without monthly payments.

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer is purchasing additional shares of Boeing, taking advantage of a price dip caused by news of a certification delay for its 777X aircraft. The club's rationale is that such delays are not uncommon in the aerospace industry and represent a buying opportunity, as the issue is unlikely to affect the company's long-term cash flow or fundamentals. This move reflects a strategy of building a position in a new holding by buying into what is perceived as short-term market weakness. (not investment advice)</p>
