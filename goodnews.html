        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores new warnings from longevity specialists regarding the potential health risks of overemphasizing animal-based protein in one's diet. While acknowledging that protein is crucial, particularly for older adults, experts point to research linking excessive consumption of animal products to harmful compounds that can accelerate aging and increase cardiovascular disease risk. The consensus among the featured doctors is to shift dietary focus towards plant-based proteins, such as beans and nuts, as well as fish to promote better long-term health and longevity.</p>

          <p>In a meeting at the White House, Apple committed to increasing its investment in U.S. manufacturing by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total domestic pledge to $600 billion. The announcement is widely seen as an effort by the tech giant to avoid President Trump's threatened tariffs on its products, which are largely assembled overseas. The investment aims to expand Apple's U.S. supply chain and directly hire 20,000 American workers, though final iPhone assembly is expected to remain abroad for the time being.

          <p>To improve public safety, the UK government has announced plans to implement a significant regulatory crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetics industry. The new proposals would restrict high-risk procedures, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), to qualified health professionals only. Additionally, clinics offering popular treatments like Botox and dermal fillers will be required to obtain a license by meeting strict standards for safety, training, and insurance. This move follows growing concerns over rogue practitioners and aims to protect consumers from harm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service (Ucas) is predicting that a record number of 18-year-old students will be accepted into their first-choice university this year, even if their grades are slightly below the requirements. This favorable outlook for students is attributed to increased uncertainty around international student enrollment, which is making UK undergraduates a more stable and desirable cohort for universities' financial planning. As a result, universities are expected to be more competitive and flexible in their offers to domestic applicants.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani provided a remarkable two-way performance, hitting his first home run in ten games and delivering his best pitching outing as a Dodger with eight strikeouts in four innings. Despite his individual excellence, the effort was not enough, as the team's bullpen struggled in a 5-3 loss to the St. Louis Cardinals. The article reflects on the immense challenge of balancing elite-level hitting and pitching, a feat not consistently attempted in Major League Baseball since Babe Ruth over a century ago, and Ohtani's ongoing adjustment to the demanding routine.</p>

          <p>Financial markets widely anticipate that the Bank of England will cut its key interest rate to 4% from 4.25%, which would mark its lowest level in over two years. This would be the fifth rate cut since last August, a move that could lower monthly costs for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages but would also result in smaller returns for savers. The expected cut comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation and a cooling labor market, despite inflation remaining above the Bank's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the long-held belief that Pompeii was completely abandoned after the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79, new archaeological evidence suggests survivors returned to live among the ruins. Researchers have found traces of a precarious settlement, which they describe as a "favela among the ruins," that existed at the site until the 5th century. This discovery indicates that some people, likely those unable to afford a new life elsewhere, reoccupied the city, living in the upper floors of buried structures and salvaging materials from the devastation.</p>
