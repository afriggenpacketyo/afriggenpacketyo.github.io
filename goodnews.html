          <p>DNC Chair Ken Martin expressed frustration with the Democratic Party, urging a more aggressive stance against President Trump, whom he labeled a "dictator-in-chief." Speaking at the DNC's summer meeting, Martin criticized Democrats for focusing on winning arguments rather than elections, advocating for a stronger fight against Trump's policies. Other Democrats echoed this sentiment, highlighting efforts to resist the administration's agenda and mobilize supporters. The article suggests a shift towards a more provocative and combative strategy within the party.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently at 6.58% for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, are expected to see a negligible drop in September, even if the Federal Reserve cuts the federal funds rate. Experts anticipate more significant decreases towards the end of 2025, possibly nearing 6%, influenced by the bond market and broader economic slowdown. While lower rates could attract more homebuyers, increased demand might also push home prices up, creating a double-edged sword for prospective buyers.

          <h2>New Tax Deductions Under Trump's Bill Expand 0% Capital Gains Eligibility for 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 11:26:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's "big beautiful bill" did not alter capital gains rates but introduced new deductions for 2025, potentially expanding eligibility for the 0% capital gains bracket. A temporary $6,000 tax break ($12,000 for married couples) for Americans aged 65 and over, in addition to standard deductions, can significantly reduce taxable income. This creates a "golden opportunity" for many investors to sell assets without incurring capital gains taxes. Financial planners note that many clients are unaware of this benefit, which could be a "game changer" for qualified individuals (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on Optimal AC Usage for Energy Efficiency When Away From Home</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 11:23:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts generally agree that adjusting your thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit (4-6 degrees Celsius) while away for several hours is the most energy-efficient and cost-saving approach for air conditioning. While turning the AC off completely can save money, it risks mold growth in humid climates and increased wear on the unit when restarting. Factors like climate, home insulation, and AC unit type influence optimal usage. Simple strategies like blocking sunlight and using ceiling fans can also significantly contribute to keeping homes cool and reducing energy consumption.</p>

The article explains the PSL's history, its rise as Starbucks' top-selling seasonal beverage, and its role in the "seasonal creep" phenomenon. Despite criticisms, the PSL's success led to a surge in pumpkin spice-flavored products. However, the author suggests that public fatigue with "pumpkin spice hot takes" indicates a potential return to the drink simply being an autumnal treat.</p>
