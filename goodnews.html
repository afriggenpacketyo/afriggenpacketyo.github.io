        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Jolly, a former Republican congressman and vocal critic of Donald Trump, has announced his candidacy for governor of Florida as a Democrat. Jolly, who represented the Tampa Bay area in Congress, left the Republican Party in 2018 and believes issues like affordability, public school funding, and campaign finance reform will resonate with voters. His shift to the Democratic Party is described as a formality, aligning with his long-held values of government assistance, economic fairness, and celebrating immigrants. Jolly's run draws comparisons to Charlie Crist, another former Republican congressman who unsuccessfully ran for governor as a Democrat, and he will face competition from Trump-backed Byron Donalds, among others, in the upcoming election.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has issued a warning to women using weight-loss injections, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro, about potential risks to unborn babies and reduced effectiveness of the contraceptive pill. The MHRA advises women to use effective contraception while taking these medicines and for a period after stopping, ranging from one to two months depending on the specific drug. The agency also highlights concerns about the growing popularity of these 'skinny jabs' and the potential for unsafe usage without proper medical advice. The MHRA has received around 40 reports relating to pregnancies, including unintended pregnancies, in women using these medications and advises women to discuss the risks and benefits with their prescribers.</p>

          <p>China has granted approval for the mass production of its first domestically developed 1,000-kilowatt helicopter engine, the AES100, marking a significant milestone for the country's aviation ambitions. The move comes shortly after the US announced new export restrictions targeting China, including curbs on jet engine-related technologies. While the AES100 turboshaft engine differs from the jet engines used in commercial aircraft, Chinese experts said its development represents a major step forward for the country's aviation sector. Li Gaiqi, chief designer of the AES100, stated that the license reflects China's ability to independently develop and manufacture advanced civil turboshaft engines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that leprosy existed in the Americas long before the arrival of European explorers, challenging the previously held belief that the disease was solely introduced by settlers. Researchers from the Institut Pasteur in Paris discovered that a second species of bacteria, Mycobacterium lepromatosis, was responsible for leprosy in the Americas, existing and infecting humans for 1,000 years prior to European contact. The study, which involved analyzing over 800 DNA samples from ancient human remains and recent medical cases, found that Mycobacterium lepromatosis had spread rapidly throughout North and South America. This discovery transforms our understanding of the history of leprosy in the Americas.</p>

          <p>With an above-normal hurricane season forecasted, experts are advising homeowners to review their insurance policies to ensure adequate coverage. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration predicts an active season with 13 to 19 named storms. Experts recommend checking policy limits to cover rebuilding costs, assessing deductibles, and determining the need for flood insurance, as standard policies typically do not cover flood damage. Acting now is crucial, as insurers often suspend policy changes when a storm approaches, ensuring homeowners have the right coverage before an urgent need arises.</p>

Despite some initial setbacks, such as pre-order cancellations by one supplier and temporary suspensions in the US due to tariff concerns, the launch has been met with considerable excitement. UK retailer Currys reported its "biggest gaming pre-order ever," selling 30,000 units. While questions remain about whether the Switch 2 will match the success of its predecessor due to higher game prices, many fans are excited about the new console and the release of Mario Kart World.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand Parliament has imposed record suspensions on three lawmakers from the Te Pati Maori party for performing a haka, a traditional Maori dance, during a debate on Indigenous rights. Debbie Ngarewa-Packer and Rawiri Waititi were suspended for 21 days, while Hana-Rawhiti Maipi-Clarke received a seven-day suspension. The incident occurred last November during the reading of a controversial bill that would have rewritten a treaty between the British crown and Indigenous Maori leaders.

This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, and the government has set aside ¬£1 billion to fund the initiative up to 2029. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson stated that the changes would save parents ¬£500 a year and lift 100,000 children out of poverty. The Institute for Fiscal Studies noted that while the rule change would reduce child poverty to some degree, other measures like lifting the two-child limit would be more effective.</p>

          <h2>UK Inflation Overstated Due to Car Tax Calculation Error</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) has announced that the April inflation rate was overstated by 0.1 percentage points due to a car tax data calculation error. The ONS initially reported the annual rate at 3.5%, but revised data shows the Consumer Price Index rose by 3.4% in the 12 months to April. The error stemmed from incorrect Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) data provided by the Department for Transport, which overstated the number of vehicles subject to VED rates in the first year of registration. The ONS has apologized for the error and will use correctly weighted data from May onward.</p>

          <h2>England Announces Squad for First Test Against India</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England has recalled Jacob Bethell for the first Test against India and named Jamie Overton in the squad to address a lengthy pace-bowling injury list. Bethell, who missed the victory over Zimbabwe due to IPL commitments, returns to the squad but may not make the final XI. Fast bowler Gus Atkinson is likely to be absent for the first two Tests due to a hamstring injury, joining Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Olly Stone on the sidelines. Chris Woakes and Brydon Carse are back, while Josh Tongue and Sam Cook are also included in the group of seamers for the series opener.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban includes exceptions for World Cup athletes, dual citizens, and individuals with existing visas. This allows these groups to enter the U.S. despite the broader restrictions imposed by the ban. The exceptions highlight the complexities of implementing such policies and the need to balance national security concerns with international commitments and individual rights. The decision to include these exceptions reflects the administration's efforts to mitigate potential disruptions to international events and travel.</p>
