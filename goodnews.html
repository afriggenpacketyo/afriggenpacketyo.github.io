          <p>Italians will vote in a referendum that proposes halving the legal residency requirement for non-EU adult foreigners to apply for citizenship, from 10 to five years. The referendum bypasses parliament due to a grassroots organization gathering half a million signatures. Currently, an estimated 1.4 million people in Italy face obstacles in obtaining citizenship due to clerical errors or insufficient income. Prime Minister Meloni has discouraged participation, hoping the referendum will not reach quorum, but a successful vote would recognize the diversity of millions of residents and enrich Italy's national identity.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter at birth, specifically Bifidobacterium longum, can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that young children with this bacteria had half the risk of being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers believe this finding could lead to therapies that boost good bacteria in babies. The protective bacteria were found only in babies that came into the world via a vaginal delivery rather than a caesarean.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups challenging an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County's coastline, granting a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp. The order halts restart efforts on the operation's onshore pipeline system, which suffered a major rupture and spill in 2015. The ruling forces Sable to delay its restart timeline, targeting August 1 for first sales. Environmental groups celebrated the ruling, arguing that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work.</p>
