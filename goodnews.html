          <p>An opinion piece challenges the narrative that China has stolen millions of American jobs, arguing that cheap Chinese goods have made life more affordable for the average American. While acknowledging the impact on blue-collar workers affected by manufacturing decline, the article questions the reality of the so-called "China shock." It references research suggesting that the benefits of trade with China may outweigh the costs. The piece aims to provide a counter-argument to the anti-China sentiment prevalent in U.S. politics.</p>

          <p>Despite delivering quarterly beats on key metrics, CrowdStrike experienced a decline in share price due to mixed guidance, leading to profit-taking. The company's revenue increased by 20% year-over-year, with growth across all regions, and adjusted earnings per share exceeded estimates. Annual recurring revenue also jumped, and remaining performance obligations increased significantly, prompting a new $1 billion share repurchase authorization. The analysis in the article suggests that the market's reaction is shortsighted and raises the price target for CrowdStrike shares, citing the growing demand for cybersecurity and the company's strong performance.
