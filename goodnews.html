          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures expected to peak above 30 degrees Celsius. The heat has prompted amber health alerts in southern England and wildfire warnings in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The extreme weather has also affected major events like Wimbledon, where play was halted due to spectators needing medical attention, and has led to travel disruptions and hosepipe bans. Fire officials are urging public caution around water and highlighting the severe risk of wildfires due to the dry conditions.</p>

          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano by a majority decision in the final fight of their historic trilogy at Madison Square Garden. The bout, described as a strategic "chess match," saw Taylor retain her undisputed light-welterweight championship in front of a sold-out arena. While not as explosive as their previous encounters, the fight was gripping, with Taylor boxing smartly to secure the win. Following the victory, the 39-year-old champion expressed respect for her opponent but remained noncommittal about her future in the sport.</p>

          <p>Google has announced a significant move in the competitive AI talent market, hiring Windsurf co-founder and CEO Varun Mohan and other senior employees from the AI coding startup. The deal, valued at $2.4 billion, includes licensing fees for some of Windsurf's technology and compensation for the new hires, though it is not an acquisition. This development highlights the escalating "talent war" among major tech companies, with firms like Google, Meta, and Microsoft making multi-billion dollar deals to secure top AI researchers and developers. Windsurf will continue to operate independently under a new interim CEO.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a cultural controversy. The brand faced criticism after showcasing sandals at Milan Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their Indian origin. In response to the backlash from Indian critics and politicians, Prada engaged in talks with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents thousands of Kolhapuri artisans. This move is seen as a step toward respectful collaboration between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, halting certain immigration enforcement tactics in several Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, prohibits agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or location without reasonable suspicion. The decision came in response to a lawsuit by the ACLU and other groups alleging unconstitutional racial profiling. Local officials, including LA Mayor Karen Bass, praised the ruling as a victory for constitutional rights and public safety.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company deceptively used their voices, which they were told were for internal research, to create AI voice clones sold on its platform. While the judge dismissed claims of federal copyright over their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive practices, and copyright infringement related to training data will proceed. The decision is considered a significant step for artists seeking to hold AI companies accountable for misusing their work.</p>

          <p>In response to a government push and growing demand from Chinese companies operating abroad, Chinese law firms are significantly expanding their international presence. The number of overseas offices for Chinese firms has grown by 70 percent since 2018. These firms find that Chinese companies expanding globally often prefer and have more trust in legal support from their compatriots. However, lawyers acknowledge that winning over non-Chinese clients is a major challenge, particularly amid rising geopolitical tensions that can complicate cross-border legal work and client trust.</p>

          <p>A federal judge's order blocking certain immigration arrest tactics in Los Angeles also addressed the critical issue of legal access for detainees. Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong found that federal officials were holding many people for hours in a temporary processing facility without access to their attorneys. The ruling rebuked this practice and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to permit legal visitation seven days a week. This part of the order provides a significant victory for immigrant rights advocates who argued that detainees' constitutional rights were being systematically violated.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has implemented an emergency ban on air passengers carrying substandard portable power banks following several incidents of defective units catching fire on commercial flights. The rule, effective since June 28, bars any portable lithium-ion batteries that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark from domestic flights. This safety measure has caused some confusion among travelers and led to large numbers of power banks being abandoned at airports.

          <p>Chinese pharmaceutical companies are poised to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with approximately 60 rival drugs to treatments like Ozempic currently under trial. The upcoming expiration of the patent for semaglutide in China next year is expected to pave the way for cheaper generic versions, potentially making these treatments more affordable and accessible. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic drug makers in China will compete for market share, driving down prices in a market valued at over $150 billion.

          <p>A 123-year-old railway bridge in Prague has become the focus of a passionate debate between the national Railway Authority and a coalition of architects and preservationists. The authority plans to dismantle the iconic Vysehrad bridge, citing corrosion and the need for a third track to handle growing rail traffic, and move it to a new location. However, an international foundation of experts argues that the bridge can be repaired in place for less money and with minimal disruption. With support from Unesco and a public petition, campaigners are urging the Czech government to preserve the historic landmark.</p>
