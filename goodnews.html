          <p>A prototype of the innovative MingKwai Chinese typewriter, invented by linguist Lin Yutang in the 1940s and long thought to be lost, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. The machine was a revolutionary attempt to adapt the complex, character-based Chinese language for mechanical typing, using a system that broke down characters by shape rather than sound. This design concept is a foundational element in modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computing input methods. The discovery is celebrated by scholars as finding a key artifact in the history of global technology.</p>

          <p>For the first time in over 100 years, public swimming has been officially permitted in designated areas of Paris's Seine River. The milestone follows a massive $1.5 billion cleanup project, initially spurred by the city's Olympic bid, which has successfully improved water quality to meet safety standards on most days. On Saturday, residents and the mayor celebrated by taking a plunge, marking the culmination of a long-held dream to restore the iconic river for recreational use. This achievement is seen as a significant environmental success and a moment of national pride for France.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are conducting research on sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand ocean health and shift public opinion about the animals. By temporarily capturing sharks and examining their stomach contents, researchers can assess the health of both the individual shark and its surrounding ecosystem. The work, led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, aims to generate crucial data for marine conservation. Despite public fascination with sharks, the lab notes that securing financial support for this vital research remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>An Arizona man is challenging his property management company after being fined $4,000 for posting negative online reviews about his rental experience, which included issues like black mold. The fine was based on a "non-disparagement" clause in his lease that penalizes tenants for reviews rated three stars or less. Such clauses are generally illegal under the 2016 federal Consumer Review Fairness Act, which protects a consumer's right to share honest feedback. The tenant has filed complaints with state and federal authorities, highlighting a potentially widespread and unlawful practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mo Gawdat, a former Google executive and happiness researcher, promotes a "90-second rule" for processing negative emotions like anger or stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, suggests that the physiological response to an emotional trigger, such as the release of cortisol, lasts only about 90 seconds. After this initial period, any continued distress is caused by consciously or unconsciously re-running the negative thought. Gawdat advises allowing oneself this brief window to feel the emotion, and then consciously choosing to shift focus, thereby preventing a cycle of rumination.</p>

The show's protagonist is a security cyborg that has hacked its own programming to achieve free will but has no interest in humanity, preferring to secretly watch soap operas. This concept subverts the common sci-fi trope of AI yearning for human connection or seeking to dominate mankind.
