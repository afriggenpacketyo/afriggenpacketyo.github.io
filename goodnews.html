        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shell reported adjusted earnings of $5.58 billion for the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations despite a decrease from the $7.73 billion earned in the same period last year. The company announced a $3.5 billion share buyback program, marking the 14th consecutive quarter of buybacks exceeding $3 billion, demonstrating confidence in its financial performance and strategic direction. Shell's CEO, Wael Sawan, hailed the results as "another solid set" and reaffirmed the company's commitment to increasing shareholder returns while maintaining a reduced annual investment budget. This move contrasts with rival BP's decision to lower its share buyback after disappointing earnings.</p>

          <p>Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) has fined TikTok 530 million euros for violating the EU's GDPR data protection law by transferring European user data to China. The DPC, which oversees TikTok's privacy practices in the EU, ordered the company to comply with data processing regulations within six months, threatening to suspend data transfers to China if compliance is not achieved. The regulator cited TikTok's failure to ensure equivalent data protection standards for EEA users when their data was accessed by staff in China, particularly regarding potential access by Chinese authorities under anti-terrorism and counter-espionage laws.</p>

          <p>A mother traveling from Bristol to Belfast was reportedly asked by EasyJet staff to pay an additional charge for carrying breast milk and a breast pump as extra hand luggage, despite researching the airline's rules beforehand. Daisy Crawford described the experience as "embarrassing" and expressed disappointment at the lack of understanding from the staff, who allegedly refused to hear her point. EasyJet has since apologized for the incident, stating that customers are allowed an additional free bag for breast pumps and milk if they notify the airline in advance, but this information was not communicated effectively during Ms. Crawford's boarding.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump criticized Democrats for pursuing impeachment efforts against him, suggesting that Republicans should consider expelling them from Congress for alleged crimes. Trump's comments followed Rep. Shri Thanedar's announcement of articles of impeachment against him, prompting Rep. Al Green to express support for the effort. Trump accused the Democrats of dishonesty and using impeachment as a weapon, while asserting that Republicans should retaliate by expelling them for their own offenses. He also alluded to alleged past actions by Adam Schiff and the January 6th Committee, claiming they required pardons to avoid expulsion.</p>

          <p>A lynx born at Newquay Zoo in Cornwall could become the first UK zoo-born cat to be successfully released into the wild, as it participates in a European breeding program. Due to a shortage of female lynxes, the zoo was asked to contribute their one-year-old female, which has been moved to an enclosure in Germany for monitoring. The lynx will be assessed for its survival skills, particularly its ability to avoid human interaction, which is crucial for successful rewilding. Thousands of lynx already roam wild in European forests, and this effort aims to increase genetic diversity, especially in central Europe, where fragmented habitats have led to inbreeding.</p>

Supporters trust his leadership and believe short-term pain is a price worth paying for long-term gain, often citing his adherence to campaign promises and admiration for figures like Elon Musk.</p>

          <p>A recent poll shows strong support for reindustrializing America, with 80% believing it would benefit the country, even if only 25% think it would personally benefit them. The article argues that a strong manufacturing sector is crucial for economic health, wage growth, and social equality, citing examples from China and Denmark. Reindustrialization could also help the left regain working-class voters and offer a way out of neoliberal globalization by rethinking trade, immigration, and economic policies. Despite challenges, the US has an opportunity to rebuild its manufacturing sector, potentially leading to better wages and more stable communities.</p>

Weber argues that the act's unnecessary documentation requirements would create significant barriers to voting, echoing historical efforts to suppress voting rights.

This effort aims to counter the trend of rising home prices and potential displacement of long-standing residents, particularly in the Black community.

          <p>Christina Li's "The Manor of Dreams" is a gothic novel where two families converge at a crumbling Altadena mansion for the reading of a will, revealing secrets and ghostly encounters. The will of Oscar-winner Vivian Yin leaves her daughters, Lucille and Rennie, with little money but grants the mansion to Elaine, sparking conflict and suspicion. As the families stay in the house, they experience strange occurrences, prompting them to uncover long-held secrets about Vivian's past and their own relationships. While the novel's attempt to link the haunting to the exploitation of Chinese migrants falls short, the story is a compelling exploration of family dynamics, queer romance, and the impact of secrets.</p>

          <p>Euro zone inflation remained unchanged at 2.2% in April, according to Eurostat data, failing to meet expectations for a decrease. While core inflation rose to 2.7%, economists suggest that the increase in services inflation may be due to Easter timing effects and expect a decline in the coming months. Despite tariff uncertainty, analysts believe the relatively low headline inflation keeps pressure off the European Central Bank (ECB), allowing for further interest rate cuts. The ECB last cut interest rates in April, lowering its key rate to 2.25%.</p>
