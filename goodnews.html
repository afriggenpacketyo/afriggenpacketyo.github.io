          <h2>Louisiana's Investment in Meta Data Center Faces Scrutiny</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-25 08:08:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta's decision to build a $10 billion data center in Louisiana has sparked debate over the economic benefits versus the costs to the state. The project, set to be the largest data center in the Western Hemisphere, promises to transform Louisiana's economy and create 500 permanent jobs, with a temporary surge to 5,000 during construction. However, the state had to offer significant incentives, including a 20-year sales tax exemption, to secure the deal. Concerns are also raised about the massive energy consumption of the data center, which will require the construction of three new gas-fired power plants. Optimism about the project's long-term impact is tempered by the potential environmental and financial burdens on the state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are stuck in a holding pattern due to economic uncertainty and overseas conflicts, showing minimal movement despite significant global events. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages slightly increased to 6.88%, offering little incentive to potential homebuyers. Applications for mortgages to purchase homes dropped slightly, remaining historically low due to inflated house prices and limited supply. While refinance applications saw a rise, overall market activity remains subdued, indicating a lack of significant momentum in the housing sector.</p>

          <p>The British pound is currently at its highest level in over three years, prompting differing opinions among analysts regarding its potential for further gains. While some attribute the pound's strength to dollar weakness and recovery from the 2022 mini-budget crisis, others suggest its upward momentum may be limited. Forecasts vary, with some predicting continued dollar weakness and a rise to $1.40, while others anticipate a decline to $1.30 due to macroeconomic factors and potential Bank of England rate cuts. Geopolitical developments, such as improved relations with the EU, could also influence the pound's future performance.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers and Clippers are preparing for the NBA draft, focusing on selecting the 'best available' player rather than addressing specific needs. The Lakers, lacking a first-round pick, aim to develop their second-round selection with the South Bay Lakers. Contract decisions for key players like LeBron James and Luka Doncic are looming. The Clippers, holding the 30th overall pick, seek frontcourt help, playmaking, and shooting, with Noah Penda projected as a potential pick.</p>

          <p>NATO allies, including the United States, have reaffirmed their commitment to collective defense, as outlined in Article 5 of the Washington Treaty, at a summit in The Hague. While the communique did not condemn Russia's war in Ukraine, it did describe Russia as a long-term threat. Allies also agreed to increase defense spending, aiming to invest 5% of GDP annually by 2035. The agreement comes amid concerns about President Trump's skepticism towards NATO and the need for member states to share the burden of defense.</p>

          <h2>Triple Amputee Veteran Completes Solo Sail Across Pacific to Japan</h2>

          <p>Craig Wood, a British Army veteran and triple amputee, has made history by becoming the first person with his condition to sail solo across the Pacific Ocean. Wood, who lost both legs and his left hand in Afghanistan, sailed approximately 13,000 kilometers from Mexico to Hiroshima, Japan, over 90 days. He hopes his achievement will inspire others, particularly those living with limb loss, to challenge perceptions of disability. Wood also plans to visit the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum to reflect on the impact of war.</p>
