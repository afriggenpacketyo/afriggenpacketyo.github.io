          <p>President Trump addressed questions about defying the Supreme Court regarding the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland resident mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Trump stated he is relying on Attorney General Pam Bondi to determine the legality of ordering Abrego Garcia's return. When questioned about Secretary of State Marco Rubio's view on due process for citizens and non-citizens, Trump admitted, "I don't know. I'm not a lawyer. I don't know." Further pressed on upholding the Constitution, Trump deferred to his lawyers, stating they would follow the Supreme Court's guidance. This article focuses on the administration's response to a specific legal case and Trump's reliance on legal counsel.</p>

          <p>After Bayer Leverkusen's historic unbeaten season, Bayern Munich has won back the Bundesliga title, marking their 33rd overall. The article attributes the win to Vincent Kompany's steadying influence as coach, key signings like Harry Kane and Michael Olise, and Leverkusen's inability to sustain their previous season's performance. Kompany's positive relationships with players and effective handling of internal pressures were crucial, while Kane's goal-scoring prowess and Olise's creativity added new dimensions to Bayern's attack. Bayern's strength in depth also allowed them to overcome injuries to key players, ultimately securing the title with one game to spare.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old investing legend, is planning to step down as head of Berkshire Hathaway, the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he built using value investing principles. Buffett's approach focused on buying wonderful businesses at fair prices and holding them for the long term, transforming a failing textile manufacturer into a diverse economic powerhouse. His success earned him a Midas-like fortune and the admiration of financiers worldwide. While his successor, Gregory Abel, is regarded as an excellent operator, some investors worry that Berkshire may lose its mythical status without Buffett's stock-picking prowess.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist specializing in couples, the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly detrimental to relationships. This comparison, whether to an ex, friend, or past version of oneself, conveys a message of inadequacy and undermines a partner's sense of worth. The phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of open communication or uncertainty about the relationship. Instead of making comparisons, the psychologist recommends clearly communicating needs and frustrations to foster a healthier and more secure relationship.</p>

          <p>This article explores the idea of retrofitting existing single-family homes into multi-unit dwellings as a potential solution to the affordable housing crisis. With a shortage of millions of homes and rising construction costs, developers and policymakers are looking at ways to utilize the existing housing stock more efficiently. Examples include converting homes into "roommate houses" and adding accessory dwelling units (ADUs) like backyard cottages. These efforts aim to add housing in existing neighborhoods without major disruption and can provide homeowners with additional income or housing options for family members.</p>
