          <p>Germany's new government, led by Katherina Reiche, is reassessing climate protection policies, particularly concerning the Building Energy Act. Reiche aims to revise the law, which promotes heat pumps, to include gas-fired power plants. Critics argue this move could increase reliance on fossil fuels, while Reiche prioritizes securing the energy supply alongside climate goals. Despite these shifts, Germany has committed significant investments towards climate protection infrastructure, demonstrating a continued focus on environmental issues, even amidst debates on specific energy policies.</p>

          <p>The European Union's trade chief emphasized the bloc's commitment to securing a trade deal with the US based on "respect" rather than "threats." This statement follows US President Donald Trump's suggestion of imposing a 50% tariff on all goods from the EU. European governments have cautioned that higher tariffs would harm both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward. The EU remains one of Washington's largest trading partners, and leaders are keen to find a mutually beneficial solution.</p>
