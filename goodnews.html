          <p>Hamas responded to President Donald Trump's Gaza peace proposal, agreeing to release all remaining hostages if Israel withdraws from Gaza and specific field conditions are met, while also agreeing to hand over administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body. President Trump stated on social media that he believes Hamas is ready for a lasting peace and urged Israel to immediately stop bombing Gaza to ensure the safe release of hostages. Qatar has begun working with its partners in mediation with Egypt and the United States to complete discussions on the plan to end the war. The developments indicate a potential pathway towards de-escalation and negotiations.</p>

Raghu is appealing to Ice, explaining his case and the financial hardship his family faces due to his revoked work visa.

          <p>A federal appeals court upheld a lower court's decision, determining that the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship is likely unconstitutional. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the Trump administration, citing historical efforts to restrict birthright citizenship that were ultimately rejected. The court emphasized the importance of recognizing birthright citizenship based on the simple fact of being born in the United States, rather than on the actions of one's parents. The Trump administration has requested Supreme Court review of the constitutionality of the executive order.</p>

Cerebras has shifted its focus away from selling systems to providing a cloud service for accepting incoming queries to models that use its chips underneath.

          <p>Munich Airport suspended operations for the second time in 24 hours due to unconfirmed drone sightings in the vicinity. The move comes hours after a drone was spotted above a German military installation in the nearby town of Erding. German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt described the drone incident in Munich as a "wake-up call" and called for increased funding and research. Germany is celebrating 35 years since the integration of former East and West Germany.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department is considering minting a $1 coin bearing President Donald Trump's likeness on both sides to honor him and commemorate the United States' 250th birthday next year. One side of the coin depicts Trump's head in profile, while the other shows him raising his fist, reminiscent of his reaction after surviving an assassination attempt. Concerns have been raised about the legality of depicting a living person on a coin, as existing laws appear to prohibit it. The Treasury spokesperson said that the draft reflects the enduring spirit of the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ange Postecoglou, the manager of Nottingham Forest, retains the support of the club's hierarchy despite a run of six matches without a victory. The club's board believes mitigating circumstances have contributed to the poor start and that refereeing decisions wrongly went against them in the Europa League defeat. However, the upcoming match against Newcastle is considered significant in evaluating Postecoglou's position, with the performance being as important as the result. A heavy defeat could put Postecoglou under internal scrutiny heading into the international break.</p>
