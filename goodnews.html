          <p>The UK government is considering expanding the ban on bottom trawling in its offshore protected areas from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgent need to protect oceans from irreversible destruction, coinciding with the UN Ocean Conference in France. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats across 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas. This move follows warnings from Sir David Attenborough and calls from MPs to ban destructive fishing practices in MPAs, and aims to balance environmental protection with the interests of the fishing industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports to the U.S. experienced a significant drop of 34.5% in May, marking the sharpest decline since February 2020, due to lingering effects of tariffs. Despite this, overall exports rose by 4.8%, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asia, the European Union, and Africa. Imports also fell by 3.4%, reflecting sluggish domestic demand, while China's total trade surplus increased by 25% to $103.2 billion. The decline in exports of rare earths indicates Beijing's strategic use of export controls during trade negotiations, while volumes of cars and ship exports increased, and the imports of soybeans surged.
