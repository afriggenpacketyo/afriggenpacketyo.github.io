          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:29:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite previous denials from owner Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys are now reportedly open to hearing trade offers for All-Pro pass rusher Micah Parsons. The move comes amid a contentious contract dispute that has seen Parsons hold out from practice as he seeks a new long-term deal. Parsons, who is currently on the fifth-year option of his rookie contract, has publicly expressed his desire to leave the team and has removed Cowboys references from his social media. The situation reflects a significant standoff between a top NFL player and team management, with any potential trade likely demanding a substantial return of draft picks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid rising inflation and concerns about Social Security, many seniors face financial strain from healthcare costs not fully covered by Medicare. This article outlines several strategies for older adults to bridge these insurance gaps and manage out-of-pocket expenses like copays and deductibles. Options include purchasing Medicare supplemental insurance, also known as Medigap, which is specifically designed to cover these leftover costs. Other potential solutions involve leveraging home equity through a reverse mortgage, a product exclusive to homeowners 62 and older, or securing a guaranteed future income stream by purchasing an annuity.

          <p>Intel has received $5.7 billion in cash from the U.S. government as part of the Trump administration's plan to take a 10% stake in the semiconductor company. The investment was confirmed by Intel's CFO, David Zinser, who also suggested the company might seek external investors for its chip manufacturing foundry business. The deal, which is still being finalized by the Department of Commerce, aims to bolster the domestic chip industry. In a corporate filing, Intel acknowledged the government transaction could potentially lead to adverse reactions from investors, employees, and foreign governments, as well as increased public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock experienced a slight dip despite reporting a 56% surge in quarterly sales, as investor concerns about the company's future in China overshadowed strong results. The Trump administration's block on sales of its H20 chip, designed for the Chinese market, remains a significant issue, although CEO Jensen Huang is negotiating a deal to resume sales. While Huang highlighted the immense long-term opportunity in AI infrastructure, projecting a $3 to $4 trillion market by the end of the decade, the immediate uncertainty in China created noise around the otherwise robust earnings report. The company's guidance for the next quarter does not include any potential H20 shipments to China.</p>

Raducanu, who has shown consistent progress and strong form in her opening matches, will test her improved game against the powerful 2022 Wimbledon champion, Elena Rybakina. This matchup provides a significant benchmark for Raducanu's development since their last encounter in 2022. Meanwhile, Cameron Norrie is preparing for his seventh career meeting with tennis legend Novak Djokovic, hoping his recent intense training will allow him to challenge the world's top player more effectively than in their previous encounters.</p>

          <p>Data storage vendor Pure Storage saw its shares soar by 32% to a record high after reporting better-than-expected quarterly results and raising its full-year guidance. A key driver of the impressive performance is a new agreement with Meta, which has become Pure Storage's key storage provider to meet the massive data needs of its AI operations. The company has begun recognizing revenue from the Meta deal and expressed confidence in deploying one to two exabytes of storage for the social media giant this year. This major contract with a hyperscaler has bolstered investor confidence and is attracting interest from other large-scale tech companies.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 15:51:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans have fallen to their lowest point this year, making them an increasingly attractive option for homeowners seeking financing. With average rates now at 8.22%, these loans offer a fixed-rate alternative to variable-rate HELOCs, providing protection against future market uncertainty. The appeal of these loans is heightened by record-high home equity levels, which give homeowners a substantial borrowing base. Furthermore, using the funds for eligible home improvements can provide tax deductions, adding another financial benefit for borrowers considering this option to leverage their home's value.

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its grocery business by integrating fresh and perishable items into its existing same-day delivery service for Prime members. By retrofitting its network of same-day fulfillment hubs with temperature-controlled environments, the company can now deliver items like eggs and produce alongside non-perishables in a single order. This strategic move aims to close the convenience gap with traditional grocers like Walmart and Kroger, potentially disrupting the market and posing a threat to delivery services like Instacart. While analysts note initial limitations in product selection, Amazon's logistical strength and vast Prime customer base position it for long-term growth in the sector.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has started public testing of MAI-1-preview, a new, large-scale AI model developed in-house, signaling a move to reduce its reliance on strategic partner OpenAI. While Microsoft has invested heavily in OpenAI and uses its models to power many AI features, this new model could lead to significant enhancements for its own Copilot assistant. The move highlights the evolving and increasingly competitive relationship between the two tech giants. Microsoft plans to roll out the new model for specific text-based tasks within Copilot in the coming weeks to gather user feedback and further refine its performance, with ambitions to reach billions of users.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has announced it will reclaim direct management of Washington, D.C.'s Union Station, a major transit hub that has reportedly fallen into disrepair. While the federal government has owned the landmark building since the 1980s, its operations have been outsourced to other entities, most recently Amtrak. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated the move is intended to restore the station and make it safe and beautiful, citing issues with crime and vagrancy. The administration plans to address immediate infrastructure needs like the roof and security before considering any long-term expansion projects, aiming to improve the station's financial stability through better management of its commercial aspects.</p>
