          <p>Writer Jack Thorne has lauded the "remarkable" journalists who exposed the widespread phone hacking scandal, in anticipation of ITV's forthcoming drama, "The Hack." The series, starring David Tennant as investigative Guardian reporter Nick Davies, delves into the intricate and often troubling relationship between the press, politics, and police. Thorne, who also penned the hit "Mr Bates vs The Post Office," highlighted that this article celebrates journalists who successfully held their own industry accountable, a contrast to cases where media scrutiny struggled to gain purchase. The drama further incorporates the perspective of police detective Dave Cook, who investigated the murder of private investigator Daniel Morgan, offering a comprehensive view of the events.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many couples experience a significant drop in sex drive after childbirth, a common issue impacting relationships, as highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth and medical experts. This article explains that physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts causing vaginal dryness, and the overwhelming demands of new parenthood all contribute to reduced libido for both mothers and fathers. Open communication between partners is crucial to alleviate pressure and address concerns, fostering understanding that these changes are often not personal. Specialists emphasize that societal expectations for resuming intimacy often misalign with the complex realities of postpartum recovery, advocating for patience and mutual support during this transitional period.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has agreed to appear at a local ABC town hall, reversing his earlier withdrawal following the network's decision to reinstate Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. Mamdani had protested Kimmel's suspension, which occurred after the FCC chair threatened ABC's broadcast licenses over Kimmel's criticism of the Trump administration's reaction to Charlie Kirk's death. Disney, ABC's parent company, announced Kimmel's return after "thoughtful conversations." This article underscores Mamdani's principled stand against perceived censorship and his commitment to upholding free speech, a significant theme in the ongoing mayoral race that also includes Andrew Cuomo and Eric Adams.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants, offering significant relief to the University of California system. Judge Rita F. Lin ruled that the National Institutes of Health grants were suspended using unspecific form letters, likely violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration had cited allegations of campus antisemitism, the use of race in admissions, and the school's recognition of transgender identities as justifications for the funding freeze, and proposed a $1.2 billion fine. This article highlights a crucial legal victory for academic freedom and the continuation of vital biomedical research across UC campuses.</p>

          <p>Disney announced the reinstatement of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" after a week-long suspension triggered by comments Kimmel made concerning the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk. The suspension followed threats from the Federal Communications Commission chairman and criticism from President Trump, who had publicly supported the network's initial decision. Disney stated the show was suspended "to avoid further inflaming a tense situation" and because some comments were "ill-timed and thus insensitive." This article details the significant controversy, including Sinclair's decision to replace the show with news programming and widespread condemnation from free-speech advocates, Hollywood figures, and lawmakers who decried the suspension as a violation of free speech rights.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual "pannage" season, an ancient tradition dating back to 1079. These pigs act as a natural "cleanup crew," grazing on abundant acorns, chestnuts, and beech mast, which are toxic to the area's free-roaming ponies and cattle. This article explains that the New Forest's verderers initiated pannage due to a heavy acorn crop, emphasizing its crucial role in maintaining the forest's ecological balance and the husbandry of other livestock. Visitors are reminded to maintain a safe distance from the pigs and drive extra carefully through the forest to prevent accidents during this unique seasonal practice.</p>

          <p>NASA introduced a new class of 10 astronaut candidates, comprising six women and four men, selected from over 8,000 applicants. This marks the first time a NASA astronaut class has more women than men, featuring a diverse array of professionals including pilots, engineers, and a former SpaceX launch director, with one candidate already having commercial spaceflight experience. They will undergo two years of rigorous training for future missions to the International Space Station, the Moon, and eventually Mars. This article highlights the new astronauts joining NASA during a period of uncertainty due to budget cuts and challenges in the Artemis moon program, yet the acting administrator expressed strong confidence in the agency's ability to win the "second space race" to the moon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has canceled nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, with major federal health agencies moving to phase out live animal research. This article highlights a growing, bipartisan movement, encompassing animal rights activists and members of Congress, advocating to halt billions in federal spending on animal experiments. While animal tests have historically been crucial for developing life-saving drugs and vaccines, critics champion alternatives such as AI-based computational modeling and lab testing on human organs. The initiative sparks a fierce debate about balancing ethical concerns with the imperative for continued medical innovation and urgent patient needs, as some worry about delaying critical treatments.</p>

          <p>India is investing $18 billion through its "Semiconductor Mission" with the ambitious goal of establishing a full domestic chip supply chain, encompassing design, fabrication, testing, and packaging. This article explains that the initiative aims to reduce import dependence, secure chips for strategic sectors, and capture a larger share of the global electronics market, a move partly driven by US restrictions on advanced AI chip exports to China. While India boasts a significant pool of engineering talent, experts caution that success requires more than just financial incentives. They emphasize the need for a dynamic and long-term ecosystem, including robust tax, trade, and intellectual property policies, to effectively compete with established chip-making nations.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK Liberal Democrats, is set to propose offering discount visas to US cancer scientists whose research has been impacted by Trump administration funding cuts. This article explains Davey's initiative, framed as a direct response to what he calls the US government's "anti-science agenda," aims to position the UK as a global leader in the fight against cancer. The proposal follows significant cuts to biomedical research grants in the US and a poll indicating that 75% of scientists are considering leaving the country. Davey also criticized Reform UK members for applauding cuts to mRNA vaccine research, underscoring a political commitment to scientific advancement.</p>

          <p>A 4.3 magnitude earthquake struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday, jolting thousands awake but causing no reported injuries or major structural damage. Centered east-south-east of Berkeley, the quake prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to implement reduced speeds for safety track inspections, leading to systemwide delays. While some businesses reported broken windows and merchandise tumbling from shelves, city officials confirmed no significant damage reports. This article serves as a stark reminder of the region's inherent seismic risks, urging residents to prepare for future, potentially larger quakes, and highlights the effectiveness of immediate response protocols.</p>
