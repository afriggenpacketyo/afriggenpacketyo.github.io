          <h2>Europe Embraces Night Trains While America Lags Behind in Sustainable Transportation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 02:57:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards' New York Times article compares the contrasting approaches of Europe and the United States towards night train travel. Europe is experiencing a renaissance in sleeper train networks, driven by environmental concerns and the desire to compete with short-haul flights. The European Union plans to significantly increase high-speed rail traffic by 2030. In contrast, the United States is reducing funding for public infrastructure and prioritizing cars, planes, and unproven technologies like the Hyperloop. The article argues that investing in rail networks could improve mental health and provide a more sustainable alternative to car dependence, but America continues to favor highways and individual transportation. </p>

Recent polls indicate a close race, likely leading to a second round. The election is also a test for far-right forces, with S≈Çawomir Mentzen polling in third place.

          <p>A CBS News "48 Hours" report recounts the story of Chris Smith, who survived a gunshot to the head during a first date in Illinois, thanks to his dog, Tiki. After being shot, Smith lay wounded for 12 hours until EMTs arrived, with Tiki huddling beside him and providing warmth. The assailant, Robert Tarr, an ex-boyfriend of Smith's date, Leslie Reeves, was later convicted of murder and attempted murder.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is increasingly utilizing Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include projects in Kenya and Zambia, where Chinese companies would contribute a significant portion of the funding and operate the infrastructure for a minimum of 25 years to recoup their investment through toll fees. This approach is viewed as a sustainable way to continue infrastructure development in Africa. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new fibre-optic gyroscope with enhanced stability across a wide temperature range, potentially improving navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope uses the changing movement of light in optical fibres to sense orientation and turning rates, making it valuable for inertial navigation systems. These systems are immune to interference, which is critical for military and security applications. The interferometric fibre-optic gyroscope (IFOG) offers a simple structure and high resolution, making it suitable for various uses including aerospace, weapons systems, oil platforms, and autonomous vehicles.</p>
