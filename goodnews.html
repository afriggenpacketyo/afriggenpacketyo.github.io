          <p>Arsenal has strengthened its defense by signing Ecuadorian international Piero Hincapie on a season-long loan from German club Bayer Leverkusen. The deal includes a £45 million option for a permanent transfer next summer, making Hincapie the eighth signing for the club during the current transfer window. Manager Mikel Arteta praised the 23-year-old's physical presence and versatility, which will add depth to the squad's defensive options. The move coincides with the departure of defender Jakub Kiwior to Porto and midfielders Fabio Vieira and Sambi Lokonga to Hamburg, as Arsenal reshapes its team.</p>

          <p>Oman has become the latest Gulf nation to launch a "golden visa" program, aiming to attract wealthy foreign investors, including Americans seeking international residency. To qualify for the Golden Residency, individuals must invest at least $520,000 in Omani property, bonds, or businesses that create local jobs. The program offers benefits like fast-track airport services and the ability to own property in previously restricted areas. This move is part of a broader trend where countries use investment-based residency to stimulate economic growth, with experts noting a rising demand for such programs as a form of security and mobility.

          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson in a dramatic role as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores the personal crisis Kerr faced after his first professional loss, delving into his struggles with substance abuse and relationship issues. Johnson's performance is noted as a powerful and fitting casting choice, capturing the vulnerability of the formidable fighter. While the film is praised for its solid drama and insightful moments, particularly in scenes with co-star Emily Blunt, some critics feel it doesn't fully explore its emotional depths.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated he is "very encouraging" of people flying national flags like the Union Jack and the St. George's Cross, viewing them as symbols of patriotism. However, he cautioned that their value is diminished when they are used "purely for divisive purposes," a comment made in the context of flags being displayed during protests against asylum hotels. Starmer, who noted he has a St. George's flag in his Downing Street flat, has previously made efforts to associate his Labour Party with patriotic symbols. The comments come as some local councils have begun removing flags from public infrastructure, citing safety concerns.</p>

          <h2>Investigation Finds No Evidence for Claims of Melania Trump's Past as an Escort</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social media posts reviving old, unfounded claims that Melania Trump worked as an escort and met Donald Trump at a party hosted by Ghislaine Maxwell are circulating again. This article clarifies that these allegations, which originated in 2016, lack credible evidence. Melania Trump previously sued the Daily Mail and a blogger for defamation over the escort claim, resulting in retractions, apologies, and financial settlements. Furthermore, multiple reports confirm the Trumps were introduced by former modeling agent Paolo Zampolli, not at an event connected to Jeffrey Epstein or Maxwell. The claims are therefore determined to be unsubstantiated.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has announced his six wildcard selections, completing his 12-man team for the upcoming event at Bethpage. The picks—Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, Ludvig Åberg, Matt Fitzpatrick, Jon Rahm, and Sepp Straka—mean that 11 of the 12 players from the victorious 2023 Rome team will return. Despite the continuity, Donald warned the U.S. team not to expect a "rinse and repeat" of their previous strategy, emphasizing that playing away from home presents a different challenge. He urged his players to embrace the likely raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Celebrated Canadian author Margaret Atwood has penned a satirical short story to protest a new book ban in the province of Alberta. The policy, which requires school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of her iconic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some schools. Atwood's new story ironically describes two "very, very good children" who grow up and have a family "without ever having sex," mocking the premise of the ban. This creative act of protest highlights the ongoing culture clashes over censorship and educational materials, a trend that has spread from the U.S. into Canada.</p>

In the health-care sector, shares of Novo Nordisk also rose following the release of favorable trial data for its weight-loss drug Wegovy, suggesting superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to a key rival.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study analyzing 8,000 years of animal bones has found that human activities, particularly since the Middle Ages, caused a significant divergence in the body size evolution of wild and domesticated species. Researchers from the University of Montpellier discovered that as human settlements expanded and hunting intensified, wild animals like deer and foxes became smaller due to habitat loss and pressure. In contrast, domesticated animals such as cattle, sheep, and chickens grew larger as humans exerted more control through selective breeding and specialized management. The findings illustrate the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

          <p>During the redevelopment of a former Debenhams department store into a university campus in Gloucester, UK, archaeologists have discovered 317 skeletons from medieval and post-medieval burial grounds. The find is part of a larger excavation that has also unearthed numerous Roman-era artifacts, including pottery and building foundations, as the site was once part of an ancient Roman town. The skeletons were found near the location of the former St. Aldate's Church. While the human remains will be reinterred after study, other artifacts will be displayed at the new University of Gloucester campus when it opens.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned rail operator in Scotland, has permanently scrapped peak-time fares, meaning passengers will no longer pay higher prices for traveling during traditional rush hours. The move is a response to post-pandemic travel patterns, which have seen a reduction in commuter congestion, providing enough capacity to handle demand without price differentiation. While passengers welcome the cheaper tickets, the initiative raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could follow suit. Experts are divided, with some warning that without sufficient capacity, eliminating peak fares in busier English networks could lead to overcrowding or overall price increases to offset lost revenue.</p>
