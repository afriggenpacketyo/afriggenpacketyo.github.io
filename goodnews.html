          <p>The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) is intensifying its efforts to establish the region as a nuclear-weapon-free zone by urging global nuclear powers to sign its 1995 treaty. Malaysia, the current ASEAN chair, announced that China has committed to endorsing the treaty without reservation, and there are indications Russia may follow suit. This diplomatic push occurs as the U.S. pursues the AUKUS security pact, which involves nuclear-powered submarines in the Asia-Pacific. The move is seen as an attempt by ASEAN to reinforce its diplomatic centrality amid growing geopolitical competition.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Wimbledon tournament concluded with significant takeaways for the world of tennis, highlighting the continued dominance of Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz in the men's game. In the women's singles, Iga Swiatek achieved a career milestone by winning on all three surfaces, solidifying her status as an all-court great. The event also signaled a potential decline for Novak Djokovic, who failed to secure a 25th major title, while British tennis saw notable performances and a historic men's doubles victory. The tournament was also marked by a controversy involving the temporary failure of its new electronic line-calling system.</p>

          <h2>Athlete-Backed 'Jams' Launches to Compete with Uncrustables in Frozen Sandwich Market</h2>

          <p>A new company named Jams has launched a line of frozen peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, aiming to challenge the market dominance of Smucker's Uncrustables. Backed by prominent athletes like Alex Morgan and C.J. Stroud, Jams positions itself as a healthier alternative, free from seed oils, artificial dyes, and high-fructose corn syrup, while offering more protein per ounce. The product, created by 26-year-old entrepreneur Connor Blakley, will be sold exclusively at 3,000 Walmart stores. It enters a lucrative market, as Uncrustables is on track to generate over a billion dollars in annual sales.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China has stated it will continue its "moderately loose" monetary policy with a carefully managed pace to support the nation's goal of approximately 5% GDP growth this year. A deputy governor noted that the full effects of previous supportive measures, such as cuts to reserve requirements and key interest rates, have not yet materialized due to inherent policy lags. Future policy adjustments will depend on evolving domestic and international economic conditions. The bank aims to stimulate domestic demand and stabilize market expectations with its current approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's military showcased its defensive capabilities by live-streaming a naval minelaying exercise as part of its annual Han Kuang war games. The drill, held off the coast of Kaohsiung, involved deploying domestically produced sea mines designed to deter an enemy invasion by sea. This demonstration of asymmetric warfare tactics coincided with an urban warfare exercise in Taipei, where troops used the metro system for rapid deployment under simulated air raid conditions. These exercises are intended to bolster Taiwan's combat readiness in response to potential threats from across the strait.</p>

          <p>A former member of New York City's rent guidelines board, Leah Goodridge, argues that mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for a citywide rent freeze is a necessary and realistic policy. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney and board member, she asserts that rent freezes are a lifeline for many New Yorkers struggling with housing affordability. Goodridge dismisses criticism of the proposal, pointing out that the board has already approved rent freezes four times in the last decade under a previous administration. She frames the debate as part of a larger effort by landlords to deregulate rent-stabilized housing entirely.</p>

It highlights the acceptance of same-sex love in antiquity, citing examples like the Roman Emperor Hadrian and practices on the Greek island of Lesbos. The text contrasts this with the persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which used biblical interpretations to condemn what it termed "unnatural" lifestyles.

          <p>The UK government has initiated a public consultation on the future of the Post Office, proposing that the state-owned enterprise could be transformed into an employee-owned mutual organization. This discussion comes as the government seeks a "fresh vision" to reform the institution's culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will also explore the range of services the Post Office should offer, particularly banking, as high street banks close branches.

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement, which advocates for increasing housing supply by reducing building restrictions, is fundamentally a progressive and populist cause. The author refutes critics who paint YIMBYism as a pro-business, deregulatory agenda, instead framing it as an antitrust effort to break the "regulatory capture" by wealthy landowners (NIMBYs) who restrict housing supply to protect their property values. By blocking new development, these incumbent homeowners create artificial scarcity and drive up costs. The article asserts that building more homes is essential to address the cost-of-living crisis, climate change, and segregation.</p>

This policy idea resonates deeply with voters facing the city's exorbitant childcare costs, which average $26,000 a year. The plan, funded by increased taxes on corporations and the wealthy, is seen by supporters as a response to years of grassroots activism and a necessary step for economic equity. While implementing the system faces state-level political hurdles, advocates point to the success of universal pre-K as evidence that such ambitious social programs are achievable.</p>

          <p>India's consumer price inflation cooled to a lower-than-expected 2.1% in June, marking its eighth consecutive monthly decline and reaching a new multi-year low. The slide was driven by a continued drop in food prices, which fell into negative territory. This sustained easing of inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) with more room to continue its monetary policy relaxation, potentially leading to further interest rate cuts. Economists anticipate that a good monsoon season and strong cereal production will help keep inflation low, boosting domestic consumption and economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
