          <p>Chinese authorities, in cooperation with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration and the Royal Thai Police, have confiscated a record amount of methamphetamine near a contested reef in the South China Sea. The operation, which took place in late February, resulted in the seizure of nearly 5,000 kilograms of methamphetamine and the arrest of seven suspects. Representatives from the involved nations met to discuss further cooperation in dismantling drug trafficking networks, marking the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. This collaboration highlights international efforts to combat drug trafficking in the region. The cooperative effort shows a commitment to addressing transnational crime.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has reappointed Sébastien Lecornu as prime minister shortly after Lecornu's resignation amid political infighting. Macron tasked Lecornu with forming a government and addressing France's economic challenges, including mounting debt. All new cabinet members must renounce presidential ambitions for 2027, aiming to stabilize the political landscape. The move is viewed as Macron's attempt to revitalize his second term, facing criticism and lacking a parliamentary majority. France faces economic and political instability.
