          <p>After a week of escalating tensions including strikes on nuclear facilities, Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire, announced by President Trump. The agreement follows Iranian missile attacks on a U.S. base in Qatar and retaliatory U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu confirmed the ceasefire, stating that Israel achieved significant objectives, while Iran's Foreign Minister Araghchi asserted that Iranian forces continued to respond to Israeli aggression until the last moment. This development aims to de-escalate the conflict and potentially lead to lasting peace in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following the announcement of a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, alleviating concerns about potential disruptions to global oil supplies. Brent crude fell to $68 a barrel, dipping below levels seen before the recent missile strikes, while stock markets in the UK, Europe, and Asia showed positive reactions. Market analysts caution that the extent to which both countries adhere to the ceasefire will be crucial in determining future oil prices, as the initial drop narrowed following Israeli claims of Iranian ceasefire violations. Fears of increased energy costs impacting global economies had risen during the conflict.</p>

          <p>NATO allies have convened in The Hague for a two-day summit to discuss increasing defense spending and addressing ongoing crises, including the war in Ukraine and the escalation in the Middle East. Leaders and representatives from the 32 member states, along with Indo-Pacific partners, are expected to participate in the summit. A key focus of the summit is a vote on increasing defense spending to 5% of GDP, a demand championed by U.S. President Trump.

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran may have been effective, at least temporarily, as both countries have agreed to a ceasefire. The announcement came after Iran retaliated for U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities by launching missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, which were reportedly intercepted without causing casualties. While the agreement's fragility was evident with immediate accusations of violations, the Trump administration hopes the ceasefire will hold, preventing further escalation of regional conflict. Trump warned of an overwhelming American response to any attacks on U.S. interests.</p>

Morgan believes that artificial intelligence used by companies to filter applications might have hindered her progress initially, as her CV was not optimized for applicant tracking systems. Despite the challenges, she persevered and eventually landed a job in London, underscoring the importance of persistence and adapting to modern recruitment processes.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target to spend 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035. The agreement is expected to be formalized at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, with 3.5% allocated to core defense and 1.5% to related areas such as resilience and security. The government says measures on energy and tackling smuggling gangs could be classified as security spending. The Conservative Party has criticized the plan as unfunded and too distant.</p>

          <p>Ferrari faces intense scrutiny from the Italian media due to its status as a national team, leading to high-pressure environments. Team principal Frederic Vasseur expressed frustration over reports questioning his position, emphasizing the negative impact on the team. The media's role is to objectively report and scrutinize, not to support, and the facts of Ferrari's performance have fallen short of expectations. The Italian media's intense coverage is a part of what makes Ferrari special, despite the pressure it creates.</p>

          <p>NATO, formed in 1949, aimed to deter Soviet expansion in Europe after World War II and foster political integration on the continent. The organization, with 32 members, acts as a collective security alliance, providing mutual defense if a member is threatened by an external country, as outlined in Article 5. The fall of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of the Soviet Union paved the way for former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO. Russia's war against Ukraine has reinforced NATO's strategic relevance, with Ukraine's ambition to join the alliance remaining a point of contention.</p>

          <p>Global equities posted muted gains as investors digested President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, as well as signs of fatigue towards Trump's policymaking. The MSCI World index saw marginal increases, and U.S. futures also showed slight gains. Analysts suggest the market's muted response is due to a desensitization to Trump's policy changes and the subdued Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities. After significant swings from tariff policy changes in April, subsequent changes have had less impact on the markets.</p>

          <p>Western airlines risk greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which is forcing carriers to avoid flying over dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies continue to use it, giving them more flexibility. Analysts suggest this competitive advantage for Chinese airlines may widen due to the conflict, as Western firms divert flights through longer routes over Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Afghanistan.</p>
