          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic has advanced to the Wimbledon semi-finals after a four-set victory over Flavio Cobolli, setting up a highly anticipated match against world number one Jannik Sinner. Sinner secured his spot by defeating American Ben Shelton in straight sets, showing little discomfort from a recent elbow injury. This will be a rematch of their French Open semi-final, which Sinner won. However, Djokovic has a winning record against Sinner on grass and has now surpassed Roger Federer for the most men's semi-final appearances in Wimbledon history.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have both stated they are "very close" to securing a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Netanyahu indicated a "good chance" for a 60-day truce that would involve the release of half the remaining hostages, both living and deceased. The discussions are part of a broader effort by the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza, with a U.S. special envoy heading to Doha to continue negotiations. Netanyahu also defended Israel's independent aid distribution system, asserting it prevents Hamas from seizing supplies meant for civilians.</p>

          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting show that while most officials anticipate interest rate cuts this year, there is significant division on how many and how soon. The summary revealed a debate between concerns over potential tariff-driven inflation and signs of a weakening labor market. Some officials indicated a rate cut could be appropriate as soon as July, while others felt no reductions would be needed in 2025. This divergence reflects the central bank's cautious "wait-and-see" approach as it balances a resilient economy with inflation that remains above its 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With student loan payments resuming and new legislation set to change repayment programs, borrowers are advised to explore options to lower their monthly costs. This article outlines five key strategies, including switching to an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan before they are phased out and requesting temporary deferment or forbearance for short-term hardship. Other options include carefully considering refinancing for a lower interest rate, seeking out employer or state-based repayment assistance programs, and enrolling in autopay to receive a small interest rate discount. Acting proactively can help borrowers navigate the changing landscape and avoid financial strain.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is refreshing its menu with the return of the fan-favorite Snack Wrap and the launch of a new limited-time Spicy Egg McMuffin to attract budget-conscious customers. The move comes as the fast-food giant faces declining same-store sales and reduced traffic from low-income consumers impacted by inflation. By emphasizing value, with offerings like the $5 meal deal, and reviving popular items, McDonald's aims to regain its competitive edge. Analysts note that the strategy is a classic approach to drive business during times of economic uncertainty and reconnect with its core customer base.</p>

Netanyahu emphasized the strong U.S.-Israel coordination under President Trump, highlighting shared goals of dismantling Hamas and securing the release of all hostages.

          <p>As the Federal Reserve's July meeting approaches, homeowners considering borrowing against their equity face a choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan. A HELOC offers a variable rate that could fall if the Fed cuts rates, but also carries the risk of rising rates. Conversely, a home equity loan provides a fixed rate, offering stability and predictable payments in an uncertain interest rate climate. The decision depends on a homeowner's risk tolerance and outlook on whether interest rates are more likely to rise or fall in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, offers a revised perspective on the life of Hollywood star Jayne Mansfield. The film argues against the common portrayal of Mansfield as merely a "dime-store" Marilyn Monroe, instead highlighting her intelligence, talent, and ambition to be a serious actress. It explores how she strategically navigated the restrictive 1950s studio system, using her bombshell persona as a means to an end. The documentary serves as both an affectionate tribute and a critical look at how Hollywood's narrow view of female stardom ultimately limited her career.</p>

          <p>In the wake of deadly flash floods in Texas and other states, water rescue experts stress that survival often depends more on luck and prior preparation than on actions taken once caught in the torrent. They warn that just six inches of fast-moving water can sweep an adult away, and the primary danger is not just drowning but also trauma from debris. Experts advise having a weather radio, understanding warning levels, and immediately seeking high ground if a warning is issued. For drivers, the advice is unequivocal: never attempt to cross a flooded road, a situation often summarized as "Turn around, don't drown."</p>

          <p>Mount Rainier in Washington is experiencing a notable "earthquake swarm," with hundreds of small tremors detected since early Tuesday, marking the most significant seismic activity at the volcano in over 15 years. The U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory has stated that there is no cause for concern, as the earthquakes are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause damage. Scientists believe the swarm, which is a common occurrence at the active volcano, is likely caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust, not by rising magma.</p>

A top admiral stated the visit demonstrates U.S. presence and reassures allies in the strategically vital area.

          <p>Former New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning has stated he is no longer interested in purchasing a minority stake in the team, primarily because skyrocketing NFL franchise valuations have made it "too expensive." Manning noted that with team valuations potentially reaching $10 billion, even a small percentage represents a very large investment. This comes as several NFL teams have recently sold minority stakes at record-high valuations. Manning, who has various business ventures including a private equity partnership, said he still plans to remain actively involved with the Giants organization in an advisory capacity.</p>
