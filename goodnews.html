          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words this year, including several terms popularized by internet and social media culture. Among the new entries are "skibidi," a gibberish term from a viral YouTube series, and "tradwife," a shorthand for a traditional wife who promotes a domestic lifestyle online. Other additions reflect modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device used to feign activity while working remotely. Lexicographers note that the rapid evolution of internet culture is having a fascinating and observable effect on the English language.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously known as the last country without a national soccer team, has officially made its international debut in a tournament held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese population, which provided enthusiastic support for the new team. Despite losing their opening matches, the team celebrated scoring its first-ever international goals, and the community expressed immense pride in finally having a team to represent them on the global stage. The event marks a significant cultural milestone for the small island nation and its diaspora.</p>

          <p>A Minnesota fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick, potentially solving the nearly 60-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. Authorities recovered the severely deteriorated vehicle and found human remains inside. The car's vehicle identification number confirmed it belonged to Benn, who was reported missing in September 1967 at the age of 59. While the remains await formal identification, investigators believe they belong to Benn, and his remaining family has been notified, bringing them closer to long-awaited closure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent column titled "Against Polling" by John Ganz has sparked a debate about the Democratic Party's reliance on political data and consultants. The column argues that polling is largely unreliable and that Democrats should focus more on historical context and bold rhetoric rather than data-driven strategies often described as "popularism." In response, this article defends the use of empirical data, asserting that while flawed, polling remains the most effective tool for understanding voter sentiment. The author contends that dismissing data wholesale risks allowing ideological bias to dictate electoral strategy, potentially harming the party's chances of winning.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is navigating a complex political path, balancing his identity as a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) with the need to appeal to a broader electorate. The article details his deep connection to the DSA, which he credits for his political rise, while also noting his recent efforts to engage with mainstream Democratic figures like Elizabeth Warren and Barack Obama. Mamdani's challenge is to leverage the organizational power of the socialist movement while transcending its more divisive ideological elements to govern a city of 8.5 million people.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk rose nearly 5% following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval of its popular drug, Wegovy, for treating a serious liver disease. The condition, known as MASH, affects an estimated 5% of U.S. adults. This new authorization expands Wegovy's use beyond its well-known applications for obesity and diabetes, making it the first GLP-1 class drug approved for this liver condition. The approval strengthens the drug's market position and highlights its potential cardiovascular and metabolic health benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing to evacuate an initial group of 30 to 50 critically ill and injured Palestinian children from Gaza for medical care in the coming weeks. This marks the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the conflict, involving the Foreign Office, Home Office, and Department of Health. The children, selected based on medical need, will be treated by the NHS. The move follows a letter from a cross-party group of 96 MPs urging the government to act without delay to save children at risk due to the collapse of Gaza's healthcare system.</p>

          <p>Pierre Poilievre, leader of Canada's Conservative party, is running in a crucial special by-election in the rural Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot to regain a seat in the House of Commons. Poilievre lost his own Ottawa-area riding in the last general election, which saw his party defeated by the Liberals. He is widely expected to win in the conservative stronghold, but his margin of victory will be closely watched as a measure of his leadership strength ahead of a mandatory party review in January. The election comes as the new Prime Minister, Mark Carney, enjoys a post-election honeymoon period with the public.</p>

          <p>Chinese semiconductor company Cambricon Technologies is set to raise nearly 4 billion yuan (US$560 million) to advance its artificial intelligence chip development. The fundraising plan has been approved by the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is seen as a significant step in China's broader campaign for technological self-sufficiency. Cambricon is considered a key domestic challenger to U.S. giant Nvidia, and its stock price has nearly tripled over the past year amid strong investor confidence and government directives for publicly owned computing hubs to source more chips from local producers.

          <p>The city of Helsinki, Finland, has successfully recorded zero traffic-related deaths over the last year, a significant achievement for a city of its size. Officials attribute this success to the "Vision Zero" program, which implements smart city planning focused on safety. Key measures include reducing speed limits to 30 km/h (18.6 mph) on most city streets, redesigning infrastructure to protect pedestrians and cyclists, and using data analytics to identify and fix dangerous intersections. This proactive approach to traffic management serves as a model for other major cities aiming to eliminate road fatalities.</p>

          <p>In a potential breakthrough for treating neuropsychiatric disorders, Chinese scientists have successfully converted human stem cells into dopamine-producing neurons and transplanted them into mice. The research, published in Cell Stem Cell, found that the grafted cells helped reduce depressive behaviors like anxiety and anhedonia (the inability to feel pleasure) in the test subjects. This proof-of-concept study suggests that cell therapy could one day be used to repair dysfunctional neural circuits in the human brain that are associated with mood regulation, offering a new avenue for treating conditions like major depressive disorder.</p>

          <p>On his new podcast, former footballer Wayne Rooney shared an anecdote from the infamous 2004 "Pizzagate" match that ended Arsenal's 49-game unbeaten streak. Rooney revealed that his former England teammate, Sol Campbell, refused to speak to him for six months following the game. The silence stemmed from a controversial penalty Rooney won after a challenge from Campbell, which led to Manchester United's first goal in their 2-0 victory. Rooney stated that Campbell was convinced he had dived, leading to a prolonged period of animosity between the two, even during international duty.</p>
