          <p>Villanova University was placed on high alert after receiving reports of an active shooter on its law school campus, prompting a massive law enforcement response. The university president later confirmed that the incident was a "cruel hoax," and that no shooter, firearms, or injuries were found on the premises. While the community was relieved that no one was harmed, the event caused significant fear and disruption, with students and staff ordered to shelter in place for hours while police conducted thorough sweeps of the buildings. An investigation into the source of the false report is underway.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are seeking to revise the country's 28-year-old pricing law to address "involution," a term for destructive, cutthroat competition that has plagued industries like solar panel manufacturing. The proposed amendment, now open for public feedback, aims to curb practices such as selling products at a loss simply to gain market share, which has led to significant industry-wide financial damage. This regulatory move is intended to restore a "sustainable equilibrium" in the market, where severe oversupply and homogenization of products have forced many companies into unsustainable price wars, stifling innovation and profitability in key sectors of the economy.</p>

For fans, it was a bittersweet night celebrating a new chapter of European football for the first time in nearly three decades while simultaneously preparing to bid farewell to a key player.

The club will allow supporters who purchased a Mihailović jersey to exchange it for a new one, featuring either the newly acquired star Paxten Aaronson or another player. Mihailović requested the trade for "personal reasons" but later implied his new team had a greater commitment to winning, surprising fans of the Rapids, who are having their best season in years. The jersey swap is a move to acknowledge fan loyalty during the transition.</p>

          <p>Enterprise software company Workday reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue growing 13% year-over-year. Despite the positive results, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading as its guidance for the upcoming quarter was merely in line with estimates. CEO Carl Eschenbach also warned of challenges ahead, citing a funding slowdown for state and local government clients and pressure on higher education institutions. The company also announced its acquisition of Paradox, a conversational AI recruiting software firm, as it continues to integrate artificial intelligence into its product offerings.

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeast into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina shoreline. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it generated life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the East Coast, prompting warnings and evacuation orders for parts of the Outer Banks. Tropical storm warnings remain in effect for coastal North Carolina and Virginia, as well as Bermuda. Forecasters expect Erin to gradually weaken over the next few days and transition into a post-tropical cyclone by the weekend.</p>

          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining popularity among wealthy investors as a way to manage large, unrealized profits in their taxable accounts. This method allows them to exchange appreciated assets, like stocks from a separately managed account, for shares in a new or existing exchange-traded fund (ETF) without immediately triggering capital gains taxes. While financial advisors describe the tax deferral as "like magic," the process has strict diversification requirements and high investment minimums, often starting at $1 million. The strategy also locks investors into the specific ETF, limiting future flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

Dunst, whose career began at age three, has several upcoming projects with renowned directors but is also open to joining a major commercial franchise. Her highest-grossing film remains 2007's "Spider-Man 3," which earned nearly $900 million worldwide.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent market behavior indicates a potential shift in how investors react to signals of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, with value-oriented stocks benefiting more than high-growth tech names. Traditionally, lower rates boost the valuation of tech stocks with high future earnings potential. However, the current focus appears to be on near-term earnings revisions, where cyclical companies like Home Depot stand to gain more directly from lower borrowing costs and increased economic activity. In contrast, the growth of AI-related stocks is less dependent on minor changes in the federal funds rate, leading to profit-taking in that sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newly released public records reveal that protests targeting Los Angeles hotels where immigration agents were staying during raids this summer prompted U.S. military officials to compile a list of "LA Hotels to Avoid." Activists organized "No sleep for ICE" rallies outside several hotels, successfully pressuring some establishments to ask the agents to leave. The documents, obtained by a government transparency group, show military and law enforcement agencies sharing intelligence to find accommodations where federal personnel would not be "harassed." The records suggest the community-led protests effectively disrupted the Trump administration's immigration crackdown in the region.</p>
