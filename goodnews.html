          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a crucial 6-2 victory over the Seattle Mariners in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series, forcing a decisive Game 7. Addison Barger's early single and later two-run home run fueled Toronto's offense, while Vladimir Guerrero Jr. also contributed with a solo home run. Despite opportunities, the Mariners struggled to capitalize, squandering bases-loaded situations. Trey Yesavage's strong pitching performance with seven strikeouts aided the Blue Jays. The final game will determine which team advances to the World Series, a title the Blue Jays haven't held since 1993 and the Mariners have never achieved. </p>

          <p>China's economy grew by 4.8% in the third quarter, meeting analyst forecasts, despite a slump in the real estate sector. Fixed-asset investment unexpectedly contracted, raising concerns about downward pressure on fourth-quarter GDP growth. Retail sales rose, but slowed compared to August, while industrial production exceeded expectations. China's exports remained resilient, but headline inflation fell, signaling persistent deflationary pressures. (not investment advice) </p>

Participants carried signs and banners, and some events featured marching bands and costumes, creating a street party atmosphere. Organizers claimed the rallies drew more people than previous events, fueled by outrage over immigration policies, attacks on the media, and perceived authoritarian actions. While Republicans criticized the demonstrations as "Hate America" rallies, participants asserted their love for the country and desire to fight for its values. </p>

Paz defeated right-wing former President Jorge Quiroga, securing over 54% of the vote in preliminary results. Paz pledged to restore Bolivia's international role and address the country's economic crisis, including a shortage of US dollars and high inflation. Both candidates had promised to pivot away from populist economic policies and attract foreign investment, but differed on approaches to handling the economy, with Paz favoring tackling corruption over seeking IMF assistance. </p>

He notes that the cost of LiDAR systems has significantly decreased, while their performance has increased.
