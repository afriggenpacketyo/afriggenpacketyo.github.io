          <p>An expert estimates that federal direct undergraduate loan interest rates could slightly decrease to 6.39% for the 2025-2026 academic year, compared to the current 6.53%. Graduate student loans may see a similar drop to 7.94%, and PLUS loans for graduate students and parents could decrease to 8.94%. These rates, set annually by the government, are based on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note, which had a high yield rate of 4.34% this year. The article explains how these rates impact monthly payments and overall repayment amounts for borrowers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services has granted an exemption to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to hire a new class of Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS) officers, averting a potential halving of the program. EIS officers, known as "disease detectives," are crucial for investigating outbreaks and responding to health emergencies. The decision comes amid a sweeping federal hiring freeze that has significantly hampered the CDC's ability to add new staff. The article notes that the fate of the program had worried CDC officials, especially with a June 30 start date looming for the incoming officers.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve pausing interest rate hikes, homeowners considering borrowing against their equity face a choice between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Historically, home equity loans were preferred during rate pauses due to their fixed interest rates, but with potential rate cuts on the horizon, HELOCs may become more attractive due to their variable rates. Currently, HELOC rates are lower than home equity loan rates, offering potential savings, but borrowers must be prepared for fluctuating payments as rates change. The article advises borrowers to carefully compare both options before applying.</p>
