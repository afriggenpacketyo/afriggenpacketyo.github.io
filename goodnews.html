          <p>A Nigerian Doctor Who fan, Adesoji Kukoyi, expressed his excitement about the show's upcoming episode set in Lagos, Nigeria, marking the first time the series is primarily set in Africa. Kukoyi, who has been a fan since childhood, described the moment he saw the preview as screaming "like a little girl." The episode is significant for the show as well, with scriptwriter Inua Ellams reflecting on why it has taken 62 years for the Doctor to spend significant time in Africa, suggesting it may be due to a lack of writers confident enough to create an authentic African story.</p>
