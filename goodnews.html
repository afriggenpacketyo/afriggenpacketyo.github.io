          <p>According to U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff, Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed during his summit with President Trump to allow the U.S. and its allies to offer Ukraine a security guarantee similar to NATO's Article 5. Witkoff described the concession as "game-changing," as it could provide a workaround to Russia's long-standing objection to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy acknowledged the development but stated that the details of how such a guarantee would work in practice remain unclear.</p>

Meanwhile, Singapore's non-oil domestic exports shrank more than expected in July, indicating some regional economic headwinds.

          <p>In a recent interview, actress Dame Helen Mirren asserted that the iconic character of James Bond should continue to be played by a man. Despite identifying as a feminist, she believes that casting a woman in the role would fundamentally change the character into "something else." Her sentiment was echoed by former 007 actor Pierce Brosnan, who also expressed his belief that a male actor should continue to portray the famous spy in the long-running film franchise.</p>

          <p>A court-ordered ban on feeding pigeons in public spaces in Mumbai has ignited a fierce debate, pitting public health advocates against animal lovers and religious communities. Authorities imposed the ban due to health hazards associated with pigeon droppings, which can spread disease. However, the move has led to protests, particularly from the Jain community, for whom feeding birds is a deeply ingrained religious and cultural practice. The conflict underscores the challenge of balancing modern public health concerns with long-standing traditions.</p>
