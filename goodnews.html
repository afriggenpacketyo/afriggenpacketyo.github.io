        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in popularity for matcha, driven by social media trends and its reputation as a superfood, has led to significant shortages and price increases, even in its native Japan. Japanese producers are struggling to meet the demand due to labor-intensive farming methods and an aging workforce, causing supply chain bottlenecks. Retailers are implementing purchase limits, and major companies like Ito En are creating dedicated divisions to manage the crisis, while some experts suggest educating consumers on different matcha grades could alleviate pressure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's education secretary, Bridget Phillipson, has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. Citing BBC analysis, she noted that students missing school in the first week are significantly more likely to become persistently absent, a problem that has worsened since the COVID-19 pandemic. The government is implementing support programs like attendance hubs, though head teachers' unions argue that more resources are needed to address underlying issues like student mental health and anxiety.</p>

          <p>In a significant development for China's commercial space industry, Beijing-based CAS Space successfully launched two small satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup. The mission, which placed two "femtosatellites" weighing less than 100 grams each into orbit, marks a rare entry for China into the North American commercial launch market. The satellites aim to demonstrate the viability of smaller, more accessible space technology, with plans to engage students and amateur users across Mexico through low-cost receiving stations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Britain experiences increasingly hotter summers, the demand for home air conditioning is rising, prompting a debate over its environmental, financial, and health impacts. While providing relief and improving productivity, air conditioners consume significant electricity and use hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), potent greenhouse gases. Experts advise consumers to choose energy-efficient models and dispose of them properly, while also highlighting that well-maintained units can improve air quality, though poorly maintained ones pose health risks like spreading bacteria.</p>

          <p>An analysis suggests that Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is well-positioned for significant growth, potentially reaching a $2 trillion market capitalization. The company is central to the production of cutting-edge technology, particularly AI chips, and has demonstrated strong revenue growth. Despite its market dominance and a bullish long-term outlook from management, the article notes that TSMC's stock trades at a relatively low forward earnings multiple compared to its peers, suggesting it may be undervalued.

          <p>Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from England's Euro 2025 squad as the "best decision I have ever made," stating she was on the verge of a mental breakdown. The 32-year-old, who captained the Lionesses to the World Cup final, felt she could not give 100% after an intense season where she helped her club win a domestic treble. Bright revealed she had been ignoring ongoing issues and, after the season ended, realized she needed a break to prioritize her mental and physical well-being.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it") declaration, which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy has had a profound and lasting impact on German society, politics, and culture. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of the refugees who arrived then had found employment by 2022, challenges remain, with migrants facing higher unemployment rates, and the political debate over immigration continues to be a central issue in the country.</p>

          <p>In an innovative approach to wildlife management, biologists with the USDA are experimenting with drones to protect cattle from gray wolves near the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and clips of Scarlett Johansson's voice to haze the predators and interrupt hunts. This nonlethal method is part of an effort to find new ways for ranchers and the recovering wolf population to coexist, though the high cost and potential for wolves to become habituated remain challenges.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old British Formula 1 enthusiast, Brandon Burgess, is undertaking a challenge to attend every one of the 24 Grand Prix races this season on a strict budget of £20,000. By using only his 28 days of annual leave and finding cost-saving measures like staying in hostels, he aims to prove that following the sport across the globe can be more accessible. While he is currently on track financially, Burgess faces the most expensive "flyaway" leg of the season, which will test his budget and logistical planning to the limit.</p>
