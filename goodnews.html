          <h2>Argument Emerges for Clayton Kershaw as the Greatest Pitcher in Dodgers History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 00:17:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his 3,000th career strikeout, a new column argues that Clayton Kershaw has solidified his status as the greatest pitcher in the history of the Los Angeles Dodgers, surpassing even the legendary Sandy Koufax. The case for Kershaw rests on his remarkable longevity and endurance over 18 seasons, contrasting with Koufax's brilliant but shorter five-year peak. While acknowledging Kershaw's postseason struggles, the article points to his superior career stats in wins, ERA, and winning percentage over a much larger sample size. It concludes that Kershaw's consistent professionalism and sustained excellence make him the franchise's most impactful pitcher.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export restrictions on semiconductor design software to China, as confirmed by leading software firms Synopsys and Cadence. The reversal allows these companies, along with Siemens EDA, to resume providing their products and technology to Chinese customers. These three companies dominate the global electronic design automation (EDA) market, which is crucial for chip manufacturing. The move, which follows a period of required licensing for such exports, is seen as part of a broader, tentative trade truce between the two nations, which have also signaled progress on resuming exchanges of rare earths and other advanced technologies.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw achieved a historic milestone, becoming just the 20th player in Major League Baseball history to record 3,000 career strikeouts. The moment occurred during the sixth inning of a game against the Chicago White Sox, as Kershaw struck out Vinny Capra with an 84-mph slider. The achievement places him in an elite group, as he is only the fourth left-handed pitcher to reach this mark and one of only two in the last century to do so with a single team. The game was paused as Kershaw received a standing ovation and was congratulated by teammates.</p>

          <p>Armenia is actively working to deepen its relationship with China as it diversifies its foreign policy beyond its traditional reliance on Russia. During a visit to Beijing, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated there are no obstacles to elevating bilateral ties to a strategic partnership. This diplomatic pivot follows Armenia's frustration with Russia's inaction during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and subsequent conflicts with Azerbaijan. As a result, Armenia announced its withdrawal from the Moscow-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation, signaling a significant shift in its geopolitical alignment and an increased focus on building new alliances.</p>

          <p>With a slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the possibility of a tie vote on legislation has become more relevant. Unlike the Senate, where the Vice President can cast a tie-breaking vote, the House has no such mechanism. According to House rules, if a vote on any question results in a tie, the measure is considered defeated and does not pass. This scenario was highlighted in a recent vote where a few party defections nearly led to a tie, demonstrating how narrow margins can impact legislative outcomes and empower small groups of dissenting members within the majority party.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's IPO market is experiencing a significant revival, positioning it to potentially become the world's top listing destination this year. This surge is driven by Chinese companies seeking to raise capital, spurred by regulatory support from Beijing and a more favorable market environment. Factors like muted A-share listings in mainland China and concerns over potential U.S. delistings are also compelling firms to turn to Hong Kong. The influx of mainland investors has further bolstered market liquidity, contributing to a robust first half of the year for new listings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has struck down a Trump administration policy that effectively banned migrants who cross the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that neither the Constitution nor existing immigration law allows for such a unilateral suspension of asylum rights. The executive order, issued on President Trump's first day in office, had been challenged by several immigrant rights groups. The judge stayed his decision for 14 days to give the administration time to appeal the ruling.</p>
