          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, starting with his attendance at the WellChild charity awards in London. During his visit, he paid respects to the late Queen Elizabeth II on the third anniversary of her death by laying a wreath at her burial site. The Prince's visit has fueled speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, whom he has not seen in person since the King's cancer diagnosis was announced. His itinerary also includes visits to Nottingham and Imperial College London, while his wife Meghan and their children remain in California.</p>

          <p>The technology sector is seeing support as the 10-year Treasury yield continues to decline following a weak August jobs report, boosting stocks like Broadcom and Nvidia. This article analyzes the market dynamics, noting that while Nvidia has faced concerns about competition, there is likely sufficient demand for both major AI chipmakers. Separately, BlackRock's acquisition of $80 billion in client assets from Citigroup is seen as a positive development, estimated to add at least 25 cents to its adjusted earnings per share. The report also touches on a Meta Platforms partnership with Anduril for a U.S. Army contract. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is scheduled to join President Donald Trump on a state visit to the United Kingdom next week, along with other prominent U.S. business leaders. This move highlights the strategic importance for Nvidia of maintaining a strong relationship with the administration, particularly as the company seeks new licenses to sell its advanced AI chips in China. Huang has actively engaged with the White House, arguing that allowing Nvidia to export its technology is beneficial for U.S. leadership in the AI race. The visit underscores the ongoing dialogue between the tech industry and the government regarding trade and national security.</p>

Instead of depicting Newcastle and the River Tyne, the route of the race, the items showed the nearby city of Sunderland and the River Wear. Approximately 60,000 participants received the erroneous medals. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company admitted the mistake, joking that it made the items a unique keepsake and a celebration of the entire region, albeit an unintentional one.

The investment, led by Peter Thiel's Founders Fund, comes just two months after Cognition acquired Windsurf, another AI startup that had recently seen its founders depart for Google. Cognition's CEO stated that the company's annual recurring revenue has more than doubled since the acquisition, highlighting rapid growth. This valuation places Cognition among the top-tier AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic, signaling strong investor confidence in its technology and market position.</p>

          <p>A program at Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing free doula services to expectant mothers in the Baltimore area, aiming to create a more supportive birth experience. The Birth Companions program, now in its 27th year, trains nursing students to offer emotional, physical, and informational support during labor and delivery. These student doulas act as advocates for patients, bridging the gap with medical staff without replacing them. The initiative has become more accessible following a new Maryland law requiring hospitals to allow certified doulas to be present during childbirth, enhancing care options for mothers.</p>

          <p>A business-led campaign to repeal a new law setting a $30 per hour minimum wage for Los Angeles hotel and airport workers has failed to gather enough valid signatures to qualify for the ballot. The city clerk confirmed the referendum fell short by approximately 9,000 signatures. The ordinance, which was approved by the City Council in May, mandates phased wage increases culminating in a $30 minimum wage by July 2028. Labor organizers hailed the failure of the repeal effort as a significant victory for working people against corporate interests, ensuring the wage increases can now proceed as planned.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Water District is offering a substantial incentive for Southern California businesses, schools, and public institutions to remove nonfunctional lawns. A new rebate program provides $7 per square foot for replacing grass with sustainable, water-efficient landscapes, more than doubling the previous offer. The initiative is funded by state and federal grants and aims to prepare large water users for a 2027 state law prohibiting the use of potable water on purely ornamental turf. To qualify, projects must include features like stormwater retention and a minimum number of drought-tolerant plants, promoting both water conservation and biodiversity.</p>

          <p>Despite England's consistent success in World Cup and European Championship qualifiers, this article reflects on the often dull and predictable nature of these matches. With only four World Cup qualifying losses in 30 years, England's path to major tournaments is typically smooth but lacks the excitement and jeopardy of high-stakes games. The analysis notes that while this routine success is the primary goal, it rarely produces memorable moments for fans, who often face inferior opposition playing defensively. The piece suggests that these games feel more like an obligation before the real test begins at the tournaments themselves.</p>

          <p>Two independent audit reports commissioned by the disaster-relief charity FireAid have found no evidence of misused funds, concluding that aid is reaching communities affected by recent wildfires. The organization, which raised nearly $100 million, faced scrutiny from politicians and residents over its grant-making process. An independent review by the law firm Latham & Watkins affirmed that FireAid acted according to its mission and had strong accountability measures. The reports clarify that funds were distributed to established local nonprofits capable of swift disaster response, rather than as direct cash payments to individuals, which was consistent with the charity's stated purpose.</p>

Feltwell said he gave her the ball to de-escalate the situation, which involved vulgar language in front of his children. In a positive turn, both the Phillies and the opposing Miami Marlins provided Lincoln with souvenirs, including a signed bat from the player who hit the home run.</p>

The Texas winner will not owe any state income tax on their winnings, while the Missouri winner will face an additional state tax withholding of at least 4%, potentially costing them over $16 million from the lump sum payment.</p>
