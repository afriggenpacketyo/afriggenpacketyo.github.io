          <p>AI search startup Perplexity has submitted an unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome browser, a figure exceeding its own current valuation. The move is reportedly backed by several investors and comes after the Department of Justice recommended Google divest Chrome following an antitrust ruling that found the company held an illegal search monopoly. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered answer engine, sees the acquisition as a strategic move to level the playing field for search competitors. This follows other ambitious proposals from the startup, including a merger with TikTok.</p>

          <p>A new report from JLL suggests that the rapid advancement of quantum computing is set to create a significant new demand for specialized commercial real estate, similar to the data center boom driven by AI. As quantum technology becomes commercially viable, it requires unique facilities with features like electromagnetic shielding, distinct from traditional data centers. The industry is projected to attract billions in investment by 2030, with emerging hubs located near research centers in places like Chicago, Boston, and Southern California. This trend presents a new, long-term opportunity for real estate development and investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker is set to sign the Sonya Massey Act, a new law mandating more thorough background checks for police officer candidates. The legislation was inspired by the 2024 shooting death of Sonya Massey by a sheriff's deputy who had a documented history of misconduct in previous law enforcement roles. Under the new law, agencies cannot make a final hiring offer without inspecting a candidate's complete prior employment records, including performance and disciplinary history. This reform aims to prevent officers with problematic pasts from being hired by different departments within the state.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index for July indicated that inflation held steady, rising 2.7% year-over-year, which was slightly below economists' forecasts. However, core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased to 3.1%, its highest level in five months. Food prices continued to climb, causing stress for many households, while gasoline prices fell. Despite core inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, analysts believe the overall data is not alarming enough to prevent a potential interest rate cut in September.

          <p>For retirees seeking financial security amidst market volatility, annuities can provide a guaranteed income stream, but their safety depends on several factors in the current economic climate. The financial strength of the issuing insurance company is paramount, as annuities are not FDIC-insured. While state guarantee associations offer some protection, it is limited. It's also crucial to consider how different annuity types carry different risks and how the current interest rate environment and long-term inflation can erode the purchasing power of fixed payments over time.

          <p>While President Trump has the authority under the D.C. Home Rule Act to temporarily federalize the city's police force during a self-declared emergency, that power has a significant legal limit. The statute explicitly states that such control cannot extend beyond 30 days unless Congress passes a joint resolution to authorize an extension. Legal experts note that while the president has broad discretion to determine if an emergency exists, the 30-day cap is a firm restriction. Any attempt by the president to unilaterally extend his control would likely face a strong legal challenge.</p>

          <p>For investors seeking stability, a high-yield certificate of deposit (CD) can be an attractive option, and a $100,000 deposit can earn significant interest at current rates. Depending on the term length, which can range from three months to five years, savers could earn anywhere from approximately $1,000 to over $22,000. Because CD rates are fixed, they offer predictable returns without the volatility of the stock market. This makes them a potentially valuable tool for securing principal while generating guaranteed interest, though savers should consider the trade-off of locking up their funds.
