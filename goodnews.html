          <p>Asia-Pacific markets showed a generally positive trend as investors reacted to Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation amidst growing pressure from his national election defeat. Japan's Nikkei 225 index experienced a 1.5% increase following the announcement, while the Topix index reached a record high, climbing 1%. Potential successors such as Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae are being considered, with Takaichi's deregulation stance being particularly well-received by the market. Meanwhile, analysts from BMI anticipate a period of uncertainty in Japan leading into Q4 2025, as the country navigates persistent inflation and tighter monetary policies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following an immigration raid at a Hyundai Motor facility in Georgia where numerous South Koreans were detained, President Trump addressed foreign companies, asserting the necessity of respecting U.S. immigration laws. He encouraged these companies to legally bring in skilled workers and, in return, hire and train American workers. Trump stated he would examine the situation, emphasizing the importance of legal immigration while also suggesting a need for foreign experts to train Americans in specialized fields. The incident has potentially strained relations between the U.S. and South Korea, as the latter expresses concern over the treatment of its citizens.</p>

          <p>In the season opener against the Seattle Seahawks, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy connected with backup tight end Jake Tonges for a crucial touchdown in the fourth quarter, securing a 17-13 victory. Tonges stepped up after George Kittle's early exit due to a hamstring injury, making a remarkable catch in the end zone with a defender closely guarding him. Nick Bosa's strip-sack on Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold sealed the win for the 49ers, while Purdy finished with 277 passing yards and two touchdowns, despite a roller-coaster performance. Ricky Pearsall led the way with 108 receiving yards.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open victory, defeating Jannik Sinner in a match that experienced delays due to enhanced security measures for President Trump's attendance. Trump's presence at the event, his first U.S. Open appearance in a decade, drew mixed reactions from the crowd, with reports indicating that broadcasters were asked to minimize showcasing any disruptions. The U.S. Tennis Association had issued guidance to broadcasters to edit out any crowd reaction to the president. Alcaraz's win was a four-set victory over Italy's Jannik Sinner, winning his second U.S. Open at Arthur Ashe Stadium.</p>

          <p>The General Secretary of the TUC, Paul Nowak, is calling on the Labour government to demonstrate its support for working-class communities, arguing that their promise of change has not yet become a reality. He is urging the government to make political choices that will persuade voters it is on their side, including lifting the two-child benefit cap, funded by new taxes on wealth. Unite union leader Sharon Graham has warned that her union may sever its financial ties with Labour if standards of living don't improve, with Reform UK predicted to be the main beneficiary.</p>

A falling U.S. dollar and expectations of easier monetary policy are spurring inflows to Asian equities and debt funds.
