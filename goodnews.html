          <p>President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump attended the opening performance of "Les Mis√©rables" at the Kennedy Center, receiving a mix of cheers and boos from the audience. Videos circulating on social media showed that while some attendees booed, their voices were quickly drowned out by cheers and chants of "USA" from the president's supporters. There were also attendees dressed in drag, a symbolic gesture considering Trump's previous social media posts about "NO MORE DRAG SHOWS, OR OTHER ANTI-AMERICAN PROPAGANDA." This event marked Trump's first attendance at a Kennedy Center performance since becoming its chairman and restructuring the board. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not significantly increased inflation, as recent consumer and producer price indexes remain stable. This is attributed to three main factors: companies stockpiling imported goods before the tariff announcement, the time it takes for tariffs to impact the economy, and limited pricing power due to cautious consumer spending. Economists expect the impact of tariffs to become more evident in the coming months, but these initial factors have kept inflation in check. Aichi Amemiya, a senior economist at Nomura, suggests that the limited impact in May reflects pre-tariff stockpiling and a delayed pass-through of tariffs into import prices.

          <p>A crash involving an Air India jet occurs as the airline undergoes a major revamp under the Tata Group's ownership. Founded in 1932, Air India was nationalized in 1953 and later returned to the Tata Group in 2022. The Tata Group has been working to revive the airline by ordering new jets and upgrading its existing fleet. The company has consolidated its airlines into a combined Air India Group, which is now the second-biggest airline in India in terms of passenger numbers.</p>
