          <p>Wise, a British money transfer firm, announced its plan to move its primary listing location to the U.S., which is a significant setback for the London Stock Exchange.

This move would allow Wise's shares to be traded on both a U.S. stock exchange and the LSE. Shares of Wise experienced a 7% increase during early morning trading following the announcement.

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has warned women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro to use effective contraception due to potential risks to unborn babies. The MHRA advises using contraception while taking these GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward, ranging from one to two months depending on the specific drug. Women using Mounjaro and oral contraceptives should also use condoms for four weeks after starting the drug or switch to another contraceptive method. The MHRA is concerned that the increasing popularity of these drugs means many women aren't using them safely or receiving proper advice. The article highlights the importance of consulting with prescribers about the risks and benefits of these medications.</p>

          <p>Three unexploded U.S. bombs from World War II were successfully defused in Cologne, Germany, after the city's largest evacuation since the end of the war. More than 20,000 residents were evacuated from the city center following the discovery of the bombs during road construction preparations. Experts managed to defuse the bombs within approximately one hour, according to city authorities. Unexploded bombs from wartime air raids are frequently found in Germany, necessitating large-scale precautionary evacuations, though this particular location was unusually prominent near Cologne's historic center.</p>
