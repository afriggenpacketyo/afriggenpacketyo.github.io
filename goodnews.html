          <p>Nintendo has reported record sales of over 3.5 million units for its new Switch 2 console in the first four days following its launch, surpassing initial expectations and setting a new benchmark for the company. This performance positions the Switch 2 favorably to meet its target of selling 15 million units within the fiscal year ending March 2026. The enthusiastic response from fans worldwide indicates the upgraded console's appeal as a versatile gaming system for both home and on-the-go use. Despite the positive sales figures, Nintendo's stock experienced a slight dip, but overall, the company has seen significant growth since the original Switch's debut. The new console's success hinges on maintaining the momentum of its predecessor, which became one of Nintendo's best-selling devices. Optimism surrounding the console's future is high due to its innovative features and strong market demand.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Asian countries are increasingly moving away from reliance on the U.S. dollar due to geopolitical uncertainties and a desire to reduce FX risks. This trend, known as de-dollarization, is driven by concerns that the dollar could be used as leverage in trade negotiations or sanctions. ASEAN nations are promoting the use of local currencies in trade and investment, while the BRICS nations are developing alternative payment systems to bypass traditional dollar-dependent systems like SWIFT. Countries with substantial foreign assets, such as Singapore and South Korea, are also exploring repatriating earnings to their home currencies, further contributing to the de-dollarization trend. The dollar's dominance is gradually being challenged as Asian economies seek greater financial autonomy.</p>

          <p>Zara's parent company, Inditex, announced weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and indicated a slower start to the summer season compared to the previous year. First-quarter revenues fell slightly short of analyst expectations, and summer sales growth slowed to 6% compared to 12% in the same period last year. The company attributed the slowdown to broader economic uncertainty and previous concerns about U.S. tariffs. Despite the slower growth, Inditex continues to navigate a challenging retail environment.</p>

          <p>A recent report by PwC suggests that the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence may diminish the value of formal college degrees. The report indicates that employer demand for degrees is declining faster in AI-exposed fields, as AI tools enable individuals to acquire expert knowledge more rapidly. Skills are becoming more critical than degrees, particularly in occupations heavily influenced by AI, and workers are encouraged to upskill in AI to future-proof their careers. This shift could democratize opportunities for those who lack the resources for formal education.</p>

Both versions retain Bach's original musical style but introduce new texts and instrumentation to reflect their respective themes.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani took a significant step toward his pitching comeback, striking out six in three simulated innings. Ohtani has been off the mound since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. While a return before the All-Star break is uncertain, manager Dave Roberts indicated a possibility. Ohtani's fastball was clocked at 96 miles per hour, and he used all his pitches effectively, demonstrating command and control during the practice session.</p>
