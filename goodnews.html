          <p>The SEC has dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, concluding one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions by the agency. The original complaint, filed in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds, as well as enabling trading in unregistered securities. This dismissal marks a symbolic end to aggressive crypto crackdowns and coincides with the Trump administration's efforts to support the crypto industry. Binance is also deepening its involvement in Pakistan, with Zhao advising the country's Crypto Council. (not investment advice)</p>

The mother and child, the first grandchild of the crown prince and the first great-grandchild of former Emperor Akihito, are reported to be in good health. Japanese law stipulates that female members of the imperial family forfeit their royal status upon marrying commoners, thus Mako no longer holds her title.</p>

          <p>Erica Benner, a political philosopher, challenges the popular view of Niccol√≤ Machiavelli as a proponent of ruthless pragmatism, arguing that his work, particularly "The Prince," is a veiled critique of authoritarian power. Benner suggests that Machiavelli was deeply republican and concerned with the health of democracies, emphasizing the dangers of inequality and the importance of appearance over truth. She argues that Machiavelli's focus was on understanding human nature to create a politics that allows people to coexist, rather than advocating for cruelty.

          <p>India's economy grew at an annual rate of 7.4% in the quarter ending in March, surpassing expectations despite global economic uncertainties. This marks the strongest quarterly growth in the government's fiscal year 2025, with the full fiscal year expanding by 6.5%. The robust growth is attributed to strong domestic consumption and a relatively lower dependence on exports, which has cushioned the impact of U.S. trade policies. While the U.S. imposed tariffs on goods imported from India, these were later reduced to allow for deal negotiations.</p>

If the standard model is incorrect, it could significantly alter our understanding of the universe's fate, potentially changing the dominant theory of heat death.

          <p>ECB President Christine Lagarde believes that the shifting geopolitical landscape presents an opportunity for the euro to gain greater international prominence. She cited a decline in multilateral cooperation and increasing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. dollar's dominance as factors that could favor the euro. Lagarde emphasized the need for Europe to strengthen its geopolitical, economic, and legal foundations to support the euro's rise. Market watchers are divided on the euro's potential to challenge the dollar, with some seeing upside for the euro as investors seek to diversify away from the greenback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump is celebrating a partnership between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel in Pittsburgh, despite initially opposing the sale. The deal is expected to add $14 billion to the U.S. economy and create 70,000 jobs, and details regarding the deal are expected to be announced during Trump's speech. Elon Musk is stepping down as the leader of the Department of Government Efficiency following legal challenges and clashes, and he will join Trump for a final press conference. Despite Musk's departure, DOGE may continue to restructure the government with its data collection and workforce downsizing efforts.</p>
