        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to the Sizewell C nuclear power plant project, aiming to lower energy bills and enhance energy independence. The project, expected to take at least 10 years to complete, will generate enough power for six million homes and create 10,000 jobs during construction and 900 permanent positions. The investment is intended to attract further private funding and boost economic growth, with the plant expected to operate for 60 years. Critics, however, raise concerns about the project's cost and environmental impact, noting the history of delays and budget overruns with similar projects. Optimism surrounding this project is relatively high given the long-term energy security it promises. </p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales, where it is currently illegal under Victorian legislation but allowed under certain conditions. A proposed amendment aims to remove the threat of investigation or imprisonment for women terminating their own pregnancies. The framework for accessing abortion would remain the same, requiring two doctors' approval if the procedure takes place in a healthcare setting. Concerns have been raised about the potential impact on the 1967 Abortion Act and the need for proper scrutiny. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Debt forgiveness and debt consolidation offer distinct approaches to managing debt, with varying consequences for savings and credit scores. Debt consolidation combines multiple debts into a single loan or payment plan, potentially lowering interest rates but not reducing the principal balance. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to accept less than the full amount owed, typically resulting in a 30% to 50% reduction, but it requires ceasing payments, which damages credit. While debt forgiveness can save more money upfront, the resulting credit damage can lead to higher interest rates on future loans. (not investment advice)</p>

Starmer defended last year's decision to withdraw the payments from most pensioners, citing the need to fix the UK's "broken" finances.
