          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This plan represents the first large-scale effort to provide remedies for the atrocity that devastated the Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street." The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives within the affected community. This initiative aims to acknowledge and rectify the historical injustices suffered by the descendants of the victims and contribute to the revitalization of the Greenwood area.</p>

          <p>Monday's UK newspaper front pages are largely focused on Sir Keir Starmer's strategic defence review, outlining government priorities for military and security spending, though some question its viability. Several papers highlight Defence Secretary John Healey's remarks on the rising number of migrants crossing the English Channel, with the Daily Express quoting him as saying small boat smugglers are running a 'taxi' service. The Financial Times leads with U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent's assurances that the U.S. will never default, addressing investor anxiety over the federal debt. The Guardian highlights a study suggesting exercise is more effective than drugs in preventing cancer recurrence.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. A new Sydney-listed company will acquire all outstanding shares of both entities, creating a merged entity worth around $9 billion with holdings in real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers, simplifying the structure and adding scale. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, reflecting a 10.1% premium. (not investment advice)</p>
