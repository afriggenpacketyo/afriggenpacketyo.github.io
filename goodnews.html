        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO, effective January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain as chairman. This decision, announced at the annual shareholder meeting, aims to reassure shareholders that Abel, the current vice chairman of non-insurance operations, will have full authority over company operations and capital deployment. Buffett's continued presence as chairman is intended to provide support for Abel, particularly in navigating potential acquisition opportunities amid volatile markets, given Berkshire's substantial cash reserves. The company's shares experienced only a slight dip despite the CEO transition announcement and a somewhat disappointing earnings report, reflecting investor confidence in the succession plan.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst concerns over eroding disability rights, Ari Ne'eman, a disability rights advocate and researcher, draws parallels to the Reagan era, highlighting the importance of mobilization and reframing disability rights as broadly appealing. Ne'eman emphasizes the vulnerability of disabled Americans in the healthcare system, while also noting their unique need for comprehensive support services. He warns of potential cuts to Medicaid and the dismantling of agencies supporting independent living, urging advocates to employ strategies that resonate across the political spectrum. Ne'eman plans to track the impact of policy changes by monitoring access to services, family burdens, and unmet healthcare needs, while also expressing concern over recent statements that call autism 'preventable' and focus disproportionately on biological causes rather than support services.</p>

          <p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the UK has issued a warning about cyber criminals impersonating IT help desk personnel to infiltrate organizations, following recent attacks on Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods. The NCSC advises companies to review their IT help desk password reset processes and enhance authentication methods to mitigate the risk of social engineering attacks. Cyber security experts recommend implementing additional security layers, such as code words, to verify the identity of employees requesting credential changes. The advice suggests the involvement of Scattered Spider, a cyber criminal group known for using social engineering tactics.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for overpayments from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, following criticism that the initial rate was too harsh. While experts acknowledge the improvement, they warn that even a 50% clawback can cause significant financial hardship for beneficiaries who rely on their benefits for essential expenses. The change applies to new overpayment notices issued on or after April 25th, with the withholding rate for Supplemental Security Income benefits remaining at 10%. Advocates emphasize that beneficiaries are often not at fault for the overpayments and should not bear the brunt of the agency's errors.</p>
