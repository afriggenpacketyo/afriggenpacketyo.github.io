          <p>Irish center Garry Ringrose has been forced to withdraw from the British and Irish Lions' second Test match against Australia due to a concussion sustained in training. This marks the second time a head injury has sidelined him on this tour. His withdrawal led to a midfield reshuffle, with Huw Jones and Bundee Aki starting together for the first time since a tour game. Coach Andy Farrell praised Ringrose's honesty and selfless decision to prioritize his health and the team's needs ahead of the crucial match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations and marking a significant turnaround from a loss in the same period last year. The positive results came despite the euro's strength against the dollar and mixed performance in its investment banking division. While revenue from fixed income and currencies saw a strong 11% increase, the origination and advisory unit declined by 29% due to market uncertainty. The bank affirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is launching a program to provide monthly electronic coupons to its senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care services. This initiative is a rare form of direct fiscal support from Beijing, aimed at alleviating the financial burden on families and stimulating the domestic service economy. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed as moderately to severely disabled for services like meal assistance and day care. The policy reflects growing pressure on policymakers to strengthen the social safety net amid a rapidly aging population and tepid consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating the Libor interest rate quashed after a decade-long legal battle. The ruling overturns one of the highest-profile outcomes of the post-financial crisis crackdown and raises questions about the original prosecutions by the Serious Fraud Office. The decision is expected to lead to appeals from seven other traders jailed for similar offenses. The case has also renewed calls for a public inquiry into the scandal, including the role of senior bank managers and central banks in interest rate manipulation.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment is incorrect. The amendment's Citizenship Clause grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The 2-1 ruling found that a nationwide injunction was appropriate to prevent the chaos that would result from inconsistent citizenship laws across states, marking a significant legal setback for the administration's policy.</p>

The mission's stated goal is to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments and explore geological history over the last 126,000 years. The resumption of these joint surveys, which were paused during the pandemic, is seen by officials as a new chapter in bilateral marine research and a shared commitment to addressing global climate challenges.</p>

While the event is a fixture of American sports culture and a business success for the league, Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged that its format may need re-evaluation.

          <p>A large-scale study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is a more realistic and evidence-based target for health benefits than the commonly cited 10,000 steps. The research, which analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, linked this daily step count to a significantly reduced risk of serious health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. The 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign in Japan, not scientific research. Researchers believe these findings could encourage more people to adopt a practical and achievable goal for improving their physical and mental well-being.</p>

An oceanography student from Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which floats on the open ocean using a self-secreted bubble raft. These snails are usually found in warmer subtropical and tropical waters, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore currents. While a direct link to climate change is not certain, researchers suggest that continued warm water events could lead to more frequent sightings of such species outside their normal habitats.</p>

The band, fronted by Ozzy Osbourne, combined slow tempos, high volume, and dark lyrical themes inspired by horror films. Guitarist Tony Iommi's unique playing style, developed after an industrial accident damaged his fingertips, was central to their sound, creating detuned, powerful riffs that became the foundation of heavy metal. Their early albums like "Paranoid" and "Master of Reality" established a blueprint for countless rock bands that followed.</p>
