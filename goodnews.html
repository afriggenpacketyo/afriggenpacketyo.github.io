          <p>Apple has refuted claims from X owner Elon Musk that its App Store unfairly disadvantages competitors, particularly in the AI app market. The tech giant stated its platform is designed to be fair and uses objective criteria for featuring apps. This conflict is the latest in an ongoing feud between Musk and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, stemming from Musk's belief that OpenAI has strayed from its non-profit mission. Despite Musk's complaints about his apps X and Grok not being promoted, data shows they perform well, though not as highly as he claims.</p>

          <p>Despite increasing pressure from replay reviews and the rise of automated ball-strike systems, aspiring umpires continue to pursue a career in Major League Baseball. At a recent MLB umpire camp in Milwaukee, candidates expressed that new technologies are tools for improvement, not deterrents. Instructors and MLB officials acknowledge that while technology has made umpiring more accurate than ever, it has also heightened expectations and mental stress. The ability to mentally recover from having calls overturned in real-time is now a key trait evaluated for umpires aiming for the major leagues.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study reveals that the potato originated from an ancient interbreeding event between the ancestors of tomatoes and a group of plants called Etuberosum. This hybridization, which occurred around 9 million years ago, gave the new plant lineage the unique ability to grow tubers. This evolutionary development happened at a crucial time when the Andes mountains were forming, allowing the resilient potato to thrive in the new high-elevation habitats. The research not only solves a long-standing genetic mystery but could also pave the way for creating more resilient potato varieties by breeding them with seeds.</p>

          <p>Giving a good pep talk involves more than just generic encouragement; it requires specificity, good timing, and active listening. According to experts, the most effective pep talks are tailored to the person's specific anxiety and don't always need to include advice. Sometimes, simply bearing witness to someone's struggle and reminding them of truths they already know can be the most powerful form of support. The article suggests that small, everyday words of encouragement can be just as meaningful as grand speeches, emphasizing that the goal is to show you're on their side.</p>

          <p>Young men diagnosed with cancer often face a severe emotional and psychological toll, tending to isolate themselves and avoid support systems more than women. This can lead to worse outcomes, including a higher risk of suicide among male cancer survivors. The article highlights the story of men who struggled with the loss of identity, control, and feelings of shame after their diagnoses. In response, grassroots organizations like Man Up to Cancer are being created to provide a space for male survivors to find fellowship, share their vulnerabilities, and combat cultural conditioning that discourages them from seeking help.</p>

          <h2>The Linguistic Mystery Surrounding the Origin of the Word 'Dog'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The word "dog," one of the most common in the English language, has a mysterious origin that linguists have yet to solve. For centuries, canines were more commonly called "hounds," with "dog" appearing as a derogatory term for people before evolving into the standard, affectionate term around the 1500s. Theories suggest it may derive from the Old English words "dox" (a color) or "dugan" (to be strong), but its true etymology remains unknown. The evolution of the word and its use in many idioms reflects the deep, long-standing emotional connection between humans and their canine companions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Police Chiefs' Council in the UK has issued new interim guidance encouraging police forces to consider disclosing the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in high-profile cases. This move aims to counter misinformation and increase transparency, following criticism over the handling of details in recent sensitive cases. While the government supports releasing these details in most instances, the final decision will remain with individual police forces, who must balance public interest with the need to avoid prejudicing a fair trial. The guidance is part of a broader review of police media relations.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Rolls-Royce, Tufan Erginbilgic, believes the company's plan to power artificial intelligence data centers with its small modular nuclear reactors (SMRs) has the potential to make it the UK's most valuable firm. As AI's energy consumption soars, Rolls-Royce is positioning its nuclear technology as a key solution, having already signed deals with the UK and Czech governments. Despite the SMR technology being currently unproven on a commercial scale, the CEO is confident in its future, seeing a potential trillion-dollar market. This strategy is part of a dramatic company turnaround. (not investment advice)</p>
