          <p>The Statue of Liberty was originally conceived in 1865 to celebrate the end of slavery in the United States, symbolized by the broken chains at her feet, not as a beacon for immigration. It was poet Emma Lazarus's 1883 sonnet, "The New Colossus," that reframed the statue as a "mother of exiles" for fundraising purposes. This new meaning solidified with the opening of Ellis Island in 1892 and was later cemented by President John F. Kennedy's "A Nation of Immigrants," transforming the monument into a powerful, enduring symbol of America's promise to newcomers.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating trade tensions at the national level, many U.S. city and local officials continue to welcome investment from China. According to the China General Chamber of Commerce, local leaders see these investments, particularly in manufacturing, as vital for stimulating their economies. While potential Chinese investors are wary of the geopolitical climate, mayors in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive. The article suggests President Trump's tariffs have even increased the incentive for Chinese companies to establish production facilities within the U.S. (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Turkey is significantly increasing its political and cultural influence in the Western Balkans, using "soft power" tactics such as funding the construction of large mosques, like the Namazgah mosque in Tirana, Albania. This strategy, termed "infrastructure imperialism" by one expert, extends beyond religion to include major investments in railways, ports, and hotels, often benefiting companies with ties to President Erdogan. This policy is part of a broader Turkish effort to assert itself as a regional power and heir to the Ottoman Empire, projecting an image of modernity and a shared destiny with nations across the Balkans, Caucasus, and Africa.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," recounts the author's 1882 return to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain found the river and its towns profoundly changed, yet his time back in a steamboat's pilot house evoked a powerful sense of nostalgia and belonging. The experience highlighted a central paradox of his life: the more famous and worldly he became, the more he cherished the memory of his untroubled early years as a river pilot, a period he considered his only time of true freedom.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley has suggested that football clubs should help pay for the £70 million annual cost of policing their matches in the UK. Arguing for a "polluter pays approach," Rowley questioned why event organizers that require a police presence do not contribute to the expense, which currently draws resources away from local communities. This proposal was made alongside a broader call for radical police reform, including consolidating the 43 forces in England and Wales into 12 to 15 larger entities to better manage overstretched funding and modern threats.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores professional wrestling as a vital and uniquely American cultural form, blending storytelling, athleticism, and audience interaction. It describes wrestling as a "Rough Theatre" that oscillates between the real and unreal, where pre-arranged outcomes are executed with real physical impact and pain. The piece highlights the narrative power of wrestling, using Hulk Hogan's famous 1996 "heel turn" as an example of storytelling that can captivate audiences and even influence broader culture. It argues that wrestling's raw, unpolished, and often unpredictable nature is central to its enduring appeal and artistic fascination.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people, dressed in traditional white and red attire, gathered in Pamplona, Spain, for the "chupinazo" rocket launch, officially starting the nine-day San Fermín bull-running festival. The event, made famous by Ernest Hemingway's novel "The Sun Also Rises," draws large crowds of locals and tourists for its daily "encierros." In these controversial runs, participants sprint ahead of six charging bulls through the city's streets to the bullring. The festival is characterized by heavy drinking, dancing, and daily bullfights where the animals are ultimately killed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that ranked-choice voting (RCV) was a major winner in the New York City mayoral primary, enabling the victory of long-shot progressive candidate Zohran Mamdani. The author contends that RCV incentivized a more positive, coalition-building campaign, allowing multiple progressive candidates to run without acting as spoilers for one another. Instead of forcing early consolidation, the system gave Mamdani time to build momentum and appeal to a broad base of voters. The high turnout and positive voter feedback suggest that RCV empowers voters and can lead to more engaging, issue-focused elections.</p>

          <p>The American flag represents a complicated symbol for many Black Americans, embodying both a nation they helped build and a history of oppression enacted under its banner. This article explores this dynamic, noting how Black service members have historically fought for a country that treated them as second-class citizens. In modern times, a new generation of Black artists, like Beyoncé, is seen as reclaiming the flag, signaling a sense of ownership, progress, and belonging. This reclamation is complex, as it coexists with the flag's use by nationalist groups and the ongoing struggle for racial equality in the U.S.</p>

          <p>China's minimal influence during the recent exchange of fire between Iran and Israel demonstrates that it is not yet ready to be a global superpower or a key security provider in the Middle East. Despite its economic partnerships and reliance on the region's oil, Beijing was unable to play a significant mediating role. The article argues that China's relationships, even with partners like Iran, are limited by its own business interests, its inability to project military power, and its reluctance to form binding alliances. Consequently, the United States remains the indispensable political and strategic power in the region.</p>

          <p>Mark Rowley, the commissioner of London's Metropolitan Police, is calling for a radical overhaul of policing in England and Wales, arguing the current model of 43 separate forces is outdated and inefficient.
