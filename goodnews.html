          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic moment for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, 53, previously led the Metropolitan Chicago Synod and hopes his presence will encourage more leaders of color within the church, which is currently over 95% white. His six-year term, beginning October 1, comes as the ELCA faces challenges common to other mainline Protestant denominations, including precipitous membership declines from 5.3 million in 1988 to 2.7 million today, and ongoing theological disputes over LGBTQ+ inclusion. This article highlights a significant step towards diversity in American religious leadership and the challenges ahead for the denomination.</p>

Tight ends coach Jerry Neuheisel, elevated to playcaller just four days prior, orchestrated an offense that scored on its first five drives. Quarterback Nico Iamaleava was instrumental, running for three touchdowns and passing for two more, while also rushing for 128 yards. The win, secured by a crucial defensive stop in the final minutes, ended UCLA's four-game losing streak and ignited fervent fan support.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Freshers' flu," a common cold-like illness affecting new university students, is primarily caused by an influx of various respiratory viruses converging on campuses from diverse geographical backgrounds. Immunologists explain that students' immune systems are often compromised by factors prevalent during freshers' week, such as poor diet, lack of sleep, high stress from new responsibilities, and increased alcohol consumption. The close living quarters, packed lecture halls, and intense social interaction create a "mixing pot" for infections, making it difficult to avoid transmission even before symptoms appear. This article clarifies that while rarely serious, the symptoms can feel worse due to novel virus exposure and weakened immune responses.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square, celebrating with cautious optimism the potential Gaza ceasefire deal and crediting President Donald Trump for brokering it.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that a Gaza ceasefire would begin "immediately" once Hamas confirms its agreement to a new U.S. peace plan. Trump stated Israel had "agreed to the initial withdrawal line" and that the deal would facilitate the release of Israeli hostages, a prisoner exchange, and conditions for further Israeli withdrawal, aiming to end the "3,000-year catastrophe." His remarks came amidst Hamas accusing Israel of continuing "horrific crimes and massacres" despite claims of reduced military operations, claiming 70 people had been killed by strikes since Saturday morning.

          <p>Senne Lammens, Manchester United's 23-year-old goalkeeper, made his debut, earning a clean sheet and fan praise, including chants of "are you Schmeichel in disguise?" from the Stretford End. This came after his £18.1 million move from Royal Antwerp and amid fan desperation for an alternative to current keepers. Despite an ill-advised dash from goal in the second half, Lammens made two significant saves, demonstrating confidence and competence that current keepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana have lacked. Manager Ruben Amorim noted Lammens' adaptation to a new country and the immense pressure, suggesting a period of preparation before his first start. This article highlights a promising debut for the new goalkeeper and the team's need for consistent performance.</p>
