          <p>Former President Donald Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have approved the first stage of a peace agreement following negotiations in Egypt. The deal involves the release of all hostages held by Hamas in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli troops to a pre-determined line. The Israel Defense Forces stated they have begun operational preparations for implementing the ceasefire and have warned Palestinians against returning to northern Gaza, which remains a dangerous combat zone. The agreement is presented as a significant step towards a lasting peace in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has launched a pioneering thermal power station in the Gobi Desert, featuring a world-first dual-tower design that feeds a single turbine system. The plant, built by the China Three Gorges Corporation, uses nearly 27,000 mirrors to concentrate sunlight onto two 200-meter towers. This process heats molten salt to store energy, allowing the station to generate electricity even after sunset or on cloudy days. The innovative dual-tower configuration is estimated to be 25% more effective than single-tower designs, marking a significant advancement in renewable energy technology.</p>

          <p>The initial phase of the peace plan agreed upon by Israel and Hamas involves the release of all remaining hostages in Gaza in exchange for a significant number of Palestinian prisoners. As part of the deal, Israeli forces will also withdraw to an agreed-upon line within Gaza, and more humanitarian aid will be allowed into the territory. However, key long-term issues remain unresolved, including the disarmament of Hamas and the future governance of the Gaza Strip. While the deal marks a major step towards ending the war, these unresolved points will be critical in determining whether a lasting peace can be achieved.</p>

          <p>As the Norwegian Nobel Committee prepares to announce this year's Peace Prize winner, intense speculation surrounds former President Donald Trump's chances, fueled by his own public desire for the award. Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves the prize for his diplomatic efforts, and his supporters have actively nominated him. The committee, which granted the BBC rare access to its final meeting, maintains its independence from public pressure. However, experts note that Trump's withdrawal from international agreements and polarizing rhetoric could hinder his candidacy.</p>

          <p>Construction workers at the Port of Long Beach, California, unearthed an unexploded ordnance dating back to World War II on Wednesday. The discovery of the eight-decade-old shell prompted the immediate evacuation of one of the port's container terminals and the establishment of a safety perimeter. A U.S. Marine Corps ordnance disposal team was called to the scene. They determined the device was safe to transport before moving it off-site for deactivation, allowing port operations to resume later that night.</p>

          <p>The recent agreement on a hostage release marks a significant diplomatic achievement for Donald Trump, who personally invested in pressuring both Israel and Hamas. By leveraging his relationships with regional allies like Qatar and Turkey, he compelled Hamas to agree to release all hostages upfront, a major concession. However, this first phase does not resolve the core issues of the conflict, such as Hamas's disarmament or the future governance of Gaza. Trump appears to be counting on the momentum from this deal and his own political capital to push the exhausted parties toward a permanent end to the war.</p>
