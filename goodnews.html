          <p>Quarterback Shedeur Sanders signed a four-year, $4.6 million rookie contract with the Cleveland Browns after being selected in the fifth round of the NFL Draft. Sanders, who will wear No. 12, decided against buying his college jersey number from a teammate, citing his modest signing bonus. Despite the contract's value being less than his college NIL valuation, the agreement provides Sanders with security as he competes for a roster spot in a crowded quarterback room. Sanders finished the 2024 season at Colorado with 4,134 passing yards.</p>

Cramer argued that the downgrade prompted excessive fear that was not warranted by the economic environment. He suggested gold and bitcoin as hedges against government borrowing but cautioned against selling, advising investors to invest more of what they can save. Cramer warned that calls to 'get out now' are often driven by either ignorance or the business models of shrewd short sellers. (not investment advice)</p>
