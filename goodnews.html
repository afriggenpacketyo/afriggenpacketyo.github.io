          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler won the BMW Championship in Maryland, overcoming a four-shot deficit in the final round to finish two strokes ahead of overnight leader Robert MacIntyre. Scheffler's steady play, culminating in a three-under-par 67, contrasted with MacIntyre's difficult start, which included several early bogeys. The Scottish golfer struggled to find fairways and ultimately carded a 73, securing the runner-up position. The victory at Caves Valley Golf Club marks another significant title for Scheffler, who demonstrated resilience and skill under pressure to claim the championship with a final score of 15 under par.</p>

          <p>Jon Rahm has been crowned the LIV Golf individual champion for the second year in a row, earning the season-long award and an $18 million prize. Despite losing a play-off to Sebastian Munoz in the Indiana event, Rahm's overall performance was sufficient to edge out competitor Joaquin Niemann for the title. Munoz won the tournament with a birdie on the first extra hole after both he and Rahm finished at 22 under par. The event also saw former Ryder Cup players Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter secure their positions in LIV for the 2026 season, avoiding relegation.</p>

          <p>As part of the Trump administration's ongoing crime crackdown in Washington, D.C., 68 suspects were arrested on a single Saturday night, with officials seizing 15 illegal firearms. The arrests are part of a broader federal operation that has resulted in over 300 arrests in less than ten days, targeting what the administration calls a "crime plague." Charges from the recent sweep included aggravated assault, assault on a police officer, and grand larceny. A White House spokesperson stated that President Trump's leadership is making the capital safer and delivering on his promise to restore order, a sentiment echoed by Attorney General Pam Bondi.</p>

          <p>In an exclusive interview, Jing Qian, a vice-president at the Asia Society, provides an analysis of the recent U.S.-China trade talks, framing them as a continuation of principles established at a prior summit in Geneva. He notes that the initial goal was de-escalation to calm rattled markets and provide both nations with economic breathing space. The discussions involved high-level officials, including U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, who were supported by veteran negotiators. Qian's research focuses on the interplay between domestic politics and foreign policy in both countries, suggesting the current rivalry, while tense, is being handled as a manageable issue by both sides.</p>

          <p>A recent JPMorgan Chase analysis reveals that while balances in traditional checking and savings accounts are declining, Americans' total cash reserves are growing, particularly in higher-yield options like money market funds, brokerage accounts, and CDs. This trend, most pronounced among lower-income households, helps explain the continued strength in consumer spending despite persistent inflation. The shift indicates a strategic move by savers to secure better returns on their money in the current economic climate. This article explores the various investment vehicles gaining popularity and offers considerations for those looking to make similar financial moves. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Manchester United suffered a 1-0 opening day defeat to Arsenal at Old Trafford, with a critical error from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir leading to the decisive goal. Bayindir, selected over the recently fit Andre Onana, failed to handle a corner, allowing Riccardo Calafiori to score for Arsenal in the 13th minute. The mistake has renewed debate over United's goalkeeping situation, a position the club did not prioritize during its £200m summer spending spree focused on attackers. Despite a more threatening attack, United could not find an equalizer, placing early-season pressure on manager Ruben Amorim and his choice of goalkeeper.</p>

          <p>Following the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, U.S. special envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Russia has agreed to allow the U.S. and Europe to provide Ukraine with "robust" security guarantees as part of a potential peace deal. Witkoff stated this could involve "Article 5-like language," referencing NATO's collective defense principle, which could serve as an alternative to Ukraine's formal NATO membership. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the offer as "historic" ahead of his visit to Washington to meet with President Trump and European leaders. The development comes amid concerns that Trump may press Ukraine to cede territory, particularly the Donetsk region, to Russia.</p>

          <p>Legendary investor Peter Lynch recently offered advice on retirement planning, stressing the importance of a long-term perspective when investing in the stock market. He cautioned that while the market has historically been the best place for wealth growth, it is not suitable for those who need their money within one or two years due to its volatility. Lynch also shared his strategy of finding excellent companies within struggling industries, as these often attract less competition and can yield better returns than popular, fast-growing sectors. His guidance serves as a reminder that patience and unconventional thinking are key to successful investing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's summit with Vladimir Putin, Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that ending the war in Ukraine will require concessions from both Russia and Ukraine. Speaking on "Face the Nation," Rubio emphasized that a peace deal is not a surrender and that neither side can expect to get everything it wants. He indicated that the administration saw enough movement in the talks with Putin to justify a follow-up meeting with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy and European leaders. Key areas for negotiation include security guarantees for Ukraine, the drawing of territorial lines, and a plan for the country's reconstruction.</p>
