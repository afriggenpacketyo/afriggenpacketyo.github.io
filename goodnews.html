          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace inflation. While national average yields for CDs are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs yielding around 4.4%. The article notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs currently provide higher interest rates than long-term ones, a trend observed since late 2022. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to explore offerings from online banks, which typically have lower overhead, and consider short-term CDs or a laddering strategy.

          <p>Financial technology startup Imprint has won a competitive bid to launch a new co-branded credit card with online shopping platform Rakuten, a significant victory in an industry dominated by large banks. The five-year-old company also raised an additional $70 million in capital, increasing its valuation to $900 million. Imprint's strategy focuses on a seamless digital experience and transparent fee structures, differentiating itself from established players. By partnering with smaller banks and using the American Express network, Imprint handles the technology and customer experience directly, aiming to offer better rewards and an easier payment process for users.

          <p>While the national average interest rate for savings accounts remains low at 0.38%, high-yield savings accounts are offering rates between 4.11% and 4.30%, providing a robust option for building an emergency fund. The article emphasizes that online banks typically offer these superior rates due to lower operational costs, passing the savings to customers. These accounts often have low or no minimum balance requirements and no monthly fees, making them accessible to a wide range of savers. Experts advise consumers to compare different high-yield options to find the best combination of high rates and low fees to maximize their earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Coca-Cola Company has reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations, with adjusted earnings of 87 cents per share against a predicted 83 cents. This strong performance was largely driven by robust demand in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa segment, which helped to counterbalance volume declines in other global markets. Despite the positive earnings, the company's global unit case volume saw a 1% decrease, with North America also experiencing a slight drop. The company also confirmed plans to introduce a cane sugar version of its classic soda in the U.S. this fall. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Phillies defeated the Boston Red Sox in a highly unusual conclusion, winning 3-2 on a walk-off catcher's interference call in the 10th inning. With the bases loaded, Phillies batter Edmundo Sosa's swing made contact with the glove of Red Sox catcher Carlos Narvaez. After a review confirmed the interference, Sosa was awarded first base, forcing in the winning run. This marked the first time a Major League Baseball game has ended on a walk-off catcher's interference since 1971, providing a bizarre and historic finish to the contest.</p>

          <p>The United States and Taiwan are exploring a potential collaboration on a spaceport focused on suborbital flights, according to the American Institute in Taiwan. This emerging technology involves vehicles briefly exiting and re-entering the Earth's atmosphere, which could dramatically reduce travel times. If developed, such a system could shorten the journey between Taipei and Houston from approximately 14.5 hours to as little as 2.5 hours. The discussions are still in the evaluation phase, but Houston's Ellington Airport already possesses the necessary spaceport license, positioning it as a key site for this futuristic transportation initiative.</p>

Despite the Lions regaining the lead with a second try from Osborne and another from Duhan van der Merwe, their opponents' physicality caused significant problems. A late try from the Pasifika side created a tense finish, but the Lions managed to hold on for a hard-fought win in their Australian tour.</p>

          <p>The economic gap between China's top two provincial economies, Guangdong and Jiangsu, has shrunk to its narrowest margin in years. In the first half of 2025, Jiangsu's GDP reached 97.44% of Guangdong's, a difference of just 175.76 billion yuan (US$24.5 billion). Analysts attribute Jiangsu's gains to its diversified industrial structure and lower dependence on real estate and exports. In contrast, Guangdong, a traditional export powerhouse, has seen its export growth slow dramatically, from 12.1% in the first quarter of 2024 to just 1.1% in the same period this year, weighing on its overall economic performance.

          <p>Stephanie Wambugu's debut novel, "Lonely Crowds," examines the intense and damaging decades-long friendship between two women, Ruth and Maria. The story, told from Ruth's perspective, challenges the romantic notion of childhood bonds by revealing the secrets and misunderstandings at the core of their relationship. Growing up as the only two Black girls in their class, their dynamic becomes one of obsession and dependency, with the passive Ruth constantly seeking approval from the controlling Maria. As they navigate college and the New York art world, their childhood patterns persist, transforming their once-close bond into a liability that prevents them from truly knowing themselves or each other.</p>

          <p>The Coca-Cola Company announced it will introduce a version of its classic cola sweetened with cane sugar in the United States this fall. For decades, the U.S. version has used high-fructose corn syrup, while the cane sugar variant, popularly known as "Mexican Coke," has gained a loyal following. The move comes after public comments from President Donald Trump supporting the use of "REAL Cane Sugar" and aligns with a broader consumer trend, even as the company also promotes its zero-sugar options. This new product offers another choice for consumers, though research does not indicate cane sugar is a healthier alternative to corn syrup.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have unveiled a next-generation high-speed rail technology capable of operating at 400km/h (249mph), surpassing the previous 350km/h barrier. The scientific team overcame significant challenges related to aerodynamic resistance and energy consumption, which increase exponentially at higher speeds. By redesigning the train's head shape and adding an undercarriage cover to shield the bogies, they successfully reduced air resistance by over 24%. This innovation allows the new train to achieve a 50km/h speed increase while maintaining comparable energy consumption to the current generation of Fuxing high-speed trains.</p>

During a recent match, LAFC fans displayed a large banner reading "Los Angeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido" ("Los Angeles, united, will never be defeated"), a message of solidarity with immigrant communities. While LAFC has issued a statement supporting its community, the Galaxy organization has remained silent, prompting some of its own fans to boycott.

          <p>This article argues that as global temperatures rise, providing shade should become a public health priority on par with clean air and water. With heat already killing more people than floods and hurricanes combined, shade from trees and man-made structures is an effective, democratic tool for mitigating extreme heat in urban environments. The author suggests that society has become overly focused on indoor cooling and has forgotten the importance of cooling outdoor public spaces. Investing in "shade infrastructure," whether through urban forestry or artificial canopies, is presented as a critical and necessary adaptation for life on a hotter planet.</p>
