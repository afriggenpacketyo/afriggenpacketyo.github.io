          <p>A private Japanese company, ispace, attempted to land its Resilience lander on the lunar surface, carrying cameras, scientific instruments, and a rover. The mission aimed to explore the moon's northern hemisphere and deploy a tiny rover called Tenacious to collect data and lunar regolith. The lander also carried a small model of a Swedish house as a symbolic payload. This attempt follows a previous failed landing by ispace in 2023, highlighting the challenges of private lunar missions. Success would mark a significant milestone in commercial space exploration, but this article does not confirm the success or failure of the landing itself. </p>
