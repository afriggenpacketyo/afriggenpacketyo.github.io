          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 12:39:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ultium Cells, a joint venture of General Motors and LG Energy Solution, is upgrading its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility to produce lower-cost lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries for electric vehicles. This strategic shift aims to significantly reduce EV battery pack expenses, as LFP technology avoids the use of costly minerals like cobalt and nickel. While the company did not disclose the new investment amount, commercial production of the LFP cells is slated to begin by late 2027. This development complements GM's broader strategy of diversifying its battery portfolio, which includes a separate $900 million investment in new battery development labs in Michigan.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is making its unofficial "secret menu" official by adding popular fan-created drink combinations to its mobile app for rewards members.

The initiative is part of CEO Brian Niccol's broader strategy to revive the brand and improve customer service, which also includes simplifying the main menu and standardizing charges for add-ons. To generate excitement, the company is also hosting a contest for customers to submit their own custom drink creations for a chance to win prize money.</p>

          <p>A new provision in the federal spending bill is anticipated to fuel a surge in private jet sales by reinstating "bonus depreciation." This allows businesses to write off 100% of a new or used jet's purchase price in the first year, a benefit that applies to planes used for business purposes. Aviation brokers report a subsequent burst of client activity, as the tax incentive comes at a time when the private jet market has been cooling from its post-pandemic highs. While the change makes purchases more attractive, experts suggest the main rush to buy will likely occur in the fall as companies finalize their annual tax strategies.</p>

Conversely, Melius analysts praised Texas Roadhouse as a rare growth story in casual dining driven by strong customer traffic.

Analysts believe this institutional buying and growing policy clarity are key drivers, with some predicting further appreciation in the near future.

The proposal is part of a broader effort to renew the government's work and boost Ukraine's economic potential as the war with Russia continues. Svyrydenko, 39, has risen quickly through government ranks and played a prominent role in securing a key mineral deal with the United States. Her candidacy must be approved by Ukraine's parliament, and if confirmed, she would replace Denys Shmyhal and become the nation's second female prime minister.</p>

          <p>England's second-place finish in their Euro 2025 group has sparked debate over whether it provides them with a more favorable path in the knockout stages. By not finishing first, the Lionesses will face Sweden in the quarter-finals instead of eight-time champions Germany, and they also avoid a potential semi-final clash with powerhouse Spain. While Sweden is a formidable opponent, some analysts believe this draw is strategically better for England. However, the team now has less recovery time, playing their quarter-final on Thursday instead of Saturday, adding a layer of complexity to their championship pursuit.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of women senators is sponsoring the "She Drives Act" to address a significant safety disparity in vehicle crash testing. Federal data shows women are 73% more likely to suffer serious injuries and 17% more likely to be killed in a crash than men. The legislation aims to update federal standards by requiring the use of advanced crash test dummies that better reflect the public, including one simulating a smaller woman. Proponents argue this will provide crucial data to design safer cars, as current dummies are based on the size of an average 1990s man.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals potential interest rate cuts later this year, financial experts are advising savers on how to choose the right certificate of deposit (CD) term. With short-term CD rates currently higher than many long-term options, some experts suggest sticking with shorter terms for flexibility. Others argue that locking in a competitive long-term rate now could be advantageous before rates fall. For those unsure, building a CD ladder with staggered maturity dates is recommended as a strategy to balance access to funds with securing higher long-term yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explains the capabilities of the MIM-104 Patriot, a U.S.-made surface-to-air missile system being sent to Ukraine. Developed by Raytheon, the Patriot is a mobile system designed to intercept threats like high-flying aircraft, cruise missiles, and tactical ballistic missiles, all of which are used by Russia in its attacks. While highly effective against these targets, it is less so against smaller, low-flying drones. The system has a range of over 100 miles and requires about 90 troops to operate. The new deployment, paid for by European allies, aims to significantly bolster Ukraine's air defense capabilities.</p>
