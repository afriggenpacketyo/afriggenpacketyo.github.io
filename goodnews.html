          <p>During Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to Beijing, China and Russia signed over 20 bilateral cooperation agreements in sectors like energy, aerospace, and AI. This move aims to strengthen their economic partnership as both nations face increasing trade pressure and tariffs from the United States. Analysts suggest that despite a recent dip in Chinese auto exports to Russia, there is significant potential for growth in trade settled in their local currencies. The agreements signal a strategic pivot towards new markets and a response to being pushed away from the US market.</p>

          <p>New York Democratic Representative Jerry Nadler, 78, has announced he will not seek re-election in 2026, ending a 34-year career in Congress. Nadler cited the need for "generational change" within the Democratic party as a primary motivator, referencing the pressures that led to Joe Biden's withdrawal from the previous presidential race. As the former chair of the House Judiciary Committee who led two impeachments against Donald Trump, Nadler expressed a desire for younger leadership to confront the challenges posed by Trump's political agenda. His decision opens up a competitive primary for his Manhattan district seat.</p>

          <p>Shares of PepsiCo jumped 4% after activist investment firm Elliott Management disclosed a $4 billion stake in the company, making it one of the top five active investors. Elliott sent a letter to Pepsi's board outlining a plan to revitalize the consumer goods giant, which they believe presents a "historic opportunity" for unlocking shareholder value. The firm is pushing for sharpened focus, increased innovation, and greater efficiency to improve what it describes as a "disappointing trajectory." PepsiCo has acknowledged Elliott's investment and stated it will review the firm's perspectives. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zack Polanski, a 42-year-old London Assembly member, has been elected as the new leader of the UK's Green Party, defeating two of the party's sitting MPs. Polanski campaigned on a platform of "eco-populism," promising a more confrontational communication style and a decisive shift to the left to challenge the Labour Party. With a background as an actor and hypnotherapist, he represents an unconventional choice aimed at connecting with voters on an emotional level. His victory signals a potential new direction for the party, one that may involve collaboration with other left-wing movements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers with the USDA are experimenting with a novel, nonlethal method to deter gray wolves from attacking cattle in the western U.S. by using drones. These drones are equipped with speakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from movies, and live human voices to startle the predators and interrupt their hunts. This creative approach is part of an effort to find coexistence strategies as wolf populations recover and come into increasing conflict with ranchers. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results have shown success in scaring wolves away from livestock.</p>

Under this model, traders buy and sell contracts on the outcomes of sporting events, with odds shifting based on market activity rather than a bookmaker. The partnership allows Underdog to enter the rapidly growing prediction market industry, utilizing Crypto.com's federally registered derivatives exchange for the contracts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard troops and Marines in Los Angeles to handle protests was illegal. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer found that the action violated the Posse Comitatus Act, a federal law that restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement purposes. The ruling, which is currently limited to California, blocks the administration from using troops for tasks like arrests, searches, and crowd control within the state. The judge warned that such deployments risk creating a "national police force with the President as its chief."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, financial experts are advising savers to lock in current certificate of deposit (CD) rates before they decline. They suggest that now is a good time to open a CD to maximize returns, as rates are still higher than historical averages but will likely drop following any Fed action. Other recommended strategies include considering no-penalty CDs for greater flexibility and using a "CD ladder" approach to stagger maturity dates. Experts also stress the importance of shopping around at different banks and credit unions for the best possible rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's recent tax legislation, dubbed the "big beautiful bill," may create a "golden opportunity" for more investors to pay 0% on long-term capital gains, according to financial planners. The 0% rate applies to individuals with taxable income up to $48,350 or married couples up to $96,700 for 2025. With new and expanded deductions in the bill, more people could fall below this threshold, allowing them to sell profitable assets tax-free. This strategy, known as "tax-gain harvesting," can be used to rebalance portfolios or reset an asset's cost basis for future tax savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a landmark U.S. legal case, Russell Marubbio has been convicted of a 1987 sexual assault based on DNA analysis that distinguished him from his identical twin brother. Forensic scientists used advanced techniques to identify minute genetic mutations that occur after an embryo splits, which are unique to each twin. This "ultra-deep sequencing" allowed investigators to definitively link Marubbio to the crime scene evidence from nearly four decades ago. The successful application of this technology in a U.S. court sets a major precedent for solving future criminal cases involving identical twins.</p>
