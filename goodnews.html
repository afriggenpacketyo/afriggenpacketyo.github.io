          <h2>Mike Tyson Advocates for Federal Legalization of Cannabis</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:36:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boxing legend Mike Tyson has voiced his frustration with the negative discourse surrounding legal cannabis, arguing for its federal legalization. He stated on social media that current laws benefit cartels and human traffickers, and that regulating cannabis like alcohol or cigarettes is a matter of personal freedom for adults. Tyson, a prominent advocate for cannabis reform, has previously written to the White House, urging for the reclassification of marijuana and clemency for nonviolent offenders. He believes federal legalization is essential for both social justice and economic reasons.</p>

          <h2>Former Obama Speechwriter Advocates for 'Neutral Ground' to Bridge Political Divides</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:29:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a commentary, former Obama speechwriter David Litt suggests that finding "common ground" in a politically polarized America is increasingly difficult. Instead, he proposes seeking "neutral ground"—shared activities or spaces where people with differing views can connect without focusing on their disagreements. Drawing from his experience learning to surf with his politically opposite brother-in-law, Litt argues that these neutral spaces foster friendships and can lead to more genuine discussions. He believes this approach is more effective at bridging divides than directly debating contentious issues.</p>

          <h2>Parenting Expert Emphasizes 'Self-Connection' as the Most Crucial Skill for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 10:04:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to parenting expert Reem Raouda, the single most important skill to teach a child for lifelong success is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. Raouda argues that common parenting phrases like "you're okay" can inadvertently teach children to distrust their feelings, leading to anxiety and insecurity. To foster self-connection, she advises parents to validate emotions, welcome all aspects of a child's personality, and model their own emotional regulation. This approach helps build emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence.</p>

          <p>Sources suggest that the upcoming Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea is the most likely venue for a meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. The potential meeting, which could occur before or during the summit, comes amid efforts to stabilize fluctuating U.S.-China relations following Trump's return to office and threats of heavy tariffs. Recent high-level talks between Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi have indicated a strong desire from both nations for their leaders to meet.</p>

          <p>Newberry Springs, a small desert town on the historic Route 66 in California, is hoping for a resurgence as the famed highway approaches its 100th anniversary in 2026. The town, like many others, faded after being bypassed by a modern interstate in the 1970s, leaving it feeling "frozen in time." Local residents and business owners are now banding together to organize events, create new tourist attractions, and secure grants to capitalize on the expected influx of visitors for the centennial. They aim to preserve the town's quirky, rural character while breathing new life into its economy.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that traditional metrics like job creation and unemployment rates are becoming obsolete for understanding the health of the U.S. labor market. With the rise of the "over-employed" holding multiple jobs, the gig economy, and remote work, focusing on "jobs" is misleading. The author proposes shifting the focus to measuring income, suggesting a new metric that tracks the percentage of the working-age population earning above a certain inflation-adjusted threshold from all sources. This approach would provide a more relevant picture of economic well-being in a rapidly changing work landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Contrary to the long-held belief that personality is fixed, new scientific research suggests it is possible to intentionally change one's traits. Professor Shannon Sauer-Zavala's work indicates that by consciously adopting different behaviors and maintaining them over time, individuals can shift their personalities. For example, an introvert can become more extroverted by consistently engaging in social situations. Writer Olga Khazan documented her own successful journey of using this method to reduce her neuroticism and social anxiety, as detailed in her book, "Me, But Better."</p>

Moseley Braun expresses concern that the Democratic party is "walking around in a daze" in its struggle to effectively counter Donald Trump. Despite recent backsliding on civil rights, she remains optimistic that Americans ultimately value democracy.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists may have identified the 300-year-old wreck of the 'Nossa Senhora do Cabo,' a Portuguese warship captured by the notorious French pirate Olivier Levasseur, known as 'La Buse.' The ship was laden with a treasure of gold, diamonds, and other valuables, estimated to be worth over $130 million today. The wreck was discovered near the island of Nosy Boraha off Madagascar, a known pirate hideout.

The excavation, documented by Discovery Channel's "Expedition Unknown," unearthed the 2,000-year-old tomb containing the remains of 12 individuals along with various ceramic and metal artifacts. Unlike many other tombs at the World Wonder site, this one was not empty, providing a rare opportunity for researchers to learn more about the Nabataean people who built the city and the purpose of its most famous monument.</p>

          <p>Market analysts are forecasting a potential surge in Bitcoin's price to $200,000 by the end of the year, fueled by a massive influx of corporate investment. According to Bitwise and XBTO experts, over $15 billion in Bitcoin purchases are planned by corporate treasury departments, signaling a strategic shift to hold the asset long-term. This trend of "permanent capital" is distinct from speculative retail trading and could create a significant supply shock. These corporate buyers are treating Bitcoin as a reserve asset, not a short-term trade, which could fundamentally alter its market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a first-of-its-kind court ruling, the Atlanta Police Foundation (APF) has released nearly 300 pages of records related to the controversial police training center known as "Cop City." The ruling found that the private foundation was subject to Georgia's Open Records Act, setting a major precedent for the transparency of over 250 similar police foundations nationwide. The released documents reveal the APF's efforts to lobby city council members to block a public referendum on the project. Activists say this transparency is a crucial step in holding these powerful, privately-funded police support groups accountable.</p>

Patients in trials and anecdotal reports describe significant improvements in symptoms like irregular periods, hair loss, and mental health issues.

However, the threat was later downgraded, and officials confirmed that the danger had passed. There were no immediate reports of casualties or significant damage from the quakes or the subsequent waves.
