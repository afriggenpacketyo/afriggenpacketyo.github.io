          <p>At Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholders meeting, Warren Buffett voiced his disapproval of President Trump's tariff policies, stating that "trade should not be a weapon." Buffett's remarks, closely followed by investors, acknowledged the potential impact of trade policies on Berkshire's operations, as the company reported a 14% drop in first-quarter operating income. Despite his criticism, Buffett reiterated his long-standing optimism about the United States, highlighting its enduring opportunities and resilience.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that domestication is causing cats and dogs to evolve similar skull shapes due to human selection. Selective breeding for traits like flat faces has led to convergence, where distantly related species develop similar characteristics. This trend, driven by human preferences for infant-like features, can result in health problems for the animals, such as breathing difficulties and neurological conditions. The study highlights the significant impact of human intervention on animal evolution and the ethical concerns surrounding breeding for extreme physical traits.</p>

          <p>New research suggests that California could potentially support a population of over 1,000 grizzly bears, raising the possibility of reintroducing the species to the state after a century-long absence. The study identifies suitable regions for reintroduction, including the northwest forest, southern Sierra Nevada, and southwest region near Santa Barbara. While the idea has garnered public support, concerns remain about potential conflicts with humans and livestock. The reintroduction process would be gradual and carefully monitored, with officials prioritizing remote areas and working closely with local communities.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term in Australia, defeating opposition leader Peter Dutton, amid global uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration. Dutton's campaign, which echoed some of President Trump's policies and messaging, ultimately failed to resonate with voters. Albanese's victory was attributed to a desire for stability and a rejection of divisive politics. The election results are seen as part of a broader trend of voters in allied countries choosing familiar leadership over Trump-inspired alternatives.</p>

          <p>Reginald, the world's tallest dog, a Great Dane, and Pearl, the world's shortest dog, a Chihuahua, recently had a playdate. Despite the 3-foot height difference, the meeting went well, with lots of tail wagging and sniffing. Reginald, who measures in at 3 feet 3 inches, was gentle and cautious around Pearl, who stands at 3.59 inches. The owners were surprised by how well the dogs got along, with Pearl even finding a new friend.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, a man who injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades, has provided a unique opportunity for scientists to develop a new antivenom. Jacob Glanville and Peter Kwong have published details of an antivenom, based on antibodies in Friede‚Äôs blood and a venom-blocking drug, that can protect against bites from 19 species of venomous snake in mice. The team strongly discourages anyone from trying to do what Tim did, and hopes that this research will revolutionize snakebite treatment.</p>
