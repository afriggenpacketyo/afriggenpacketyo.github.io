        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece explores the complex emotional and ethical dilemma of experiencing personal happiness while being aware of widespread global suffering. The author references humanitarian disasters, climate change, and political turmoil as sources of collective pain that can make personal achievements feel undeserved or inappropriate. Drawing on religious and philosophical traditions, the article argues that humanity is interconnected, meaning we should feel the pain of others but also their joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or "freudenfreude." The author suggests that embracing both horror and delight is a form of resistance and a way to maintain mental well-being without becoming cynical or disconnected from reality.</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies How Consumers Can Claim EV Tax Credit After September Deadline</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has provided a crucial clarification for consumers hoping to secure the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit, which is set to expire after September 30. According to the new guidance, buyers do not need to take physical possession of the vehicle by the deadline. Instead, they can qualify for the credit by having a "written binding contract" in place and making a payment, such as a deposit or trade-in, on or before September 30. This allows consumers to order an EV and receive it later while still being eligible for the tax break on new, used, or leased vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the transfer deadline approaching, Manchester United is reportedly considering a move for Aston Villa's goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez. The club has been actively seeking to resolve its goalkeeping issues and has also been in negotiations for Royal Antwerp's Senne Lammens. However, Martinez, a World Cup winner with Argentina and a two-time FIFA Goalkeeper of the Year, offers a wealth of high-level Premier League experience that Lammens lacks. The potential acquisition of Martinez would provide a seasoned and proven option for Manchester United as they look to strengthen their squad before the window closes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in popularity for matcha, driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom, is causing significant supply shortages and price increases in Japan. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the past decade, with demand far outstripping the production of tencha, the specific tea leaves used for matcha. Prices for tencha have skyrocketed, and retailers in Tokyo are rationing supplies to combat hoarding. Major beverage companies like Ito En are struggling to source enough raw material and are raising prices, while the Japanese government considers subsidizing farmers to boost production.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As children in the UK return to school, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of attendance, particularly in the first week. New data reveals that over half of pupils who missed some of the first week of school in 2024 later became persistently absent, compared to just 14% of those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains a significant problem, with rates of persistent absence still higher than pre-Covid levels. The government is launching initiatives like attendance hubs to support struggling schools and emphasizes a "support-first" approach with parents.</p>

          <p>In a rare commercial contract with a North American company, China's CAS Space successfully launched two miniature satellites for the Mexican startup ThumbSat. The femtosatellites, each weighing less than 100 grams, were part of a seven-satellite payload launched into sun-synchronous orbit. ThumbSat described the mission as Mexico's first commercial venture into low Earth orbit, aiming to demonstrate the viability of small, meaningful satellites. The launch is seen as a significant milestone for China's commercial space industry, marking its entry into the North American market and furthering its goal of expanding international space cooperation.</p>

          <p>Despite public opinion polls showing the Democratic Party's standing at a 30-year low, some political strategists see a path to recovery and reasons for optimism. While many voters perceive the party as weak, its chances in upcoming congressional elections appear to be improving, and a new generation of leaders is emerging. Analysts suggest the party's future relies on a strategy of rallying public opposition to President Trump, focusing on economic issues like affordability, and organizing for midterm victories. The deep unpopularity of Trump himself may be the Democrats' greatest asset, as voters may be motivated more by opposition than by affection for the party.</p>
