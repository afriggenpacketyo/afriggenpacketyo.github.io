          <p>Pride Month celebrations around the world, from New York City to Budapest, have been marked by a dual spirit of joyful celebration and determined protest.

          <p>A young male mountain lion cub that suffered severe injuries, including a fractured skull, after being struck by a vehicle has been successfully released back into the wild. The San Diego Humane Society's wildlife center spent nearly five months rehabilitating the cub, carefully providing medical care while ensuring it did not become accustomed to humans. After gaining sufficient weight and demonstrating natural survival behaviors, the cub was released in a remote area of the Santa Ana Mountains. The successful rehabilitation highlights the crucial work of wildlife rescue organizations in giving injured animals a second chance at life.</p>

Despite a strong offensive effort from Sparks players Kelsey Plum, Dearica Hamby, and Azur√° Stevens, they were unable to contain Sky rookie Angel Reese, who dominated with 24 points and 16 rebounds.

          <p>In a significant diplomatic move, China has lifted its ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant. The reversal follows an agreement to resume trade and is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve relations with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring showed no abnormalities, allowing for the conditional resumption of imports from registered and inspected Japanese facilities.</p>

          <p>Neysun Mahboubi, a U.S. expert on Chinese law at the University of Pennsylvania, believes that historical precedent offers hope for the future of U.S.-China relations. Reflecting on a recent trip to China with students, he noted that the current period of disruption feels similar to the post-1989 era, after which student and scholarly exchanges eventually resumed and flourished. While acknowledging the immense changes in China over the past 30 years, Mahboubi suggests that the underlying potential for connection and dialogue can help the relationship survive the current rupture between the two global powers.</p>
