          <p>New Orleans Saints quarterback Derek Carr has announced his retirement due to a severe shoulder injury, including a labral tear and degenerative rotator cuff. Carr, who played 11 seasons in the NFL, had joined the Saints in 2023 on a four-year, $150 million contract but struggled with injuries and inconsistent performance. His retirement comes after the Saints drafted Tyler Shough as a potential future quarterback. Carr retires with a career record of 77-92 as a starter and without a playoff win.</p>

          <p>The Channel Islands, often called California's Galapagos, are home to a diverse underwater ecosystem protected by marine protected areas (MPAs).
