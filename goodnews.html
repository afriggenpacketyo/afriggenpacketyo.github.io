          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday's drawing, following no winners in Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This substantial sum, with an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, would be the third-largest in U.S. lottery history. The current streak of 42 consecutive drawings without a jackpot winner has tied a game record, indicating widespread participation and increasing anticipation. As more tickets are purchased, there is a possibility the prize could grow further, potentially surpassing the second-largest jackpot. The odds of claiming this life-changing amount remain 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets largely experienced gains, tracking an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that bolstered the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic anxieties persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 notably rose, driven by strong performances in domestic tech stocks, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also advanced following positive household spending data. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index reversed course to fall, and mainland China's CSI 300 retreated amidst volatile trading. Meanwhile, global bond markets remain under scrutiny, with U.S. 30-year Treasury yields pushing above 5% due to various factors, including a recent court decision challenging the legality of most Trump administration tariffs.

          <p>Martha's Rule, a vital mechanism enabling families to request an urgent second opinion if concerned about a loved one's deteriorating condition, is now being implemented across all acute hospitals in England. Since its pilot launch in April 2024, the helpline has received nearly 5,000 calls, resulting in 241 interventions that potentially saved lives, as reported by NHS England. This crucial initiative was championed by the parents of 13-year-old Martha Mills, who tragically died from sepsis after her family's concerns were not addressed. The expansion, celebrated on what would have been Martha's 18th birthday, aims to empower patients and families, fostering a more collaborative and responsive healthcare environment, and is already demonstrating its profound impact on patient safety.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates that the Chinese public holds more nuanced and flexible perspectives on their nation's rivalry with the United States and its alliances with countries like Russia and North Korea, contrasting with typical American perceptions. A significant plurality, 48 percent, believe China is interested in a shared global leadership role, which suggests an openness to peaceful coexistence with the United States and the West. While respondents expressed optimism about China's future, economy, and military strength, the survey authors cautioned that self-censorship might have influenced some findings. This article suggests that understanding these complexities in Chinese public opinion could potentially open new avenues for de-escalating US-China tensions.</p>

Jackson, who vehemently denied the claims as a "political hit job," served under Presidents Bush, Obama, and Trump.
