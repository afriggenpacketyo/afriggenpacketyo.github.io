          <p>Claimants in the $725 million Facebook privacy settlement are beginning to receive their payments. The lawsuit stemmed from allegations that Facebook improperly shared user data with third parties, including Cambridge Analytica. Approved claimants are being notified via email and will receive payments through their chosen method, such as PayPal or direct deposit. The average payout is approximately $29, with the final amount depending on how long the user maintained an active account during the specified 15-year period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, savers are considering Certificates of Deposit (CDs) to lock in currently high returns. A $15,000 deposit in a one-year CD with a 4.25% annual percentage yield could earn approximately $637.50 in guaranteed interest. Longer-term CDs, such as a three-year account at 3.97%, could yield over $1,800. This article explores the potential earnings across various CD terms, highlighting them as a stable option compared to variable-rate savings accounts or volatile stocks, though funds are inaccessible without penalty for the term's duration.

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Secretary has announced that a "framework" deal has been reached with China regarding the future ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations. The agreement, forged during trade talks in Madrid, aims to pave the way for American ownership and resolve national security concerns over the app's data practices. While President Trump signaled the talks went well, Chinese officials stated that no deal would be finalized at the expense of their companies' interests. This development comes as a deadline looms for TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. arm or face a ban.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump has suggested that publicly traded companies should move from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports to encourage long-term strategic focus. In a social media post, he argued the current system fosters an unhealthy obsession with short-term profits, contrasting it with China's longer-term business perspective. While some business leaders like Warren Buffett have previously criticized quarterly guidance, investor advocates worry that less frequent reporting would reduce transparency. The change would require approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which currently holds a Republican majority. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve signals impending interest rate cuts, savers are advised to move funds from low-yield traditional savings accounts to more profitable options. This article suggests three primary destinations for a $10,000 sum to maximize returns in the current environment. These include a high-rate Certificate of Deposit (CD) to lock in a fixed return, a high-yield savings account for better returns with liquidity, or a money market account which combines high rates with check-writing capabilities. Proactive placement of funds is recommended before the anticipated rate reductions diminish earning potential. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for freelancers, gig workers, and investors with income not subject to withholding. Tax experts advise that recent tax changes enacted by the Trump administration could complicate calculations for some filers, potentially leading to overpayments if not carefully managed. To avoid underpayment penalties, taxpayers should generally pay at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's. The IRS encourages using electronic payment methods for speed and security. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates have been on a downward trend and may fall further this week as the Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce another rate cut. Lenders may preemptively lower their rates to remain competitive, potentially pushing the average below last week's 6.35% for a 30-year mortgage. The extent of the drop could depend on whether the Fed implements a standard 25-basis-point cut or a more aggressive 50-basis-point reduction. Homebuyers are advised to monitor the market closely, as these lower rates may not persist for long. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis using the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) benchmark indicates that renewable energy sources are the cheapest to produce. Onshore wind and utility-scale solar are the most cost-effective, even before accounting for government subsidies, primarily due to low operating expenses after initial investment. In contrast, fossil fuels like coal and natural gas, along with nuclear power, have higher generation costs. However, the report notes that factors like tariffs on imported components and the need for backup power sources for intermittent renewables must also be considered for a complete economic picture.

          <h2>Strategies for Accessing Funds from Annuity Retirement Accounts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities offer guaranteed retirement income but can be restrictive when cash is needed unexpectedly. This article outlines several strategic ways to access funds, including waiting for scheduled payments to begin, making a partial withdrawal of up to 10% annually, or taking a loan against the annuity's value. More drastic options involve surrendering the contract for its cash value, which incurs steep fees, or selling future payments to a third party at a discount. Each method has distinct tax implications and financial trade-offs that should be carefully considered before proceeding. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will deploy Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jets to help defend Polish airspace as part of a NATO mission to bolster its eastern flank. The move comes after Poland reported an incursion of 19 Russian drones into its territory, an act the UK defense secretary called "reckless and dangerous." The British jets will join aircraft from Denmark, France, and Germany in conducting air defense missions. This deployment underscores NATO's unified response to heightened tensions and its commitment to collective security in the region.</p>
