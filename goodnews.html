          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured his third victory of the year at the Austrian Grand Prix, narrowly holding off a persistent challenge from his teammate Oscar Piastri. The win, which marks a one-two finish for the team, narrows the gap in the drivers' championship standings ahead of next week's British Grand Prix. The race was dominated by the McLaren duo, who battled closely throughout, with Piastri briefly taking the lead before Norris reclaimed it. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finished a distant third, while a first-lap incident ended Max Verstappen's race, significantly impacting his championship position.</p>

          <p>During her Cowboy Carter tour performance in Houston, Beyonc√© was forced to abruptly stop her show when a stage prop, a suspended red Cadillac, began to tilt precariously mid-air. The 43-year-old superstar, who was sitting in the car high above the audience, clung to a flagpole for support and called for the performance to halt. The car was safely lowered to the ground without injury, and the show continued. Her company, Parkwood Entertainment, attributed the incident to a "technical mishap," which is not the first prop malfunction the singer has experienced on her recent tours.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," examines the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the American conservative movement. The book argues that Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," catalyzed a political shift that elevated figures from Barry Goldwater to Ronald Reagan and ultimately paved the way for Donald Trump. Tanenhaus and other commentators note that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics and made conservatism intellectually respectable, creating the foundation for the modern Republican Party. The biography also grapples with his controversial stances, including his early support for segregation.</p>

          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting acknowledged that the Labour government mishandled the introduction of its flagship welfare reform bill after facing a significant rebellion from its own MPs. The government was forced to make major concessions, including limiting cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (PIP) to new claimants, to avoid a defeat in the House of Commons. Streeting stated the government is now in a "better position" after listening to concerns that the original plans would harm disabled people. Rebel MPs expressed satisfaction with the changes, suggesting the bill will now pass, though the episode has raised questions about the Prime Minister's leadership.</p>

In an interview, Gunn explained his vision for a more vulnerable hero who is not indestructible and feels more grounded. Corenswet, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, embraces the character's inherent loneliness as an alien who desperately wants to be part of humanity. The film aims to highlight Superman's goodness and rebellion against meanness as his core traits, with Corenswet adding that the classic red trunks are a way to show the hero doesn't take himself too seriously.</p>

Rather than imposing strict rules, the government will allow retailers to decide on their own strategies, which could include promotions, loyalty point incentives, or store layout changes. The plan, part of a 10-year strategy for the NHS, will require major retailers to report on healthy food sales to increase accountability.

These questions assess whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts and if they can be their authentic selves without fear of judgment. They also probe whether a partner shows genuine curiosity about one's inner world and if they take accountability for their mistakes. The article posits that conflict is necessary, but how couples fight is crucial, and a lack of curiosity or accountability can lead to resentment and a loss of intimacy over time.</p>

          <p>A feature article argues that while Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, they are leading a new sexual revolution by redefining concepts like virginity and resisting traditional gendered expectations. The piece contrasts the "hookup culture" panic surrounding millennials with the current "sex recession" narrative about Gen Z. It posits that Gen Z's sexual progressivism is highly political, fueled by events like the overturning of Roe v. Wade and a desire to dismantle restrictive norms. This generation's activism seeks not just expanded access to reproductive resources but a fundamental reimagining of sex, pleasure, and identity.</p>

          <h2>Vanguard Data Shows 401(k) Balances Correlate with Income Levels</h2>

          <p>New data from Vanguard reveals a strong correlation between income and retirement savings, with higher earners accumulating significantly larger 401(k) balances. For instance, the median balance for workers earning between $100,000 and $149,999 is nearly double that of those earning between $50,000 and $74,999. The report indicates that despite economic uncertainty, Americans have continued to save, with automatic enrollment being a key factor in boosting balances. Workers automatically enrolled in their plans for at least 10 years had median balances about 60% higher than those who had to enroll voluntarily. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Startup CEO Seeks Candidates Who Can Both Strategize and Execute</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 09:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Priyanka Jain, CEO of the startup Evvy, emphasizes that the most crucial trait she looks for when hiring is the ability to both strategize and execute. She finds it concerning when a candidate is only interested in high-level strategy and sees implementation as outside their role. At a startup, Jain explains, every team member must be able to identify a problem, devise a solution, and then personally get into the details to implement it. To assess this, she asks candidates to describe a problem they solved, listening for the level of detail in their process and their enthusiasm for both sides of the work.</p>

          <h2>Couple Transforms Historic French Chateau into a Bed and Breakfast</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 08:49:57 EDT</div>

          <p>California natives Malana Moberg and Roland Salvato sold their San Francisco apartment and purchased a historic chateau in Druelle Balsac, France, for approximately $835,000. They have since invested over $300,000 into renovating the 12th-century property, turning it into a bed and breakfast that also hosts all-inclusive workshops on subjects like yoga and cooking. While the business is not yet profitable, the income it generates helps cover the chateau's significant expenses. The couple sees their venture less as a money-making enterprise and more as a passion project and a way to act as caretakers for a piece of history.</p>
