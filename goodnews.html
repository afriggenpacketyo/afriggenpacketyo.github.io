          <p>Mexico is suing Google for changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps, following Trump's executive order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that the lawsuit was filed due to Google's alteration of the oceanic basin's label, impacting Mexico and Cuba. Mexico argues the 'Gulf of America' label should only apply to the U.S. continental shelf. The article details Mexico's prior attempts to urge Google to maintain the original name, reflecting a dispute over geographic designation and sovereignty.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party in the UK, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures to reduce net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed changes include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, with a focus on the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa applications from countries with high rates of overstaying and asylum claims, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, are likely to face stricter screening. The article also mentions potential extensions to the waiting period for permanent residency and tougher English language requirements for immigrants.</p>

          <p>Former Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, believes the recent UK-US trade deal is a foundation for expanding trade opportunities between the two nations. The deal reduces or eliminates tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While the UK's Digital Services Tax was discussed, it was not abolished as part of the agreement. The article highlights the ongoing negotiations and the positive reception of the deal among other ambassadors in Washington.</p>

The goal is to attract more visitors to Hainan's duty-free shops by offering cheaper iPhones and U.S. cosmetics, particularly as domestic consumption has been sluggish and overseas tourism has recovered.</p>

          <p>Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their manufacturing operations to Vietnam in order to avoid President Trump's high tariffs on Chinese goods. This relocation trend has accelerated recently, with factories in Vietnam ramping up production and e-commerce platforms assisting companies in finding manufacturing alternatives. Vietnam is attractive due to its shared border with China and a large, young workforce. However, Vietnam faces challenges in managing this influx and negotiating trade deals with the U.S. to prevent China from using it as a backdoor for exports.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, part of a cost-cutting drive led by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The ruling favors federal employee unions, who argued that the administration's reorganization and downsizing efforts exceed its legal authority. The restraining order affects 20 federal agencies, preventing further layoffs or administrative leave for workers while the case is considered. The Trump administration argues that the cuts are designed to reduce bureaucratic bloat and save taxpayer money.</p>
