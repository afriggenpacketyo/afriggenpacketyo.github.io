          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a significant free trade agreement, hailed by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer as the most substantial deal for Britain since Brexit. The agreement will lower tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles to the UK, aiming to boost the British economy by £4.8 billion annually. In addition to the trade components, the deal establishes a new collaborative plan to address illegal migration. The agreement, which took three years to negotiate, also includes closer cooperation on defense, technology, and security.</p>

          <p>In a notable display of technological capability, a fleet of 16 drones in China transported 180 tonnes of steel and concrete to a remote mountain location. The materials were for the construction of three electricity transmission towers at altitudes up to 1,650 meters. The autonomous drones completed the task in just three days, a significant improvement over the month it would typically take using traditional cableways. According to state media, this pioneering use of a drone swarm for heavy-lift logistics increased construction efficiency by a factor of ten.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers edge rusher Tuli Tuipulotu is expected to take on a more significant role this season following the departure of veteran Joey Bosa. Though naturally quiet, Tuipulotu is growing into a leadership position, with teammates and coaches noting his on-field impact and increasing vocal presence. Last season, he led the team with 8.5 sacks despite only starting nine games, demonstrating his potential as a key playmaker. As he prepares to become a full-time starter, the focus is on his development into a central figure for the Chargers' top-ranked defense.</p>

          <p>The Mexican government has announced the dismantling of a large-scale extortion ring with ties to a major drug cartel, in what is being called the largest operation of its kind. The criminal group operated in the central State of Mexico, extorting businesses and individuals across 14 municipalities and controlling various industry labor unions. A massive security operation involving nearly 3,000 personnel resulted in the arrest of eight suspected leaders. Authorities also seized stolen animals, construction materials, and vehicles, highlighting the expanding criminal activities of cartels beyond drug trafficking.</p>

          <p>Australia has announced it will ease restrictions on U.S. beef imports, a move the Trump administration hailed as a "major trade breakthrough." The restrictions were originally put in place over concerns about mad cow disease (BSE). Australian officials stated they are now satisfied with the U.S.'s strengthened control and tracing measures for cattle from Canada and Mexico. While the U.S. administration framed this as a significant win for American farmers, some Australian analysts are skeptical that it will lead to a large influx of U.S. beef due to pricing and market dynamics.

The article advises travelers to research local customs, be aware of potential difficulties at border controls, especially for transgender and non-binary people, and offers tips for connecting with local queer communities.

          <p>Researchers are developing a powdered form of artificial blood that can be reconstituted with water to save lives in emergencies, particularly for trauma victims who bleed to death before reaching a hospital. At the University of Maryland, scientists have created "ErythroMer," an artificial red blood cell made from hemoglobin enclosed in a protective fat bubble to prevent toxicity. This synthetic blood can be stored for years without refrigeration, making it ideal for ambulances, military medics, and remote locations. While promising results have been seen in animal trials, human testing is still needed to ensure its safety and efficacy.</p>

          <p>In stark contrast to the American ideal of a single-family home, the aspirational standard of living in South Korea is the high-rise apartment complex. Today, 64% of South Korean households live in multifamily housing, a result of government policies enacted decades ago to solve a severe urban housing crisis. These large, standardized apartment complexes, or "apateu," function like miniature towns with their own amenities and are seen as symbols of upward mobility. While this model has been criticized for creating a uniform landscape and has not prevented a housing affordability crisis, it has enabled dense, efficient urban living.</p>

The article emphasizes Head Start's 60-year record of bipartisan success in giving vulnerable children a strong start.

          <p>In this essay adapted from the Mellon Lectures, playwright and actress Anna Deavere Smith explores her lifelong artistic project of understanding American character by embodying the words of others. She reflects on her upbringing, the inhibitions of being a Black child in a segregated society, and her journey into theater. Smith discusses the power of language and intention, drawing inspiration from poet Édouard Glissant's "poetics of relation"—the idea of finding oneself by taking up the problems of the Other. She connects this to the American experience, where finding a collective "us" requires confronting broken promises with hope and grace.</p>
