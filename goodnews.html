          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has emerged as the top-performing stock in the S&P 500 for June, driven by its recent inclusion in the index, favorable regulatory news, and new product launches. Analysts suggest that despite a 44% gain this month, the stock may have further growth potential, partly due to its strong revenue-sharing agreement with the newly public and soaring Circle Internet Group. While declining crypto trading volumes present a potential concern, the overall sentiment is buoyed by legislative progress like the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, which is seen as a key catalyst for the industry.

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace agreement brokered by the United States, aiming to end decades of violent conflict in eastern Congo. The deal includes provisions for disarmament of armed groups and respect for territorial integrity, and it also facilitates US access to the region's critical mineral resources. While Congolese and Rwandan officials expressed optimism about the agreement, the prominent M23 rebel group has indicated it does not consider the deal to be binding. The long-running conflict has displaced over seven million people in what the UN calls one of the world's most severe humanitarian crises.</p>

          <p>Homeowners looking to tap into their record-high equity face a choice between a home equity line of credit (HELOC) and a home equity loan, which currently have nearly identical interest rates. However, experts suggest that HELOCs are likely to become the cheaper option over the summer due to their variable rates, which are positioned to fall if the Federal Reserve implements anticipated rate cuts. In contrast, home equity loans offer a fixed rate, providing certainty but forgoing potential future savings. The decision ultimately depends on a borrower's risk tolerance and their outlook on the economy's trajectory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index achieved a new record high, closing above 6,156 for the first time as investor confidence continues to build. Despite initial concerns over international trade tensions and conflict in the Middle East, the market has surged over 20% since a low in April. Analysts attribute the rally to a rollback of some tariffs, which has eased inflation fears, and resilient economic data showing sturdy hiring and moderate price increases. The market's upward trend demonstrates a shift from concern over volatile economic policy to cautious optimism about sustained growth, though some volatility remains. (not investment advice)</p>

Coach Andy Farrell has selected a strong backline featuring fly-half Finn Russell, whose creative playmaking is seen as central to the team's strategy. The article highlights Russell's form and experience, suggesting this tour is a crucial opportunity for him to define his legacy with the Lions after unfulfilling previous tours. The Western Force, who finished low in the Super Rugby season, will be missing several key players, making the Lions strong favorites for the opening game.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the remarkable 1996 incident at a Chicago-area zoo where a gorilla named Binti Jua rescued a 3-year-old boy who had fallen into her enclosure. After the boy fell 24 feet and was knocked unconscious, the 160-pound female gorilla gently picked him up, cradled him, and carried him to a service door for zookeepers. The event garnered international praise and stands in stark contrast to the 2016 incident involving the gorilla Harambe. Binti Jua, whose actions were attributed to her maternal instincts and human-raised upbringing, is now 37 and still resides at the Brookfield Zoo.</p>

Meanwhile, President Trump asserted that Iran's nuclear program was "obliterated" and would take years to restart. However, some Democratic lawmakers expressed concern after classified briefings, suggesting that Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium may not have been destroyed and that the administration's assessment of the damage could be overly optimistic.

The strategy includes over 25 announcements through 2026, such as resurrecting the popular Hemi V-8 engine, returning to NASCAR, and offering a new industry-leading powertrain warranty. Ram's market share in the crucial full-size pickup segment has fallen significantly since 2019, and the revival plan aims to reclaim a market share of over 20%. The company is also delaying its all-electric truck models amid low demand, focusing instead on traditional and hybrid options. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists suggest several reasons for this, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, this situation may be temporary, as businesses cannot absorb these costs indefinitely. Experts, including Federal Reserve officials, anticipate that the impact of the tariffs will likely become more apparent in consumer prices in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

Since both have variable rates that may decline with future Federal Reserve cuts, the choice between them is negligible in terms of earnings.
