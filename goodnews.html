          <h2>UK Law to Extend Bereavement Leave for Miscarriages at Any Stage of Pregnancy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 04:33:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to amend the Employment Rights Bill to provide statutory bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, this right is only granted for losses occurring after 24 weeks, but the change will ensure all parents have a legal right to time off to grieve. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner said the move allows people time away from work without resorting to sick leave. Campaigners and politicians have lauded the decision as a crucial step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a form of bereavement and breaking down societal taboos surrounding the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Denmark assumes the six-month EU Council presidency, it aims to refocus the bloc's attention on green policies, which have been overshadowed by geopolitical crises and economic concerns. The Danish government is framing the green transition as essential for Europe's strategic autonomy and defense, arguing that reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels enhances security. However, this initiative faces challenges from a political backlash against climate policies and competing priorities like rearmament, which has its own carbon footprint. The proposal for a 90% emissions cut by 2040 has already met resistance from several member states, setting the stage for difficult negotiations.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of high-level academic papers and citations from 2015 to 2024 reveals that scientists of Chinese origin dominate the field of artificial intelligence. According to the report, 65 of the world's top 100 AI experts are of Chinese descent. Of these, 50 are based at research institutions and companies within China, while another 10 work at US-based institutions. The study reviewed over 96,000 papers from leading journals and conferences to assess the impact and contributions of each scientist. This highlights China's significant and growing influence in global AI research and development.</p>

          <p>AI semiconductor startup Groq, a challenger to Nvidia, has announced its first European data center in Helsinki, Finland, in partnership with Equinix. The company designs Language Processing Units (LPUs) optimized for AI inference, the process of generating results from pre-trained models. CEO Jonathan Ross highlighted that Groq's technology uses a North America-based supply chain and avoids the expensive high-bandwidth memory used by competitors, positioning it for high-volume, lower-margin inference business. The expansion reflects rising demand for sovereign AI services in Europe and leverages the Nordic region's access to renewable energy and favorable climate for data facilities.</p>

          <p>Marcus Fakana, a 19-year-old from London, has been released from a Dubai prison and has returned to the UK after receiving a royal pardon. He was sentenced to a year in prison in December for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old British girl while on holiday, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. The pardon was granted by Dubai's ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, as part of a traditional Eid gesture of compassion. The campaign group Detained in Dubai, which supported Fakana, stated the case highlights the need for legal reforms concerning foreign nationals.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The flavor of chocolate varies significantly worldwide due to differing production methods, regulations, and consumer preferences. In the United States, chocolate often contains butyric acid for a longer shelf life, which imparts a slightly sour taste that is unfamiliar to many European palates. European chocolate, particularly from Switzerland and Belgium, is strictly regulated to ensure a higher cocoa content and a finer texture through processes like conching. Meanwhile, emerging markets like India are developing their own unique flavor profiles, and in Africa, where most cocoa is grown, consumption habits often favor fresh pulp or chocolate drinks over bars.</p>

          <p>A 14-member team of British engineers has arrived in Kerala, India, to assess and repair an advanced F-35B stealth fighter jet that has been stranded at an airport for over three weeks. The jet was diverted to Thiruvananthapuram on June 14th due to bad weather during a sortie and was subsequently grounded by a technical snag. After an initial assessment by engineers from its aircraft carrier, HMS Prince of Wales, failed to resolve the issue, the specialist team was deployed from the UK with necessary equipment. The prolonged stay of the $110 million aircraft has sparked public curiosity and jokes in India.</p>

          <p>The United States has removed a ban on the sale of American jet engine parts and technology to China, a move expected to sustain production of the domestically-made C919 aircraft. The decision allows the Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China (Comac) to import critical components from a joint venture involving GE, enabling it to fulfill hundreds of existing orders for its narrowbody jet. While the deal is seen as a positive step for Comac's ambitions in the European market, analysts caution that previous US restrictions have likely strengthened Beijing's resolve to accelerate the development of its own indigenous engine technology to reduce foreign dependency.</p>

The visit, described as a friendly gesture to maintain positive relations, will include addressing Australia's stance on Chinese investment, with the port being a key issue. The port is currently operated by a Chinese-owned company under a 99-year lease, a deal that has raised national security concerns in Australia. Albanese's agenda will focus on navigating this sensitive topic while also covering routine diplomatic and trade matters between the two nations.</p>
