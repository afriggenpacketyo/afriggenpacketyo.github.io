          <p>Family offices, which cater to the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth but struggling to find qualified money managers due to trust issues and competition from other financial institutions. According to Deloitte, there were 8,030 family offices managing $3.1 trillion in assets as of last September, and this number is expected to increase to 10,720 with $5.4 trillion in assets by 2030. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, leading to challenges in finding professionals willing to work in less structured environments. To attract talent, some family offices are offering higher compensation packages and incentives like co-investment opportunities.</p>

          <p>Peter Sullivan was released after serving 38 years for a murder he did not commit, with new DNA evidence leading to his exoneration, while Victoria Beckham's clothing line received support from the Princess of Wales. Research indicates that new weight-loss drugs, GLP-1 agonists, significantly reduce the risk of strokes and heart attacks, potentially alleviating pressure on healthcare systems. Counter-terrorism police are investigating a blaze at the prime minister's London home, considering the possibility of involvement by a hostile state. The Financial Times reports on China's criticism of the UK-US trade accord, fearing it could squeeze Chinese products out of British supply chains.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he would lift sanctions on Syria before a meeting with its interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, in Saudi Arabia, a move celebrated in Damascus. The sanctions had previously blocked foreign financing, including aid, to Syria during Bashar al-Assad's regime. Al-Sharaa has called for the removal of HTS from the list of terrorist organizations. Despite promises to protect ethnic minorities, concerns remain due to clashes between security forces and Assad loyalists, as well as conflicts between Islamist armed factions and religious minorities.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program, according to Iranian officials. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with international oversight. This proposal differs from the 2015 nuclear deal by being permanent and including on-the-ground representatives from other countries, potentially addressing concerns of both Iran and the United States.</p>

          <p>Pete Buttigieg, former transportation secretary, suggested that Joe Biden's decision to run for a second term in 2024 might have been a mistake, acknowledging that "most people would agree that is the case" with hindsight. Buttigieg's remarks followed a town hall in Iowa, amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run. He affirmed that Biden was cognitively sound during their time working together, particularly during the Baltimore bridge collapse. Buttigieg also emphasized the need for the Democratic party to "meet people where they are" and avoid returning to the status quo of 2023.</p>

A recent poll indicated that three out of four Ph.D. or postdoctoral students in the U.S. are considering leaving due to the Trump administration's policies.
