          <p>England football legend Wayne Rooney has defended his generation of players, asserting that their lack of international success was not due to a poor attitude, contrary to Steven Gerrard's recent comments. Gerrard had described the team as "egotistical losers" who lacked cohesion. Rooney, speaking on his BBC podcast, acknowledged they didn't win anything but insisted they worked hard and tried their best. He suggested that current England squads benefit from better media relations and a different generation of players training together. Rooney maintained that despite the rivalries, everyone on his team was committed to each other. </p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, will announce at their annual conference that his party is prepared to replace Welsh Labour in the upcoming Senedd election. Labour has governed Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent polls suggest Plaid Cymru is now vying for leadership, alongside Reform UK. Ap Iorwerth aims to position Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, offering "new energy and new ideas" and presenting themselves as the leading anti-Reform party. While independence is a long-term goal, the party's immediate focus for the 2026 vote will be on delivering radical yet financially prudent policies, such as a child poverty payment. </p>

          <p>Prince William was visibly moved while discussing the profound impact of suicide, pausing during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, whose husband took his own life five days after their infant son's death. Mannings, who subsequently founded the bereavement charity 2wish, shared her personal tragedy and the stigma surrounding suicide. The Prince of Wales announced that his Royal Foundation is committing £1 million to establish a National Suicide Prevention Network across the UK. This network aims to better understand the root causes of suicide, provide accessible support, and foster collaboration among various agencies and charities. </p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect widespread hope for peace in Gaza following a tentative ceasefire deal, with some crediting President Trump for the breakthrough. The Daily Mirror urges the US and allies to ensure the deal leads to a comprehensive peace, warning of potential derailment if Israel reneges or terrorists intervene. The Daily Telegraph, however, highlights significant sticking points in Trump's 20-point framework, including Hamas's reluctance to disarm and unresolved questions about an international stabilization force. The Financial Times also points to uncertainties regarding which countries would contribute troops. The prospect of peace is met with cautious optimism, acknowledging the complex path ahead. </p>

          <p>Eva Maria Pommer, a 35-year-old German citizen whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004, has finally been identified after 21 years through the international police campaign Operation Identify Me. A crucial tip-off following a German TV appeal led to DNA confirmation of her identity. Known as "the woman with the German keys," her body was discovered in sand dunes near Wassenaar with no obvious signs of injury. The identification marks the fourth success for Operation Identify Me, which utilizes Interpol's public "black notices" and global police collaboration to name women who died in suspicious circumstances. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a breakthrough discovery, finding that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity. This innovative method opens new possibilities for harnessing clean power in cold environments. The research team observed that when salt-doped ice was bent, it produced an electrical response comparable to high-performing ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, the generation of an electrical charge when a material undergoes non-uniform strain. The discovery could lead to the development of low-cost energy sources in frigid regions. </p>

          <p>China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have issued a joint policy paper to curb intense, self-destructive price competition in certain industries.

Regulators will guide industry associations to assess average production costs and help companies set reasonable prices. Authorities will monitor market competition, warn businesses engaging in price wars, and intervene with cost investigations and price inspections when necessary, with violations to be dealt with according to law.

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills is anticipated to launch her Senate campaign next Tuesday, aiming to unseat long-serving Republican Senator Susan Collins.

As a top recruit for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, she will join a growing primary field, including progressive oyster farmer Graham Platner. The Maine Senate race is seen as a crucial opportunity for Democrats to potentially flip a GOP-held seat and challenge the Republican majority in the Senate, given the state's Democratic leanings. </p>

Domestically, she aims to revive Abenomics with a nationalist twist, focusing on state-led industrial revival and strategic investments in defense and technology to reduce reliance on China.

          <p>Battlefield 6, the latest installment in the military shooter series, is poised to challenge Call of Duty with significant investment and a renewed focus on player feedback. Developed by four EA-owned studios, the game aims to overcome the negative reception of its predecessor, Battlefield 2042. A preview weekend garnered "explosively positive" feedback, and the new game restores a single-player campaign, a feature missing from the previous title. Despite the project's scale and the reported hundreds of millions spent, developers express excitement about its potential.

Other bills enhance transparency, require comparable insurance for manufactured homes, and mandate an automatic payment plan for customers.
