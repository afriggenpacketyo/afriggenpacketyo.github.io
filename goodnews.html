          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean and is projected to intensify into a hurricane later this week. The storm is currently far from land but is moving west-northwest, with its core expected to pass near or north of the Leeward Islands. A tropical storm watch has been issued for several islands in the chain, which are bracing for heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding. Forecasters are also warning of life-threatening surf and rip current conditions as the storm generates significant swells.</p>

          <p>England manager Thomas Tuchel has stated that his team will enter the 2026 World Cup as "underdogs," emphasizing that they have "no chance" of winning unless they perform with strong team cohesion. Despite recent successes, including reaching consecutive European Championship finals, England has not won the World Cup since 1966. Tuchel argues that nations like Brazil, Argentina, Spain, and France are the true favorites due to their recent victories in the tournament. He stressed the importance of building a unified group to overcome historical and environmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has reached a settlement with four former top Twitter executives, including ex-CEO Parag Agrawal, over a $128 million lawsuit for unpaid severance. The executives alleged they were fired "without reason" immediately after Musk's 2022 acquisition of the company, which was a move to deny them their contractual severance packages. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed in the court filing. This case was one of several legal actions brought by former employees over severance pay following the massive layoffs that occurred after Musk took control of the platform, now known as X.</p>

          <p>The last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in May has been apprehended in Atlanta, ending a months-long manhunt. Derrick Groves, a convicted murderer, was found hiding in a crawl space following a brief standoff with a SWAT team. His capture was the result of a coordinated effort by multiple law enforcement agencies, aided by tips from the public. Over a dozen people, including Groves's apparent girlfriend, have been arrested for allegedly assisting the escapees, who broke out by climbing through a hole behind a toilet.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor is facing criticism after her team, a favorite in the Women's Champions League, was held to a 1-1 draw by Twente. Pundits suggest Bompastor underestimated the Dutch champions by making seven changes to the starting lineup, resulting in a "disjointed" performance. Despite dominating possession and creating numerous chances, Chelsea only managed to score via a penalty, canceling out Twente's opener. Bompastor admitted the result was not good enough and that her team needed to show more desire and clinical finishing to succeed in the competition.</p>

          <p>After 61 years, police in Albany, New York, have solved the murder of Catherine Blackburn, who was killed in her home in 1964. Authorities used modern DNA technology to link Joseph Nowakowski, a man with a lengthy criminal record who died in 1998, to the crime. The breakthrough came after investigators exhumed Nowakowski's body to obtain a DNA sample, which matched evidence preserved from the original crime scene. Blackburn's niece, who discovered her aunt's body six decades ago, expressed relief and gratitude that the case was finally closed.</p>

Acknowledging the party's bleak polling numbers, she introduced a blitz of new policies, highlighted by a plan to abolish stamp duty on main home purchases. The move is part of a strategy to position the Conservatives as the wise custodians of public finances, differentiating them from Labour and Reform UK. The speech was seen by some internal skeptics as a positive step to energize the party's base.</p>

          <p>The band Spaghetti Cumbia has created a unique musical style by blending the traditional Latin sounds of their heritage with the rock, punk, and hip-hop influences of their Los Angeles upbringing. The members, who grew up in the predominantly Latino neighborhoods of Boyle Heights and East LA, describe their sound as a fusion reflecting their identity of being caught between Mexican and American cultures. Music provided them an alternative to the gang violence prevalent in their youth, and they have since built a dedicated following with high-energy performances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to borrow money, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) is currently a much more affordable option than using a credit card. The average interest rate for a credit card is over 22%, whereas the median rate for a HELOC is just under 8%, making credit card debt nearly three times more expensive. While both have variable rates, the significant starting difference means HELOCs will remain the cheaper choice. Furthermore, the interest paid on a HELOC may be tax-deductible if the funds are used for qualifying home improvement projects. (not investment advice)</p>
