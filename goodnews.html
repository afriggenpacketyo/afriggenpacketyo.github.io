          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 23:57:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against President Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to expedite the deportation of Venezuelan migrants, asserting that there is "no invasion or predatory incursion." The Trump administration had been using this obscure law to deport alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, some of whom were later transferred to a supermax prison in El Salvador. The court found that encouraging illegal immigration does not equate to an armed, organized force harming the United States. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction, preventing the use of the Alien Enemies Act to remove the migrants who sued in the Northern District of Texas, although the government can still deport them under other legal avenues. The article focuses on the legal challenges to the Trump administration's immigration policies and the court's decision to limit the use of the Alien Enemies Act. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers and marines to Los Angeles in response to protests was illegal. The judge accused the Trump administration of turning the military into a "national police force," violating a law from 1878. The deployment was controversial, with the LA mayor condemning it as political theater. Trump described LA as an "invaded" and "occupied city," which the judge said did not reflect reality. This ruling is a setback to Trump's ambition to federalize Democrat-run cities and deploy the National Guard in other states. The article focuses on the legal challenges to the Trump administration's actions and the limits of presidential power. </p>
