        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a recent interview, actor Denzel Washington forcefully dismissed the concept of "cancel culture," questioning the importance of public support and social media followers. He stated that he does not fear being canceled because his guidance comes from his faith in God, not from popular opinion, asserting that one cannot lead and follow at the same time. Washington emphasized that his focus is on a higher power and that he has little concern for the currency of online approval, a sentiment echoed by director Spike Lee.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search team located him using a drone, and a California Highway Patrol helicopter hoisted him to safety. He was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leading academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to implement a top-down strategy to speed up its development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building orbital stations that convert solar energy to electricity and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather. The call to action highlights the need for China to close the technological gap with the United States and establish a stronger position in both the new energy sector and the broader space race.</p>

          <h2>Advocates Propose 'Lighthouse Parenting' as an Alternative to Intensive Child-Rearing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 10:52:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The concept of a "Lighthouse Parent" is being presented as a healthier alternative to the trend of intensive parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide for their children, providing safety and clarity when needed without controlling every aspect of their journey. Proponents argue that resisting the natural impulse to immediately solve a child's problems fosters greater confidence and resilience in children while being less exhausting for the parents themselves, ultimately benefiting the entire family dynamic.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized a £180,000 deposit that controversial influencer Andrew Tate paid for a special-edition Aston Martin Valhalla. A court granted the forfeiture order after the police argued the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, stemming from his online businesses. This seizure adds to the £2.7 million previously confiscated from Tate and his brother by the same police force under the Proceeds of Crime Act. The money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs.</p>

          <p>A program named Dec My Dorm is providing crucial support to students transitioning from the foster care system to college by outfitting them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, and the initiative aims to level the playing field by supplying items like bedding, towels, and school supplies. By doing so, the program helps alleviate the financial and emotional stress on these students, allowing them to start their higher education journey feeling prepared, supported, and equal to their peers.</p>

          <p>Therapist Sadie Salazar advocates for a simple yet powerful morning ritual to ensure a successful day: waking up early, no matter what. She explains that this practice creates crucial personal time that helps her feel grounded and avoids the chaos of a rushed morning. Instead of adhering to a rigid schedule, she uses this extra hour for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading a book or walking her dog, which she finds boosts her creativity and sets a positive tone for the rest of the day.</p>

          <p>Recent data indicates that Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This shift is partly credited to Samsung's innovation in foldable screen technology, with models like the Z Fold 7 gaining traction, and its strategy of offering a wider range of products at various price points. The trend suggests a renewed rivalry, pressuring Apple to potentially introduce new form factors, such as a foldable iPhone, in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>To develop emotional endurance, Columbia-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps to better withstand stress and discomfort. First, use a visual aid to understand that frustration is a natural part of the learning process. Second, practice positive self-talk to reframe your internal dialogue from self-criticism to support. Finally, undertake small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which trains your body and mind to tolerate discomfort and builds resilience over time.</p>
