          <p>In a stunning conclusion to one of the most thrilling Test series in recent memory, India defeated England by just six runs at The Oval. The match came down to the final moments, with an injured Chris Woakes bravely coming out to bat in a sling, creating a scene of high drama. Despite a valiant effort from England to chase a record target of 374, India's bowlers held their nerve to clinch the win and draw the five-match series 2-2. The victory was celebrated enthusiastically by India's players and their large contingent of supporters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trio of Republican senators has introduced legislation aimed at providing independent contractors and gig workers with access to benefits like health insurance and retirement savings. The proposal would create a system for portable benefits, shielding companies that offer them from worker misclassification lawsuits, a long-standing concern for firms like Uber and Lyft. While proponents argue this supports the modern workforce, labor unions strongly oppose the measures. Unions view it as a way to solidify contractor status, thereby preventing workers from gaining core protections and the right to unionize.</p>

          <p>A new tropical storm, named Dexter, has formed in the western Atlantic Ocean, marking an uptick in activity for the 2025 hurricane season. The storm is currently located several hundred miles northwest of Bermuda and is moving away from the United States coastline. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center state that no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, and the storm is not expected to pose any hazards to land. While Dexter may see some slight strengthening over the next couple of days, it is projected to become a post-tropical system by midweek.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is making another run for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska as an independent, challenging incumbent Republican Pete Ricketts. Despite losing his first bid, Osborn narrowed the Republican margin of victory significantly in a state that heavily favored Donald Trump, giving him confidence for a new campaign. Osborn is positioning himself as a working-class alternative to the wealthy Ricketts, arguing that voters are tired of the two-party system. The state Democratic party, seeing him as an ally, has decided to support his campaign in this deeply Republican state.</p>

The Police Records Access Project, a collaboration between UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and several news outlets, includes 1.5 million pages of documents from nearly 700 law enforcement agencies. This initiative vastly expands public access to internal affairs records that were previously difficult to obtain. The project aims to increase transparency and accountability by showing how police departments across the state handle allegations of misconduct and incidents resulting in serious injury or death.</p>

          <h2>Children Say They Would Use Phones Less if They Had More Real-World Freedom to Play</h2>

          <p>A new survey of American children reveals a strong desire for more unstructured, in-person play, suggesting an alternative to the screen-centric childhood. The poll found that while most children are not allowed to be in public without adult supervision, they would prefer to be exploring their neighborhoods with friends. Many children reported they would spend less time online if they had more opportunities for unsupervised play with peers. The article argues that parental fears have restricted children's independence, pushing them toward the digital world as the only space where they can socialize freely.</p>

          <h2>Global Fur Production Plummets in a Decade Amid Ethical and Economic Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 06:45:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global production of farmed fur has experienced a dramatic collapse over the past ten years, falling from over 140 million animals in 2014 to just 20.5 million in 2024. This sharp decline is attributed to a successful and sustained campaign by animal welfare advocates, which has led to major fashion brands like Gucci and Prada going fur-free. The shift has been accelerated by legislative bans on fur farming and sales in numerous countries, the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on mink farms, and changing economic conditions in major markets like Russia and China. This marks a significant victory for the animal rights movement.</p>

          <p>CK Asset Holdings, on behalf of Hong Kong's wealthiest family, has issued a strong denial of rumors circulating on social media that their iconic residence at 79 Deep Water Bay Road is for sale. The company described the speculation as "entirely fabricated" and "groundless." Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, the company's chairman, urged the public to be wary of such rumors, particularly given the rise in online scams. The denial comes at a time when other prominent Hong Kong families have been forced to sell assets at a discount due to economic pressures and high borrowing costs.</p>

          <p>China's central bank is intensifying efforts to promote the international use of its currency, the yuan, seizing on what it perceives as growing doubts about the stability of the U.S. dollar. The People's Bank of China announced plans to accelerate the yuan's use in trade, enhance its financing functions, and strengthen its offshore market infrastructure. This includes expanding the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) to support overseas clearing. The move signals a clear strategic push by Beijing to increase its financial influence and provide an alternative to the dollar-dominated global financial system.</p>

          <p>The UK Home Office has announced an extra £100 million in funding to intensify its crackdown on illegal people-smuggling gangs operating in the English Channel. The new funds will support up to 300 additional National Crime Agency officers and provide new technology to help track and disrupt the criminal networks. This move comes as the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats has reached a record high for this point in the year. The government aims to show it is taking action to reduce the crossings and dismantle the gangs profiting from them.</p>

          <p>A new federal report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health has revealed a positive trend in adolescent mental health. The data, covering the period between 2021 and 2024, shows that the prevalence of major depression, serious suicidal thoughts, and suicide attempts among teenagers has declined. For instance, serious suicidal thoughts in 12-to-17-year-olds fell from nearly 13% to 10%. Experts find the results hopeful, suggesting that increased openness and better access to targeted treatments may be contributing factors, though challenges in accessing care remain for many.</p>

          <p>Environmental advocates are calling on the State Water Resources Control Board to impose stricter limits on water diversions by Los Angeles to help restore Mono Lake. Despite a 1994 order to raise the lake's level, it remains about nine feet below the target, which activists say is harming the ecosystem and bird populations. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power contends the lake is relatively healthy and that its levels are more influenced by wet or dry years. However, some L.A. officials have expressed a desire to explore ways to lessen the city's reliance on the Mono Basin's water.</p>
