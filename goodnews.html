          <p>Honda has confirmed it is ending the production of its Acura ZDX electric vehicle, which was being assembled by General Motors at a plant in Tennessee. The decision was attributed to evolving market conditions and a desire to align its product portfolio with customer needs and long-term strategy. While the ZDX is being discontinued, production of the Honda Prologue, another EV built in partnership with GM, will continue in Mexico. GM stated the move does not reflect on the workforce or its relationship with Honda, but rather on aligning EV production with slower-than-expected consumer demand.</p>

          <p>As families gather for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, chefs and home cooks are redefining traditional holiday meals with modern interpretations, blending heritage with contemporary tastes. From a cookbook featuring 17 different kugel recipes to a restaurant serving a grandmother's schnitzel, these culinary efforts honor generational traditions while making them accessible to new audiences. This trend reflects a broader movement of rediscovering and celebrating Jewish culture through food, connecting younger generations to their history. The article highlights how these updated recipes serve not just as meals but as expressions of identity and remembrance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, though the change is minimal. For a 10-year loan, the current monthly payment is approximately $989, while a 15-year term costs around $779 per month. These figures are only a few dollars cheaper than they were before the rate cut and earlier in the year. While any reduction in cost is beneficial, the minor change suggests that homeowners should carefully weigh their options and compare rates with other borrowing products before leveraging their home's equity.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit against The Hershey Company that claimed its Reese's Halloween candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the wrappers depicted detailed, spooky faces on treats like pumpkins and ghosts, while the actual chocolates were featureless. The judge ruled that the consumers failed to demonstrate economic harm, noting that the candies were not rendered worthless by the lack of artistic detail. While disappointed by the appearance, the plaintiffs still received the product they paid for, and the judge concluded their subjective expectations did not constitute a concrete injury.</p>

          <p>In Orange County, California, a flamenco dance program led by instructor Laura Gutierrez Vila is teaching students about the rich cultural heritage of the Spanish folk art form. Originally from Valencia, Spain, Vila founded Laviva Flamenco to share her lifelong passion for the dance, which combines passionate movements with complex rhythms. The art form itself is a cultural fusion, incorporating influences from Romani travelers, North African musicians, and even Spanish colonies, with elements like the Peruvian cajón now staples in performances. Through her classes and performances, Vila aims to keep the vibrant and diverse history of flamenco alive.</p>

          <h2>Advanced AI Models Can Now Pass the Highest Level of the CFA Exam in Minutes</h2>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing the Level III Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, a feat that typically requires humans around 1,000 hours of study. A study from NYU Stern School of Business and GoodFin evaluated 23 large language models, finding that top-tier AI could successfully answer the difficult essay and multiple-choice questions focused on portfolio management. While previous studies showed AI could pass the first two levels, this marks a significant leap in its analytical reasoning capabilities. However, experts believe AI will not replace human financial analysts, who provide essential context and intent.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who spent 38 years in prison for a murder he did not commit, has been awarded a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood, California. Hastings was exonerated in 2022 after new DNA evidence not only cleared him but also identified another suspect in the 1983 kidnapping, sexual assault, and murder of Roberta Wydermyer. His lawsuit alleged that an Inglewood police detective falsified evidence and ignored information pointing to the real perpetrator, who died in prison in 2020. The settlement is believed to be the largest for a wrongful conviction in California's history.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a rule change that would eliminate the $25,000 minimum equity requirement for individuals classified as pattern day traders. This long-standing rule, established during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in a five-day period to maintain a high account balance. The new proposal, which awaits SEC approval, will replace the fixed minimum with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken. This change reflects the evolution of market technology and is expected to make active trading more accessible to smaller retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sales of newly built single-family homes in the U.S. jumped by a much larger-than-expected 20.5% in August, reaching their fastest pace since early 2022. This surge occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, suggesting that builder incentives and price cuts were a primary driver. Analysts note that while the data is promising, new home sales figures are often volatile and subject to revision. The increase was strongest in the Northeast and the South, while inventory of available new homes decreased to a 7.4-month supply, down from a nine-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers on the Texas coast have been surprised by the appearance of multiple rare and massive "pink meanie" jellyfish washing ashore. This species, scientifically known as Drymonema larsoni, was only identified in 2011 and can grow to have tentacles up to 70 feet long. Known for their distinct color, these jellyfish primarily prey on the much smaller and more common moon jellyfish, following their blooms in warm waters. According to a researcher at Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi, more than ten have been spotted recently. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be relatively mild.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has named Boeing his "favorite stock" in his investment club's portfolio, citing the recent dip in its share price as a buying opportunity. This endorsement comes as U.S. lawmakers pressure China to include Boeing aircraft orders in a new trade deal and as the company partners with Palantir for AI integration. Cramer also commented on the recent Federal Reserve rate cut, noting that the desired drop in long-term Treasury yields has not yet materialized, which affects interest-rate-sensitive stocks. He also addressed concerns about vendor financing related to Nvidia's large investment in OpenAI. (not investment advice)</p>
