          <p>Asia-Pacific markets experienced a significant uplift on Monday, tracking positive movements on Wall Street following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's indication of a potential interest rate cut next month. Major benchmarks like Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi recorded notable gains, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 also saw an increase. Investors are closely monitoring upcoming economic data, including Singapore's consumer price index, and eagerly anticipating artificial intelligence giant Nvidia's earnings report. This market optimism follows robust performances by the Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite at the close of last week's trading session, reflecting a hopeful outlook for global economic stability.

          <p>Jerry Adler, a distinguished figure who transitioned from a decades-long career behind the scenes on Broadway to a notable acting presence in his 60s, has died peacefully at the age of 96. Adler was widely recognized for his roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." Before his on-screen success, he contributed to 53 Broadway productions as a stage manager, producer, or director, working with legends like Marlene Dietrich. His unexpected acting career, sparked by a casting director's hunch, brought him consistent work for over 30 years. Adler published a memoir last year and expressed a deep enjoyment for his work, considering retirement "a road to nowhere."</p>

          <p>SpaceX aborted its tenth Super Heavy-Starship test flight on Sunday evening from the Texas Gulf Coast, citing an issue with ground systems during the fueling process. This postponement follows three consecutive catastrophic in-flight failures, with the company aiming to test upgrades and deliberately stress the vehicle. The mission's objectives included a booster landing burn test with an intentionally disabled engine and a Starship suborbital trajectory with satellite deployment and an in-space engine restart. The Starship program is crucial for launching next-generation Starlinks and for NASA's Artemis moon landing mission, which relies on numerous successful Starship flights for in-space refueling, making the 2027 moon landing target increasingly challenging.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Generation Z has sparked a burgeoning fashion craze centered around ball-jointed dolls, leading to significant economic activity in the niche market for doll clothing. Enthusiasts like 21-year-old Clementine Cai report spending upwards of 3,000 yuan on doll outfits alone, often surpassing their personal clothing budgets, driven by the dolls' aesthetic appeal and potential for creative expression through photography. Data from prominent Chinese e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, indicates a remarkable year-on-year increase of over 117% in doll clothing sales for 2024. This trend culminated in May, when sales for this specific product category exceeded the 10-million-yuan (approximately $1.4 billion) threshold for the first time, underscoring its growing impact on the economy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' struggling offense found its rhythm in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, avoiding a sweep. Manager Dave Roberts had called for more disciplined at-bats and a team-first mindset, which materialized in a nine-hit, four-walk outburst. The decisive moment came in a five-run seventh inning, featuring a go-ahead three-run home run by Dalton Rushing and Freddie Freeman's second long ball of the day. This offensive resurgence, after two low-scoring losses, propelled the Dodgers back into a first-place tie with the Padres, showcasing their ability to combine competitive plate appearances with their characteristic slugging power.</p>

          <p>Lourdes, France, remains a significant site of faith and healing, with the Catholic Church recognizing over 70 medical miracles connected to The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes over 163 years. Annually, more than 3 million pilgrims visit, drawn by stories of miraculous recoveries. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates claims over decades, seeking cases of severe, suddenly, completely, and lastingly cured diseases with no medical explanation. Since 2022, two more miracles have been recognized, bringing the total to 72. Skeptics note the historical context of medical science, but no one has disproven the office's conclusions, with an analysis finding their determinations credible.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history on Sunday, hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics, establishing a new single-season record for catchers. This achievement surpasses Salvador Perez's 2021 total and also marked Raleigh's ninth multi-home run game of the season, breaking Mickey Mantle's record for switch-hitters. Raleigh, a first-time All-Star, has consistently increased his home run tally in recent seasons and could become the first American League catcher to outright lead the major leagues in home runs. His success follows a significant contract extension and a Home Run Derby win earlier this year.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, now the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, developed southeast of Bermuda on Saturday and is tracking north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean. As of Sunday evening, the storm was situated approximately 295 miles east of Bermuda, maintaining maximum sustained winds of 45 mph. Forecasters predict Fernand will experience slight strengthening through Monday before gradually weakening on Tuesday, with its projected path keeping it over open waters well east and northeast of Bermuda. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has forecasted an above-normal hurricane season for this year, and Fernand follows Hurricane Erin, which previously intensified into a ferocious Category 5 storm in a similar area earlier in August.</p>

Eight years later, their reunion for an award ceremony transformed Berthia's life, inspiring him to establish a foundation dedicated to destigmatizing mental illness.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 16:55:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United's new £200 million attacking lineup, featuring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is experiencing early "teething problems" in scoring goals from open play. Despite a pre-season win, the team has managed only one open-play goal in four subsequent matches, relying on penalties and own goals. Manager Ruben Amorim attributes some struggles to new players adapting and the team's tendency to defend leads rather than maintain offensive pressure. While individual talents like Cunha have shown promise, the attack currently lacks cohesion. With a quiet European schedule, the club has time to integrate its new signings, but pressure mounts to translate significant investment into tangible on-field improvements.</p>
