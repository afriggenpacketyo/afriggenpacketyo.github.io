          <h2>M&S Online Services to Face Delays Due to Cyberattack</h2>

          <p>Marks & Spencer has announced that its online services will experience disruptions until July following a sophisticated cyberattack that occurred over the Easter weekend, impacting click-and-collect and contactless payments. The retailer estimates the attack will reduce profits by around ¬£300 million this year. Despite the disruption, M&S CEO Stuart Machin stated there is no change to the company's long-term strategy to reshape M&S for growth, and the incident allows them to accelerate the pace of change. The cyberattack is believed to be the work of Scattered Spider, using illicit tools from DragonForce.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 02:46:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Tokyo Metropolitan Government will waive basic water utility charges for households for four months this summer to encourage residents to use air conditioning without worrying about costs amid increasingly extreme heat. A supplementary budget bill of 36.8 billion yen ($256 million) will be submitted to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly to cover the costs. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike stated that the measure aims to protect residents' lives and daily living, given declining real wages and predictions of an extremely hot summer. About 8.2 million households are expected to benefit, saving around 5,000 yen on their water bills over the four months.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has become the first author writing in the Kannada language to win the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp'. The collection features 12 short stories that capture the hardships of Muslim women living in southern India. Mushtaq shared the ¬£50,000 prize with Deepa Bhasthi, who translated the stories into English. Mushtaq's work mirrors many of the challenges faced by the women in her stories, brought on by religious conservatism and a deeply patriarchal society. She hopes her win will encourage more translations from and into Kannada and other South Asian languages.</p>

          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British businesses operating in China report growing challenges due to regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, geopolitical uncertainties, and perceived depreciation of foreign firms in China‚Äôs evolving industrial policy. Despite these issues, British firms continue to demonstrate substantial engagement with, and commitment to, the Chinese market, according to the British Chamber of Commerce in China. Escalating tensions between China and the US have further complicated matters, causing delays in investments both in China and globally with any China exposure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed the End-of-Life Options Act into law, making Delaware the 11th state to legalize physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients. The law allows mentally capable adults diagnosed with a terminal illness and given six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. Patients must be presented with other end-of-life care options, and the law requires two waiting periods and a second medical opinion. The bill's signing ends nearly a decade of debate on the issue in Delaware.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered seven shutout innings, but the Dodgers needed a 10th-inning rally to secure a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Tanner Scott blew a save in the ninth, and Corbin Carroll's two-run homer in the 10th put the Dodgers on the brink of a fifth straight loss. However, the Dodgers rallied with an RBI double by Tommy Edman, intentional walks, and a hit by pitch, culminating in Max Muncy's sacrifice fly to win the game. Despite inconsistencies, the Dodgers avoided a total disaster on their homestand.</p>

Kashiwara feels the beauty of math when proving something new and appreciates Norway's emphasis on math education. He worries that Japan's university entrance examinations and the perception of math as a memorization subject could deter students from pursuing careers in the field. He also sees potential in China's proactive approach to attracting specialists.</p>

          <h2>First Blood Test for Alzheimer's Disease to Be Available in US</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 00:51:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The first blood test to help diagnose Alzheimer‚Äôs disease will be available in the US starting in late June, following regulatory clearance. The test, developed by Fujirebio Holdings, will initially be available at research institutes and hospitals specializing in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. The test detects amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer‚Äôs, and offers a quicker and less expensive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests. This development is viewed as a critical step in making new Alzheimer‚Äôs treatments widely accessible.</p>
