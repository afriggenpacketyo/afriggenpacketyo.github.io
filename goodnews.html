          <p>Turkish presidential advisors are drafting new regulations to address significant food waste, particularly from the country's popular and expansive all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional "Serpme Kahvalti" breakfasts. With an estimated 8.7 million tons of food discarded annually in Turkey, proponents argue that reducing waste is a matter of national security, citing economic and environmental costs. Critics, however, suggest a potential conflict of interest, as some officials involved have ties to the restaurant or hotel industries, and question whether the lucrative all-inclusive tourism model will genuinely be reformed.</p>

Chathli, a chemistry graduate and co-founder of a girls' cricket academy, reflects on her journey from a young county player to delivering on the sport's biggest domestic stage.

Despite her wealth, Guo maintains a rigorous daily routine that includes 5:30 a.m. wake-ups, back-to-back gym sessions, and working through lunch, embodying a relentless "always-on" work culture. She argues that true work-life balance is achievable even with long hours by eliminating time wasted on passive activities like watching TV. Guo believes that new founders, in particular, need to work 90-hour weeks to successfully launch their companies.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed its eruption, marking its 31st eruptive event since December. The eruption, contained within the summit crater of Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, featured lava fountains shooting up to 100 feet high. Scientists at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory explain that this series of episodic eruptions is part of an ongoing process where magma builds up and is periodically released. The spectacular natural display poses no threat to homes and has become a major attraction for visitors and a subject of cultural reverence for Native Hawaiians.</p>

The game's only touchdown came late in the third quarter on a 33-yard pass from Ohio State-committed quarterback Luke Fahey to Jack Junker. Both teams showcased formidable defenses, with Santa Margarita's defensive line stopping Mission Viejo on two separate goal-line stands. Fahey's mobility and clutch play proved to be the decisive factor, completing 16 of 22 passes for 169 yards against relentless pressure from the Santa Margarita defense.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has broadened a ruling that prevents the Trump administration from withholding federal funds from cities and counties with "sanctuary" policies. U.S. District Judge William Orrick extended a preliminary injunction to protect Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and 30 other jurisdictions that limit their cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. The judge's previous order had already protected several other cities. The ruling deems the administration's executive orders, which threaten to cut off billions of dollars in funding, an unconstitutional "coercive threat" against state and local governments.</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a man who was wrongfully deported to El Salvador by the Trump administration despite a judge's order protecting him, has been released from federal custody. After his erroneous deportation, where he was held in a maximum-security prison, he was returned to the U.S. only to be detained on charges of conspiring to transport immigrants. A Maryland judge's ruling has now allowed for his release into home detention with his family while he challenges any new deportation order. Homeland Security officials have strongly criticized the release, maintaining that Garcia is a member of the MS-13 gang, a claim his lawyers deny.</p>

          <p>Malaysia has announced a ban on the export of unprocessed rare earth minerals, a strategic move aimed at developing its own downstream industries and capturing more value from its natural resources. The policy is designed to attract foreign investment in local processing facilities, requiring projects to include technology transfers and job creation. This decision positions Malaysia as a key player in the global supply chain for these critical minerals, which are essential for many modern technologies. The move is particularly significant as the United States and other nations seek to diversify their rare earth sources away from China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the leading destination for initial public offerings (IPOs) by mainland Chinese companies this year, overtaking the United States. So far in 2025, 46 Chinese firms have raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong, compared to just 16 listings raising $740.9 million in the U.S. The shift is attributed to stronger post-listing stock performance in Hong Kong and persistent geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China, which create regulatory uncertainty and delisting risks for Chinese firms on American exchanges. This trend marks a significant milestone for Hong Kong's capital market. (not investment advice)</p>
