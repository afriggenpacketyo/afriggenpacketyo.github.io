          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 14:35:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing hormone therapy and social accommodations to transgender inmates while they challenge President Trump's executive order restricting such treatments. Judge Royce Lamberth granted a preliminary injunction sought by three transgender inmates diagnosed with gender dysphoria. The lawsuit argues that the executive order violates the Administrative Procedure Act by arbitrarily depriving inmates of medically necessary treatments. The judge found that the administration provided no adequate explanation for treating gender dysphoria differently from other mental health conditions. </p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung of the opposition party has won the South Korean presidency following a period of political chaos that included the impeachment and removal of his predecessor, Yoon Suk Yeol. Lee's victory comes after Yoon's martial law bid failed, triggering massive protests. Lee faces the challenge of uniting a deeply divided country and negotiating a trade deal with the U.S. President Donald Trump. His win is seen as a rejection of the ruling People Power Party, which was tainted by Yoon's actions. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why Wall Street values CrowdStrike's stock more highly than Palo Alto Networks, despite CrowdStrike having a higher price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Investors are willing to pay more for CrowdStrike's earnings due to its faster growth potential and software subscription model, which leads to higher margins. While both companies are leaders in the cybersecurity industry and are considered long-term holdings, CrowdStrike is seen as having more growth potential. The article concludes that both stocks are valuable, but investors are paying a premium for CrowdStrike's anticipated future growth (not investment advice). </p>

          <p>Los Angeles Opera concluded its season with a new production of Verdi's "Rigoletto," featuring a violent and politically disquieting interpretation. Baritone Quinn Kelsey's performance as Rigoletto was praised for its intensity, set against a backdrop of mob rule inspired by films of Federico Fellini and Luis Bu√±uel. Despite some shortcomings in the set design, the cast's strength and James Conlon's conducting contributed to a compelling performance. Lisette Oropesa's portrayal of Gilda and Ren√© Barbera's performance as the Duke also garnered positive reviews. </p>

          <p>With above-normal temperatures expected this summer, Americans are likely to face higher electricity bills. Home electricity bills are projected to reach a 12-year high, impacting lower-income households the most. Experts recommend using fans instead of or in addition to air conditioners, changing AC filters regularly, and setting thermostats to higher temperatures when leaving home. Other tips include using indoor plants for shade, closing curtains during the day, and unplugging unused appliances. State governments and utility companies may offer assistance programs to help reduce energy costs. </p>
