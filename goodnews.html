          <p>A 39-year-old man undergoing cancer treatment has sparked debate after refusing to travel with his brother's picky-eating children on a celebratory post-treatment trip. The man, wanting to experience the food culture of Vietnam, South Korea, or Japan, cited his niece and nephew's strict diet of "plain beige foods" as a major obstacle. He expressed that the trip is a celebration of life after cancer and not easily affordable. While his brother is upset, the man feels he should travel with someone who shares his desire to explore new cuisines, especially given his health journey.</p>

          <p>Rory Truex, a China expert at Princeton University, discusses the evolution of Donald Trump's China policy, noting a shift from a "relatively easy" approach to a tariff war. Initially, there was speculation about a broader authoritarian realignment, but Trump's aggressive rhetoric and tariffs suggest he is not interested in resetting the relationship with China more broadly. Truex views Trump as a proto-autocrat who does not respect democratic institutions and has an affinity for authoritarian leaders. The interview highlights the increasingly hostile environment in Washington regarding China policy.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the renowned value investor, plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, marking the end of an era. Buffett's approach of buying "wonderful businesses at fair prices" transformed a failing textile manufacturer into a $1.1 trillion conglomerate. Over 60 years, he amassed a personal fortune of approximately $168 billion, influencing generations of financiers. Known for his long-term investments and aversion to fees, Buffett's success earned him millions of admirers, although he acknowledges the role of luck in his achievements. Gregory Abel is expected to succeed Buffett, but some worry the company will lose its unique status.</p>
