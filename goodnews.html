          <p>Brianna Lanoye, principal of the Buffalo Academy of Science, received a heartwarming surprise when her staff and over 400 students secretly organized a mock wedding ceremony for her and fiancé Zach Klapp. Lanoye, who had expressed a desire to invite the entire school to her actual wedding but found it impractical, was deeply touched by the gesture. The ceremony featured the couple exchanging vows and candy ring pops, with a student officiating the proceedings. This unique event underscored the profound affection and appreciation students and staff hold for their beloved principal, who expressed how loved she felt in that moment.</p>

          <h2>September CPI Report Shows Inflation Climbing Slower Than Forecast Amid Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 20:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) climbed at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, even as President Trump's tariffs continue to exert some upward pressure on prices. Economists suggest U.S. businesses are absorbing some costs, but also passing on up to 55% of import duties to consumers. This data, released despite the government shutdown due to its importance for Social Security adjustments, indicates inflation is rising slower than its 2022 peak. The article highlights that this benign report could provide additional support for another Federal Reserve rate cut next week, balancing inflation concerns with a weakening job market.

          <p>A group of UK MPs on the Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue that reducing the current £20,000 limit, a measure reportedly considered to encourage investment in stocks and shares, is unlikely to achieve its intended effect and would be ill-timed. Facing a substantial £22bn budget shortfall, Reeves is exploring options to raise taxes or cut spending. The article highlights widespread opposition from banks, building societies, and consumer campaigners to the proposed cut, emphasizing the crucial role cash ISAs play for many savers in the country.

          <h2>UK Drivers Face Dilemma: Manual vs. Automatic Driving Lessons Amidst EV Shift</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A quiet but significant shift is occurring in UK driving, with one in three cars now automatic and a quarter of driving tests taken in automatic vehicles. This trend is largely driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales, as electric vehicles inherently lack manual gearboxes. New drivers face a dilemma: a manual license offers the freedom to drive any car, but automatic tests are perceived as quicker to pass. However, a shortage of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs often push learners towards manual, despite official figures showing a higher pass rate for manual tests. This article explores the evolving landscape of driver education and vehicle choice in the UK.</p>

          <p>Counting is set to begin for the Irish presidential election, where voters have chosen between two main contenders, independent politician Catherine Connolly and Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys, to replace current head of state Michael D Higgins. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, withdrew late in the campaign but his name remains on the ballot paper. Early unofficial indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, possibly struggling to reach the record low of just under 40% recorded in the 2018 election. The results are expected to be announced later today at Dublin Castle, following months of campaigning by both candidates. This article details the final stages of the democratic process.</p>

However, they stress that supplements are only beneficial if one is deficient, and strong evidence for their effectiveness in healthy individuals is often lacking.
