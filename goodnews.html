          <h2>China Foregoes Aggressive De-Dollarization Amid US Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Despite the ongoing trade war with the United States, China has refrained from significantly reducing its reliance on the U.S. dollar, according to an Oxford Economics report. The report indicates that China's export-oriented economy necessitates substantial dollar assets, and the limited availability of alternative high-grade, liquid foreign assets constrains rapid diversification. Rather than selling U.S. Treasury holdings, China is more likely to weaken the yuan to support exporters amidst trade tensions, making a disruptive sale of U.S. assets improbable, as a weaker yuan allows exporters to buy more of the Chinese currency with US dollars earned from sales overseas.</p>

          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared she will challenge the UK Labour government when its policies negatively impact Wales, prioritizing the nation's interests over party loyalty. Morgan criticized cuts to disability benefits and winter fuel allowance, urging a policy rethink and greater Welsh benefits from wind power revenues via the Crown Estate. She emphasized the need for the UK government to understand that what is right for Essex may not be right for Barry, referencing the BBC sitcom Gavin and Stacey. Morgan also called for changes to the Barnett formula to better reflect Wales' needs, and to stop cuts to disability benefits.</p>

          <p>Michigan football head coach Sherrone Moore is expected to be suspended for two games in the upcoming season due to allegations of non-cooperation in the NCAA's investigation into sign-stealing during Jim Harbaugh's tenure in 2023. The suspension is anticipated to affect the Wolverines' third and fourth games of the season, with the team also facing a self-imposed sanction that has yet to be announced. The NCAA's investigation centers on Connor Stalions, a former Michigan staffer accused of illicitly stealing signs from opponents, and Moore is accused of deleting text messages with Stalions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation remains above policymakers' target, consumers are experiencing price declines in specific sectors, including airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Economists attribute these declines to various factors, such as lower diesel fuel costs affecting produce transportation and increased efficiency in consumer electronics production. However, experts caution that these lower prices may be temporary due to potential tariff increases and the volatility of certain categories. For example, television and smartphone prices have fallen due to technology improvements, while gasoline prices have decreased due to lower crude oil prices.</p>

          <p>US consumers are increasingly pushing back against "tip-creep," as gratuities expand to self-checkouts, drive-throughs, and other unexpected venues, prompting a backlash against businesses relying on tips to subsidize wages. While some consumers have become more generous due to economic hardships, others are reducing their tipping habits, hoping to encourage employers to increase pay for staff. The ubiquity of electronic point-of-sale systems and companies pocketing tips has fueled the resentment, with some advocating for the abolition of subminimum wages and a greater emphasis on fair compensation for service workers.</p>

While DEI aims to amplify opportunities for underrepresented groups, its broader goal is to improve communication and collaboration across diverse backgrounds, requiring open discussions and tolerance. The author contends that DEI does not undermine meritocracy but rather addresses historical discrimination, and emphasizes that a lack of significant diversification in American organizations indicates DEI's limited effectiveness.</p>
