        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article compares the costs of borrowing $50,000 using a home equity loan versus a personal loan in June 2025. Home equity loans typically have lower interest rates due to the home serving as collateral, but personal loans don't require using the home as a funding source. The median personal loan interest rate is 12.65%, while the average home equity loan interest rate is 8.25% for a five-year loan. A $50,000 home equity loan at 8.25% would cost $1,019.81 per month, while a personal loan at 12.65% would cost $1,128.72 per month, making the home equity loan about $109 cheaper monthly and $6,540 cheaper over five years. The article also touches on HELOCs, noting they also use the home as collateral but typically have variable rates, making long-term budgeting difficult. Borrowers should ensure that the purpose of the loan is advantageous to ensure that it works for their financial goals both now and into the future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California ports are seeing a surge in freight containers from China as shippers rush to beat a potential tariff increase, with President Trump having set an August 12 deadline for a U.S.-China trade deal. Vessel tracking services indicate a rise in ship arrivals at the Port of Los Angeles and Long Beach, reaching the highest levels since January 2025. Despite the increase, officials do not anticipate congestion at West Coast ports due to recent softness in container traffic. Terminals at the Port of Long Beach are operating at about 60 percent capacity, while those at the Port of Los Angeles are at 70 percent. The rise in containers is expected to benefit trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies, as vessels are now arriving full.</p>

          <p>Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez are set to marry in Italy this week, hosting a three-day celebration in Venice. The wedding is expected to cost between $64 million and $76 million, with most provisions sourced from Venetian vendors. The guest list includes approximately 200 people, with celebrities such as Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, and Ivanka Trump expected to attend. Some Venice locals are expressing frustration over the city's welcoming wealthy tourists while residents' needs are unmet, leading to protests against the wedding. Activists have unfurled banners criticizing Bezos for renting Venice and not paying enough taxes, with the "No Space for Bezos" campaign gaining traction. Venetian officials have defended their decision, stating that the event will not disrupt daily life.</p>

Despite the sale, Huang still owns over 800 million Nvidia shares, placing his net worth at approximately $126 billion. The company's stock has surged over 800% since December 2022, driven by the demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in artificial intelligence development.

These include deciding whether to wait for a price drop, determining how much to invest, and assessing their portfolio needs. Gold is considered an income protector due to its steady value during economic turmoil. The common gold investing threshold is often 10% of your overall portfolio. Investors should consider speaking with a financial advisor or gold investing company who can answer your questions and guide you toward the right amount of gold to invest for your specific portfolio.
