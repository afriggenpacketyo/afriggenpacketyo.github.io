          <p>Jim Cramer and Wall Street analysts are optimistic about Wells Fargo's prospects following the Federal Reserve's removal of the bank's $1.95 trillion asset cap. The removal of the cap, which had been in place for seven years due to past misdeeds, allows Wells Fargo to grow its deposit base, invest in high-growth areas, and reduce compliance costs. Cramer raised the firm's price target to $90 per share, describing the move as a watershed moment for the bank. CEO Charlie Scharf emphasized the significance of the cap's removal, highlighting the potential for growth in customer deposits and investment services (not investment advice).</p>

Singh helped transform Curry's business from SC30 to Thirty Ink, which has broadened its scope to different business lines such as bourbon, sports drinks and a branding consultancy and agency for other athletes.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is considering a novel approach to protect federal civil servants from political firings. President Trump has effectively stripped civil servants of job protections by neutralizing the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) and firing officials responsible for enforcing civil service laws. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals suggests that if the MSPB cannot fulfill its role, federal courts should hear cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. The decision aims to close a legal loophole that has left federal civil servants unprotected.</p>

          <p>A new study using artificial intelligence (AI) suggests that some Dead Sea Scrolls may be older than previously believed. The AI program, trained to analyze handwriting styles, cross-referenced data with radiocarbon dating to estimate the age of ancient texts more accurately. The findings could reshape our understanding of Judaism and early Christianity, suggesting that scribes were copying literary manuscripts before the rise of the Hasmonaean kingdom. The study highlights the potential of AI to enhance historical expertise and provide more accurate dating of ancient texts.</p>
