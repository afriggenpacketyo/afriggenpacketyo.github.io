          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle startup, Zoox, has inaugurated a new manufacturing facility in Hayward, California, to significantly increase its robotaxi production. The facility aims to produce one robotaxi per day initially, with plans to accelerate to a capacity of 10,000 robotaxis per year. Zoox intends to deploy a commercial ride-hailing service in the U.S., operating between 500 and 1,000 robotaxis in selected cities. The company, acquired by Amazon in 2020, has been testing its robotaxis on public roads since 2023 and currently has a few dozen vehicles in operation in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK is preparing for a heatwave with temperatures predicted to reach 30C (86F) in some areas, prompting the Met Office to issue yellow heat-health alerts for most of England. The rising temperatures are attributed to a developing area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe, where France and Spain may experience temperatures close to 40C. For a heatwave to be declared, threshold temperatures must be reached for at least three consecutive days, varying from 25C in the north and west to 28C in parts of eastern England. A Met Office study also indicates an increasing risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK in the coming years due to climate change.</p>

          <p>WNBA rookie Caitlin Clark was involved in a physical and contentious game between the Indiana Fever and the Connecticut Sun, marked by skirmishes and ejections. Clark was hit in the eye, knocked down, and exchanged shoves with opposing players, leading to technical fouls and a flagrant foul. The game featured a fight in the final minute, resulting in three ejections, and coaches from both teams expressed concerns about the officiating. Despite the physical play, the Fever secured an 88-71 victory, earning a spot in the Commissioner‚Äôs Cup championship game against the Minnesota Lynx.</p>

          <p>NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory captured an image of an intense X-class solar flare, the most powerful type, erupting from the sun on Tuesday evening. Solar flares are giant explosions that release energy, light, and high-speed particles into space, potentially disrupting radio communications, electric power grids, and navigation signals. These flares are often associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs), which are large bubbles of plasma that can also disrupt communications and cause geomagnetic storms on Earth. In May 2024, a strong CME caused the most significant geomagnetic storm in over 20 years, leading to radio blackouts and visible northern lights as far south as Florida.</p>

Celebrations include parades, parties, concerts, and educational workshops, although corporate sponsorships for some events have decreased.

          <p>Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion acquisition of US Steel has been finalized, granting the Trump administration an unusual degree of power over the company. The agreement includes a national security agreement that gives the US government a "golden share," allowing it to veto key corporate decisions. This measure was implemented to secure approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US, and gives the government veto authority over decisions like idling plants, cutting production, and moving jobs overseas. While the acquisition will provide US Steel with $11 billion in investment, the inclusion of the golden share has raised concerns about deterring future foreign investment in US companies.</p>

Strategies to prevent falls include staying physically active, reviewing home safety, using assistive devices, wearing sensible shoes, and addressing health issues like changes in sight and hearing.

          <p>Investing $500,000 in an annuity at age 65 could generate a monthly income ranging from $2,900 to $3,300 for life, depending on gender and payout structure, but the actual payout varies based on factors like interest rates and the type of annuity. Immediate fixed annuities (SPIAs) provide a simple structure with monthly checks for life, while deferred annuities offer potentially higher income with delayed payments. Factors like payout features, inflation protection, and the current interest rate environment also influence monthly income, and shopping around for quotes and combining annuities with other retirement income sources can create a more flexible plan.
