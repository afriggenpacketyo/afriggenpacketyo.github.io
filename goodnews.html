          <p>Strong thunderstorms, heavy rain, hail, and gusty winds caused significant damage in parts of Germany over the weekend, particularly in North Rhine-Westphalia, where basements and streets were flooded and trees were uprooted.

          <p>For the first time, Syrians are openly calling for peace with Israel, marking a significant shift in the country's political landscape. This change coincides with direct talks between Syria and Israel, facilitated by the U.S. government following President Trump's meeting with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa. Syrians express a desire to move beyond the Axis of Resistance and focus on their own nation's interests, prioritizing economic development and stability. While the talks are in early stages, they represent a notable departure from decades of hostility, driven by changing public opinion and U.S. diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>Top U.S. universities, often divided by internal strife, are finding common ground in opposing the Trump administration's efforts to defund research, raise endowment taxes, and dictate admissions policies. The administration's actions, including banning diversity programs and imposing demands on institutions like Columbia and Harvard, have united faculty, students, donors, and alumni. While some initially supported government pressure to address issues like antisemitism, the administration's tactics are now viewed as overreaching and harmful to academic freedom. This newfound unity aims to protect universities from federal overreach and preserve their independence and intellectual diversity.</p>

          <p>A video of French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, in an awkward public moment has sparked debate and provided a distraction from pressing political issues. The incident, where Brigitte appeared to push Emmanuel's face, initially led to government claims of a deep fake before being dismissed as a playful interaction. The Macrons' relationship, which began when Emmanuel was a student and Brigitte his teacher, has long been a subject of fascination.
