          <p>Salesforce reported better-than-expected quarterly results and provided strong guidance, driven by progress in AI with Data Cloud and Agentforce exceeding $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. The company's acquisition of Informatica, a data management and integration software firm, was also discussed, with executives emphasizing its strategic importance for AI initiatives. However, some investors remain cautious due to the impact of a weaker U.S. dollar on revenue and the performance of individual applications. The company expects a $250 million tailwind to revenue from foreign exchange this fiscal year, up $400 million from its prior guidance (not investment advice).</p>
