He praised their actions as a crucial stand against partisan gerrymandering, stating their courage helps set the tone for a long struggle to protect democracy. The meeting, also attended by former Attorney General Eric Holder, highlighted national Democratic support for the state-level effort to counter what they describe as a systematic assault on voting rights.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that investors should not exit the stock market even if it appears 'frothy,' asserting that the current environment is different from the dot-com bubble. He contends that for every instance of irrational exuberance, such as the explosive gains of some recent IPOs, there are powerful, rational stories driving stocks like Amazon and Eli Lilly. Cramer's view is that the strength of these fundamentally sound companies is enough to overwhelm market speculation and justify continued investment. (not investment advice)</p>

Ouattara had a productive season with Bournemouth, scoring nine goals in 37 appearances, and his transfer marks a major acquisition for Brentford as they strengthen their squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>As economic growth slows in China's major metropolitan areas, a new engine for consumption is emerging in the country's smaller, lower-tier cities and counties. Residents in these areas are demonstrating stronger purchasing power and a greater willingness to spend, fueled by faster income growth and lighter economic burdens compared to their big-city counterparts. This trend of "consumption upgrade" in previously overlooked markets is becoming crucial for China's goal of shifting its economy to be more reliant on domestic consumer demand.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Maryland has struck down two Trump administration actions that aimed to eliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and universities. The ruling found that the Department of Education acted unlawfully when it threatened to withhold federal funding from institutions with DEI programs. This decision marks a significant legal victory for civil rights advocates and educators who had challenged the administration's policy, which they argued constituted illegal government censorship and sowed chaos in the education system.</p>
