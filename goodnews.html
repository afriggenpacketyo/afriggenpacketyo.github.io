          <p>The Sacramento Kings edged out the Los Angeles Lakers with a 117-116 victory in their final preseason game, despite a remarkable 31-point, nine-assist, and five-rebound performance from Luka Doncic. The Lakers, who were without superstar LeBron James due to a sciatica issue expected to sideline him until November, saw Gabe Vincent impressively step into the starting lineup with 14 points. While Doncic and Austin Reaves played together for the first time this preseason, the team is still working to solidify its rotation. James's absence marks the first time in his 23-season career that he will miss a season opener, forcing the Lakers to adapt their strategy.</p>

          <p>Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, has passed away in Beijing at the remarkable age of 103 due to sickness, as reported by Xinhua. Yang was widely regarded as one of the 20th century's most influential physicists, often mentioned in the same breath as Albert Einstein. His groundbreaking work in 1954, co-authored with Robert Mills, introduced the Yang-Mills theory, a set of equations that proved fundamental to understanding three of nature's four basic forces: electromagnetic, weak, and strong interactions. This theory established the mathematical cornerstone for the Standard Model, which unifies these forces and explains elementary particle behavior.</p>

          <p>The South African SUV market has experienced a notable transformation between January and August, with Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dramatically increasing their sales volume by 86%. This surge has elevated their total market share to 15%, primarily propelled by strong performances from Chery, which saw a 27% volume increase, and Haval, with a 45% rise. Although established Japanese leaders like Toyota and Suzuki continue to command the largest overall volumes, their individual market dominance is observed to be waning during the same period. This trend signifies a growing competitive landscape and changing consumer preferences in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an unprecedented two-way performance in MLB history, hitting three colossal home runs and pitching six scoreless innings with 10 strikeouts, as the Los Angeles Dodgers decisively swept the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1 in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series. Ohtani's dominant display, which earned him the NLCS MVP award, propelled the Dodgers to their fifth World Series appearance in nine seasons. This achievement makes them the first team to win back-to-back pennants since Philadelphia in 2009. The Dodgers will now seek to become baseball's first repeat champions since the New York Yankees achieved the feat from 1998 to 2000.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a pioneering computing pooling solution that reportedly slashed Nvidia GPU usage by an impressive 82% for its artificial intelligence models. Beta testing within Alibaba Cloud's model marketplace demonstrated a substantial reduction from 1,192 to just 213 Nvidia H20 GPUs required to serve dozens of models with up to 72 billion parameters. This innovative system directly addresses pervasive resource inefficiency in cloud services, where a small number of popular AI models disproportionately consume GPU power while others remain largely idle. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented these findings, positioning Aegaeon as a leading effort to reduce costs associated with concurrent large language model workloads.</p>

          <p>The immensely popular Chinese spy drama "Silent Honour" has ignited a significant public outpouring of praise and respect for real-life intelligence agents. A park in Beijing reported a "sudden surge" of visitors to the tomb of Wu Shi, an underground Communist Party member who served as a KMT lieutenant general in Taiwan in 1949. Hundreds of flowers and heartfelt thank-you notes were left, honoring Wu as an "unsung hero" for his contributions. This cultural phenomenon demonstrates the powerful influence of media in shaping public perception and historical memory, fostering a sense of national pride and recognition for previously unacknowledged figures within China's history.</p>

This pivotal win gives the Mariners a commanding 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series. A single victory in Game 6, scheduled for Sunday in Toronto, would propel Seattle to their first-ever World Series appearance. The rally was initially sparked by Cal Raleigh's leadoff homer in the eighth, setting the stage for Suárez's decisive and electrifying blast that sent T-Mobile Park into a frenzy.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is proactively enhancing its financial infrastructure to solidify its standing as a premier offshore yuan trading center. New initiatives, such as the RMB Financing Facility (RBF), are designed to make borrowing Chinese yuan more accessible and cost-effective for businesses. This particularly benefits mainland firms seeking to invest overseas and foreign companies looking for yuan funding to expand within the mainland. The RBF's expansion in December will further support direct investments, promoting greater international usage of the Chinese currency by offering more competitive interest rates compared to the Hong Kong dollar, thus strengthening Hong Kong's global financial connectivity.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a proclamation enacting 25% tariffs on imported medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their component parts, alongside 10% tariffs on all imported buses, including school and city vehicles. This strategic move aims to shield U.S. companies from foreign competition and actively incentivize domestic vehicle manufacturing. The administration plans to offer credits to vehicle manufacturers who import some parts but commit to assembling the final product in the U.S., effectively offsetting their tariff liabilities. This policy is explicitly designed to ensure American-made vehicles remain cost-competitive, support American labor, and foster an expansion of domestic production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is commemorating Liu Huaqing, the esteemed former commander of the Chinese navy, who is revered as a visionary strategist and technocrat responsible for the comprehensive modernization of China's naval forces. Often compared to the influential American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu's leadership was instrumental in transforming the People's Liberation Army Navy into a world-class maritime power. Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at 13 and rose through the ranks before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. His enduring legacy is central to China's "blue sea strategy," emphasizing a powerful, globally capable navy.</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is poised to reach its peak next week, promising a spectacular "fireworks" display in the night sky for stargazers. Visible between now and November 7, with its most intense period around October 22, the shower is renowned for its bright, fast-moving meteors that leave distinctive long streaks of light. These meteors originate from the debris trail left by Halley's Comet as Earth passes through its orbit. For optimal viewing conditions, observers are advised to find a dark location away from city lights after midnight, looking towards the constellation Orion, easily identifiable by its prominent three-star belt.</p>
