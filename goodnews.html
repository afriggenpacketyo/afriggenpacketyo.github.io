          <h2>Health and Nutritional Safety of Microwave Ovens Examined</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses common concerns about microwave oven safety, clarifying that they use non-ionizing radiation, which is distinct from harmful nuclear radiation and does not alter food at a molecular level. It explains that microwaving can actually be better at preserving nutrients in food compared to other cooking methods like boiling, due to shorter cooking times. The primary safety risks are not from radiation but from using improper containers, such as certain plastics that can leach chemicals, and the potential for severe burns from superheated food and dishes.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant advancement in AI adoption on Wall Street. The bank plans to integrate Devin into its 12,000-person development team to handle tasks like updating internal code, with the potential to scale to thousands of "Devins." The firm's tech chief anticipates this agentic AI could boost worker productivity significantly more than previous tools. This move signals a shift towards a "hybrid workforce" where humans supervise AI agents, raising new questions about the future of tech jobs.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been honored for their bravery in being the first to confront the knife attacker in Southport in July 2024. Sgt Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry faced the attacker, who had murdered three young girls and injured others at a dance workshop. Arriving at a chaotic scene, they entered the building and, armed with a baton and Taser, successfully disarmed and arrested the perpetrator. The officers were recognized at the Police Federation's 2025 bravery awards for their decisive and courageous actions.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have identified a mystery interstellar object, named 3I/Atlas, which could be the oldest comet ever detected, potentially predating our solar system by three billion years. This is only the third such object from beyond our solar system to be spotted. A team from Oxford University suggests it originated in the Milky Way's "thick disk" of ancient stars and is likely composed of water ice. As it approaches the Sun later this year, it is expected to heat up and form a glowing tail, potentially making it visible from Earth with amateur telescopes.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between the current preparations of the U.S. men's national team for the 2026 World Cup and South Korea's successful co-hosting campaign in 2002. It highlights how South Korean coach Guus Hiddink overcame early struggles by focusing intensely on fitness and fostering a strong team cohesion, effectively turning the national squad into a club-like environment. While U.S. coach Mauricio Pochettino faces different challenges, such as players being based across Europe, the article suggests lessons can be learned from Hiddink's strategy of maximizing preparation time and building an exceptionally fit and unified team.</p>

          <p>Amid growing concerns that billions of dollars from opioid settlements are being misused, two advocacy groups have launched a crowdsourced database for the public to report alleged misspending by state and local governments. Families and advocates worry the funds, intended to combat the addiction crisis, are being used to fill general budget gaps, especially as federal funding for addiction care is cut. The project aims to pressure state attorneys general, who secured the settlements, to increase oversight and investigate how this "blood money" is actually being spent to ensure it serves its intended purpose.</p>

          <p>China's National Health Commission has banned a surgical procedure for Alzheimer's disease that had been gaining popularity across the country. The procedure, lymphatic-venous anastomosis (LVA), aims to improve the drainage of harmful brain proteins by connecting lymph vessels to veins. Despite being performed in hundreds of hospitals, the commission stated the therapy is still experimental and lacks high-quality evidence to support its safety and efficacy. The procedure is now prohibited for treating Alzheimer's until further clinical studies can clearly define its benefits and risks.</p>

          <p>Sophomore Congressman Robert Garcia of California has been chosen as the new top Democrat on the influential House Oversight Committee, signaling a desire within the party for a more confrontational approach. The 47-year-old, who is the first openly gay immigrant in Congress, has a reputation as a fighter and plans to vigorously challenge President Trump and House Republicans. Despite being in the minority and lacking subpoena power, Garcia intends to use the high-profile position as a "bully pulpit" to investigate figures like Elon Musk and Stephen Miller and counter what he describes as GOP disinformation.</p>

          <p>In the aftermath of the devastating flash floods in Texas, state leaders are now pushing for the installation of flood warning sirens in vulnerable areas like Kerr County. Experts say sirens are particularly effective for alerting people who are outdoors, such as campers, but are just one part of a comprehensive warning system that must also include mobile and media alerts. The article notes that Kerr County had previously considered installing sirens in 2016 but abandoned the plan due to resident concerns over false alarms. A successful system requires public education so people know how to react when they hear the warning.</p>

Founded by China as an alternative to Western-led institutions like the World Bank, the AIIB has focused on infrastructure development rather than poverty reduction. The bank's president has insisted its goal is not to upend the existing global financial order but to demonstrate China's ability to work constructively with other nations. Having grown from 57 to 110 member economies, the AIIB's infrastructure-first mission has found broad support across the developing world.</p>

          <p>The UK government has shelved immediate plans to reduce the annual tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (Isas) following strong opposition. The Chancellor was reportedly considering lowering the £20,000 limit for cash savings to encourage more investment in stocks and shares to boost the economy. However, banks, building societies, and consumer groups warned the move could discourage saving altogether or penalize risk-averse savers. While the immediate changes are on hold, the Treasury has not ruled out future reforms and still aims to encourage more UK investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite a sales slump in much of Europe, partly due to a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, Tesla continues to dominate the Norwegian market. New car sales for Tesla in Norway saw a 54% year-on-year increase in June, driven by the immense popularity of its revamped Model Y. Experts attribute this success to Norway's highly developed EV market and the Model Y's value proposition, which meets local consumer needs for space and all-wheel drive. While a survey shows many Norwegians disapprove of Musk's politics, it has not been enough to dent Tesla's remarkable market share there.</p>
