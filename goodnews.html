          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he is seriously considering bringing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public. These government-sponsored enterprises play a crucial role in America's housing financial system by buying mortgages from lenders, bundling them into mortgage-backed securities, and selling them to investors. Trump believes that the timing is right because these companies are performing well financially and generating substantial cash flow, potentially providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the mortgage market. He plans to discuss this with his economic advisors before making a final decision. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David Sacks, President Trump's top crypto and AI advisor, believes the stablecoin legislation moving through the Senate will pass with bipartisan support and generate trillions in demand for U.S. Treasuries. Sacks stated that the administration expects the GENIUS Act to pass, providing legal clarity for the already $200 billion stablecoin market. The bill cleared a key procedural vote in the Senate, suggesting it has the necessary votes to avoid a filibuster. The remarks come amid ongoing debate about the role of digital assets in the broader financial landscape. </p>

          <h2>Scientists Suggest Targeting Mosquito Parasites with Drugs to Combat Malaria</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-21 19:10:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Harvard University propose a novel approach to treating mosquitoes with malaria drugs to prevent the spread of the disease, which kills nearly 600,000 people annually, primarily children. Unlike current efforts that focus on killing mosquitoes with insecticides, this method aims to eliminate the malaria parasites within the insects. The team identified a drug cocktail that can successfully rid mosquitoes of malaria when absorbed through their legs, with the long-term goal of coating bed nets with the drug. This approach addresses the growing problem of insecticide resistance in mosquitoes. </p>

          <p>Researchers are advocating for the NHS to offer additional scans to women with very dense breasts to improve cancer detection rates and save lives. A Cambridge University-led study found that alternative scanning methods, such as enhanced mammograms and fast MRI scans, could significantly increase the number of cancers detected in this group. Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of developing breast cancer, and cancers are harder to spot using traditional mammograms. The study suggests that implementing these alternative techniques could identify thousands of additional cancers per year. </p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding is rebranding its digital entertainment division as Hujing Digital Media and Entertainment Group, using the Chinese name for the orca or killer whale.

The company stated that the characteristics of orcas, such as being large, flexible, and smart, align with the group's vision of digital intelligence, symbiosis, and happiness.

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to a new all-time high, surpassing its previous record from January, driven by factors including softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. This has increased the focus on bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Inflows into exchange-traded funds tracking bitcoin have surpassed $40 billion, and on-chain data indicates less selling pressure. Catalysts like regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments are expected to further drive bitcoin prices higher, with the number of bitcoin held by public companies growing significantly. </p>

While the city has approved the restaurant plan, the demolition work was ordered to stop until the required notices were properly delivered.

The deal follows increasing international pressure on the UK to relinquish control of the islands, which were separated from Mauritius in 1965.
