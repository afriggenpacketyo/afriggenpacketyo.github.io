          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to bolster its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This investment, part of the Strategic Defence Review, aims to create an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up. The factories will support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons and create approximately 1,800 new jobs. Ministers assert that this investment will strengthen the armed forces, boost British jobs, and ensure the UK's security at home and abroad.</p>
