          <p>Several luxury brands are reducing steep discounts in China to restore an image of exclusivity and attract wealthy shoppers who are less affected by economic slowdowns. Brands like Balenciaga, Versace, and Valentino have decreased or eliminated discounts on platforms like Tmall. This strategy marks a shift from prioritizing short-term revenue and traffic to cultivating long-term brand loyalty and affinity. The focus is now on investing in relevance, desirability, and premium experiences to foster lasting customer relationships.</p>

          <p>International Airlines Group (IAG), the parent company of British Airways, has agreed to a $13 billion deal to purchase 32 new Boeing 787-10 aircraft, with an option for 10 more. This announcement follows a trade agreement with the U.S. that cut tariffs on the industry. IAG also announced a near $8 billion deal for 21 Airbus A330-900neo aircraft, which will be deployed across Iberia and Aer Lingus operations. Despite seeing some recent softness in economy ticket sales by US holidaymakers, IAG reports resilient demand for air travel, especially in premium cabins.</p>

          <p>The UK and US have reached a tariff deal that reduces or removes tariffs on specific goods, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While Trump's 10% tariffs on imports remain in place for most UK goods, the deal cuts car tariffs to 10% for up to 100,000 UK cars annually and scraps tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Negotiations continue on pharmaceuticals, and there is no change to the UK's digital services tax. The agreement aims to support particular sectors and smooth trade, but it is more restricted than most Free Trade Agreements.</p>

          <p>Republican District Attorney George Brauchler is cracking down on crime in Colorado, emphasizing accountability for criminal conduct. Brauchler recently secured a rare first-degree murder conviction in a high-profile DUI case where a driver, under the influence, killed an Air Force test pilot and injured his children. Brauchler's office pursued the charge based on "extreme indifference," highlighting what he feels is a loss of focus on day-to-day crimes like DUI. He aims to ensure justice is served and that offenders face appropriate consequences for their actions.</p>

          <p>India is considering a trade deal with the U.S. that could involve zero tariffs on certain goods, signaling a potential shift from its protectionist policies. While the deal could boost foreign investment and global market access, there are concerns about its impact on domestic manufacturing.

          <p>China's exports surged in April, driven by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp drop in exports to the U.S. due to prohibitive tariffs. Exports jumped 8.1% year-on-year, while imports slumped by 0.2%. Shipments to the U.S. plunged over 21%, but exports to ASEAN surged 20.8%. The surge in overall exports may be partly due to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>The 19th Venice Architecture Biennale explores how cities can adapt to rising temperatures caused by climate change. Architects and urban planners are addressing the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of greenery. The biennale's theme, "Intelligens. Natural. Artificial.

Solutions include implementing green spaces, reducing traffic, and transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities," but implementation is often slow and requires quick, unbureaucratic decision-making.</p>
