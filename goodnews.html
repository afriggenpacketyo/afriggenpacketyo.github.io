Despite frequent injuries in recent seasons, Trout continues to hit for power and get on base, though his overall playing time has decreased.

          <p>Chinese tourism to Japan is experiencing a significant surge this year, with over 6.7 million visits recorded in the first eight months of 2025, a substantial increase from the 4.6 million in the same period last year.

          <p>Elon Musk predicts that by 2030, AI and robots will replace nearly all jobs, leading to a "universal high income" and "sustainable abundance" for everyone. He envisions a future where individuals have the "best medical care, food, home, transport and everything else." The article notes that Musk has reiterated this vision for years, distinguishing "universal high income" from mere "universal basic income." However, it also highlights skepticism regarding the feasibility and funding of such a system, questioning how it would be paid for given existing national debt and political roadblocks to broad universal programs.

          <p>Creatine, a popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, including improving short-term memory, mood, and focus, and possibly alleviating "brain fog." The article highlights that while extensive research has focused on its athletic performance enhancement, newer studies are exploring its impact on female biology and other body parts, including brain function, especially during perimenopause. Experts suggest creatine might help by increasing energy production in the brain, similar to its effect on muscles. However, more research is needed, and potential side effects and individual responses vary.</p>

          <p>The White House announced a prospective deal for TikTok's U.S. operations, detailing that Americans would secure six of seven board seats and gain control over the app's powerful algorithm. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated a formal signing could happen "in the coming days," with tech giant Oracle slated to lead data and privacy aspects. The article highlights that President Trump had previously threatened to ban TikTok unless its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, divested its U.S. operations, citing national security concerns over user data. While Trump expressed optimism about the deal after a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping, Beijing's Commerce Ministry offered a less conclusive statement, suggesting ongoing complexities in the negotiations.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-20 18:02:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the "No Secret Police Act," prohibiting federal and local law enforcement officers from wearing masks while on duty, with specific exceptions for riot gear, medical masks, or undercover assignments. This landmark legislation directly addresses concerns over increased immigration enforcement operations in California, particularly in Los Angeles, where masked federal agents have conducted detentions without clear identification. The article highlights the complex legal debate surrounding a state's ability to regulate federal agent conduct, though the law also applies to local police. While proponents emphasize its role in promoting accountability and transparency, law enforcement groups have voiced strong opposition, arguing it could compromise officer safety and identification.</p>
