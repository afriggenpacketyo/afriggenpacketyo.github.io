          <p>Senator John Fetterman (D-PA) has doubled down on his anti-violence stance, issuing a "DO" and "DO NOT" list following his criticism of the "anarchy and true chaos" in Los Angeles. Fetterman's post on X urged people to protest peacefully, organize to win elections, and call out destructive behavior while condemning looting, arson, and assaults on law enforcement. The tweet included a photo of burning vehicles, underscoring the senator's message against violence. His remarks have garnered support from both sides of the aisle, with Republican Senator Dave McCormick agreeing with Fetterman's sentiment.</p>

          <p>China plans to eliminate tariffs on nearly all goods from African nations, excluding eSwatini, as part of an effort to expand access to its consumer market. The announcement was made during a meeting in China with African ministers affiliated with the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). Representatives from China and African nations criticized the United States for disrupting the global economic and trade order. Chinese President Xi Jinping expressed China's willingness to extend zero-tariff measures to 53 African countries with diplomatic ties to China.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The swift and fierce resistance to ICE raids in Los Angeles is attributed to the city's deep immigrant roots and ties to neighboring Mexico. Los Angeles has a large immigrant population, with one in three residents of LA County being immigrants. The city has long celebrated its immigrant culture and has taken steps to protect its immigrant population from federal deportation efforts. The recent raids and claims from the Department of Homeland Security have sparked anger and determination within the community, leading to widespread protests and support for immigrant rights.</p>

          <p>Meta is suing Joy Timeline HK Limited, the developer of the CrushAI app, which uses AI technology to create non-consensual, sexualized images of individuals. The Hong Kong-based company ran ads on Facebook and Instagram to promote CrushAI, prompting Meta to take legal action to stop the advertising. The lawsuit follows multiple attempts by Joy Timeline to circumvent Meta's ad review process after their ads were repeatedly removed. Meta is also updating its enforcement methods and developing new technology to identify and remove these types of ads more quickly, sharing signals about the apps with other tech companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new generation of restaurateurs is embracing a more modest model, focusing on a single location or a few establishments rather than nationwide expansion. These independent owner-operators prioritize building relationships with customers, employees, and suppliers, seeking real-time gratification and providing comfort and connection through good food. To improve their odds, they avoid high-rent spaces, run multiple operations from shared spaces, and actively engage with customers. However, the restaurant industry faces challenges such as changing consumer preferences, economic uncertainties, and the impact of ICE raids, making small-scale operations a sensible approach.</p>

          <p>One hundred and five South Korean citizens are suing former President Yoon Suk Yeol for emotional damages related to his declaration of martial law on December 3. The lawsuit, filed after lawmakers overruled Yoon's order, demands compensation of 100,000 won ($73) per plaintiff, alleging that the martial law and subsequent actions violated their basic rights and caused mental harm. The lead attorney, Lee Gum-gyu, previously helped oust conservative president Park Geun-hye and served on the National Assembly's legal team that confirmed Yoon's impeachment.

          <p>Brian Wilson's unreleased rap song, "Smart Girls," was intended to be a key part of his Sire Records album "Sweet Insanity," but it ultimately contributed to the album being shelved. Wilson aimed to create a song that uplifted women, contrasting with the negative portrayals in many rap songs at the time. The song, produced by Matt Dike, was described as a mix of Wilson's discography and collective memories of him within American music. Despite never being officially released, "Smart Girls" has circulated among Beach Boys fans and represents Wilson's openness to experimenting with different genres.</p>
