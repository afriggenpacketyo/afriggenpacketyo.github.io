Slot was named manager of the year and Premier League manager of the year at the League Managers Association (LMA) awards but withdrew from the event to show solidarity with those affected. After replacing Jurgen Klopp, Slot signed only one player, Federico Chiesa, but still led Liverpool to their second Premier League title, winning by 10 points over Arsenal.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced his intention to pardon reality TV stars Todd and Julie Chrisley, who are currently serving prison sentences for charges including bank fraud and tax evasion. The Chrisleys were convicted in 2022, with Todd receiving a 12-year sentence and Julie a seven-year sentence, after being found guilty of submitting false financial statements to obtain over $30 million in loans and concealing income from the IRS. Their daughter, Savannah, has been actively seeking a pardon for her parents, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts of up to ¬£1,000 each, and could see debts written off, in response to the scandal over the forced fitting of prepayment meters. Energy companies are paying out more ¬£70m in compensation and financial support to customers, following a review by the regulator, Ofgem. The scandal erupted two years ago, at the peak of the cost of living crisis, with energy prices spiking after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The nearly ¬£74m Ofgem announced was being dispersed applies only to customers at eight suppliers.</p>

          <p>King Charles III delivered a significant speech at the opening of parliament in Canada, defining its place in an uncertain world and its relationship with the U.S. The address, given to new Prime Minister Mark Carney, underscored the sovereignty of both nations amid tensions with the U.S. The King emphasized Canada's unique identity and its role as a strong and free nation. This speech is viewed as a symbolic show of support for the Commonwealth nation. Later in the day Trump again suggested that Canada should be annexed by the US, an idea that Ottawa has flatly rejected, as he touted his plan for a North American missile defence shield.</p>

O‚ÄôConnell, a retired history buff, used his retirement funds to create multistate treasure hunts guided by his books, hiding chests with antiques worth over $100,000.

          <p>A federal judge has struck down an executive order by President Trump that targeted the U.S. law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. This marks the third time this month that a federal judge in Washington has rejected Trump's executive orders against law firms, which sought to impose sanctions such as suspending security clearances and barring employees from federal buildings. The judge emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, stating that the order was unfaithful to the judgment and vision of the Founding Fathers.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO stands out because existing shareholders will sell more shares than the company itself, a trait rarely seen in tech IPOs but shared by Facebook's 2012 debut. Circle, profitable and with substantial cash reserves, didn't specify the reason for this decision, but it likely reflects the need for liquidity among venture capital firms after a period of meager returns. This trend may indicate a broader desire among early investors to capitalize on the market and recoup investments after a multiyear drought in IPOs.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is narrowing its check-in window for U.S. flights, requiring passengers to check in at least 45 minutes before departure starting June 3, aligning with other airlines' policies. This change applies to most domestic flights and aims to provide greater consistency for customers, particularly for those with carry-on bags only. While online check-in systems allow passengers to check in 24 hours in advance, meeting the check-in cutoff is still necessary to confirm bookings and receive boarding passes.</p>
