          <p>US art collector Thomas Kaplan plans to sell virtual shares in his extensive Leiden Collection of 17th-century Dutch art, including Rembrandts, aiming to democratize art ownership for millions. This fractional ownership model allows individuals to invest in artworks without physically possessing them, with Kaplan retaining a majority stake for museum loans. Art market experts, however, express skepticism about its revolutionary potential, citing the inherent complexities of art as an asset class, including high maintenance costs and challenges in establishing a liquid secondary market for shares. The initiative also serves as a long-term solution for the collection's inheritance, offering a new approach to keeping significant art together while potentially broadening public engagement.

Both firms, already listed in the U.S., can issue approximately 102 million new shares each. This move is part of a growing trend of Chinese companies seeking dual listings in Hong Kong, capitalizing on the city's rebounding IPO market and offering closer proximity to their home market for investors. The companies are also expanding their robotaxi operations globally, with existing services in major Chinese cities and partnerships with Uber in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Solar power is rapidly expanding its footprint, moving beyond conventional installations to six innovative and unexpected locations worldwide. These include integration into roads, parking lots, and noise barriers, offering benefits like electric vehicle charging and traffic noise reduction, with prototypes even testing solar cells on car bodies. Switzerland is pioneering solar power systems on railway tracks to potentially fuel trains, while architectural advancements see solar cells seamlessly integrated into building facades. Farmers are adopting "agrivoltaics," combining solar energy generation with crop cultivation, and large-scale floating solar parks are appearing on bodies of water. Furthermore, scientists are exploring futuristic concepts like beaming solar energy from space, though this remains in very early development.</p>

The company maintained its 2025 sales growth forecast of around 15% and a gross margin of 52%, with shares rising after the announcement. CEO Christophe Fouquet acknowledged ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, particularly regarding U.S. chip export restrictions impacting China. However, strong AI-driven investments are fueling new orders, and ASML expects 2026 net sales not to fall below 2025 levels, with further details expected in January. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Competition Watchdog Calls for Vets to Publish Price Lists</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 05:18:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) recommends that veterinary practices be mandated to publish price lists to increase transparency for pet owners. An investigation revealed vet prices have risen at nearly double the inflation rate, with owners often unaware of costs or estimates for expensive treatments. Proposals include capping prescription fees, banning bonuses for specific treatments, and requiring vets to disclose ownership by large groups, which charge significantly more than independent practices. The CMA aims to reform a regulatory system deemed outdated, empowering pet owners to shop around and make informed decisions about their animals' care. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Oklahoma high school girls' basketball team from the Academy of Classical Christian Studies demonstrated exceptional integrity by returning a championship trophy after realizing they had actually lost the title game. A scoreboard error led to their erroneous 44-43 victory, but coach Brendan King's video review confirmed a 43-42 defeat. Despite rules allowing them to keep the title, the team unanimously appealed, leading to the championship being awarded to Apache High. This unprecedented act of honesty was lauded by the opposing coach as a powerful lesson in sportsmanship, proving that integrity can transcend the desire to win.</p>

          <p>Scientists are increasingly using gene-editing to bolster natural ecosystems and threatened species, from creating climate-resilient corals to disease-resistant trees. However, a significant debate is emerging, with a proposed moratorium from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) advocating a temporary ban on releasing genetically modified species into the wild due to unknown risks. Conversely, many scientists and conservation groups argue that synthetic biology is a necessary tool in the fight against escalating extinction rates, asserting that inaction is no longer an option. The discussion highlights complex ethical and ecological considerations surrounding human intervention in nature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "broadcasting," commonly associated with radio and television, originated in agriculture, describing the scattering of seeds over a wide area, a practice still used today. Its adoption into media began in the early 1920s with radio, notably Frank Conrad's broadcast of presidential election results, which "electrified the country." The Communications Act of 1934 solidified its new definition for public dissemination of radio content. Over time, broadcasting evolved to include television and adapted to new technologies, becoming a crucial source of news, entertainment, and cultural influence, despite modern digital platforms not technically being "broadcasters."</p>

          <p>The Delaware Supreme Court is hearing arguments in a long-running legal dispute over Tesla CEO Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package, potentially worth over $100 billion. A Tesla shareholder sued, alleging Musk unduly influenced the board and that shareholders were not fully informed when they approved the deal. While lower courts sided with the shareholder, voiding the package, Tesla's board has since put the same plan to a second shareholder vote and proposed a new compensation package. The case questions corporate governance, CEO influence, and the balance between executive reward and shareholder interests, prompting Tesla to reincorporate in Texas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman announced that ChatGPT will soon be capable of writing erotica for age-verified adult users, aligning with a policy to "treat adult users like adults." This move comes as the chatbot aims to become more "human-like" and less restrictive, following previous efforts to mitigate mental health risks that had made it "less useful/enjoyable." The decision has sparked mixed reactions, with some users questioning the focus on erotica, while others welcome the return of a more authentic and less "compliance bot"-like AI.

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected Alex Jones' appeal, upholding the $1.4 billion defamation and emotional distress judgment against him for falsely claiming the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax.

This decision is a significant victory for the Sandy Hook victims' families and an FBI agent who sued him. Jones, who filed for bankruptcy, continues to appeal a separate $49 million judgment in Texas and claims the judgments are politically motivated, urging his listeners to support Infowars.</p>
