          <p>Writer and director Lena Dunham discusses her new Netflix series, "Too Much," which is loosely inspired by her experiences moving to London. The show contrasts the romanticized, period-drama version of England with the modern-day reality of the city. Starring Megan Stalter and Will Sharpe, the series follows a New Yorker who relocates across the Atlantic for work and navigates cultural differences. The 10-episode rom-com, produced by the company behind "Love Actually," also features an extensive list of celebrity cameos, including Stephen Fry, Emily Ratajkowski, and Andrew Scott.</p>

          <p>China has announced the completion of a massive 1,856-kilometer green belt in Inner Mongolia, designed to contain the Badain Jaran, Tengger, and Ulan Buh deserts. The project, part of a larger national effort to combat desertification, involved creating straw checkerboards to stabilize shifting sands. After securing the sand, workers planted drought-resistant trees like sacsaoul to establish a more permanent ecological barrier. This initiative aims to prevent sandstorms and protect agricultural land by building an effective sand prevention and control system in the region.</p>

          <p>The Department of Justice has secured guilty pleas from two individuals, Tina Brown Cooper and Ronnie Jay Oxendine, for their roles in selling a rifle to Ryan Routh, the man charged with the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. Court documents state that Cooper acted as a middleman for Oxendine in the sale of an SKS rifle to Routh, who was a convicted felon and thus prohibited from purchasing firearms. Routh was later found with a similar rifle outside Trump's Florida golf club. The defendants claimed they had no prior knowledge of Routh's alleged plans.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have charged seven Chinese nationals in Massachusetts for their alleged involvement in a multimillion-dollar marijuana trafficking organization. The operation reportedly used a network of grow houses to cultivate and distribute marijuana throughout the U.S. Northeast. Prosecutors allege the scheme also involved smuggling other Chinese nationals into the country to work in these facilities to pay off their debts. The enterprise generated millions in profits, which were then laundered through the purchase of luxury goods, homes, and vehicles, according to the Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>In a show of unity against potential U.S. economic pressure, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their bilateral trade flows. The announcement follows comments from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose a 10% tariff on all member nations of the BRICS economic bloc. Trump has repeatedly attacked the group, which includes Brazil, Russia, India, China, and other emerging economies, claiming it was formed to undermine the U.S. and its currency. This move by Brazil and India signals a strengthening of ties within the bloc as it faces a more confrontational U.S. trade posture.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States scales back its international development efforts, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a new hub for global public goods. The piece contrasts the recent dismantling of USAID as an independent agency under an "America first" policy with China's proactive role, exemplified by the new International Organisation for Mediation launched in Hong Kong. The author suggests that with the center of global development shifting eastward, Hong Kong's cosmopolitan status within China allows it to harness this momentum and gain prominence in international cooperation.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a North Korean operative from the Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a scheme that generates revenue for the nation's weapons programs. Song is accused of facilitating a network where North Korean IT workers, operating from China and Russia, use stolen identities of U.S. citizens to secure remote work at foreign companies. This sprawling operation allows North Korea to clandestinely raise funds and, in some cases, infiltrate corporate networks. The sanctions also target four entities involved in a related Russia-based network.</p>

Features like specialized roof trusses, deep anchors, and flood vents help reduce damage from high winds and storm surges. While these homes can cost more upfront, they often result in long-term savings, including lower insurance premiums, and provide greater peace of mind.</p>
