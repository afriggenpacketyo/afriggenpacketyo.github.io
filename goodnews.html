          <p>A new bill in England and Wales proposes adding up to two years of imprisonment for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings, aiming to prevent offenders from avoiding justice and providing a moment of reckoning for victims' families. The families of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa, whose killers did not attend sentencing, advocated for this change. While powers exist to compel court attendance, they are infrequently used due to risks associated with restraining disruptive defendants, but additional restrictions like limited family visits and parole ineligibility are being considered.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Rogoff argues that President Trump‚Äôs plan to weaken the dollar, as proposed by Stephen Miran, is based on a flawed diagnosis. While the dollar's reserve-currency status plays a role in trade deficits, it is just one of many factors. Miran's plan overlooks crucial details such as the fact that foreign countries can accumulate Treasury bills without running trade surpluses. Rogoff suggests that closing the fiscal deficit is a more straightforward fix than launching a trade war, and that the strength of the American economy is a key factor behind the current account deficit.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has implemented a series of measures, including interest rate cuts and easing lending restrictions for banks, to mitigate the economic impact of the trade war with the United States. These actions, which include reducing the reserve requirement ratio and freeing up money for government priorities, are intended to stabilize markets and encourage spending. The announcement follows news of upcoming trade talks between U.S. and Chinese officials, marking the first formal meeting since President Trump raised tariffs on Chinese imports.</p>

          <p>US and Chinese officials are scheduled to commence talks this week in Switzerland to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the world's two largest economies. Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will participate in the discussions, while the US will be represented by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. Experts anticipate that negotiations will be protracted, lasting several months or even longer. The talks aim to address the significant impact of unilateral tariff measures on global trade.</p>
