        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the G7 summit in Canada, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba championed the established global economic order that promotes reduced trade barriers. Ishiba's defense comes amid concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariff policies and unilateral approach to trade, which have strained the group's ability to address global challenges. Trump reiterated his dissatisfaction with Russia's expulsion from the group and even suggested including China. The G7 leaders collectively called for de-escalation in the Middle East while supporting Israel's security, but no detailed joint statement is expected at the summit's end. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Goldman Sachs analysts, China's private enterprises are experiencing a resurgence as regulatory restrictions are being relaxed, which will allow non-state firms to pursue technological advancements and international expansion. The private sector's renewed vigor is evident in investment patterns, including increased capital expenditure, overseas expansion plans, R&D spending, and fundraising activities. The report emphasizes that the rebound's sustainability depends on predictable policies, macro stimulus to combat disinflation, and stable US-China relations. China's private sector contributes significantly to the country's GDP, urban employment, and tax revenue, but receives a disproportionately small share of bank loans.</p>

          <p>The small mountain town of Marshall, North Carolina, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Helene, has reopened to visitors after nearly nine months of recovery efforts. The French Broad River, which runs through the town, rose significantly during the storm, washing out homes and businesses. Business owners are now welcoming visitors back, with many recalling the extensive mud and damage caused by the hurricane. Volunteers from across the country assisted in the cleanup, and businesses like Flow Gallery and Zuma's Coffee have reopened, marking significant milestones in the town's recovery.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an order implementing parts of a trade agreement with the UK, reducing tariffs on UK cars shipped to the US. The deal allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, rather than the 25% import tax imposed earlier in the year, as initially agreed under the terms outlined in May. The order also addresses aerospace products but does not include the expected removal of charges on steel imports, with further negotiations planned. The UK government has stated it will continue to work towards eliminating tariffs on core steel products as agreed.</p>

          <p>British Steel has been awarded a five-year contract worth ¬£500m to supply train tracks for Network Rail, potentially securing the short-term future of the Scunthorpe steelworks. The contract, beginning on July 1, will see British Steel provide 80% of Network Rail's track needs. The deal comes after the government intervened to prevent the closure of the plant's blast furnaces by its Chinese owners. This contract guarantees work for the plant and demonstrates the government's efforts to strengthen domestic manufacturing and supply chains.</p>
