          <p>A federal judge in Vermont has ordered the release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, from ICE custody after her visa was revoked by the Trump administration. The judge criticized the government for lacking evidence against her, citing only an op-ed she co-wrote criticizing the university's response to resolutions regarding Israel and Palestine. Ozturk testified about her humanitarian work and involvement in school groups, emphasizing her commitment to child development and well-being. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that Ozturk's visa was revoked due to her pro-Palestinian activism, but the judge remained unconvinced of any threat to foreign policy.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that a federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to release Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student detained in Louisiana, stating that her detention threatened to chill the speech of millions of noncitizens.

The judge emphasized the lack of evidence suggesting she posed a threat to American foreign policy interests.

          <p>As Americans worry about maintaining their standard of living amidst rising costs and tariffs, many are adopting money-saving strategies like "no buy," "low buy," and "slow buy." These trends, popularized on TikTok, encourage consumers to cut back on non-essential spending and resist overspending due to recession fears. A study by Intuit Credit Karma found that 83% of consumers would strongly consider cutting back on non-essential spending if their financial situation worsens. While these savings challenges can provide a short-term boost, financial experts emphasize the importance of practicing good long-term financial habits.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved three color additives from natural sources for use in food, responding to growing concerns about the health effects of artificial food dyes, CBS News reports. These approvals include Galdieria extract blue, butterfly pea flower extract (expanded use), and calcium phosphate. This move aligns with calls from officials like Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., who is urging companies to phase out petroleum-based dyes. While the FDA has stopped short of an outright ban on artificial dyes, it is accelerating the review and approval of natural alternatives.</p>

The recent ruling prevents Apple from charging commissions on link-outs, paving the way for Fortnite's potential return. Apple is appealing the ruling and could still reject Fortnite's submission.
