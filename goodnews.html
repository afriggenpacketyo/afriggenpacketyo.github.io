          <p>Newly released audio from former President Joe Biden's interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur reveals Biden joking about his age and memory during questioning about classified documents. The audio, released by Axios, features Biden slurring his words and struggling to recall key events, including the death of his son, Beau. Hur's report, while declining to press charges, described Biden as a 'sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory,' a characterization that sparked criticism from Democrats and amplified Republican concerns about his mental fitness. The article notes that Biden later withdrew from the presidential race due to concerns about his performance and mental acuity, and Kamala Harris was defeated by Trump in the general election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Hinduja family tops Britain's rich list again, but the article argues the real story is the explosion of 'extreme wealth.' The gap between the rich and average person has tripled since 1989, with wealth begetting more wealth through investments. The article proposes an 'extreme wealth line' to curb the excesses of wealth inequality, similar to the poverty line, arguing that extreme wealth gives individuals too much power and causes environmental harm. The author suggests actions like raising taxes on those above the line or compelling donations to charity.</p>

          <p>The New York Knicks have reached the Eastern Conference finals for the first time in 25 years, defeating the Boston Celtics in a series marked by historic meltdowns and key injuries. After a season of roster turnover and inconsistent play, the Knicks found their identity as Eastern Conference finalists, blending resilience with explosive offense led by Karl-Anthony Towns and Jalen Brunson. President Leon Rose's strategic rebuild, marked by under-the-radar signings and trades, has transformed the team from an NBA laughing stock into legitimate title contenders.

The statue, commissioned by American artist Brad Downey, was intended to be an interrogation of President Trump‚Äôs stance on immigration, but it was often derided and unappreciated by locals.

          <p>A new genetic study has traced the migration of the first people to the Americas from modern-day Russia, revealing insights into the origins and diversity of Indigenous groups. The study, published in Science, analyzed the genomes of over 1,500 individuals from 139 ethnic groups, finding that early settlers split into isolated groups, leading to distinct genetic traits. Researchers believe the findings will help underrepresented Indigenous communities understand their ancestral origins and preserve their cultural heritage. The article notes that the study corroborates archaeological evidence and highlights the importance of ancestral knowledge for people's identities.</p>

          <p>President Trump received a series of warm welcomes during his tour of the Middle East, marked by lavish ceremonies and economic investment pledges. In Saudi Arabia, he announced the lifting of sanctions on Syria, and in Qatar, he secured billions of dollars in American goods and services investments. This contrasts sharply with the backlash he faces at home over tariff policies and immigration crackdowns. The article also notes the absence of controversy surrounding his family's business dealings during the trip.</p>

          <p>As the United States and other economic powers reduce their investment and presence in Africa, the United Arab Emirates is increasing its economic and strategic influence, investing heavily in ports, mines, and renewable energy projects. The UAE's efforts are part of an ambitious plan to increase its influence, particularly over global supply chains. The article notes that the UAE's approach involves delegating statecraft to private interests and businesses, which have ties to the government or ruling families, while some of its political choices have stirred concerns.</p>
