          <p>China displayed a scale model of its J-35A fifth-generation fighter jet at the Paris Air Show, marking the first time the aircraft has been showcased overseas. The J-35A is the land-based variant of China's latest fifth-generation fighter jet, developed by the Shenyang Aircraft Corporation (SAC). While the J-20 is prohibited from overseas export, it was also on display at CATIC‚Äôs booth. China has been seeking to boost export sales of its fighter aircraft, particularly in developing countries in the Middle East and South Asia, despite facing challenges in the European market due to political and military relations with the US.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services on the Tohoku shinkansen line between Tokyo and Sendai were suspended due to an inspection of an out-of-service train that stopped between stations. JR East, the operator, stated that services were suspended between Tokyo and Sendai stations. The affected train, which debuted last spring on the Yamagata shinkansen line, stopped between Utsunomiya and Nasushiobara stations, causing two other trains to halt as well.

          <p>Chris Woakes returns to Leeds for the beginning of England's five-Test series against India, and at 36, he has perhaps never been more important to the team. His accuracy and movement are expected to challenge an Indian lineup lacking experience in English conditions. Woakes played nine Tests in 2024, his second-most in a calendar year since his career began in 2013. He prefers to be seen as the "senior" bowler and will choose the ball at Headingley. </p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) has decided to further reduce its monthly government bond purchases beyond April next year, but at a slower pace, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5 percent. This decision underscores the BOJ's cautious approach to normalizing monetary policy amid economic uncertainties. The central bank will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen ($1.4 billion) per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen. The BOJ said it is extremely uncertain how trade and other policies in each jurisdiction will evolve and how overseas economic activity and prices will react to them. </p>

The order allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year.
