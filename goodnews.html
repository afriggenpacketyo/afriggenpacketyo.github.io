          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate against the US dollar. This action involved purchasing US$6.005 billion and selling HK$46.539 billion to curb the local currency's appreciation due to increased capital inflow. The intervention occurred ahead of a US Federal Reserve meeting where potential interest rate cuts are expected to be discussed. The HKMA indicated that the Hong Kong dollar's strength was driven by equity investment activities and regional currency appreciation, and they will continue to monitor market conditions to ensure orderly market operations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The elimination of the tariff exemption for inexpensive goods entering the U.S. is expected to significantly impact advertising revenue for platforms like Meta and Alphabet. The exemption, which allowed goods under $800 from China and Hong Kong to enter the U.S. without tariffs, fueled the growth of online retailers like Temu and Shein. These companies spent heavily on digital advertising to attract American shoppers, creating a windfall for tech giants. With the exemption now eliminated, these retailers are reducing their advertising spending, which is projected to cause a slight headwind for the ad businesses of companies like Meta and Google.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that a majority of citizens believe social media platforms should be regulated by law to combat the spread of unverified information during elections. The survey comes amid growing concerns over partisan online posts influencing election outcomes. While the Constitution guarantees freedom of expression, many respondents feel social media operators should be responsible for regulating their platforms. The survey also touched on other constitutional matters, including Article 9, same-sex marriage, and the rights of married couples to choose separate surnames.</p>

The elections also included six mayoral contests, with Reform UK winning both newly-created mayoralties. The results suggest a potential loosening of the traditional main parties' grip on voters.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law to bolster the private sector, and observers are closely watching its implementation. The law's impact on firms' ability to challenge local governments in court and its protection against arbitrary fines are of particular interest. The law forbids the use of administrative measures to intervene in economic disputes, as well as unscrupulous, profit-driven fine collections and asset seizures. Experts hope that courts will be more willing to accept and adjudicate cases fairly under the new law.</p>
