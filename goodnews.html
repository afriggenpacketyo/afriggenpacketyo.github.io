Rhode has experienced rapid growth, generating $212 million in revenue in the 12 months leading up to March 31, primarily through its website, and plans to launch in Sephora stores across North America and the U.K. Bieber will remain as Rhode's chief creative officer and head of innovation, focusing on creative direction, product development, and marketing, while E.l.f. aims to expand its skincare offerings and reach a more affluent consumer base.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia announced strong earnings and revenue figures, surpassing analyst estimates, primarily fueled by a 73% year-over-year increase in its data center business. The company's performance is attributed to high demand for its AI chips, which are essential for developing and deploying AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Nvidia projects $45 billion in sales for the current quarter, although this guidance is reduced by approximately $8 billion due to recent export restrictions on its H20 chips bound for China. Overall revenue experienced a substantial 69% growth during the quarter, highlighting Nvidia's continued expansion in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>HP's stock experienced a significant decline of 15% after the company's second-quarter earnings missed analyst expectations, primarily due to the impact of tariffs. While revenue exceeded estimates, earnings per share fell short, and the company's guidance for the third quarter and full year also disappointed. HP attributed the lower outlook to "added cost driven by the current U.S. tariffs," despite efforts to mitigate these costs by expanding manufacturing operations outside of China. The company has increased production in countries like Vietnam, Thailand, India, Mexico, and the U.S., aiming to shift nearly all North American product manufacturing out of China by the end of June.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch's stock price rose sharply despite the retailer slashing its profit outlook due to an anticipated $50 million hit from tariffs. The company now expects full-year earnings per share to be between $9.50 and $10.50, down from a previous range of $10.40 to $11.40. Despite these challenges, the company's fiscal first-quarter results exceeded Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue, leading to the stock's surge. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, Abercrombie is working with vendors to offset costs and diversify its sourcing network, with its biggest trading partners now being Vietnam, Cambodia, and India.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that June 2025 may be an opportune time to consolidate credit card debt due to several economic factors. Credit card interest rates are expected to remain high, while rates on alternative borrowing options like home equity loans and HELOCs may decrease. Consolidating debt with a lower-interest loan can help borrowers avoid the compounding interest cycle of credit cards. By consolidating with a HELOC or a debt consolidation personal loan, consumers can potentially save on interest costs and make larger payments toward their principal balance.
