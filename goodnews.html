          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, signaling a potential thaw in relations with President Xi Jinping. Both nations are navigating economic headwinds, including significant US tariffs on their goods, which appears to be a catalyst for seeking a reset in their often-strained relationship. Despite historical border disputes and a 2020 military clash, the leaders are exploring renewed economic cooperation, with discussions on resuming direct flights and easing visa restrictions. This diplomatic overture could underscore India's foreign policy flexibility and its commitment to a multipolar global order, while China seeks Global South solidarity amidst trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Canadian 25th seed Felix Auger-Aliassime achieved a significant upset at the US Open, defeating world No. 3 Alexander Zverev in a thrilling four-set match that lasted nearly four hours. This hard-fought victory, 4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-4, marks Auger-Aliassime's return to the tournament's second week for the first time since his 2021 semi-final run, showcasing some of his best career tennis. Zverev, a former runner-up, struggled with his game and growing agitation, leading to his earliest US Open exit in seven years. Auger-Aliassime will now face 15th seed Andrey Rublev, while other major contenders like Jannik Sinner and Iga Swiatek also advanced in their respective draws.</p>

          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping utilized the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit to project China as a pivotal "source of stability and certainty" in a world experiencing significant geopolitical shifts. He underscored the necessity of multilateralism, solidarity, and international cooperation as the most effective approaches to address global challenges. This high-profile gathering, described by China's foreign ministry as the largest in SCO history, attracted over 30 world leaders and heads of international organizations, including the UN Secretary-General. The summit served as a crucial platform for Beijing to reinforce its global standing and diplomatic influence, particularly in positioning itself as a leader in promoting peace and development.</p>

          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are pioneering an unconventional method to safeguard livestock from gray wolves, deploying drones equipped with loudspeakers to broadcast loud sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck" and movie dialogue. This experimental approach seeks to non-lethally deter wolves, whose recovering populations have intensified conflicts with ranchers across the western U.S. Initial studies indicate success in disrupting wolf hunts, with ranchers observing a reduction in livestock fatalities. However, the high cost of the technology, its limitations in dense forests, and the potential for wolves to eventually habituate to the drones pose ongoing challenges for this innovative coexistence strategy.</p>

          <p>The No. 9 LSU Tigers secured a hard-fought 17-10 road victory against the No. 4 Clemson Tigers in a low-scoring, defensive battle. Offense proved challenging for both teams through much of the game, with LSU's quarterback Garrett Nussmeier eventually finding Trey-Dez Green for the decisive touchdown in the fourth quarter. Clemson had multiple chances to equalize late in the game but their offense stalled, allowing LSU to preserve the upset win. Nussmeier completed 28 of 38 passes for 230 yards, while Clemson's Cade Klubnik struggled to generate significant offense. This result marks a strong start for LSU and a disappointing early season loss for Clemson.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans delivered a dominant performance in their season opener, securing a resounding 73-13 victory over Missouri State, marking their highest scoring game since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava had a seamless debut, completing 15 of 18 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns before being rested at halftime. The Trojans' defense, a focus of offseason improvements, also excelled with five sacks and a pick-six, limiting Missouri State to just 224 total yards. While the win provided a strong start and confidence boost, the article acknowledges that the opponent, a new Football Bowl Subdivision program, presented a limited challenge, making the game feel more like an extended scrimmage.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, the legendary CBS News White House correspondent, has died at the age of 73 in Washington, D.C., following a period of declining health. Knoller was widely recognized as the unofficial presidential historian and statistician, known for his meticulous, self-imposed task of recording every presidential action, movement, and public statement across eight administrations. His unparalleled dedication filled an immense void in American historical record-keeping, and he was renowned for generously sharing this encyclopedic knowledge with fellow journalists and historians. Later in his career, he reinvented himself on Twitter (now X), continuing to provide his distinctive, up-to-the-minute reporting and engaging wit to a large audience.</p>

          <h2>German Beer Sales Decline While Non-Alcoholic Varieties See Surging Popularity</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is witnessing a notable transformation in its drinking culture, as overall beer sales have fallen to their lowest level in over 30 years during the first half of 2025. In stark contrast, non-alcoholic beer varieties have seen a dramatic surge in popularity, more than doubling in sales since 2013. This trend reflects a growing health consciousness among German consumers, particularly younger demographics, leading breweries like Erdinger to significantly increase their non-alcoholic production and market it as a healthy alternative. While traditional alcoholic beer remains deeply embedded in German culture, particularly at festivals, the article highlights a clear shift towards more mindful consumption habits.</p>

          <p>The critically acclaimed Metal Gear Solid series, celebrated for its pioneering cinematic approach and exploration of complex themes, has made a comeback with the release of a remake for its third game, Metal Gear Solid Delta. This highly anticipated return occurs a decade after the contentious departure of its visionary creator, Hideo Kojima, from publisher Konami, which had left the franchise without new entries. The split was reportedly fueled by the escalating development costs of Metal Gear Solid V. The remake, which capitalizes on the current trend of successful gaming remasters, has been lauded by fans for its fidelity to the original, signaling a new chapter for the beloved stealth franchise.</p>
