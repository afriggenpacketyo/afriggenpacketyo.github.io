          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a new trade agreement with Pakistan, under which Washington will assist in developing Pakistan's "massive Oil Reserves." Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Ishaq Dar, confirmed the deal, stating it would lead to lower tariffs on Pakistani exports to the United States. This agreement comes shortly after Trump's recent imposition of a 25% tariff on India and his critical remarks regarding India's trade practices and relations with Russia. While specific details on tariff rates and oil reserves remain sparse, both nations are framing the deal as a significant step towards mutual economic benefit and strengthened ties.</p>

This ambitious undertaking, a 50-50 joint venture with Nscale and Aker, aims to deliver 100,000 NVIDIA graphics processing units by late 2026, with plans for substantial future expansion. Crucially, the facility will be powered entirely by renewable energy, leveraging Norway's abundant hydropower resources. This initiative not only expands OpenAI's global AI infrastructure but also aligns with Europe's growing emphasis on "sovereign AI," promoting data processing on European soil.</p>

          <p>Shell reported better-than-expected adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion for the second quarter, surpassing analyst consensus despite a challenging environment of lower global oil and gas prices. The energy major announced another $3.5 billion in share buybacks for the next three months, marking its 15th consecutive quarter of at least $3 billion in returns to shareholders. CEO Wael Sawan expressed satisfaction with the company's performance and its ongoing transformation efforts, noting that Shell's share price has outperformed many European and US rivals this year.

          <p>Malaysian Transport Minister Anthony Loke has indicated that Malaysian airlines, including budget carrier AirAsia and the new Air Borneo, are showing interest in purchasing China's C919 passenger jet. This growing regional interest is primarily driven by the surge in air travel across Southeast Asia and the significant backlogs in aircraft deliveries from established manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. Airlines are actively seeking to diversify their procurement options, prioritize faster delivery times, and explore more cost-effective alternatives. While no firm commitments have been made, the C919 is emerging as a compelling choice for the region's expanding aviation needs.</p>

          <p>Auction house Sotheby's has returned the sacred Piprahwa Gems, believed to be connected to the Buddha's remains, to India following significant pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders. The jewels, part of an astonishing 1898 archaeological find, were scheduled for auction in Hong Kong, which ignited a widespread ethical debate over the commodification of sacred objects linked to human remains. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed as a "proud and joyous moment" for India's cultural heritage. The gems will now be permanently displayed publicly in India, resolving a century-long dispute over their custody.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump announced a "Full and Complete" trade deal with South Korea, setting a blanket 15% tariff on Seoul's exports to the United States, a reduction from the previously threatened 25%. Under the agreement, South Korea is expected to invest $350 billion in key US industries and purchase $100 billion in liquefied natural gas and other energy products. While Trump stated 90% of profits from the investment would go to Americans, South Korean officials interpret this as reinvestment, highlighting differing interpretations of the deal's terms. This agreement marks a shift from the longstanding free trade regime, though Seoul successfully resisted concessions on sensitive agricultural sectors like rice and beef. (not investment advice)</p>
