          <p>A three-day strike by NJ Transit engineers has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a tentative deal. Train service is set to resume on Tuesday, following inspections of the train cars and tracks. The strike, which halted train service across New Jersey, impacted over 100,000 daily riders. Governor Phil Murphy described the deal as fair and fiscally responsible, involving concessions related to work rules that will offset the cost of wage increases. The last NJ Transit strike occurred in 1983, highlighting the significance of this recent labor action.</p>

          <p>The United States is considering implementing region-based tariffs rather than individual duty rates for many nations, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. This approach is being explored as the deadline for negotiating trade deals approaches, following the implementation of reciprocal tariffs in April. The Trump administration is focusing on striking deals with key trading partners, with the aim of establishing regional rates for areas like Central America and Africa. The reciprocal policy involves a baseline tariff of 10 percent for most nations and higher duties for countries with trade surpluses with the U.S.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the mayor of Bucharest, has defeated George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump, in the Romanian presidential election. With more than 98 percent of ballots counted, preliminary official results gave 54 percent of the vote in the presidential runoff to Mr. Dan, 55, the mayor of Romania‚Äôs capital, Bucharest. The election was tense due to Russia's meddling. It is likely that his victory will calm fears in Europe‚Äôs political mainstream that Romania, which borders Ukraine and plays a vital role in defending NATO‚Äôs eastern flank against Russia, might join Hungary and Slovakia in opposing help for Ukraine and in cozying up to Moscow.</p>

          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor, has won the Romanian presidential election, defeating hard-right nationalist George Simion. The victory is viewed as a setback for nationalist forces in Europe and a reaffirmation of Romania's commitment to the European Union and NATO. Simion's supporters have alleged electoral fraud, echoing claims made by Donald Trump after the 2020 U.S. election. Dan's win is expected to ease concerns about Romania aligning with countries like Hungary and Slovakia in opposing aid to Ukraine.</p>
