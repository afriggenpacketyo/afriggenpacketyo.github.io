        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) is urging 200,000 new blood donors to register, as supplies are critically low, requiring an increase in regular donors to over one million to maintain a reliable supply. The health service previously issued an "amber alert" due to low blood stocks and is now trying to avoid a "red alert," which would threaten public safety. There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types needed to treat sickle cell disease. Only a small percentage of the population donates regularly, and efforts are being made to make donating more accessible.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, across English waters. The proposal aims to extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the need for urgent action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference and follows warnings about the damage bottom trawling causes to the seabed and marine life. A 12-week consultation will seek views from the marine and fishing industry.</p>
