A single winner would have the option of a lump sum or 29 annual payments. The next drawing is scheduled for Monday, with the jackpot expected to increase if no grand prize winner emerged from this drawing.</p>

          <p>Iowa's head coach Kirk Ferentz has tied Woody Hayes' record as the Big Ten's all-time winningest coach, securing his 205th victory with the Hawkeyes in a 34-7 win over Albany. In his 27th season, Ferentz downplayed the personal milestone, focusing instead on the team's performance. Freshman Xavier Williams led Iowa's rushing attack with 122 yards and a touchdown, stepping up after an injury to the starter. The team's strong ground game compensated for a sluggish passing start, securing a comfortable season-opening victory.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans football team achieved its highest score since 1930, crushing Missouri State 73-13 in their season opener. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, completing 15 of 18 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns before halftime. The defense also impressed with five sacks and a pick-six, holding Missouri State to minimal yardage. This commanding victory served as a smooth, albeit unchallenged, start for USC's season, highlighting their offensive power and defensive improvements as they navigate a new era in college football.</p>

New quarterback Tommy Castellanos led Florida State's punishing rushing attack, contributing 78 yards and a touchdown. The unranked Seminoles, under new offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, were physical from the start, amassing 230 rushing yards.

          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in its drinking habits, with overall beer sales falling to their lowest in over 30 years, while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. The Destatis federal statistics office reported a 6.3% slump in beer sales in the first half of 2025. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting alcohol-free options, especially at sporting events, as younger generations become more health-conscious. Despite this trend, traditional full-strength beer remains a massive part of German culture, particularly in regions like Bavaria, though consumption is becoming more mindful.</p>

          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series is making a comeback with a remake of its third installment, 'Metal Gear Solid Delta,' a decade after its creator Hideo Kojima's acrimonious split from publisher Konami.

Konami's shift towards remakes, driven by gamer nostalgia and lucrative sales in the aging industry, led to this new release. Fans praise the remake for its faithful recreation of the original, improved graphics, and audio, suggesting it successfully retains Kojima's directorial 'genes' despite his absence from the project.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, 'Stranded on Honeymoon Island,' hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of 'Love Island' and 'Survivor.'

Contestants face challenges like mosquitoes, extreme heat, and lack of beauty products, aiming to test if love can thrive in isolation and adversity. This article suggests the show appeals to those seeking authenticity in dating and offers a more profound connection than typical dating shows, attracting slightly older participants.</p>

          <p>The UK is employing an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs and drones, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny insect posing a significant threat to the nation's forests. This beetle, which has devastated millions of spruce trees across Europe, was found to be spreading to the UK via winds, not just imported wood. Government scientists claim successful eradication from at-risk areas in eastern and southeastern England. However, the article notes that climate change and increasing beetle populations in Europe could make future incursions more challenging, emphasizing the ongoing need for vigilance and advanced detection methods.</p>
