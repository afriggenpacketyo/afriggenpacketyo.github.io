          <p>The founder of Chinese AI company DeepSeek, Liang Wenxing, has shared a best paper award at the prestigious Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference. The award-winning paper details a "native sparse attention" mechanism, a key innovation that enhances the efficiency of DeepSeek's AI models. The recognition highlights a trend of Chinese researchers increasingly outperforming their U.S. counterparts in the field of natural language processing. At this year's ACL conference, over half of the first-named authors on accepted papers were from China, a significant increase from the previous year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece asserts that President Donald Trump is successfully dismantling the liberal media establishment that sought to destroy his presidency. The author cites recent events as evidence, including the defunding of NPR and PBS, the departure of late-night host Stephen Colbert, and staff buyouts at The Washington Post following a shift in its editorial stance. The article credits Trump's willingness to fight back against media criticism, a strategy it claims no other recent Republican president has employed so effectively. It concludes that Trump's second term is marked by significant policy successes and a decisive victory over his media adversaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In her new book, "The Book of Alchemy," writer Suleika Jaouad champions the practice of daily journaling as a tool for self-discovery and transformation. Jaouad, who used journaling to navigate her battle with leukemia, explains how the process can help make sense of life's challenges and unlock new perspectives. She suggests that reading passages from other writers' diaries can have a "kaleidoscopic effect" on one's own writing. The article shares practical advice for starting a journaling habit, such as setting a specific duration, integrating it into a daily routine, and keeping the barrier to entry low by not worrying about the "right" way to do it.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions coach Andy Farrell has made two changes to his starting lineup for the decisive third and final Test match against the Wallabies in Sydney. Blair Kinghorn will start on the left wing, and James Ryan comes into the second row, joining a team aiming for a historic 3-0 series sweep. The selection prioritizes cohesion, with eleven players having started all three Tests, as the Lions seek their first clean sweep since 1927. The article notes that several key Australian players, including flanker Rob Valetini, will be absent due to injury, while the Wallabies have also made changes at scrum-half.</p>

          <p>Energy giant Shell reported better-than-expected second-quarter adjusted earnings of $4.26 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts despite the impact of lower global oil and gas prices. The company also announced it will continue its shareholder return program with another $3.5 billion in share buybacks over the next three months. The strong performance comes after the company flagged weaker results in some divisions, but CEO Wael Sawan expressed pleasure with the results in a challenging macroeconomic environment. The company's strategic focus on value creation, discipline, and simplification appears to be resonating well with investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the crucial but unheralded role of American cyclist Matteo Jorgenson in the 2025 Tour de France. As a "domestique" for his team's leader, Jonas Vingegaard, his job was to challenge and exhaust the dominant Tadej Pogačar, sacrificing his own ambitions. Despite struggling with bronchitis and seeing his team's main strategy fail, Jorgenson continued to push, making selfless attacks. His persistent efforts ultimately paid off on the final stage, wearing down Pogačar enough to allow his teammate Wout van Aert to secure a prestigious stage win, a testament to the unseen triumphs of teamwork in cycling.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is establishing its first major European AI data center in Norway, a project branded as "Stargate." The facility will be developed as a joint venture between British firm Nscale and Norwegian energy company Aker, with OpenAI acting as the primary customer buying its capacity. The data center, located in northern Norway, aims to house 100,000 Nvidia GPUs by the end of 2026 and will run entirely on renewable hydropower. This move aligns with Europe's push for "sovereign AI," which requires data and AI workloads to be processed on European soil, addressing the continent's need for more computing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have struck a trade agreement that will see the U.S. help develop Pakistan's significant oil reserves. President Donald Trump announced the deal, stating a U.S. oil company would be chosen to lead the partnership, while Pakistan confirmed the agreement would result in lower tariffs on its exports to the U.S. The deal was reached as Pakistan faced a potential 29% tariff from the U.S. The announcement came shortly after Washington imposed a 25% tariff on India for its trade with Russia, with Trump criticizing India's own high tariffs.</p>

          <h2>Sotheby's Returns Sacred Buddhist Jewels to India After Planned Auction Sparks Uproar</h2>

          <p>The auction house Sotheby's has returned a set of sacred jewels, believed to be linked to the Buddha's remains, to India following intense pressure from the Indian government and global Buddhist leaders. The "Piprahwa Gems," unearthed in 1898, were scheduled for auction but the sale was canceled after diplomatic intervention. The Mumbai-based Godrej Industries Group acquired the relics, facilitating their return for permanent public display in India. The planned sale had sparked a significant ethical debate over whether sacred objects connected to human remains should be treated as commercial commodities.</p>
