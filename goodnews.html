          <p>AOL has announced the termination of its iconic dial-up internet service, effective September 30th, after more than 35 years of operation. The company, now owned by Yahoo, stated the decision was part of its routine evaluation of products to meet the demands of the modern digital landscape. While the service is now used by a very small number of households, its distinctive connection sound and "You've Got Mail" greeting are remembered as hallmarks of the early internet era. Free AOL email accounts and other services will not be affected by this change.</p>

          <p>Sportswear giant Adidas has issued a public apology following accusations of cultural appropriation for its "Oaxaca Slip-On" shoe design. The shoe was inspired by traditional "huarache" sandals from the Indigenous Yalalag community in Oaxaca, Mexico, who were not involved in the product's creation. The issue drew criticism from Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and Oaxaca's governor, who highlighted the importance of protecting Indigenous intellectual property under a 2022 law. The shoe's designer also expressed deep regret, stating the intention was to honor, not appropriate, Oaxacan culture.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order to extend the existing tariff truce with China for an additional 90 days, averting an immediate escalation in the trade dispute. The decision provides temporary relief and more time for negotiators, following recent talks in Stockholm. Just before the announcement, the president publicly urged China to significantly increase its purchases of American soybeans, framing it as a way to reduce the U.S. trade deficit. This extension comes amid ongoing fragility in trade relations between the two economic powers.</p>

        </div>

          <p>An unusual agreement requires Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain AI chip sales to China in exchange for export licenses. Analysts view this as a transactional approach by the Trump administration, effectively creating an "indirect tariff at source." From an investor standpoint, the deal is seen as a net positive, as securing 85% of revenue from the vast Chinese market is preferable to being completely shut out. The move gives the companies short-term certainty but raises long-term questions about whether the government might seek a larger share in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has confirmed that his administration is actively considering reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a less restrictive drug category, with a decision expected in the coming weeks. This announcement follows reports that the president was weighing the move, causing a significant rally in cannabis stocks, many of which are currently penny stocks. Reclassification, likely to Schedule III, would ease tax burdens on marijuana companies and encourage institutional investment. While the president's support is crucial, the final authority rests with the Attorney General and the DEA. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Dohmke, the CEO of Microsoft's GitHub since 2021, has announced he is leaving the company to "become a founder again." His departure comes as GitHub faces intensifying competition from a new wave of AI-powered coding tools like Cursor and Replit. Dohmke will stay on through the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition, but no immediate successor has been named. Under his leadership, GitHub launched its popular AI-powered Copilot tool and saw its registered developer base more than double to 150 million users.</p>

          <p>The remains of Dennis "Tink" Bell, a British meteorologist who vanished in Antarctica in 1959 at age 25, have been discovered and positively identified through DNA analysis. Bell fell into a crevasse while working on a glacier, and his body was never recovered at the time. A Polish research team found his remains and over 200 personal items near a receding glacier, bringing long-awaited closure to his family after 66 years. The discovery is one of several recent instances where melting glaciers have revealed the bodies of long-missing individuals.</p>

          <p>The new "first look" production deal between the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Netflix is being interpreted in different ways, with some calling it a demotion while others see it as a continued vote of confidence. Unlike their original 2020 contract, this arrangement gives Netflix the first option on projects from Archewell Productions rather than a fixed commitment. While financial details are private, such deals can be lucrative and may include covering operational costs for the production company. The agreement confirms that despite recent speculation, Netflix still views the couple as influential figures worthy of investment.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied the Trump administration's request to unseal grand jury materials related to the Ghislaine Maxwell case, ruling that their release would not provide meaningful new information. Judge Paul Engelmayer stated that the government's premise was "demonstrably false," as the records do not identify new individuals, crimes, or investigative paths beyond what is already public. He suggested the motion could be perceived as a diversionary tactic rather than a genuine effort at transparency. The Justice Department had argued for the release based on special circumstances, a claim the judge firmly rejected.</p>

          <p>Movie theater chain AMC Entertainment reported better-than-expected second-quarter financial results, causing its stock to rise. The company posted revenue of nearly $1.4 billion and significantly narrowed its net loss to $4.7 million, or one cent per share, compared to a $32.8 million loss a year prior. CEO Adam Aron attributed the strong performance to a recovering industry-wide box office and a 26% increase in attendance. The company also successfully refinanced its near-term debt, providing a more solid foundation to capitalize on what it believes will be continued growth in the industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article suggests that seniors facing financial pressure from inflation and high living costs may want to consider a reverse mortgage to supplement their income. The tool is presented as particularly beneficial for those with significant home equity but limited liquid cash, or for those who wish to age in place and need funds for home modifications. A reverse mortgage allows homeowners to borrow against their home's value without making monthly payments, providing tax-free funds. However, it is a significant financial decision that carries risks and is not suitable for every homeowner. (not investment advice)</p>
