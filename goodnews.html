          <p>Nvidia refuted reports that it plans to send graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China for modification to comply with U.S. export controls. A spokesperson for Nvidia clarified that the company is not sending any GPU designs to China. The Financial Times had previously reported that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed a potential new research and development center in Shanghai with the city's mayor, aimed at assessing ways to meet U.S. restrictions while serving the local market. The company's denial aims to dispel concerns about technology transfer and adherence to export regulations.</p>

          <p>President Trump concluded a three-nation Middle East tour, marked by opulent receptions and significant business deals with Gulf states. A notable development was Trump's diplomatic engagement with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, reversing previous U.S. policy. Trump also announced the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria to support its rebuilding efforts. While the White House touted deals worth billions for U.S. companies, details remained sparse.

          <p>Shares of Cartier owner Richemont experienced a 7% jump following a report of better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division. Revenues increased by 7% year-on-year, exceeding analyst forecasts, although sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment due to weakness in the Asia-Pacific region. Despite ongoing global uncertainties, Richemont Chairman Johann Rupert noted the company's robust overall performance, fueled by remarkable growth in jewelry and retail. Analysts suggest that the company's pricing power could help offset potential headwinds such as gold prices and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that some unexpected college majors, such as nutrition, art history, and philosophy, are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects. The unemployment rate for computer science and computer engineering majors was notably higher than the national average, while majors in nutrition and art history had significantly lower unemployment rates. This shift in employment prospects is attributed to the increasing demand for creative thinking and soft skills in the age of artificial intelligence, as well as the continued high demand for healthcare professionals.</p>

          <p>A $50,000 annuity can supplement retirement income, offering guaranteed monthly payouts, but the amount varies based on age, gender, and contract terms. For example, a 65-year-old man might receive around $322 per month, while a woman would receive about $309 monthly. While the monthly income may not cover all expenses, it can provide financial security and protect against longevity risk. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding annuity terms and considering other financial goals before investing, noting that annuities are not a liquid asset.</p>
