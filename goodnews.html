          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-12 15:21:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve anticipates its first interest rate cuts in a year, market attention is shifting to a record $7.6 trillion held in money market funds. While some analysts predict this "wall of cash" will flow into riskier assets like stocks and bonds, others, like Peter Crane of Crane Data, argue that money market assets historically only decline during severe economic crises. Crane suggests that a 25-basis-point cut won't significantly alter the appeal of money funds, especially given their higher yields compared to bank deposits. Investors are advised to assess their risk tolerance and consider options like treasury ETFs or rebalancing equity portfolios as rates become less attractive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As mortgage interest rates continue to fall, reaching their lowest in almost a year ahead of an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut, potential homebuyers are seeing a timely opportunity. Mortgage applications have surged, signaling renewed market activity. However, experts advise buyers to consider four crucial factors: timing the market, maintaining a high credit score for the best rates, prioritizing the right home over waiting for even lower rates, and securing pre-approval to demonstrate serious intent. This article highlights that while the market is cooling, strategic planning remains essential for successful home purchases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has named Mitch Kamin, a seasoned lawyer and nonprofit executive, as her new chief of staff, marking her third such appointment in less than three years. Kamin brings decades of experience, including fighting the Trump administration's immigration policies and leading legal services for underserved communities. His appointment comes as the Trump administration continues its immigration crackdown in Los Angeles. Kamin replaces Carolyn Webb de Macias, who had extended her service beyond an initial one-year commitment, and is expected to lead the mayor's office with a focus on effectiveness and performance.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is organizing a delegation of American growers and agricultural exporters to visit China this autumn, including exchanges with officials in Beijing and participation in a major import fair in Shanghai. This marks the third annual trip, but it carries added significance as both nations seek to stabilize relations despite ongoing trade tensions. China remains the largest overseas market for American farmers, and this visit aims to foster dialogue and maintain trade ties, even as Beijing has reportedly reduced purchases from the U.S. in recent years.</p>

          <p>With multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts already issued and more anticipated, the decision to renew a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account maturing this September warrants careful consideration. While current CD rates are lower than a year ago, they remain significantly higher than early-decade lows, still offering potential for hundreds or thousands in interest, especially from online banks. Renewing a CD provides fixed-rate protection against future market volatility, making it a valuable option for savers. This article suggests that locking in a competitive rate now might be a final opportunity before further reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has initiated a pilot program to expedite the deployment of air taxis, with leading electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) companies Joby Aviation and Archer Aviation participating. This program will establish public-private partnerships across at least five projects to promote the safe use of eVTOL aircraft, with supervised trials potentially starting next year. U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy emphasized America's leadership in this "next great technological revolution." Both companies view this as a crucial step toward widespread commercial air taxi service, aiming to cut emissions and ease traffic.</p>

          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections, marking a significant victory for democracy. This conviction, alongside seven allies, challenges historical norms of impunity for military figures involved in coups. While celebrated by democracy defenders and targeted groups, the ruling is expected to galvanize Bolsonaro's domestic supporters, who view him as a martyr. The article notes the US's backing of Bolsonaro and an alarming attempt to export anti-democratic impulses. The fight for democracy in Brazil, though strengthened, is far from over.</p>
