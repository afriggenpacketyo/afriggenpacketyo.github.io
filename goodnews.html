        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese secured a second term, marking a significant win for the center-left Labor Party. Voters, grappling with a cost-of-living crisis, chose Albanese over conservative opposition leader Peter Dutton, whose campaign echoed some of Donald Trump's policies. Despite concerns about incremental changes, voters opted for the 'known evil,' as one lecturer put it, amid a challenging global environment. Albanese emphasized facing global challenges 'the Australian way,' signaling a focus on domestic solutions and independence from foreign influence. The Labor Party is expected to widen its parliamentary majority, reflecting a shift in voter sentiment. Optimism Score: 65</p>

          <p>A Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas has deemed the administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act as 'unlawful,' joining a chorus of judges across the country who have ruled against the president. Michael Scherer of The Atlantic notes that the judiciary is the primary institution opposing Trump's agenda during his second term. This resistance from the legal system marks a significant development amidst the absence or retreat of other institutions that previously challenged the administration's policies. The defining fact of Trump's second term is that the judiciary is stepping in to step in. Optimism Score: 60</p>
