          <p>British-Egyptian pro-democracy activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has spoken publicly for the first time since being released from an Egyptian prison, describing his difficult recovery from more than a decade of incarceration. He recounted the severe conditions, including a near-fatal hunger strike and total isolation, but now finds joy in reconnecting with his family. While he hopes to return to the UK soon, his ability to travel remains uncertain, and he states that while he is committed to fighting for a better world, his days of street activism are over.</p>

          <p>Germany's Social Democrats are advocating for legislation to criminalize verbal sexual harassment in public spaces, commonly known as "catcalling," arguing that the existing laws are inadequate. Currently, such behavior is not specifically listed as a sexual offense and is seldom successfully prosecuted under general insult laws due to narrow judicial interpretations. While several other European nations have already passed similar laws, the proposal faces resistance from coalition partners in Germany who question its practicality and effectiveness.</p>

          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has announced an agreement to build a facility for the Qatari Emiri Air Force at Mountain Home Air Force Base in Idaho. This initiative will allow Qatari pilots to train on their F-15 aircraft alongside U.S. military personnel, aiming to improve interoperability and strengthen the strategic partnership. The announcement drew criticism from some right-wing activists due to past allegations against Qatar, prompting Hegseth to clarify that the U.S. will maintain full operational control over the existing base.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Men's National Soccer Team played to a 1-1 draw against a formidable Ecuador side, displaying notable progress in their tactical execution under coach Mauricio Pochettino. Striker Folarin Balogun scored the American equalizer in the 71st minute, responding to an earlier goal from Ecuadorian veteran Enner Valencia. Despite controlling possession for large portions of the match, the U.S. team expressed a sense of disappointment, believing their strong performance should have resulted in a victory as they continue preparations for the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has officially rejected a proposal from the Trump administration that would have granted it preferential access to federal funding in exchange for adhering to a set of prescribed policies. In a letter, MIT's president stated that the deal's terms, which included capping international student enrollment and limiting political expression, were inconsistent with the university's core values of academic freedom and independence. The university maintained its position that scientific funding should be awarded based on scientific merit alone.</p>

          <p>President Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for what his office termed a "routine yearly checkup," though his previous annual physical was conducted just six months ago. A memo released by the president's physician confirmed the visit was a scheduled follow-up involving advanced imaging and lab work, concluding that the 79-year-old president remains in "excellent overall health." During the appointment, which Mr. Trump himself called a "semiannual physical," he also received his annual flu shot and an updated COVID-19 booster.</p>

While the other four horses have since recovered and returned to duty, it was determined that a peaceful retirement at The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire was the best course of action for Quaker's long-term welfare.</p>
