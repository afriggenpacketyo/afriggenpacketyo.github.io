          <p>Bristol Myers Squibb and Pfizer announced they will sell their popular blood-thinning medication, Eliquis, directly to patients at a 40% discount from its list price. This move allows the pharmaceutical giants to bypass pharmacy benefit managers, potentially mitigating pricing pressures from the government. Analysts do not expect this to negatively impact the companies' net pricing, as the drug is already heavily rebated. The decision is also seen as a strategic effort to build goodwill with the Trump administration amid threats of drug pricing reform. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House announced that President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency, described as a benign and common condition, after he noticed swelling in his legs. Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stated that a comprehensive examination, including vascular studies, ruled out more serious issues like deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. The diagnosis was made public after photos from a recent event showed the president with swollen ankles. The White House physician affirmed that Mr. Trump remains in excellent overall health, with all related test results falling within normal limits.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned six key leaders and affiliates of Tren de Aragua, a violent Venezuelan gang with expanding influence across the Western Hemisphere. The sanctioned individuals include the gang's notorious leader, Hector "Niño Guerrero" Rusthenford Flores, and his wife. This action blocks their assets and prohibits transactions with them, aiming to dismantle the gang's operations, which include murder, human trafficking, and extortion. The move aligns with the Trump administration's designation of the gang as a foreign terrorist organization and its broader goal to combat transnational criminal groups.</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has approved Yulia Svyrydenko, a former economy minister, as the new prime minister, following the resignation of Denys Shmyhal. This major government reshuffle comes as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seeks to rearrange the executive branch to better implement agreements with international partners during the ongoing war with Russia. While the move occurred under martial law, raising some legal questions from the opposition, Svyrydenko is seen as a dynamic, trusted ally of the president. Analysts suggest the change is aimed at improving management and credibility, though key policy decisions will likely remain with the president's office.</p>

          <p>Representatives from the British Medical Association (BMA) and UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting have engaged in "constructive discussions" to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors. The doctors are in a dispute over pay, arguing that their wages have not kept pace with inflation over the last 17 years. While the government insists its 5.4% pay offer is final, it is reportedly exploring other solutions to improve working conditions. Both sides have expressed a willingness to continue negotiations, creating a "window of opportunity" to resolve the conflict and avoid further disruption to the NHS.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of lawmakers has introduced legislation to classify extreme heat as a "major disaster" under the Stafford Act, which would make affected communities eligible for federal FEMA assistance. The move follows a record-breaking heat dome in June and aims to unlock funding for cooling centers, water infrastructure, and heat adaptation projects. Currently, extreme heat is not explicitly listed as a qualifying disaster, and past requests for such declarations have been denied. Proponents argue the change is vital as heat kills more Americans than any other weather event.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to lower the voting age to 16 for all elections, a move ministers say will boost democratic engagement among young people. The proposal has drawn criticism from opponents who claim it is a political maneuver to benefit the Labour Party, which polls show is more popular with younger voters. However, polling data for 16 and 17-year-olds is scarce, and their small share of the electorate means the overall impact on election results would likely be minimal. The debate highlights the fracturing political landscape, with various parties vying for the youth vote.</p>
