          <p>Despite rising US-China tensions, Chinese students continue to pursue higher education in the United States, but they are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants are now prioritizing well-known schools, highly-ranked programs, and the safety of the campus city more than before. For many, the appeal of greater academic freedom and the unique culture of American life still outweighs concerns about political instability or personal risk. This shift indicates a more calculated approach from students weighing the significant opportunities against potential downsides.</p>

          <p>Disgraced former U.S. Representative George Santos has begun serving his seven-year prison sentence at a federal facility in New Jersey. Santos pleaded guilty to multiple federal charges, including wire fraud and identity theft, stemming from lies about his background and the misuse of campaign funds for personal luxury expenses. His expulsion from Congress in 2023 was a historic event, marking the downfall of a politician whose career was built on a foundation of fabrications. Before reporting to prison, Santos posted on social media that "legends never truly exit."</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. Court of Appeals panel has ruled that President Trump's executive order aimed at curtailing birthright citizenship is unconstitutional. The 9th Circuit Court found the order contradicts the plain language of the Fourteenth Amendment, which grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The Trump administration had argued that the amendment's jurisdiction clause does not apply to children of undocumented immigrants, an interpretation the court rejected as unmoored from legal principles. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy, which remains on hold due to multiple court injunctions.</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has reached a new milestone, joining the list of the 20 most valuable U.S. companies after its stock more than doubled in 2025. The company's market capitalization rose to $375 billion, surpassing established giants like Home Depot and Procter & Gamble. This surge is driven by investor optimism in its artificial intelligence business and its strong ties to the U.S. government, with its government-related revenue growing 45% in the last quarter. Despite its high valuation, the company's sales remain a fraction of other firms in the top 20. (not investment advice)</p>
