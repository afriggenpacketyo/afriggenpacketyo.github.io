        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Oracle's stock price increased by 27% in extended trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business fueled by artificial intelligence demands. This significant investor confidence came even as the company's quarterly earnings and revenue slightly missed Wall Street estimates. Oracle announced it had signed several multi-billion dollar cloud contracts and raised its future revenue forecasts, highlighting a massive 359% increase in its remaining performance obligation. The growth reflects the high demand for cloud services and AI-powering GPUs, positioning Oracle as a major competitor in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Apple introduced its latest iPhone 17 series, featuring incremental updates to the base and Pro models and a newly designed, ultra-thin iPhone Air. While the event did not reveal major breakthroughs in Apple's generative AI strategy, the hardware updates, including better processors and cameras, are seen as sufficient to maintain consumer interest. The company also implemented a new pricing structure that effectively raises the average selling price for its Pro models by adjusting storage configurations. Analysts believe these updates provide Apple with the necessary time to further develop its "Apple Intelligence" offerings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, issued a strong warning that companies failing to adopt artificial intelligence quickly will face significant competitive disadvantages. Speaking at a Goldman Sachs conference, she emphasized that the biggest threat to established businesses is an individual or competitor who deeply integrates AI into their operations. Friar also addressed the immense demand for computing power needed for AI development, which has prompted OpenAI to seek partnerships beyond Microsoft. Her comments underscore the rapid pace of AI integration and the strategic imperative for businesses to adapt.</p>

          <h2>Upcoming Inflation Reports Expected to Show Price Increases, But Fed Rate Cut Still Likely</h2>

          <p>Key inflation data to be released this week, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), is anticipated to show a rise in prices for August. Economists predict a 0.3% monthly increase, which would push the annual inflation rate to 2.9%, largely due to tariff-sensitive goods. Despite this expected uptick, analysts believe the Federal Reserve will likely proceed with an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. Policymakers are expected to focus on the unchanged "core" inflation rate and a weakening job market, viewing the tariff-related price hikes as a temporary issue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has suspended its plans to remodel its restaurant interiors, citing customer feedback that the modern designs did not align with the brand's beloved "Old Country Store" aesthetic. This decision follows a recent controversy where the company faced intense backlash from conservative customers and influencers for introducing a minimalist new logo. After quickly reverting to its original "Old Timer" logo, the company is now also shelving the interior redesigns to reinforce its commitment to its traditional, vintage Americana identity. The company stated it is listening to its customers and focusing on its core brand experience.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for playing Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was detained by Los Angeles police for five hours following an altercation over a parking spot. The incident occurred while Cruz was washing his car, when three women parked very close to him.

The women reported it as an assault, leading to his brief custody, though his agent characterizes it as a misunderstanding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that the tax cuts signed into law by President Trump will have a varied impact across different states. Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to receive the largest average tax cut, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest benefits. This geographic disparity is driven by provisions that favor higher earners and business owners, as well as an increased deduction cap for state and local taxes, which benefits residents of high-tax states. The typical filer nationwide could see an average tax reduction of $3,752 in 2026. (not investment advice)</p>
