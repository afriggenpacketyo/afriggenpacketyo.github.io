          <h2>Apprenticeship Funding Shift Prioritizes Under-21s in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 19:50:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is revamping apprenticeship funding to focus on individuals under 21, potentially impacting postgraduate-level apprenticeships. Funding for Level 7 apprenticeships, equivalent to a master's degree, will now be restricted to those under 21, aiming to create 120,000 more training opportunities for young adults. This shift has sparked controversy, with critics arguing it could undermine advanced training in sectors like healthcare and limit access to professions for those without university degrees. The government defends the change as a necessary step to prioritize younger workers and address the decline in entry-level apprenticeships.</p>

          <p>As rocket launches become more frequent, physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight to understand and mitigate the impact of rocket noise on communities. Researchers at Brigham Young University are analyzing SpaceX's Falcon 9 rockets to understand the causes of sonic booms and how they propagate through the atmosphere. SpaceX is also testing Starship, the largest rocket ever, and scientists aim to gather data before rocket noise becomes a pervasive issue. The goal is to find ways to lessen disruptions caused by rocket launches and sonic booms.</p>

          <p>King Charles and Queen Camilla visited Canada, with the visit interpreted as a subtle assertion of Canadian sovereignty amid tensions with the United States under President Trump. Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation for Charles to open Parliament is seen as a deliberate emphasis on Canada's distinct heritage. The visit underscores Canada's commitment to its own identity and political traditions, separate from potential U.S. influence. The King's presence and delivery of the speech from the throne serve as a symbolic affirmation of Canada's independent future.</p>

          <p>A black bear surprised Kentucky homeowners after it crashed through their ceiling and landed on their kitchen stove. The incident occurred early in the morning when the bear climbed a ladder, entered the attic, and fell through the ceiling. A game warden and sheriff's deputy were able to safely guide the bear out of the house, and no injuries were reported. The incident has garnered attention on social media, with users humorously referencing classic bear-related stories and cartoons.</p>
