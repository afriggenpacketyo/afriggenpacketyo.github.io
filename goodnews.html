          <p>NATO leaders have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP by 2035, drawing both praise and criticism. President Trump lauded the agreement, while some allies, like Spain, expressed reservations. Current spending levels vary significantly among members, with Poland exceeding 4% while others fall short of the previous 2% target. The non-binding nature of the targets raises questions about their implementation.</p>
