          <p>Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) media students participated in the Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival, which was cut short due to severe weather and flooding. Students gained hands-on experience in broadcasting, sound mixing, filming, and reporting. The partnership between MTSU and Bonnaroo provides students with real-world experience, with some alumni going on to work with major artists. Despite the festival's cancellation, the students were able to utilize new technology and gain valuable skills in the media field.</p>

          <p>Music therapy, which combines talk, music, and lyrical composition, is as effective as cognitive behavioral therapy in managing cancer symptoms and anxieties. A study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting showed that music therapy can help patients process their emotions and improve their quality of life. The therapy involves trained therapists guiding patients in expressing their feelings through music creation and conversation. For some, like Cynthia Cherish Malaran, music therapy provided a way to cope with stress and emotions after being diagnosed with breast cancer, leading to healing and stress regulation.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved for Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder causing insatiable hunger, offering new hope to patients. This breakthrough comes amid concerns that federal funding cuts could hinder future research into obesity and rare diseases. While Vykat XR's high cost remains a challenge, researchers hope its development will provide insights into the biology of extreme appetite. Early results show the drug is transforming the lives of patients by easing their anxiety about food and enabling them to live more independently.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms have been added to Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring licenses for domestic firms to ship products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions and aims to tighten loopholes. The new domestic export controls could also increase the punishment for potential breaches in the future, according to analysts.</p>
