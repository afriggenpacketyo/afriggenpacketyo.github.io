          <p>Gemini Space Station, the cryptocurrency exchange founded by the Winklevoss brothers, saw its shares surge over 40% on Thursday following its initial public offering on Nasdaq. The stock opened at $37.01 after pricing at $28, valuing the company at approximately $3.3 billion. Despite reporting net losses in 2024 and the first half of this year, Gemini, which holds over $21 billion in assets, offers a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin and custody services. The Winklevoss brothers, early Bitcoin investors, predict Bitcoin will reach $1 million within a decade, emphasizing the need for smart crypto regulation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article advises on whether to renew a $10,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) account maturing in September 2025, given recent and anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts. Despite rates being lower than in 2024, renewing a CD is still recommended for several reasons. Investors can still earn hundreds or thousands in interest, protect their money with a fixed rate against market volatility, and potentially lock in one of the last high rates before further reductions. The stability offered by fixed CD rates is highlighted as crucial in the current uncertain economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

This program will establish at least five public-private partnerships to promote safe eVTOL usage, with supervised trials potentially starting next year. The initiative aligns with President Trump's executive order to foster U.S. leadership in advanced aviation. Proponents tout eVTOL technology's potential to reduce emissions and traffic, marking a significant step towards widespread commercial air taxi service.</p>

          <p>Nepal has appointed former Supreme Court Chief Justice Sushila Karki as its interim prime minister, making her the first woman to lead the Himalayan nation's government. This appointment follows fiery anti-corruption protests, initially sparked by a social media ban, which led to the resignation of the previous prime minister and resulted in over 50 deaths. Karki, known for her stance against corruption, was sworn in after negotiations between the president, army, and protest leaders. Her selection is seen as a move to stabilize the country and pave the way for general elections within six months.</p>

          <h2>Investing Club Advises Focusing on Value Over Price for High-Cost Stocks</h2>

          <p>This article from CNBC's Investing Club challenges the notion that regular investors should avoid high-priced stocks, emphasizing that "value is what you get, price is what you pay." It advises focusing on valuation metrics like price-to-earnings ratio and dividend yield, rather than share price, when making investment decisions. The article highlights that fractional shares and dividend yields are proportional to the dollar amount invested, not the number of shares, making expensive stocks accessible. It encourages investors to prioritize fundamental company characteristics and growth opportunities over arbitrary share cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brazil's supreme court sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 elections, a significant victory for Brazilian democracy. The plot involved an online disinformation campaign and plans to assassinate the newly elected president, culminating in the January 2023 Brasília riots. Seven allies were also convicted, with the coup failing due to military and air force chiefs' refusal to participate. While hailed as a challenge to impunity, the conviction may fuel Bolsonaro's supporters, who view him as a martyr, indicating the ongoing fight for democratic stability.</p>

          <p>This article reviews "Downton Abbey: The Grand Finale," praising it as a fitting conclusion to the beloved British costume drama. The film, set in 1930, grounds itself in familial and social dramas, exploring contemporary issues through a historical lens, such as Lady Mary's divorce scandal and Lord Grantham's resistance to generational change. Creator Julian Fellowes effectively blends archaic norms with modern relevance, offering both escape and commentary. With returning favorites and delightful new additions, the article suggests the finale provides a pleasurable, albeit potentially temporary, visit with the Crawley family, leaving open the possibility of future installments.</p>

          <p>A record $7.6 trillion is currently held in money market funds, but experts are debating whether this "wall of cash" will shift into riskier assets once the Federal Reserve begins cutting interest rates. While some believe lower yields will push money into stocks and bonds, others, like Peter Crane of Crane Data, argue that money fund assets typically only decline when rates hit zero during severe economic crises. Crane notes that most of this cash is institutional and unlikely to move significantly, especially given that bank deposits offer even lower returns. (not investment advice)</p>

Arthur Fery will make his debut in the second match due to an injury to Jacob Fearnley. The tie's winner will advance to next February's first round, aiming for the 2026 title. Despite being heavy favorites, Norrie's challenging match underscores the unpredictable nature of the competition, with Britain needing this win to maintain their elite status.</p>

          <p>The family of Steve Biko, the iconic South African anti-apartheid activist, expressed confidence that a new inquest into his 1977 death will finally lead to prosecutions. Biko died from a brain injury while in police detention, with authorities initially claiming he hit his head. Post-apartheid, former officers admitted to assaulting him, but no one was prosecuted. His son, Nkosinathi Biko, emphasized the country's need to address its violent past for true democracy. The inquest, reopening 48 years after his death, seeks accountability for apartheid-era crimes, with two linked individuals in their 80s still alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article recounts the 1985 congressional hearing where Tipper Gore's Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) advocated for warning labels on music with explicit lyrics, facing opposition from musicians like Dee Snider of Twisted Sister. Gore argued for "truth in packaging" to aid parental guidance, while Snider defended artistic freedom and parental responsibility. The PMRC's efforts, despite claims of censorship, led to the industry adopting "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" stickers. These labels, though voluntary, influenced retail decisions and ironically boosted sales for some artists, highlighting the enduring debate over content regulation and youth protection.</p>

          <p>The European Union has accepted Microsoft's commitments to unbundle its Teams communication platform from its productivity apps, allowing the tech giant to avoid a potentially hefty antitrust fine. Microsoft was accused of breaching competition rules by tying Teams with Office products. Under the agreement, Microsoft will offer Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites at reduced prices without Teams, permit long-term license holders to switch, and ensure interoperability with rival tools. This decision, following a complaint by Salesforce-owned Slack, aims to foster fair competition and provides a significant regulatory outcome for the tech industry.</p>
