          <p>KFC has announced a five-year growth plan that includes a ¬£1.5 billion investment to create 7,000 new jobs across the UK and Ireland. The fast-food chain intends to focus on setting up shops in key locations, including Ireland and northwest England, while also upgrading existing sites. This expansion comes as competitors like Wingstop and Popeyes are also growing in the British and Irish markets. KFC will invest in its supply chain to strengthen relationships with companies like Pilgrim's Europe and McCormick. The fried chicken market in Britain alone is worth billions, according to research.

          <p>Businesses are utilizing the "first sale rule," a decades-old piece of U.S. customs law, to minimize the impact of tariffs. This rule allows U.S. importers to calculate customs duties based on the price of the first sale in a series of transactions, often reducing the duty imposed. To apply the rule, there must be at least two sales involving an overseas producer and an intermediary, carried out at arm's length by independent parties, with proof that the item was destined for the U.S. Italian luxury fashion brand Moncler has cited the first sale rule as providing significant benefit to its cost structure.

          <p>A shift toward nuclear power is gaining momentum in Europe as countries seek greater energy independence. Denmark is reconsidering its 40-year ban on nuclear power, Spain is reportedly open to reviewing the shutdown of its nuclear plants, and Germany has dropped its opposition to atomic power. This renewed interest is driven by the costs associated with renewables and the desire for more reliable energy sources. Denmark's government plans to analyze the potential of new advanced nuclear technologies, such as small modular reactors, to complement solar and wind technologies.

It praised the government's planning reforms and infrastructure investment plans but cautioned that global uncertainty and volatile financial markets mean difficult choices lie ahead for balancing taxation and spending.
