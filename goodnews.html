          <p>President Donald Trump has reversed his plan to send federal forces to San Francisco following conversations with tech leaders, including Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff. The president also cited a call with Mayor Daniel Lurie, acknowledging the city's progress in addressing crime. This decision is seen as a political victory for Mayor Lurie, who has advocated for local solutions and partnerships with federal agencies like the FBI and DEA rather than a military presence. The city has recently reported significant decreases in crime rates and a resurgence in business and tourism, driven largely by the AI boom.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress has passed the IRS MATH Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at making "math error" notices sent to taxpayers easier to understand. These notices are issued when the IRS identifies simple clerical or mathematical mistakes on tax returns, proposing changes and additional taxes owed. The legislation, now awaiting the president's signature, requires the IRS to provide clearer explanations of the error and the steps needed for correction. Lawmakers and taxpayer advocates have argued that the current notices are often confusing and don't adequately explain the 60-day window taxpayers have to respond before the changes become final.</p>

          <p>India has secured the last remaining spot in the Women's Cricket World Cup semi-finals after a decisive 53-run victory over New Zealand in Navi Mumbai. Centuries from Pratika Rawal and Smriti Mandhana powered the co-hosts to a commanding total of 340-3, the highest of the tournament so far. Despite a weather-interrupted match, India's performance was strong enough to eliminate both New Zealand and Sri Lanka from contention. The victory marks a crucial return to form for India, which had lost its previous three matches, and sets them up to join Australia, South Africa, and England in the knockout stages.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial conglomerate Dover surged after the company reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits and raised its full-year earnings guidance. While revenue slightly missed expectations, adjusted earnings per share of $2.62 comfortably beat consensus estimates, rising 15.4% year-over-year. The company highlighted strong performance in its Pumps & Process Solutions segment, driven by growth markets like data centers for AI, biopharma, and liquified natural gas exports. Executives expressed optimism for 2026, noting that for the first time in years, no business unit is forecasting a decline in revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government has announced it will step in to pay the October salaries for approximately 11,000 local employees at U.S. military bases in the country. This measure is intended to prevent financial hardship for the workers, whose pay is at risk due to the ongoing U.S. federal government shutdown. A German Finance Ministry spokeswoman described the action as a "sign of solidarity" with the U.S. armed forces stationed there. Germany, a key NATO ally, anticipates that the U.S. government will eventually reimburse these funds once the shutdown ends and its budget is approved.</p>

          <p>Researchers have found a potential link between the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine and improved survival for cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy. The observational study, involving over 1,000 patients with advanced lung cancer and melanoma, found that those who received the vaccine within 100 days of starting immune checkpoint therapy had a median survival nearly twice as long as those who did not. The benefit was most pronounced in patients with tumors typically resistant to immunotherapy. While these findings are promising, researchers emphasize that a randomized clinical trial is necessary to confirm a causal relationship and revolutionize oncologic care.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese toymaker Pop Mart, known for its popular Labubu collectible dolls, fell 9% despite the company reporting that its third-quarter U.S. sales had swelled by over 1,200%. The stock's decline reflects growing investor concern that the collecting craze may be peaking, as data from resale platforms shows some Labubu dolls selling at or below their retail price. Analysts are divided, with some seeing it as a sign of slowing demand, while others suggest it may be the result of Pop Mart successfully increasing supply to counter scalpers. The company has significantly boosted production to meet global demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For individuals facing a significant $30,000 credit card balance, paying it off in one year requires an aggressive financial strategy beyond standard monthly payments. This article explores several methods, including debt settlement, where creditors agree to accept a lower amount, though this can damage one's credit score. Other options for those with better credit include using a 0% APR balance transfer card to eliminate interest or consolidating the debt into a personal loan with a lower fixed rate. For those in severe financial distress, bankruptcy is presented as a final option to eliminate the debt. (not investment advice)</p>

Winter successfully spearheaded the creation of new riverfront parks and neighborhood projects that replaced asphalt with permeable surfaces. Her work was driven by the belief that embracing nature-based solutions was central to creating a more livable and climate-resilient Los Angeles for the future.</p>

This clarification comes as the administration has recently taken stakes in other companies deemed vital to national security, such as Intel and MP Materials. Quantum computing is a field of intense focus for governments due to its potential military applications, including the ability to break advanced encryption.</p>

While allocations remain relatively small, the trend indicates a growing acceptance of assets like gold and bitcoin as legitimate portfolio hedges.

          <p>According to sources familiar with an internal Department of Justice memo, evidence gathered by original prosecutors in the case against New York Attorney General Letitia James appears to undercut some of the indictment's claims. The memo reportedly concluded that James's personal financial benefit from an allegedly falsified mortgage was minimal, around $800 in the first year. Prosecutors also expressed concern that vague federal guidelines on what constitutes "occupancy" for a second home would make it difficult to prove intentional fraud beyond a reasonable doubt. The indictment was secured by an interim U.S. Attorney appointed after the previous one was ousted by President Trump.</p>

          <p>With credit card debt at a record high and interest rates soaring, this article outlines several legitimate pathways for consumers to seek debt forgiveness. One primary method is working with a debt relief company, which negotiates with creditors to settle the debt for a reduced lump-sum amount, though this can impact credit scores. Other options include contacting card issuers directly to enroll in hardship programs that may lower rates or pause payments. Additionally, nonprofit credit counseling agencies can arrange debt management plans that consolidate payments and reduce interest, providing a structured way to pay off the full balance.

          <p>Southwest Airlines, long known for its no-frills, open-seating model, is making significant changes to attract premium travelers. The airline is introducing new cabins with assigned seating, in-seat power, larger overhead bins, and an extra legroom section, officially ending its iconic open boarding policy in the new year. This shift follows the recent introduction of fees for checked bags, another departure from its traditional value-oriented approach. Industry analysts suggest these moves were necessary for Southwest to remain competitive as even budget carriers like Frontier begin offering more premium perks to travelers.</p>
