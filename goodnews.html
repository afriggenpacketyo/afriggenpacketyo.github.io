          <h2>CVS Caremark Limits Weight Loss Drug Coverage, Favoring Wegovy Over Zepbound</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CVS Caremark's decision to exclude Zepbound, a weight-loss drug shown to be more effective than Wegovy, has sparked controversy and patient concern. This move, affecting many Americans, highlights the power of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in shaping prescription coverage and potentially disrupting patient treatments. While Caremark claims this decision aims to lower drug prices by 10-15%, some patients worry about being forced to switch to a less effective medication. The New York Times article emphasizes the ongoing issue of secret deals between drugmakers and middlemen that impact patient access to optimal healthcare.</p>
