          <p>Jill Lepore's new book, "We the People: A History of the U.S. Constitution," delves into the continuous struggle to amend and preserve America's foundational document as a dynamic framework for an evolving nation. The article highlights the Constitution as an "explosion of ideas" that, despite its origins on parchment and ink from natural sources, endures and changes over time, ingeniously accounting for the passage of time. Lepore argues that the document attempts to solve ancient problems related to the people and their rulers, governmental structure, and the nature of rights. This historical perspective underscores the Constitution's role as a living framework, adapting to societal needs while remaining the world's most influential and one of its oldest. The book emphasizes the ongoing dialogue and reinterpretation necessary for its survival.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic and Zepbound is significantly impacting the apparel industry, creating what some are calling the "Ozempic effect." Resale stores are reporting a surge in larger sizes and increased demand for smaller garments, prompting retailers to adjust inventory and even farm out plus-sized clothing production. The article notes that while the size curve is shifting, demand for inclusive sizing within the larger range remains, as these drugs reduce weight but not height. Fashion experts warn against prematurely scaling back plus-size offerings, emphasizing that a large segment of consumers remains underserved, and widespread drug adoption hinges on greater price accessibility.</p>

          <p>Tech giants Apple, Google, and Meta are rapidly advancing towards creating real-time universal translators, transforming a science fiction concept into a near-reality. Apple's new AirPods Pro 3 feature Live Translation for several languages, enabling seamless, simultaneous two-way conversations, though it won't initially be available in the EU. Google's Pixel 10 offers Voice Translate for phone calls, uniquely preserving speaker voice inflections, while Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses provide transcribed translations on a user's phone. These innovations, driven by generative AI, are poised to reshape communication and industries, with the article noting that translation jobs are among the most threatened by AI advancements.</p>

The article reports Harry's schedule in Kyiv, including visits to a museum, engaging with 200 veterans, and meeting the Ukrainian Prime Minister, emphasizing his desire to "humanize the people involved in this war" and prevent desensitization. This marks his second trip to Ukraine since the 2022 invasion, aiming to highlight the war's real destruction beyond western cities. His meeting with King Charles, the first in over a year amid royal tensions and the King's cancer diagnosis, signals a potential step towards family reconciliation.</p>

          <p>Altay Bayindir will retain his place as Manchester United's starting goalkeeper for Sunday's derby against rivals Manchester City, despite recent errors that led to goals, as confirmed by head coach Ruben Amorim. The article highlights that new £18.1m signing Senne Lammens is considered a promising future first-choice, but Bayindir's greater international and club experience is prioritized for the immediate challenge. This decision comes after Andre Onana's loan move to Trabzonspor, prompted by his struggles with confidence and performance under the intense pressure at United. Amorim wishes Onana well, emphasizing the need for a changed environment to help him return to his top level.</p>
