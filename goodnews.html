          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a record high, crossing the 44,000 mark after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation. The market rally reflects investor optimism that the next leader from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party might introduce significant fiscal stimulus to boost the nation's economy. Technology and industrial sectors led the gains, with notable increases for companies like Advantest and Tokuyama Corp. This positive market movement in Japan coincided with gains in U.S. markets, where the Nasdaq also reached a new record high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, NHS England has released public league tables ranking the performance of its hospital, ambulance, and mental health trusts, with specialist hospitals securing the top positions. The new system, which rates trusts on metrics like patient waiting times and financial performance, aims to increase transparency and identify where improvements are needed. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables will help end the "postcode lottery" in healthcare quality. However, organizations representing the trusts have raised concerns that the rankings may not accurately reflect performance and could lead to unintended negative consequences.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has risen by 46% between 2021 and 2023, according to a recent study. With marijuana now legal for medical or recreational use in most states, the stigma surrounding it is diminishing, and many seniors are turning to it for medicinal purposes like pain relief and relaxation. The article explores this trend through the experiences of seniors in a retirement community who use cannabis products like edibles. However, it also presents a caution from medical professionals who warn about potential cardiovascular risks associated with THC, regardless of the method of consumption.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have activated third baseman Max Muncy from the injured list, providing a much-needed boost to the team's struggling offense. Muncy, who had been sidelined with an oblique injury, was immediately placed in the cleanup spot for the game against the Colorado Rockies. His return is seen as a critical reinforcement for the Dodgers, who have had a losing record during his absence and are looking to regain momentum for their playoff push. The team also anticipates the return of several other key players from injury in the coming days.</p>

          <p>A port operator in Dalian, China, is establishing a new fruit transit center to facilitate faster imports of durian from Southeast Asia to the country's northeast region. The initiative, dubbed the "durian express," is a new shipping service designed to reduce transit time to as little as six days, ensuring the freshness of the popular fruit. This move aims to meet the growing demand for durians among the roughly 100 million consumers in northeastern China. The region has been a challenging market to supply due to its distance from traditional entry points in southern China.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a bill aimed at shutting down the pipeline from out-of-state "puppy mills" by banning online pet brokers and dealers who misrepresent themselves as local breeders. The legislation, AB 519, targets a loophole in a 2019 law that barred retail pet stores from selling commercially bred dogs but did not cover the growing online market. This move follows a media investigation that exposed how dogs were being trucked into California and sold deceptively. If signed by the governor, the bill will apply to the sale of dogs, cats, and rabbits under one year old.</p>

While officials state that anyone can receive a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower formal approval may affect access and insurance coverage for the general population. The CDC has identified a list of high-risk conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, and heart conditions, that make individuals eligible. The updated shots from Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax are expected to be available in pharmacies and clinics this fall.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions about his team's aggressive style of play, often labeled "Bazball." He argues that the perception of the team as simply reckless and carefree overlooks the hard work, strategic thinking, and determination to succeed. McCullum clarified that his coaching philosophy is about creating an environment where players can perform without being restricted by pressure, not about a rigid mandate to attack at all costs. Since he and captain Ben Stokes took over in 2022, they have revitalized a team that had previously been struggling.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed several recent instances of market negativity that he believes were unwarranted, particularly concerning major tech companies. He pointed to fears that a DOJ ruling would force a breakup of Alphabet, concerns about Amazon's web services falling behind, and worries over Apple's AI strategy, all of which have since subsided as the stocks recovered. Cramer argued that investors can always find something to be negative about, but these fears often prove to be overhyped. He also expressed confidence in Nvidia's long-term performance despite a recent price target cut from one analyst. (not investment advice)</p>
