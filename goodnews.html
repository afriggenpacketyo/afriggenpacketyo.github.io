          <p>Rivian Automotive reported better-than-expected first-quarter results but adjusted its 2025 delivery targets downward, now projecting 40,000 to 46,000 units instead of the previous 46,000 to 51,000, and increased its capital spending guidance to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. The company cited the uncertain global economic landscape and evolving trade regulations, particularly President Trump's tariffs, as factors impacting consumer sentiment and demand. Despite these adjustments, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a modest positive gross profit this year and anticipates losses of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion on an adjusted basis before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. The automaker also achieved its second consecutive quarter of gross profit, unlocking an expected $1 billion from Volkswagen Group as part of their joint venture. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Andrew Wilson attributed the strong year of bookings to the success of the company's FC and College Football games. While first-quarter bookings guidance fell slightly short of analyst projections, the overall outlook remains positive for the video game maker. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting Wednesday, the federal government will begin enforcing Real ID requirements at airports, potentially causing headaches for travelers without compliant identification. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will no longer accept IDs that don't meet Real ID standards, although alternative forms of identification such as U.S. passports and Global Entry cards will still be accepted. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem stated that travelers without a Real ID may face additional screening but will generally be allowed to fly. The TSA advises travelers to arrive at least three hours before a domestic flight to allow for potential delays due to the new requirements.</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of California legislators has released a letter urging the state's congressional delegation to protect the Head Start program from proposed federal cuts. The letter, signed by a majority of state lawmakers, expresses deep concern over potential reductions to the early childhood program, which provides childcare, education, and medical care to low-income children. Legislators emphasized the critical role Head Start plays in supporting working families and boosting the state's economy, with some lawmakers sharing personal experiences as former Head Start participants. The program currently serves over 80,000 children in California and employs approximately 26,000 workers.</p>

          <p>A new Apple TV show called "Your Friends & Neighbors" starring Jon Hamm examines the lives of wealthy individuals in a Connecticut town. The show's characters are unhappy and insecure despite their wealth, which is meant to reassure the audience that being rich isn't all that it's cracked up to be. The show seems to imply that money makes divorce more likely without making it more endurable, and that wealth comes with an extreme pressure to keep up with others who are just as rich. In the end, the show is a useful balm for the resentments of people who assume that they‚Äôd definitely be happier with $10 million in the bank.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to eliminate the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS), which provides federal funding to libraries and museums. The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit filed by attorneys general from 21 states, arguing that the proposed elimination violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The IMLS is the primary source of federal funding for public libraries, particularly benefiting small and rural libraries. The ruling is a victory for the public interest, preventing the Trump Administration from hindering access to educational resources.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people of the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Researchers analyzed artifacts found at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and discovered traces of hallucinogenic substances, including DMT, on bone tubes believed to be inhalation apparatuses. The small size of the rooms where these artifacts were found indicates that only certain members of Chav√≠n society were invited to partake in these rituals. This discovery provides material evidence that hallucinogens were a focal point of these gatherings.</p>
