          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Supply</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers surprising insights into the impact of China's dams on the Tibetan plateau, suggesting they may alleviate rather than create water crises for downstream nations like India. By analyzing data from the Zangmu and Jiacha dams since 2014, researchers found that water flows during the dry season have significantly increased. Specifically, low flows in February were up by over 50 percent, countering fears that the massive dam projects would lead to droughts in India. This evidence provides a new perspective on the environmental consequences of China's hydroelectric projects in the region.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her sixth Grand Slam title with an overwhelming performance in the Wimbledon women's final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0. The match, lasting just 57 minutes, marked the first time in 114 years that a player failed to win a single game in the women's final at the tournament. For the 24-year-old from Poland, this victory adds a grass-court major to her four French Open and one U.S. Open championships. The result was a tough conclusion for Anisimova, who was playing in her first-ever Grand Slam final.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's space economy is rapidly expanding, driven by a surge in private investment and technological advancements, with a forecast to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035. The piece highlights successful private Chinese aerospace companies like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones, such as putting a rocket into orbit. It suggests that this boom, supported by the state, is lowering manufacturing costs and fueling innovation in areas like satellite launchers and reusable rockets. The growth of this sector is presented as a key component of China's industrial and technological ambitions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new wave of food-tech start-ups is developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to create casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. Companies like the UK's Better Dairy are aiming to launch products within a few years that they claim closely mimic the taste and texture of traditional dairy cheese. However, they face significant hurdles, including high initial costs, regulatory approval for 'novel foods,' and a recent decline in consumer interest in plant-based alternatives. The success of this emerging industry will depend on its ability to overcome these challenges and convince consumers of its value.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from 'indiscriminately' detaining individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling, by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, also bars officials from denying detainees access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop without reasonable suspicion. The judge stated there was a 'mountain of evidence' that officials were unconstitutionally basing arrests on factors like race or speaking Spanish.</p>
