          <p>To combat lackluster sales and stand out in a competitive market, Starbucks is launching a new 'Green Apron Service' program. This strategy aims to improve the customer experience by focusing on warm, engaging interactions and hospitality, moving beyond just value offerings. The initiative is part of a broader turnaround plan that includes investments in better staffing, scheduling technology, and redesigned cafes. The company hopes these changes will make Starbucks visits a regular habit for consumers and drive foot traffic growth.</p>

          <p>During President Donald Trump's visit to Scotland, First Minister John Swinney urged him to exempt scotch whisky from a 10% US tariff, an issue costing the industry an estimated £4 million per week. The two leaders met at Trump's Aberdeenshire resort, where Swinney argued for the unique circumstances of the spirit, which can only be produced in Scotland. The first minister also used the meeting to implore the president to use his influence to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Swinney described the conversation as convivial and felt there was a new willingness from Trump to consider the issues.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has announced it will recognize a Palestinian state in September unless Israel takes significant steps toward a sustainable peace. The conditions laid out by the prime minister's office include ending the crisis in Gaza, allowing unimpeded UN humanitarian aid, and committing to no annexations in the West Bank. This potential policy shift follows a similar announcement from France and signals growing pressure from Western allies on Israel to alter its course in the conflict.</p>

          <p>The 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' championed by President Trump, is set to provide a major financial boost to large technology companies by restoring key tax provisions. The legislation permanently brings back immediate expensing for domestic R&D and 100% bonus depreciation for capital expenditures. Analysts estimate this will unlock billions in free cash flow for firms like Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft, giving them more flexibility to invest in areas like AI and return cash to shareholders.
