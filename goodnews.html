          <h2>Chinese Farmers Embrace Livestreaming to Boost Sales and Revitalize Rural Economy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 22:59:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an effort to combat slowing sales and revitalize the agricultural sector, Chinese farmers are increasingly turning to technology, particularly livestreaming on platforms like Douyin, China's version of TikTok. Local governments are supporting this trend by offering training bootcamps to teach farmers how to effectively market their produce directly to the country's one billion internet users. This shift is part of a broader "rural revitalization" push championed by President Xi Jinping, aiming to modernize agriculture and create new economic opportunities. The movement is transforming public perception of farming from a traditional, disconnected trade to a tech-savvy, entrepreneurial endeavor.</p>

          <p>Democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani has officially won the New York City Democratic mayoral primary with a historic 565,639 votes after three rounds of ranked-choice voting. This total surpasses the previous record set by David Dinkins in 1989, a milestone Mamdani's campaign is touting as a mandate for his progressive platform. He defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo by nearly 13 percentage points in the final tally. The victory signals a significant leftward shift in the city's politics, and attention now turns to whether Cuomo or other centrists will mount an independent challenge in the general election.</p>

          <p>AI server manufacturer Super Micro intends to significantly increase its investment in Europe, including expanding its manufacturing capabilities in the region to capitalize on soaring demand for artificial intelligence hardware. CEO Charles Liang stated that the company, which builds servers packed with essential Nvidia chips, already has a plan in place to grow its European footprint beyond its current facilities in the Netherlands. The move aligns with recent calls from Nvidia's CEO for Europe to bolster its computing capacity. Liang dismissed recent concerns about slowing growth, asserting that the company's fundamental technology and expanding business scope provide tremendous room for future expansion.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, six weeks after his 80th birthday, delivered an explosive and consistent rock-and-roll performance at the Hollywood Bowl as part of his "Celebration Tour." The setlist was heavily focused on his iconic work with Creedence Clearwater Revival (CCR), whose song rights he fully regained two years ago after a lengthy legal battle. Despite his age, Fogerty's powerful, raspy vocals and energetic guitar playing remained remarkably strong throughout the two-hour show. He performed classics like "Bad Moon Rising" and "Born on the Bayou," and also shared the stage with his two sons, who are part of his current band.</p>

          <p>In a show of solidarity, Brazil and India have pledged to triple their trade flows, reinforcing their commitment to the BRICS economic bloc. This move comes as former U.S. President Donald Trump has intensified his attacks on the group, which also includes Russia, China, and South Africa, among others. Trump recently claimed the bloc was designed to harm the U.S. and threatened a 10% tariff on any member nations. The BRICS group, which seeks to increase the influence of emerging economies from the Global South and reform Western-dominated international institutions, has not issued an official response to Trump's posture.</p>

          <p>Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport has once again been named the world's busiest airport, processing over 108 million passengers in 2024, according to a new report from Airports Council International. While global passenger traffic hit a record high, Atlanta's numbers are still slightly below its 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Dubai International Airport ranked second and saw its traffic climb nearly 7% above pre-pandemic figures, also topping the list for most international passengers. The report highlights a strong recovery in air travel, with U.S. airports featuring prominently, though several major hubs have yet to fully return to their pre-COVID passenger volumes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that as the United States shifts its foreign policy focus inward under an "America first" mentality, a gap in providing global public goods is emerging. The author suggests that China is stepping in to fill this void, and Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a central hub for this new wave of international development and cooperation. The piece contrasts the recent dismantling of independent US development agencies with China's high-profile launch of the International Organisation for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong. This shift presents an opportunity for the city to harness the momentum and enhance its prominence on the world stage.</p>

          <p>An Iranian mother, Mandonna “Donna” Kashanian, who has lived in the U.S. for 47 years, has been released from ICE detention following an intervention by Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. Kashanian was detained last month from her New Orleans home despite having no criminal record and regularly checking in with immigration authorities as required. After a surge of community support, Scalise asked the Department of Homeland Security to review the case, stating she should be judged on her life's work and community role. Her attorney called the intervention "absolutely crucial," highlighting the impact of political access on immigration outcomes.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has sanctioned Song Kum Hyok, a member of North Korea's Reconnaissance General Bureau, for his role in a sophisticated IT worker scheme. The U.S. accuses Song of helping recruit North Korean cyber operatives who pose as American remote workers to get jobs at global companies, with their salaries funneled back to fund the nation's weapons programs. The scheme allegedly involved stealing the identities of U.S. citizens to create aliases for the workers. This action is part of a broader crackdown on North Korea's efforts to circumvent sanctions and clandestinely finance its military ambitions through illicit cyber activities.</p>

          <p>As forecasters predict an above-average hurricane season, a growing number of homeowners on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts are investing in climate-resilient construction. These homes are designed to withstand the stronger and more frequent storms fueled by climate change, featuring aerodynamic shapes, reinforced roofs, and elevated foundations with flood vents. Companies like Deltec Homes specialize in such hurricane-resistant structures, which can cost more upfront but often result in long-term savings on repairs and insurance. Research institutions are also testing building materials and designs to identify vulnerabilities and promote stronger construction standards for all homes in vulnerable areas.</p>

This surge is part of a strategic push by Beijing to advance the "high-quality development" of its marine economy, with strong government support through subsidies and planning.
