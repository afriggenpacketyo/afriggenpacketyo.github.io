          <h2>NHL's New Decentralized Draft Format Draws Criticism for Lacking Traditional Atmosphere</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 00:35:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHL's first non-pandemic decentralized draft drew criticism for its awkward and impersonal format, with team representatives making selections from their home cities rather than a central venue. Kings GM Ken Holland was among those who preferred the old system, which fostered excitement and a shared experience for players and their families. The new format was plagued by technical glitches, such as audio issues during virtual calls between draftees and team management, creating a disjointed atmosphere. Despite the logistical issues, the draft proceeded with top prospects being selected as expected by teams like the Islanders and Ducks.</p>

          <p>A team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted via blood vessels, a less invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into a patient's intracranial vasculature through a neck vein. This allowed a 67-year-old patient, paralyzed on one side from a stroke, to regain some limb movement. This minimally invasive approach, which contrasts with methods like Elon Musk's Neuralink, aims to reduce surgical risks and shorten patient recovery times.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, taking sole possession of the best record in MLB, though their manager believes the team is not yet playing its best baseball. The victory was marred by defensive errors and a quiet offense in the later innings, with the team relying on home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy to build a lead. The game concluded with a dramatic, bases-loaded double play in the ninth inning, securing a hard-fought win. Despite individual player slumps, the team continues to find ways to win against struggling opponents.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has stated the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe.

Maresca expressed his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for the club and that the best plan is for him to remain at Stamford Bridge.

          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security found that working-age people who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet have a lower rate of depressive symptoms. The research assessed a diet comprising rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables, and found a positive correlation with mental well-being among a cohort of nearly 12,500 employees. The institute noted that specific foods in the diet, such as those rich in folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to this effect by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters and providing anti-inflammatory benefits.</p>

Massey was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The escape, which involved exploiting a faulty cell door, has drawn criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, and a significant reward is offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

          <p>The Bafta-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," written by Kat Sadler and starring her sister Lizzie Davidson, is returning for a new series. The show, which follows two sisters and their mother navigating financial and romantic struggles, is known for its dark humor and unflinching take on taboo subjects like mental health and abortion. Sadler says the new series is influenced by their all-female upbringing and the "bleak" modern dating scene, satirizing the idea that being single is a "worst nightmare." The sisters describe the new season as even more depressing, but also funnier.</p>
