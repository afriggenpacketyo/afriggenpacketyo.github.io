        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new all-time high, exceeding its previous record from January, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Increased liquidity in the crypto market and growing corporate treasury investments have also contributed to the rise. The Senate's move to create a regulatory framework for stablecoins and Coinbase joining the S&P 500 have further boosted investor confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

While overall consumer spending remains cautious, Lowe's anticipates slight sales growth this year, driven by improvements in weather-sensitive categories like garden supplies and outdoor equipment. The company is also diversifying its imports to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>

The Tulsa Zoo was chosen due to its larger enclosure and existing herd of Asian elephants. Advocates continue to voice concerns about the elephants' well-being, and legal challenges are ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>News that former President Joseph Biden has advanced prostate cancer has revived long-standing questions about the benefits versus the harms of PSA tests. PSA tests alone leave a lot to be desired as a cancer screening test, as elevated PSA can be a marker for cancer, but also can signal a false positive or an inactive cancer, triggering a painful biopsy, and leading to overtreatment with punishing side effects. A new era in prostate-cancer screening has arrived, and instead of men immediately having their prostates biopsied when they get an elevated PSA test, many specialists recommend first getting an MRI and, when possible, watching and waiting.</p>

Judge Reggie B. Walton found that the dismissals were illegal and arbitrary, violating the intent to shield board members from presidential interference. The ruling is seen as a victory for independent agencies and the rule of law, ensuring that the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board can continue its oversight of government counterterrorism actions.</p>
