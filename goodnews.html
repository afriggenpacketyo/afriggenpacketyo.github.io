          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations after a 90-day pause on tariffs was agreed upon. Bessent emphasized that this agreement establishes a mechanism to avoid escalating tariff pressures between the U.S. and China. During the recent meeting in Switzerland, discussions also addressed the issue of fentanyl, with Bessent noting China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in curbing the flow of precursor drugs. This development follows a rally in global stock markets, reflecting optimism about the potential for a more comprehensive trade agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The BBC examines the challenges facing the UK government's immigration plan, noting that despite numerous promises and targets over the past 15 years, migration levels remain high. The government aims to reduce net migration to around 315,000 by the end of Parliament, but this is still higher than most years in the past decade. A key issue is filling labor market gaps, particularly in social care, where there are significant vacancies and concerns about low pay. The government also faces challenges related to overseas students, who are a major contributor to net migration but also a significant source of funding for UK universities.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced an executive order aimed at reducing drug prices in the U.S. by forcing drug companies to match lower prices paid in other developed countries. The order proposes a "most favored nation" pricing policy, potentially opening the U.S. market to drug imports from other countries. While patients in the U.S. generally pay more for drugs, it's unclear what legal authority the administration would have to enforce the order.

          <p>A new study indicates that tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, may lead to greater weight loss compared to semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. Over a 72-week period, tirzepatide users lost approximately 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost about 14%. In addition to weight loss, these drugs have shown potential benefits for blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels. However, the high cost of these medications remains a significant barrier, with limited insurance coverage.</p>
