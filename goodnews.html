          <p>Liverpool has officially completed the signing of 18-year-old defender Giovanni Leoni from the Italian club Parma for a reported fee of £26 million plus add-ons. The highly-rated Italy Under-19 international has signed a long-term contract with the club that extends until 2031. This acquisition addresses Liverpool's need for defensive reinforcements following the recent departure of Jarell Quansah. Leoni's move to Anfield comes after a successful debut season in Serie A, where he attracted interest from several other top European clubs before choosing to join the Premier League side.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and her discussion of the color orange on a podcast with Travis Kelce, numerous major brands have launched orange-themed social media campaigns. Companies from United Airlines to Netflix quickly adopted the color in their marketing, aiming to capitalize on the immense economic and cultural influence Swift commands. This phenomenon highlights the singer's significant impact, where even a casual mention can trigger a widespread commercial response. Her Eras Tour previously demonstrated this effect by providing substantial economic boosts to host cities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A swarm of more than 130 small earthquakes, with the largest reaching magnitude 4.0, has been recorded in Northern California's Geysers geothermal steam field. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such seismic activity is common in this area and is induced by the operations of the geothermal power facility located there. The process of withdrawing steam and injecting reclaimed water to generate electricity causes the surrounding rock to contract and shift, triggering these minor quakes. Officials emphasize that this activity is not linked to major fault lines like the San Andreas and does not pose a significant seismic hazard to the region.</p>

          <p>American shoppers are continuing to purchase jewelry at a strong pace, providing a bright spot for retailers amid weaker consumer sentiment in Europe and China. Danish brand Pandora reported an 8% rise in U.S. sales, which now constitute a third of its total revenue, contrasting sharply with a 15% sales decline in China. This trend is also seen at the luxury end, with Cartier-owner Richemont posting a 17% jump in American sales. However, jewelry brands face headwinds from potential tariffs, particularly on goods manufactured in Asia, and rising costs of precious metals like silver and gold. (not investment advice)</p>

Her departure follows a pressure campaign from investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, who were dissatisfied with the company's turnaround strategy. Opendoor, which uses technology to buy and sell homes, has struggled with the impact of rising interest rates on the housing market. The company has named its technology chief, Shrisha Radhakrishna, as an interim leader while it begins a formal search for a new CEO to navigate its recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis Shows Many U.S. Cities Still Offer Mansions for Under $1 Million</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising home prices nationwide, a new analysis reveals that mansions, defined as homes with at least 5,000 square feet, can still be purchased for under $1 million in several U.S. metro areas. Cities like Buffalo, Indianapolis, Cleveland, and Memphis offer a median mansion price below this threshold, contrasting sharply with coastal markets like San Jose, where the median is $6.5 million. In 2021, nearly half of all U.S. mansions were valued under $1 million, but today that figure has dropped to just 30%. The data illustrates the significant regional disparities in housing affordability across the country.</p>

          <p>Charity founder Krish Kandiah has offered an "olive branch" to UK Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick after accusing him of "xenophobia" during a BBC radio segment. The comment, which referenced an article by Jenrick about migrants, was later edited out by the BBC after Jenrick complained. Kandiah has now publicly called for collaboration to de-escalate fear and focus on substantive issues like housing and jobs rather than anti-immigrant sentiment. He referenced a time when he worked positively with Jenrick during his tenure as housing minister to welcome refugees from Hong Kong, signaling a desire for constructive dialogue.</p>

          <p>The FluMist nasal spray, the only non-injectable flu vaccine, is now available for self-administration at home through a new delivery service. Previously only administered by healthcare providers, the FDA has approved its use for individuals aged 2 to 49, with caregivers administering it to children. The service, called FluMist Home, will be available in 34 states for the upcoming flu season and is covered by most commercial insurance plans, though a shipping fee applies. This development aims to increase vaccination accessibility by providing a convenient option for those who prefer to avoid clinics or pharmacies.</p>

          <p>The NCAA has imposed one of its largest-ever financial penalties on the University of Michigan's football program for a sign-stealing scheme but will not ban the team from the playoffs. The university must forfeit over $20 million in postseason revenue and will face other sanctions, including scholarship reductions and recruiting restrictions. The investigation found that a former staffer, Connor Stalions, orchestrated an extensive in-person scouting operation to illegally decode opponents' signals. While classifying the violations as severe, the NCAA panel opted for financial penalties to avoid punishing current players for the actions of former staff and coaches.</p>

          <p>On Friday, the stock market experienced a rotation as investors moved away from momentum stocks and into the out-of-favor healthcare sector. This shift was highlighted by a significant surge in UnitedHealth's stock after Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway disclosed a major investment, boosting the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Meanwhile, the University of Michigan's latest survey indicated a decline in consumer sentiment, with growing concerns about future inflation and unemployment. Analysts also weighed in on Cisco Systems following its earnings report, with some downgrading the stock due to concerns about its networking and security business segments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With U.S. credit card debt surpassing $1.21 trillion, many consumers are struggling to manage their balances. For a typical $3,000 balance, the minimum monthly payment can range from $60 to $85, depending on the issuer's calculation method, which often combines a percentage of the balance with accrued interest. Simply making minimum payments is a costly strategy that can trap consumers in debt for years due to compounding interest. The article advises that paying more than the minimum is crucial, and explores alternative debt relief strategies such as balance transfers, consolidation loans, and credit counseling to help regain financial control.</p>

          <p>Associated British Foods (ABF), the owner of the Kingsmill bread brand, has agreed to purchase its rival Hovis in a deal that would create the largest bread producer in the United Kingdom. ABF stated that the merger of the two currently loss-making businesses would allow for cost-cutting and improved efficiency, aiming to restore profitability. The move comes as both brands have faced declining sales due to shifting consumer preferences toward specialty breads and lower-carbohydrate diets. The deal, valued at an estimated £75 million, now requires approval from the UK's competition watchdog to proceed.</p>

          <p>A loud sonic boom was heard and felt across several counties in southeast England, including London, Essex, and Kent. The Royal Air Force (RAF) confirmed that the noise was caused by three Typhoon fighter jets that were launched to intercept a civilian aircraft that had lost communication with air traffic control. The jets, traveling faster than the speed of sound, escorted the plane safely to Stansted Airport after communications were re-established. Essex Police confirmed there was no cause for concern upon landing, explaining the startling event that had led many residents to believe an explosion had occurred.</p>
