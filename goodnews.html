        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea has unexpectedly canceled striker Nicolas Jackson's loan move to Bayern Munich after he had already traveled to Germany for a medical. The decision was prompted by a serious hamstring injury to fellow striker Liam Delap during Chelsea's match against Fulham, leaving the team with only one fit striker. The sudden reversal has reportedly angered Jackson, though attempts may be made to salvage the deal. This development highlights Chelsea's precarious striker situation despite significant spending on attacking players.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's "reciprocal tariffs," which affect a wide range of goods from most countries, are illegal because he overstepped his presidential authority. The court found that the power to impose such broad tariffs resides with Congress, not the executive branch under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. However, the ruling does not affect sector-specific levies on steel and aluminum or tariffs imposed on China during his first term. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Costco is set to begin strictly enforcing its new policy that grants an exclusive morning shopping hour to its higher-priced Executive Members. Since June 30, Executive members have been able to shop from 9 a.m. to 10 a.m., but a "grace period" allowed other members entry as well. Starting in September, this grace period ends, and Gold Star and Business members may be denied entry before 10 a.m. The policy has drawn criticism from some customers who feel it alienates a large portion of the membership base, though Costco states it is a reward for its most loyal members.</p>

          <p>Eighteen-year-old Davina Perrin scored a historic century for the Northern Superchargers in The Hundred, leading her team to the final at Lord's. Her remarkable 101 from just 43 balls, the fastest T20 hundred by an English woman, has drawn widespread acclaim and comparisons to cricket legends. Perrin, a product of the ACE programme aimed at increasing black British participation in cricket, is being hailed as a future star for the England national team. While her consistency is still developing, the innings is seen as a major breakthrough for the talented young batter.</p>

          <h2>Experts Advise on Age-Appropriate Screen Time Limits for Children's Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts continue to debate the exact amount of screen time that is safe for children, but a consensus exists around precautionary principles tied to developmental stages. For the youngest children (under 3), most German experts recommend no screen time to allow for sensory and motor skill development, while the WHO suggests a maximum of one hour for children aged two and up. As children grow, the focus shifts from strict time limits to the quality of content and maintaining open communication, ensuring digital interaction doesn't replace crucial real-world social experiences and imaginative play. Parents are advised to set clear rules and engage with their children's digital lives.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. The source of the Legionella bacteria was traced to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been cleaned and disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the inspection and testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found that a stethoscope enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—almost instantly. A UK study involving over 12,000 patients in GP surgeries showed the device significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle sounds in the heartbeat that the human ear cannot discern and cross-references them with a large patient database. Experts believe this technology could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis and treatment, with plans for a wider rollout.</p>

          <p>The new remake of the 1984 cult classic "The Toxic Avenger," directed by Macon Blair, offers a more polished and emotionally grounded take on the Troma original. Starring Peter Dinklage as a janitor who becomes a mutant hero after being thrown into toxic sludge, the film retains the gore and parody of the source material but with a higher production value. The review suggests that while the film is a diverting and well-made homage, its slickness and sincerity might feel at odds with the deliberately cheap and tasteless spirit of the original Troma movie.</p>
