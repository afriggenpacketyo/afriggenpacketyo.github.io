          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021, as the city-state anticipates slower economic growth in the latter half of the year. Core inflation also dipped to 0.5%, primarily driven by a decline in retail and other goods prices, alongside lower electricity and gas costs. The Monetary Authority of Singapore projects moderate near-term inflation, citing easing global crude oil prices and contained food commodity hikes. This recent economic data strengthens the argument for the MAS to potentially loosen monetary policy in its upcoming October meeting, aiming to provide a buffer against expected economic weakening.

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures up to 30C on bank holiday Monday, with the Midlands and northwest expecting the highest heat, and Wales potentially seeing its hottest late August bank holiday on record. However, this warm spell will be short-lived, as the remnants of Hurricane Erin are forecast to bring wet and windy weather across most of the UK overnight, starting in Northern Ireland. Temperatures are expected to drop significantly by Friday, and persistent rain is anticipated throughout the week, offering welcome relief after a particularly dry summer that has led to hosepipe bans and concerns for the harvest.</p>

          <p>Keurig Dr Pepper is set to acquire the Dutch coffee and tea company JDE Peet's in an approximately $18 billion transaction. The deal involves Keurig Dr Pepper paying JDE Peet's shareholders 31.85 euros per share, a 33% premium over its 90-day average stock price. Following the acquisition, Keurig Dr Pepper plans to separate its beverage and coffee units into two distinct, U.S.-listed companies, effectively unwinding its 2018 merger that created North America's third-largest beverage company. This strategic move aims to reshape the company's structure and market presence in the beverage industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India's ambassador to Russia, Vinay Kumar, declared that India will continue to purchase oil from any country offering the "best deal" to protect the interests of its 1.4 billion citizens. This statement comes ahead of potential U.S. tariffs on India for buying Russian oil and weapons, which Vice-President JD Vance framed as economic leverage against Russia's war in Ukraine. India, whose Russian oil imports surged since the conflict began, maintains its trade is market-driven and prioritizes energy security, rejecting U.S. pressure and asserting strategic autonomy in its foreign policy decisions.</p>
