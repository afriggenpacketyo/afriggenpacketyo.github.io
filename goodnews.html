          <p>Following the implementation of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, a senior U.S. military commander, Admiral Brad Cooper, visited the Gaza Strip to discuss post-conflict stabilization efforts. While confirming that no U.S. ground troops would be deployed, he outlined plans for a CENTCOM-led Civil-Military Coordination Center to support rebuilding. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians have begun returning to their homes, many of which are destroyed after more than two years of conflict. The visit signals a shift towards managing the aftermath of the war under a U.S.-proposed peace plan, even as the humanitarian situation remains dire.</p>

          <p>This opinion article suggests that New Jersey Republican gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli is successfully channeling the rally strategies of Donald Trump and Charlie Kirk to generate voter enthusiasm. The piece describes a recent event in Wildwood, New Jersey, as a festive and hopeful gathering that energized hundreds of supporters by focusing on in-person interaction and a sense of community. The author argues that such live events, which create a "happy conservative warrior" image, are a powerful tool for the GOP to mobilize its base. The article highlights voter concerns about energy prices, taxes, and crime.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reported having a "very productive" phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, during which they discussed a potential path to peace in Ukraine. Zelenskyy urged Trump to help broker an end to the war with Russia, drawing a parallel to recent U.S.-led peace efforts in other regions. The conversation also covered bolstering Ukraine's air defense capabilities in response to recent Russian attacks on the country's energy infrastructure. This call marks a significant warming of relations between the two leaders, who had a publicly contentious meeting earlier in the year but have since found common ground.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Influence Was Key in Brokering Israel-Hamas Peace Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-11 11:24:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political analysts suggest that U.S. President Donald Trump was a pivotal figure in brokering the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, which is set to end the war in Gaza. According to reporting from Washington Week, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reliance on American political support made him susceptible to pressure from Trump. As U.S. public opinion on the conflict has shifted, Trump's direct involvement was seen as the crucial element that brought the parties together. The analysis highlights how the U.S. president's influence can significantly shape outcomes in complex international conflicts, even when other global powers are involved.</p>

          <p>The Plaid Cymru party in Wales has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers incentive payments of up to £30,000 if they win the next Senedd election. The proposal aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by making Welsh incentives competitive with those in England, particularly for high-priority subjects like math and science, and for Welsh-medium teaching. The payments would be conditional on the recipient working in Wales for five years after qualifying. The party estimates the policy would cost around £6-7 million and is part of a broader plan to raise educational standards in the country.</p>
