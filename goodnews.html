          <p>Shares of Hugo Boss experienced a surge after the fashion retailer announced a smaller-than-expected decline in first-quarter sales, while also reaffirming its full-year guidance amidst macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty. Revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis, primarily due to weaker demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China. The company is closely monitoring macroeconomic developments and trade tensions, and is prepared to respond flexibly to changing circumstances. Hugo Boss has been implementing a strategic overhaul to revive consumer demand, with improvements in store formats, product diversification, and engagement with younger consumers, although womenswear remains a weak spot. </p>

          <p>After a decade of prioritizing "supply-side reform," China is signaling a potential shift towards boosting domestic consumption, as indicated by recent policy statements from the Communist Party's Politburo. President Xi Jinping introduced the concept in 2015, focusing on boosting productivity, eliminating excess capacity, and cultivating new technologies. The shift comes as China has become a powerhouse in emerging sectors, including electric vehicles and artificial intelligence, but faces challenges in translating supply-side success into strength in demand. Policymakers are now emphasizing the "four stabilities" ‚Äì employment, enterprises, markets, and expectations ‚Äì while acknowledging the need to boost household income and consumption. </p>

          <p>The UK government announced a plan to modernize 1,000 GP practice buildings in England, allocating ¬£102m to expand and improve surgeries, with work set to begin this summer. This investment aims to address record-low satisfaction levels with GP services and reports indicating that two in five practices are not fit for purpose. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described the plan as a "significant step" towards tackling waiting lists and improving patient services. The Royal College of GPs welcomed the funding as an "encouraging interim measure," but emphasized the need for long-term investment to address inadequate infrastructure and improve patient experience. </p>

          <p>UK's Deliveroo, the food delivery app, has agreed to be taken over by US giant DoorDash in a deal valuing the business at ¬£2.9bn.

DoorDash is offering 180p per Deliveroo share, which marks a 44% increase on the UK company's share price from the point when takeover talks were made public last month.

The de minimis rule, which exempted U.S. imports worth $800 from trade tariffs, has closed for shipments from China, exposing Temu and Shein to duties as high as 120%. In response, the companies are accelerating localization strategies, onboarding goods from American sellers, and shipping in bulk to U.S. warehouses. Experts agree that the companies' agile supply chains and competitive pricing will allow them to continue competing effectively in the U.S. market.</p>

Voight, one of Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial ambassadors‚Äù to Hollywood, claimed that many Americans have lost jobs to productions that have gone overseas.

While Donnarumma's form has improved, his supposed weaknesses have lingered in PSG's domestic season, with mistakes in Ligue 1 games.

Government jobs are seen as decent and secure, but they are low-paid and demanding, and there are more constraints on personal choices compared to those in the private sector. The trend appears to be reversing in recent years as the ruling Communist Party has tightened the rules around officials and their families as part of its sprawling anti-corruption drive, and amid a slowing economy.</p>
