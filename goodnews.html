          <p>The New York Knicks avoided elimination by defeating the Indiana Pacers 111-94 in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference finals. Jalen Brunson scored 32 points, and Karl-Anthony Towns added 24 points and 13 rebounds for the Knicks. The Knicks are now attempting to become only the 14th team in NBA history to overturn a 3-1 series deficit. Indiana struggled offensively, recording their lowest-scoring game of the postseason, while Tyrese Haliburton was limited to eight points and six assists. Game 6 is scheduled for Saturday night in Indiana, with a potential Game 7 back at Madison Square Garden on Monday. The Knicks' victory marked their first home win in the conference finals. The team's ability to bounce back and secure a crucial win has injected a sense of hope and determination into their playoff journey.</p>

          <p>Optimism in the global business travel sector has significantly declined this year due to tariffs, tightened border policies, and other U.S. government policies. A report by the Global Business Travel Association indicates that positive sentiment fell from 67% in November 2024 to 31% in April 2025. Nearly 30% of business travel buyers anticipate their companies will reduce employee trips this year, while a third are considering changing policies regarding travel to or from the United States. Despite these concerns, global airfares have slightly decreased. The trade war's uncertainty could lead to delays in investment decisions and hiring (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Faizan Zaki, a 13-year-old from Allen, Texas, won the 100th Scripps National Spelling Bee, earning over $50,000 in cash and prizes. Faizan, who was last year's runner-up, won by correctly spelling √©claircissement. The competition came down to Sarv Dharavane, Sarvadnya Kadam, and Faizan, with all three finalists initially misspelling their words, adding late-round drama. The first National Spelling Bee began in 1925, and this year's event featured nine finalists out of 243 young spellers who qualified through local and regional bees. Faizan's victory marked the 110th champion due to past ties.</p>

          <p>An Alaska man, Kell Morris, survived after being pinned facedown in an icy creek by a 700-pound boulder for three hours. His wife, Jo Roop, kept his head above water while waiting for rescuers, and a sled dog tourism company provided a helicopter to transport rescuers to the remote location. Seven men used inflatable airbags to lift the boulder off Morris, who drifted in and out of consciousness. He spent two nights in the hospital for observation but was otherwise unharmed, acknowledging his luck and his wife's quick thinking. The man's wife relied on her law enforcement experience to send exact GPS coordinates to dispatch.</p>

          <p>Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has accused Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Reform UK leader Nigel Farage of indulging in "fantasy economics" regarding their welfare policies. Badenoch says both leaders believe in getting struggling taxpayers to "fund unlimited child support for others". Her commentary comes after the Labour government indicated that it was looking at the possibility of scrapping the two-child benefit cap. Badenoch argues that the country cannot "afford their fantasy economics" and that Britain deserves leaders who do not "treat economics like a branch of showbiz". She contends her party is now "the only major political party to take a serious look at the welfare state".</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that Elon Musk's official role in the administration is concluding, but hinted at continued collaboration. Musk's government service as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) ends on May 30, due to legal limits for his "special government employee" designation. DOGE has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts. Democrats in Congress have criticized Musk's influence, while markets have reacted positively to his return to the private sector. Musk reassured shareholders that he would allocate more time to Tesla and SpaceX, as the groundwork at DOGE is in place.</p>

Chinese authorities are expected to issue a public notice easing the ban and opening registration for Japanese facilities that process marine products. Japan will continue to seek the removal of remaining restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures imposed after the 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The restart of seafood exports from 37 prefectures to China is considered a significant milestone. The process may take a few months due to registration and radiation checks.</p>

He was not knocked down during the bout but began losing consciousness after the final gong and was rushed to the hospital. Under Japan Boxing Commission rules, a boxer who has had a craniotomy cannot hold a professional license, meaning Shigeoka must retire from the sport.
