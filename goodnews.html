          <p>Following pressure from President Trump, Apple has announced it will increase its investment in the United States by an additional $100 billion. The commitment is aimed at encouraging more of the company's manufacturing and component production to be based in the U.S., including new data centers and a smart glass facility in Kentucky. Trump also announced a planned 100% tariff on foreign-made semiconductors, which would not apply to companies investing in American manufacturing. Analysts note that while this may help Apple's standing with the White House, significant supply chain shifts will take time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is set to make history as Jen Pawol will become the first woman to serve as an umpire in a regular season game. She is scheduled to work the weekend series between the Miami Marlins and the Atlanta Braves, starting with the bases in a doubleheader. Pawol, a former college softball player, has been umpiring in the minor leagues since 2016 and worked spring training games in recent years. This milestone breaks a significant gender barrier in professional baseball, following similar breakthroughs in the NBA, NFL, and men's World Cup soccer.</p>

          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes has been lauded for his courage after batting in the final moments of a Test match against India despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder. With England needing 17 runs to win and only one wicket remaining, Woakes emerged with his arm in a sling, batting left-handed to protect his injury. Although he did not face a ball, he ran four crucial runs before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run loss for England. Woakes stated he felt a duty to his team and wouldn't have been able to live with himself if he hadn't tried.</p>

          <p>In the current economic climate, savers are weighing where to place significant funds for the best returns. This article compares depositing $10,000 into a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a money market account. While current interest rates are similar, a CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing the return, whereas a money market account's rate is variable and may decline with anticipated Fed rate cuts. The analysis suggests a CD could offer slightly higher and more predictable earnings over the six-month period, though it requires sacrificing liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>
