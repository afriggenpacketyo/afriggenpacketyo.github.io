          <p>Former President Donald Trump declared Washington, D.C., a "CRIME FREE ZONE" following a federal crackdown involving the deployment of National Guard troops and reassigned federal agents. Trump cited statistics on arrests and firearms seized, claiming a significant drop in robberies and auto break-ins. However, the article notes that these claims come after Trump declared a public safety emergency and invoked federal control over the Metropolitan Police Department. The article provides data and context to Trump's claims, but doesn't necessarily validate them, and offers an overview of the measures taken and the reported outcomes. </p>
