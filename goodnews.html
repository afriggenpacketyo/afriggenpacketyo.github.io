          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Claim 'The Simpsons' Predicted Recent Viral Kiss Cam Moment</h2>

          <p>A viral social media claim that the animated sitcom "The Simpsons" predicted a recent kiss cam incident at a Coldplay concert has been determined to be false. The rumor, which spread rapidly online, used a digitally manipulated or AI-generated image to suggest the show had foreseen the event. This article from DW Fact Check confirms that no such scene exists in the episodes cited by the rumor. The piece also revisits other famous but often misrepresented "Simpsons predictions," noting that the show's creators attribute any accurate forecasts to the sheer volume of jokes written over decades, rather than intentional foresight.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Honeywell's Post-Earnings Stock Drop Presents Buying Opportunity</h2>

          <p>Following the release of its second-quarter earnings, Honeywell's stock experienced a 5% drop, which this article characterizes as an unwarranted and "disrespectful" reaction from the market. The company reported revenue and earnings per share that surpassed Wall Street expectations and also raised its full-year outlook for these key metrics. While segment margin was a point of weakness, the article attributes this to increased R&D investments, which are seen as crucial for future growth ahead of the company's planned split into three separate entities. The analysis views the current stock price as a buying opportunity for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>The Cultural Resurgence and History of Facial Hair</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 15:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the cyclical nature of facial hair trends, from its widespread acceptance in the 19th century to its decline and eventual counter-cultural revival. It traces the journey of beards and mustaches through American history, noting their association with presidents like Abraham Lincoln, their disappearance in the clean-shaven mid-20th century, and their comeback with hippies and later, hipsters. The piece reflects on the current ubiquity of facial hair, from politicians seeking a more relatable image to the trendy mustache-and-mullet combination. The author connects this broader cultural history to his own personal experiences with deciding whether to shave or grow a beard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "Oh, Hi!" is reviewed as a high-stakes romantic comedy that deconstructs modern dating dynamics through a darkly comedic premise. The movie stars Molly Gordon and Logan Lerman as a new couple whose romantic getaway goes awry when he reveals his lack of commitment, leading her to hold him hostage with handcuffs. The review praises Gordon's nimble and likable performance but notes that the film struggles at times to balance its tones, shifting between romantic comedy and light thriller. Ultimately, the article describes it as a pleasant but perilous date night film that critiques gender tropes in relationships.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A popular hiking trail in New York's Adirondack Mountains has been closed since June due to the persistent presence of a large bull moose near its summit. State wildlife officials are monitoring the animal, which has exhibited unusual behavior by remaining in a small area instead of moving to lower elevations as is typical for this time of year. While the moose has not shown aggression, the trail remains closed for public safety. Researchers suspect an underlying illness might be influencing its behavior but have not found obvious signs of disease, leaving the reason for its lingering a mystery.</p>

          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, announced he will not run for a third term in 2026, setting up the first open gubernatorial race in the battleground state in 16 years. In his announcement, the 73-year-old governor stated he was proud of his public service but wanted to focus on his family. His tenure has been marked by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively to block conservative priorities. The decision opens a competitive race for both parties, as Democrats also aim to gain control of the legislature under newly redrawn, more favorable election maps.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has softened its stance on AI giant Nvidia, with the president rolling back some export restrictions on its advanced chips and easing permitting rules for data centers. At a recent AI summit, President Trump admitted he had once considered breaking up the company but was advised against it, instead praising CEO Jensen Huang's leadership. This shift provides a significant tailwind for Nvidia, whose stock has soared as it dominates the market for AI infrastructure. The move comes even as a Department of Justice antitrust probe into the company, opened last year, remains ongoing.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has publicly stated that he will not seek to "destroy" Elon Musk's companies by revoking their government subsidies, despite their recent and public war of words. In a social media post, Trump expressed his desire for all U.S. businesses, including Musk's, to thrive. This declaration comes after a period of escalating conflict between the two, which began over a spending bill and evolved into personal attacks. Musk's companies, including SpaceX and Tesla, have significant exposure through federal contracts and benefit from regulatory credits, which had reportedly been under review by the administration.</p>

          <p>England has taken a commanding position in the fourth Test against India, thanks to a five-wicket haul from Ben Stokes and a blistering opening partnership. Stokes' performance, his first five-wicket haul in eight years, helped restrict India to a total of 358. England's openers, Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, then responded with a rapid 166-run stand, significantly reducing the deficit. Despite the bravery of India's Rishabh Pant, who batted with a suspected broken foot, England ended the day at 225-2, firmly in control and looking to secure a series victory.</p>

In the last year, AI-themed job listings have more than doubled, growing at an average annual rate of nearly 29% over the past 15 years. This demand reflects the rising adoption of AI by companies across various sectors, not just in traditional tech hubs. While AI jobs still represent a small fraction of the overall labor market, they tend to offer higher salaries, paying an average of 28% more than similar roles that do not require AI skills.</p>

          <p>This article compares the potential interest earnings of placing $25,000 into either a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. Based on current rates, the CD offers a slightly higher guaranteed return, but the primary advantage is the fixed rate that protects against potential market downturns. The high-yield savings account provides lower, variable returns but offers crucial liquidity, allowing penalty-free access to funds at any time. The article advises that the decision should be based on an individual's need for an emergency fund, short-term financial commitments, and overall risk tolerance rather than just the marginal difference in earnings.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has reversed its decision to phase out paper checks for beneficiaries, confirming it will continue issuing them to those with no other means of receiving payments. The initial plan to switch entirely to electronic deposits after September 30 was walked back following a meeting between Senator Elizabeth Warren and SSA Commissioner Frank Bisignano. Senator Warren raised concerns for the roughly 600,000 Americans, many of whom are unbanked, who rely on paper checks. The SSA will continue to encourage electronic transfers but has committed that no one will be left without access to their benefits.</p>
