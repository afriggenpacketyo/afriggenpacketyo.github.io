          <p>Auckland City secured a surprising 1-1 draw against Boca Juniors in the Club World Cup, a match interrupted by a nearly 50-minute weather delay due to lightning. Despite Boca taking an early lead, Auckland City equalized shortly after halftime, impacting Boca's chances of advancing. In the same group, Benfica triumphed over Bayern Munich with a 1-0 victory, securing their spot in the last 16. Benfica will now face Chelsea or Esperance de Tunis, while Bayern is set to compete against Flamengo in the next round.

          <p>Starbucks is implementing changes to its pricing structure for beverage add-ins, standardizing costs across its stores. Customers will now be charged 80 cents for any combination of syrup or sauce modifying an unflavored drink, but substitutions in pre-flavored drinks will remain free. Adding matcha powder to non-matcha beverages will cost $1, and dried fruit inclusions will be 50 cents. This adjustment is part of CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to enhance customer service and create a more inviting caf√© environment, with the company also testing real-time pricing updates in its app to improve transparency.</p>

          <p>The HMS Prince of Wales, a British aircraft carrier, has docked in Singapore as part of a rare Pacific deployment involving multinational exercises and visits to Australia, Japan, and Korea. Commodore James Blackmore emphasized the deployment demonstrates the UK's commitment to the region and upholding a rules-based international order. The deployment includes participation in an Australia-led exercise involving the US and other regional militaries, and supporting Japan in developing its F-35 capability. The warship's presence coincides with increased activity from Chinese aircraft carriers in the region, though Blackmore anticipates safe and professional interactions.</p>

          <p>FedEx reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue, achieving its $4 billion cost-cutting goal and announcing plans to reduce costs by an additional $1 billion in the next fiscal year. The company's U.S. daily package volume increased by 6% year-over-year, with U.S. ground home delivery volume up 10%. Despite the positive results, FedEx stock dropped in after-hours trading due to current-quarter profit guidance slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's DRIVE program, aimed at improving long-term profitability, is expected to contribute significantly to future cost reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman criticized a lawsuit filed by hardware startup Iyo, which accuses OpenAI of trademark infringement related to the acquisition of Jony Ive's AI startup io. Altman stated that Iyo's CEO had persistently sought investment from OpenAI, now suing over the name in what Altman described as a "silly" case. OpenAI removed the blog post announcing the deal from its website after a judge granted Iyo's request for a temporary restraining order. The lawsuit is one of several legal challenges facing OpenAI as it works to evolve its organizational structure and build out its AI models.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer has moved to dismiss all active gang injunctions, impacting 317 people across multiple cities. This decision follows a 2022 Assembly Bill that narrowed the legal definition of gang activity in California. The move comes after legal pressure from the Peace & Justice Law Center, which argued the injunctions were racially biased and violated the state's Racial Justice Act. Critics argue the injunctions turned everyday activities into crimes and were disproportionately applied to Latino criminal organizations. The district attorney's office may seek new injunctions under the revised definition if necessary.</p>
