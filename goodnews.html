          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage and reconnect with the real world, as evidenced by a British survey indicating that almost half would prefer a life without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups where smartphones are prohibited, offering activities like reading, games, and arts and crafts. Studies suggest that excessive smartphone use is associated with mental health problems, prompting political measures such as potential digital curfews and raising the age limit for social media use. These initiatives reflect a broader trend of recognizing the harmful effects of smartphone overuse and promoting healthier digital habits.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts indicated that Shohei Ohtani is likely to return to the mound after the All-Star break. Ohtani is scheduled to face batters for the first time since undergoing elbow surgery in September 2023. While the Dodgers initially considered an earlier return, they prioritized his hitting during spring training and slowed down his pitching rehabilitation. The plan is to gradually build Ohtani up to five or six innings, making a pre-All-Star break return unlikely.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways became the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the entire rail network by the end of 2027. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander hailed this as a watershed moment, aiming to improve services and reinvest profits into infrastructure. The move seeks to end 30 years of fragmentation and save up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees to rail operators. Rail unions have expressed support for the state takeover, citing the failures of privatization.</p>
