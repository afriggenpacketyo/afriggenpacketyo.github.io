          <h2>Nvidia Shares Surge Amid Anticipation of Trump Administration Easing Chip Export Limits</h2>

          <p>Nvidia's stock price experienced a 3% increase following reports that the Trump administration intends to revise the "AI diffusion" rule, a set of chip trade restrictions proposed during the Biden administration. This rule categorizes countries into tiers with varying limitations on exporting advanced AI chips. The anticipated rescission of the rule, initially scheduled to take effect on May 15, has sparked optimism among investors. Nvidia has declined to comment on the matter, while the potential policy shift signals a significant development in the landscape of international chip trade and technological competition.</p>

          <p>President Trump withdrew his nomination of Dr. Janette Nesheiwat for U.S. Surgeon General, replacing her with Dr. Casey Means following criticism from right-wing influencer Laura Loomer. Loomer questioned Nesheiwat's medical degree and her stance on vaccines, leading to the change. Means' brother, Calley Means, is a White House advisor who works with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who will be serving with Nesheiwat in another capacity. The shakeup underscores the influence of conservative figures in shaping Trump's administration appointments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve decided to maintain interest rates, citing significant uncertainties stemming from President Trump's tariffs and their potential impact on inflation and economic growth. Fed Chair Jerome Powell acknowledged the solid labor market but emphasized the increased uncertainty and risks of both higher unemployment and inflation. Powell stated that the Fed is prepared to respond to economic developments but remains unsure about the appropriate course of action, dampening expectations of a rate cut in June. The central bank is grappling with assessing the economic fallout from the administration's policies while striving to maintain a healthy labor market and stable inflation.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump has spent fewer than 14 days at the White House since her husband's inauguration 108 days prior. She has been observed spending considerable time at Trump Tower in Manhattan and Mar-a-Lago in Florida. While administration officials assert she visits the White House more frequently than publicly known, they have not provided specific details about her schedule. This limited presence has led to comparisons with Greta Garbo due to her reclusive nature.</p>

          <p>House Democrats are urging Attorney General Pam Bondi to prevent the closure of the Community Relations Service, an office created as part of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The Community Relations Service is tasked with preventing and resolving racial and ethnic tensions, conflicts, and civil disorders. The Democrats argue that the office combats violence and city unrest and has played a role in keeping places of worship safe. The Justice Department has confirmed receipt of the letter but declined to comment further.</p>

          <p>Judge Jefferson Griffin, the Republican candidate for the North Carolina Supreme Court, conceded the race to Democratic Justice Allison Riggs after a judge rejected his legal challenges to the election results. Griffin stated that he respects the court's holding and will not appeal the decision. The ruling by Richard E. Myers II, a judge appointed by Republican President Donald Trump, was a major win for Democrats in the swing state. Riggs will serve an eight-year term on the GOP-majority court, boosting Democrats' chances of regaining the majority in 2028.</p>

          <p>Ray Mendoza, a former Navy SEAL, co-wrote and directed the film *Warfare* with Alex Garland, based on Mendoza's experiences in the Iraq War. The film meticulously reconstructs the events of a day in Ramadi when Mendoza's platoon was ambushed, resulting in severe injuries to his teammates. Mendoza aimed for an accurate representation of combat, focusing on the protocols, emotions, and bonds among soldiers. For Joe Hildebrand, the SEAL on whom a character was based, the film offered a therapeutic revisiting of the incident, allowing him to corroborate memories and process the trauma.</p>
