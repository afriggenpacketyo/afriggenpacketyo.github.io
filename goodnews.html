          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 19:59:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein discusses the surprising debate surrounding his book "Abundance," co-written with Derek Thompson, which has become a focal point in the Democratic Party's post-2024 reimagining. The book, advocating for policies that increase the supply of essential resources, has sparked a civil war within the party, particularly between those embracing abundance and anti-corporate populists. Klein notes that while establishment Democrats have largely embraced the book's arguments, some on the populist left see it as a threat to their rising influence, preferring to focus on concentrated corporate power as the primary problem. The article highlights the contrasting viewpoints and the broader struggle within the Democratic Party to define its future direction.</p>

The retreat involved ceremonies using psilocybin and 5-MeO-DMT, with the aim of helping veterans revisit traumatic experiences and find healing. While the Veterans Administration cautions against self-medicating with psychedelics, it is also conducting clinical trials to study the potential benefits of these substances for treating PTSD, depression, and addiction.

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to bolster critically low blood supplies and avert a potential "red alert" situation. The number of regular donors needs to increase from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a safe and reliable supply, particularly of O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHS is emphasizing the need for more black donors to address specific blood types required for treating sickle cell disease, as only a small percentage of the population donates regularly. The appeal comes nearly a year after the NHS issued an amber alert due to a "perfect storm" of factors, including unfilled appointments and increased demand.</p>
