          <p>Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist, passed away in Beijing at the age of 103, marking the end of a remarkable life dedicated to scientific advancement. Often ranked alongside Albert Einstein, Yang was celebrated for his groundbreaking contributions to the field of physics. In 1954, he co-authored the Yang–Mills theory with Robert Mills, a set of equations that proved as pivotal to physics as Einstein’s theory of relativity. This theory laid the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model, which is the cornerstone of modern physics, explaining the behavior of all known elementary particles and unifying fundamental forces.</p>

          <p>The South African SUV market has experienced a significant shift between January and August, with Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dramatically increasing their sales volume. Chinese brands collectively grew sales by 86%, boosting their total market share to 15%. This surge was primarily driven by Chery, which saw its volume rise by 27% to over 16,000 units, and Haval, which experienced a 45% surge to over 12,000 units. While Japanese leaders Toyota and Suzuki still command the largest sales volumes, their individual market dominance is waning, with both brands recording a decline in market share in the same period, indicating a notable change in consumer preference and market dynamics.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered a historic two-way performance, hitting three home runs and pitching into the seventh inning with ten strikeouts, as the Los Angeles Dodgers swept the Milwaukee Brewers 5-1 in Game 4 of the NL Championship Series. Ohtani became the first player in MLB history to hit multiple home runs in a game he pitched, with his three blasts traveling a combined 1,342 feet. This dominant display, ending a quiet postseason for him, secured the Dodgers' back-to-back pennants and their fifth World Series appearance in nine seasons. The team now aims to become baseball’s first repeat champions since the 1998-2000 New York Yankees.</p>

          <p>Alibaba Cloud has introduced Aegaeon, a computing pooling solution that reportedly slashed the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) required to serve its artificial intelligence models by 82%. Beta-tested for over three months, the system reduced the need for Nvidia H20 GPUs from 1,192 to 213 for dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This innovation addresses resource inefficiency in cloud services, where popular models consume disproportionate GPU power while others are sporadically used. Researchers from Peking University and Alibaba Cloud presented this work, highlighting Aegaeon as the first to reveal the excessive costs of serving concurrent large language model workloads on the market.

          <p>Eugenio Suárez's eighth-inning grand slam, his second home run of the game, broke a tie to lead the Seattle Mariners to a decisive 6-2 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays. This crucial win gives Seattle a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven American League Championship Series, placing them just one victory away from their first World Series appearance in franchise history. Cal Raleigh initiated the pivotal rally with a leadoff homer in the eighth, followed by walks that loaded the bases for Suárez's monumental opposite-field blast. Gabe Speier earned the win in relief, and Seattle closer Andres Munoz secured the ninth inning, as the Mariners now eye a historic Game 6 in Toronto.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively building an ecosystem to solidify its position as a leading offshore yuan trading center, aiming to encourage greater international use of the Chinese currency. A key initiative is the new Renminbi Banking Facilitation (RBF) scheme, which makes it easier and cheaper for businesses to borrow yuan, especially appealing given Hong Kong dollar interest rates are more than double mainland yuan loan rates. The RBF will expand in December to include direct investments, enabling mainland firms to secure yuan loans for overseas investment and foreign firms to fund mainland expansion. These strategic measures, announced by Hong Kong and mainland regulators, are designed to attract more international investors and companies to transact in yuan, enhancing the city's financial influence.

          <p>President Trump signed a proclamation imposing 25% tariffs on imports of all medium- and heavy-duty trucks and their parts, along with 10% tariffs on all imported buses, such as school and city buses. This action aims to protect U.S. companies from foreign competition and incentivize domestic manufacturing, discouraging the exclusive use of foreign materials. The administration will also provide a credit for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts to produce vehicles in the U.S., offsetting tariff liabilities based on the proportion of imported components. This program is designed to support American labor, ensure cost competitiveness for companies building vehicles domestically, and expand U.S. production. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, is remembered as a revered strategist and visionary technocrat who directed China’s comprehensive naval modernization to world-class standards. Often compared to 19th-century American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu was instrumental in transforming China's naval forces, particularly championing the development of aircraft carriers and a "blue sea strategy." Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at 13 and took part in the Long March, rising through the ranks before being transferred to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952, marking his first encounter with the sea. His strategic foresight laid the groundwork for China's modern naval power projection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Orionid meteor shower, known for its bright and fast meteors, is set to peak around October 22, offering a spectacular celestial display visible until November 7. These meteors originate from debris left by Halley's Comet, burning up in Earth's atmosphere at speeds of about 41 miles per second, creating distinctive light trails. For optimal viewing, observers should find a dark spot away from city lights between midnight and dawn, looking towards the constellation Orion, specifically near its red-tinged star Betelgeuse. The article advises that no binoculars or telescopes are needed, as the shower will be visible to the naked eye, with a zenithal hourly rate of around 15 meteors per hour during its peak.</p>

          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is seeing a shift this year, with soaring prices influencing consumer behavior. Gold and silver prices have surged, prompting jewellers to innovate with lighter, more elaborate-looking designs to accommodate stagnant budgets. While jewellery still dominates, there's a clear trend towards buying gold and silver for investment rather than adornment, reflected in rising bullion market data and record inflows into ETFs and digital gold. The Reserve Bank of India is also a major driver, diversifying its foreign exchange holdings to reduce dollar dependence and provide stability. Despite high prices, retail demand is expected to hold up in value terms, though volumes may fall. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US is experiencing a significant turnaround in its fentanyl epidemic, with fatal overdoses falling by 25% in 2024, saving nearly 30,000 lives. This decline is largely attributed to a commitment to harm reduction strategies, prioritizing drug users' health over criminalization. North Carolina, a leader in this trend, utilizes programs like Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion (LEAD) to divert users towards recovery, alongside expanded access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) like methadone. The widespread availability and use of Naloxone, an opioid overdose reversal drug, has also saved thousands of lives. Despite challenges and political debates over abstinence versus MAT, these multi-faceted approaches are showing promising results.</p>

Fans, many introduced to sumo through online videos and dedicated communities, expressed excitement at experiencing the sport's speed and power firsthand.
