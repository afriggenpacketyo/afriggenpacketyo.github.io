          <p>High-level trade discussions between the United States and China concluded in London with both nations agreeing on a framework to advance trade relations. China's Vice Commerce Minister Li Chenggang indicated that the agreement aims to implement the consensus reached by both heads of state during prior discussions. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick mentioned that the framework should resolve restrictions on rare earths and magnets, with the plans requiring approval from both Washington and Beijing. The goal is to increase trade between the two countries after a tariff war that saw significant tariffs imposed by both sides. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Play experts are advocating for a national ban on "no ball games" signs and increased protection for playtime in schools to combat children's increasing screen time. The Raising the Nation Play Commission's report highlights a 50% decline in outdoor play in England due to traffic, safety concerns, and unwelcoming public spaces. Recommendations include updating planning policies to involve children in new developments, protecting playtime in schools, and opening school playgrounds to the community. The commission emphasizes creating child-friendly neighborhoods and reversing the intolerance towards children playing outdoors, with some councils already removing restrictive signs.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling parties have agreed to include cash handouts for households affected by rising prices in their platforms for this summer's House of Councillors election. This decision comes as the Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, the main opposition force, proposes suspending the 8 percent consumption tax on food for at least one year. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party opposes tax cuts, setting up a contrast in economic policies leading up to the election. The focus on economic relief highlights concerns over the impact of rising prices on Japanese households.</p>

          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) nations are likely to forgo a joint statement at the conclusion of their upcoming summit in Canada, marking the first time since 2014 that the meeting would end without a consensus document.

The summit is the first in-person meeting since U.S. President Donald Trump assumed office in January, adding further complexity to the discussions.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has proposed selling U.S.-made cars in Japan through its domestic dealership network to support Japan's trade negotiations with the United States. The proposal aims to address President Donald Trump's concerns about trade imbalances between the two countries.

The initiative is seen as a strategic move to ease trade tensions and foster cooperation between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

While Cramer finds some of these stocks not immediately "investible," he acknowledges their popularity and the potential for opportunity, urging a closer look at these companies.
