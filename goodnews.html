          <p>Japanese police arrested three Chinese nationals for allegedly operating an illegal poker gambling operation in Tokyo. Authorities suspect the trio earned over 60 million yen (approximately $413,000) within a year by collecting fees from players. The suspects, including 42-year-old Wang Yi, are accused of running the operation in a condominium, charging a 5% fee on winnings, and hosting around a dozen players daily. While one suspect admitted to the charges, the others claimed they were simply playing poker with friends.</p>

While Mr. Trump hailed the initial talks as a success, economists remain skeptical about the likelihood of a swift agreement.

          <p>In a guest essay for the New York Times, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers should embrace their flaws and avoid striving for perfection. She contends that being flawed is an essential part of a mother's job, teaching children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross also critiques the tendency in psychiatry to blame mothers for their children's problems, urging society to cut mothers some slack and recognize that being "good enough" is sufficient.</p>
