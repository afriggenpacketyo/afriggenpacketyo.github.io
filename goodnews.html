        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ric Edelman, former head of Edelman Financial Engines, argues that the traditional 60-40 portfolio is no longer viable due to increasing human longevity. The article states that with people living longer, investors need to allocate a higher percentage of their portfolio to equities, suggesting 70% to 80% for many investors. Edelman emphasizes the need to plan for a lifespan of 100 years or more, citing advancements in health technology. Fidelity Investments estimates that an average retired couple aged 65 in 2024 may need as much as $315,000 saved just to cover health care expenses in retirement (not investment advice).</p>

Lamar's set list balances his Drake feud with his broader career arc, while SZA explores themes of spiritual rebirth. The performance underscores how competing visions of vengeance can coexist.</p>

          <p>The enforcement of skort wearing in camogie has sparked a debate over sexism, with calls for players to have the choice between skorts or shorts. The article highlights that a recent Gaelic Players Association survey showed 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% wanted the option to wear shorts. A Special Congress has been called to vote on the issue, and a Munster senior camogie final was deferred due to players' refusal to wear skorts.</p>
