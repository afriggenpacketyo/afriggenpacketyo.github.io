          <p>Pop singer Sabrina Carpenter has released an alternate cover for her upcoming album, "Man's Best Friend," following public backlash against the original artwork, which some critics called dehumanizing. The new version was humorously presented as being "approved by God." In recent interviews, Carpenter has addressed the intense scrutiny female artists face, particularly regarding her own sexually suggestive lyrics and stage performances. She defends her artistic choices, stating that femininity is something she embraces and that she feels pressure to be funny.</p>

Enr√≠quez expressed deep frustration with the World Boxing Council (WBC) for the lack of opportunities to unify her title, accusing the organization of protecting the current champion. Feeling disrespected and stalled in her boxing career, she has decided to pursue a new path in MMA, where she has already made a successful debut.

          <p>Animal welfare experts are urging dog owners to take extreme precautions during heatwaves, as exercising dogs in hot weather is a leading cause of heat-related illness. Dogs have a limited ability to cool themselves and can overheat quickly, leading to heavy panting, lethargy, and in severe cases, collapse. Owners are advised to avoid walks during the hottest parts of the day, check pavement temperatures, and provide plenty of cool water. On extremely hot days, keeping dogs indoors with air conditioning and engaging in indoor play is the safest option to prevent a medical emergency.</p>
