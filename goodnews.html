          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 02:13:08 EDT</div>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets presented a mixed trading landscape as investors analyzed China's industrial profits data, diverging from Wall Street's performance. China's industrial profits experienced a slight dip of 1.5% year-over-year in July, indicating a recovery from previous months. Separately, secondary U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian shipments took effect, escalating overall duties on the country's exports to 50%. Despite this, some economists suggest excessive optimism, noting improving liquidity and a dovish Fed could cushion any market corrections, though it is too early to call it a bubble. The mainland Chinese index has climbed over 13% so far this year, showing resilience. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Millions of households in England, Scotland, and Wales will experience a 2% increase in their gas and electricity bills due to the latest price cap announced by Ofgem. The increase, slightly higher than anticipated, will take effect in October, leading campaigners to worry about another winter of high energy costs. Ofgem's cap limits the price per unit of gas and electricity, setting the annual bill for a typical household at £1,755, a £35 increase. This change is partly influenced by government support measures like the £150 Warm Home Discount for those on means-tested benefits, funded by all billpayers, but Which? advises consumers to look for fixed-price deals but be aware of exit fees. </p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new residual heat removal system designed to enhance the safety of its next-generation nuclear power plants. The China Institute of Atomic Energy reported the simulation of a passive heat removal system for fast nuclear reactors, a crucial step in developing a fourth-generation nuclear plant with a closed-loop fuel cycle. This technology aims to make reactors more meltdown-proof by using liquid metal, typically sodium, as a coolant. Integral fast reactors are distinguished by their closed-loop fuel cycle, where spent fuel is reprocessed within the same facility as the reactor, increasing efficiency and safety. </p>

          <h2>China's Industrial Profit Decline Slows as Beijing Addresses Price Wars</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 01:43:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a slower decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, signaling that Beijing's efforts to combat price wars are starting to stabilize company profitability. This improvement follows steeper declines in previous months, with profits in the mining sector particularly impacted. The narrower profit declines are attributed to Beijing's policies aimed at recovering consumer price levels, which have improved profitability for companies in the raw-material manufacturing sector. However, analysts remain cautious, noting that deflationary pressures may persist until market forces lead to industry consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Jacob Fearnley overcame nerves and a heckler to achieve his first main-draw win at the US Open, defeating Roberto Bautista Agut in a four-set match. Fearnley struggled with his serve, accumulating 16 double faults, but managed to improve his performance in the fourth set to secure the victory. He is now set to face Alexander Zverev in the second round, marking a rematch after previous encounters at the Australian Open and Miami Open. Despite his inexperience at the highest level, Fearnley's recent progress has been rapid, and he hopes to address his serving issues by gaining more exposure to high-stakes environments. </p>

The upgraded heat shield tiles were tested successfully during reentry, and the spacecraft splashed down in the Indian Ocean. While challenges remain, such as developing a reusable heat shield and orbital refueling, this test brings Starship closer to supporting NASA's Artemis program and Elon Musk's vision of human missions to Mars. </p>
