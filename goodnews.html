          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new investment in UnitedHealth, acquiring a stake worth approximately $1.6 billion amid the insurer's recent struggles. This move is notable given UnitedHealth is facing a Justice Department investigation into its billing practices, which had caused its stock to decline significantly this year. The investment, possibly made by one of Buffett's lieutenants, aligns with Berkshire's history of value investing and caused UnitedHealth's shares to surge in after-hours trading.

The 24-year-old winger had announced in early 2024 that he was leaving rugby to join the NFL's international player pathway program, signing with the Kansas City Chiefs and later the Jacksonville Jaguars. After failing to secure a spot, he has opted to return to rugby, stating Bristol was the "obvious choice" for his ambition to create exciting moments for fans.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid economic uncertainty, retirees are increasingly considering annuities for guaranteed income, raising the question of whether owning multiple annuities is a sound strategy. While holding various types like fixed and variable annuities can help diversify risk and balance stable income with growth potential, it also introduces complexity and additional fees. This approach requires careful planning around liquidity, as each contract has different surrender periods and withdrawal rules, and nuanced tax management to avoid higher tax burdens. A multi-annuity strategy is most suitable for those with substantial assets who can manage the increased administrative load. (not investment advice)</p>

This move follows a pattern of increased government intervention in key industries, including deals involving Nvidia, U.S. Steel, and rare-earth miners, as Intel works to regain its footing in the competitive semiconductor market.</p>

          <p>Average 30-year mortgage rates have fallen to 6.58%, their lowest point since October 2024, offering some relief to prospective homebuyers and those looking to refinance. Further rate drops could be influenced by upcoming economic data releases, including the September 5 jobs report and the September 11 inflation data. The most significant date is September 17, when the Federal Reserve concludes its next meeting, with a high probability of an interest rate cut that could further reduce borrowing costs for consumers.

          <p>The choice of Alaska for the summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin is strategically significant due to its geography and history. Once a Russian colony sold to the U.S., Alaska provides a symbolic middle ground and a secure, convenient location for the Russian delegation. In modern times, it served as a Cold War frontline and remains a region of strategic military importance for the U.S. This historical context, from shared heritage to past tensions, provides a unique backdrop for the high-stakes talks focused on the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Scientists at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab are developing AI to enable humanoid robots to perform complex tasks in dynamic, human-centered environments. Led by Professor Daniela Rus, the team is training robots by capturing motion and force data from humans, teaching the machines how to handle objects with appropriate delicacy or strength. While acknowledging public apprehension, Rus emphasizes that these robots are tools designed with safety measures, like emergency stop buttons, and have the potential to provide humans with both cognitive and physical 'superpowers'.</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has seen its stock surge over 1,700% since its 2020 public debut, driven by strong retail investor interest and major government contracts. The company recently surpassed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time, yet its market valuation now dwarfs that of tech behemoths with far greater earnings, trading at over 280 times forward earnings. This high premium reflects immense investor confidence in Palantir's AI-powered software and its growing role with the U.S. military and other government agencies. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time in seven years, boys have surpassed girls in achieving the top A-level grades in the UK, with 28.4% of their entries marked A* or A compared to 28.2% for girls. This narrow but significant shift is likely influenced by the growing popularity of STEM subjects, particularly maths, which are taken by a higher proportion of boys and tend to yield more top grades. While humanities subjects have seen a decline in popularity, the overall number of girls achieving top grades remains higher due to more female students taking A-levels in general.</p>
