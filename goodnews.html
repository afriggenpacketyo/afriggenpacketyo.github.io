          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is planning to integrate artificial intelligence into its weather forecasting system to improve accuracy, particularly in areas such as typhoon path prediction. A new team was established in April to combine AI predictions based on historical weather data with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system will analyze vast amounts of data to generate forecasts for temperature and rainfall. While AI will play a significant role, human forecasters will still oversee the process and issue final weather reports and disaster alerts. The agency is also exploring the use of deep learning to process observational data from the Himawari-10 weather satellite, which is set to begin operation in fiscal 2029.</p>

          <p>Fujii Shuzo, a sake brewery in southwestern Japan with over 150 years of history, has started offering a five-day seminar for foreign sommeliers on traditional sake-making techniques. The seminar, part of a course organized by the British-based Sake Sommelier Academy, aims to spread awareness and appreciation of sake beyond Japan. Toru Fujii, head of the brewery, hopes that opening up to overseas participants will eventually lead to increased exports to Europe. Despite some concerns within the domestic industry about revealing trade secrets, Fujii believes that increasing sake's global appeal is essential to counteract the shrinking domestic market.</p>

Hur, despite objections from the Biden administration. A four-minute audio clip of the interview released Friday evening showed Mr. Biden speaking softly and haltingly as he struggled to recall key dates. Republicans have long sought the release of the audio, arguing it might offer evidence of a decline in Mr. Biden‚Äôs mental acuity. Hur's report, released in 2024, declined to recommend charges against Mr. Biden but described him as ‚Äúan elderly man with a poor memory,‚Äù sparking controversy.</p>

          <p>A bronze statue of Melania Trump, erected near her hometown of Sevnica, Slovenia, has been stolen. The life-size statue, which had been in place since 2020, was found to be missing on Tuesday, with only its feet remaining. Residents suspect the theft was either an act of vandalism or a means to melt the statue down for cash. The statue, originally made of wood and later replaced with bronze, had been commissioned by an American artist as an interrogation of President Trump‚Äôs harsh stance on immigration. While the town has capitalized on its connection to Ms. Trump, some locals felt the statue was unaesthetic and did not flatter her.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's "big, beautiful" tax bill has stalled in the House of Representatives after failing to advance through the House budget committee due to disagreements among Republicans. Primary sticking points include the amount to cut from the budget, with some conservatives demanding steeper cuts, and proposed cuts to Medicaid. Republicans also disagree over state and local tax deductions and food assistance programs. The bill's tax breaks total about $4.9 trillion, partly paid for by cuts to Medicaid and green energy tax breaks.</p>

          <p>Ahead of a UK/EU summit in London, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key negotiating points. The EU is seeking a new "youth mobility scheme" to allow young people to move freely between the UK and EU, but concerns exist about the impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are also a point of contention, with the EU seeking an extension of the current post-Brexit deal, while UK fishing groups are calling for changes. Both issues are politically sensitive and could impact future relations between the UK and the EU.</p>

          <p>Tesla has changed its corporate bylaws to limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breaches of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's outstanding shares to initiate or maintain a derivative proceeding, a stake worth over $30 billion. This change takes advantage of a Texas state law, where Tesla is incorporated, allowing corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits. Ann Lipton, a corporate law expert, notes this would be a significant barrier to bringing lawsuits for breach of fiduciary duty against Tesla insiders.</p>

          <p>Animal-rights advocates, including Cher, are advocating for the relocation of the Los Angeles Zoo's two surviving elephants, Billy and Tina, to an animal sanctuary. A lawsuit has been filed to prevent zoo officials from shipping them to another zoo in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Cher argues that Billy has had a ‚Äúterrible life‚Äù in a restrictive enclosure. The legal battle highlights a broader trend of zoos closing their elephant enclosures due to lawsuits and a shrinking number of available animals. The Los Angeles Zoo has said that its elephants receive the best care possible.</p>
