          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate leaders and business titans to raise private funds for the construction of a new, $200 million ballroom at the White House. The guest list included executives from major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google, as well as representatives from the tobacco, telecom, and cryptocurrency industries. The administration stated the project is fully financed by these private donations, which has drawn criticism from figures like Senator Elizabeth Warren over the potential influence of corporate money. The ballroom is one of several renovation projects Trump has undertaken to reshape the White House.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice in an effort to break a significant postseason slump. The $700-million player, who typically avoids this public routine, has struggled at the plate, hitting just two-for-25 with 12 strikeouts since the start of the playoffs. Manager Dave Roberts has expressed that the team cannot win the World Series with Ohtani performing at this level. Ohtani downplayed the idea that his dual role as a pitcher and hitter is contributing to his offensive struggles, instead focusing on improving his at-bats and swing decisions.</p>

This year's ceremony is being held in Newcastle, marking the first time the event has taken place outside of London since its inception in 1992.

          <p>The band The Last Dinner Party is earning critical acclaim for their second album, "From The Pyre," which explores darker, more grandiose themes than their debut. In a recent interview, the members discussed their creative process, revealing that some songs originated from ideas they had when the band first formed, while others were written over a short period. Singer Abigail Morris explained how one track, "The Scythe," evolved from a teenage breakup song into a deeper rumination on grief and the loss of her father. The band's confidence has grown following their rapid success, including winning the BBC's Sound of 2024.</p>

          <h2>Housing Chief Proposes Solution to UK's Asylum Hotel Dilemma</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-15 20:38:20 EDT</div>

          <p>A UK housing association chief executive has proposed a novel solution to the costly and controversial issue of housing asylum seekers in hotels. The plan suggests the government provide funds to councils and housing associations to purchase properties for the social housing stock, rather than paying private contractors for expensive hotel rooms. This would create new homes for existing social housing tenants, and the properties they vacate could then be used for asylum seekers at a fraction of the current cost. The proposal has reportedly been discussed with government departments as a potential way to meet the pledge of emptying all asylum hotels by 2029.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has asserted that federal regulation of artificial intelligence is essential, especially to protect children online, as individual states like California and Texas begin to enact their own laws. Speaking at the CNBC AI Summit, Blackburn emphasized the need for a federal standard to preempt a patchwork of state rules and to hold big tech platforms accountable. She highlighted her work on the Kid's Online Safety Act and other bills aimed at protecting consumer data privacy and preventing the unauthorized use of an individual's name, image, or likeness by AI models. Regulation, she argued, must focus on end-use applications rather than specific technologies.</p>

          <p>Greensburg, Kansas, has become a model of resilience and sustainable innovation after being almost entirely destroyed by an EF-5 tornado in 2007. In the aftermath of the disaster that killed 10 people and wiped out 95% of the town, residents chose to rebuild with a focus on green energy. Today, Greensburg derives 100% of its electricity from wind power, and many buildings feature solar panels and other sustainable designs. This approach has provided not only environmental benefits but also economic stability, with electricity costs remaining remarkably low and consistent over the past decade, inspiring some former residents to return.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's 20-year-old forward, Alyssa Thompson, delivered a standout performance in the team's dominant Champions League victory against Paris FC, scoring her first goal for the club. The young American player, who arrived with high expectations after a club-record transfer, also provided an assist, showcasing the talent that manager Sonia Bompastor believes is still developing. Teammates and commentators noted that the goal would likely relieve pressure on Thompson and could open the floodgates for future scoring. The victory was a return to form for Chelsea, who had been held to draws in their previous two matches.</p>

          <h2>Review: Microsoft's First Handheld Xbox Console is a Powerful but Unpolished Device</h2>

          <p>Microsoft has finally entered the handheld gaming market with the ROG Xbox Ally, a portable console built to work natively with its Xbox Game Pass service. The device is effectively a powerful portable PC running Windows 11, meaning it can play hundreds of games from the Xbox library as well as most PC games that users already own. While the hardware is comfortable and the screen is impressive, the experience is sometimes hampered by the Windows operating system, which wasn't designed for a console and can require updates and troubleshooting. The console offers strong performance but faces stiff competition in a crowded market.</p>
