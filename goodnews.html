          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley is set to introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning with some liberal members of Congress. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would begin increasing the minimum wage in 2026, with subsequent increases tied to inflation. Vermont Democratic Senator Peter Welch is co-sponsoring the bill, reflecting bipartisan support for addressing wage stagnation. This move by Hawley challenges traditional conservative opposition to minimum wage increases, reflecting a shift towards populism and addressing the affordability crisis faced by working-class Americans (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Scientists are helping Yosemite's native Northwestern pond turtles recover by removing invasive American bullfrogs. The bullfrogs, which prey on turtle hatchlings and other wildlife, have contributed to the decline of the pond turtle population.

This study offers a potential tool for reversing the decline of certain species and restoring freshwater ecosystems, highlighting the importance of invasive species management. </p>
