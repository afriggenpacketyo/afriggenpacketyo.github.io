          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 12:28:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "One Battle After Another," starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, has claimed the top spot at the box office with a domestic debut of $22.4 million. The adult drama, loosely based on a Thomas Pynchon novel, met industry expectations and marks another success for Warner Bros. Despite questions about its appeal to casual moviegoers, the film benefited from strong critical reviews, a 98% Rotten Tomatoes score, and significant awards buzz. The solid opening weekend performance is seen as a positive sign for adult-oriented dramas, which have struggled to attract audiences in the post-pandemic era.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Ryder Cup team member Viktor Hovland has been forced to withdraw from his Sunday singles match against Harris English of the United States due to a neck injury. The Norwegian golfer had previously pulled out of Saturday's fourballs competition and has not recovered sufficiently to compete in the final day's events. As a result of the withdrawal, the match has been declared a half, with each team receiving half a point. This development brings Europe's lead to 12-5, meaning the team now needs only two more points from the remaining 11 matches to retain the Ryder Cup.</p>

          <h2>Swiss Voters Narrowly Approve Introduction of Voluntary Digital ID System</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprisingly close referendum, Swiss voters have narrowly approved a government plan to introduce a voluntary electronic identity card system, with 50.4% in favor. This was the second time the issue was put to a national vote, after a 2021 proposal was rejected over concerns that private companies would control the data. The revised, approved plan ensures the system remains state-controlled, with data stored only on users' smartphones, and its use will be optional. Supporters argue the digital ID will streamline bureaucratic processes, while opponents maintain fears about potential privacy erosion and data tracking.</p>

          <p>North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has signaled a willingness to engage in a new round of discussions with U.S. President Donald Trump, citing a positive personal bond from their previous meetings. Despite the failure of past summits to achieve a denuclearization agreement, Kim's statement has renewed speculation about a potential fourth meeting. However, significant obstacles remain, as Kim reiterated that North Korea's nuclear program is non-negotiable and not a bargaining chip. The U.S. State Department responded by reaffirming its commitment to the "complete denuclearization" of the Korean Peninsula, indicating that the fundamental impasse between the two nations persists.</p>

          <p>In a local referendum, residents of Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, have voted to impose severe restrictions on the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums. With over 61% support, the new rules will completely ban gas-powered models and limit the use of electric devices to a three-month period from October to December. Supporters of the initiative argued that the machines contribute to noise and fine dust pollution, and are harmful to microorganisms. Opponents, however, criticized the vote as an expression of an "anti-social culture of prohibition" that will make maintenance work unnecessarily difficult.</p>

          <p>Amid political skepticism about official government statistics, an analysis of alternative data sources presents an uneven and complex picture of inflation in the U.S. economy. While the official Consumer Price Index (CPI) shows annualized inflation at 2.9%, some alternative metrics like the Truflation Price Index and Adobe's Digital Price Index suggest lower rates. However, other leading indicators from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) and the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) point to rising price pressures from manufacturers and small businesses, suggesting that consumer inflation may increase in the coming months.

          <p>China is pioneering an industrial "pull system" designed to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the efficiency and consistency of automobile manufacturing. This emerging model contrasts with the traditional aerospace "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and excess inventory. In the new system, final assembly lines will "pull" components from suppliers only when they are needed, aiming to lower costs, improve quality, and increase flexibility. Researchers believe mastering this scalable production method will be key to dominating the exponentially growing global space industry in the coming decades.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime commercial real estate. With demand softening, landlords are becoming more willing to negotiate flexible lease terms and lower rents with independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and other service-based businesses that were previously priced out. While rental rates are still rising, the pace of increase has slowed, allowing for a market recalibration. This trend is enabling local entrepreneurs to move into spaces with established foot traffic and reimagine them to better reflect their communities.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani, Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The details of the settlement are confidential. Dominion sued Giuliani in 2021, citing numerous instances where he promoted conspiracy theories that the company's voting machines were rigged to ensure Joe Biden's victory. This marks the third major settlement for Dominion in its legal battle against purveyors of election misinformation, following substantial payouts from Fox News and Newsmax for their roles in amplifying the baseless claims.</p>
