          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 02:18:59 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and the Netherlands have jointly uncovered the mechanism by which a single plant cell can regenerate into an entirely new plant, identifying two crucial genetic switches. This significant discovery, published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell, involved researchers from Shandong Agricultural University, BGI-Research, and Radboud University. Traditionally, embryo formation from a single cell was believed to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. However, this article reveals that differentiated somatic cells in plants possess the remarkable ability to reacquire embryogenesis under appropriate conditions, a process termed somatic embryogenesis. This fundamental insight could revolutionize understanding of plant development and offer new avenues for agricultural innovation.</p>

          <p>A BBC presenter shares her initial shock and subsequent journey of understanding after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, decided to donate her body to medical science. Patsy's motivation stems from gratitude to medical professionals who treated her bowel cancer, aiming to help "make a better doctor" for future generations. The article delves into the process of body donation, including how bodies are used for education at Cardiff University, the emotional impact on grieving families, and the long wait for funerals. This personal narrative explores the profound decision and its implications, highlighting the invaluable contribution of body donors to medical training and the differing perspectives within families.</p>

          <p>Boxer Jaron "Boots" Ennis made a spectacular debut in the 154lb division, securing a first-round knockout victory over Uisma Lima in under two minutes. The undefeated Philadelphian, who previously struggled with welterweight cuts, dropped Lima three times with a concussive right uppercut and blistering flurries. This dominant performance, his 35th professional win and 31st inside the distance, sends a clear message to the junior middleweight division. Ennis is now poised for a highly anticipated clash with interim WBC champion Vergil Ortiz Jr. in early 2026, a fight promoter Eddie Hearn calls "one of the best to be made in American boxing."</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans from US dollars to Chinese yuan, a strategic move expected to significantly cut annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. This decision, announced by Kenyan Treasury Minister John Mbadi, involves three loans from the Export-Import Bank of China for the Standard Gauge Railway. With approximately US$3.5 billion of the loan still unpaid, this currency swap aims to halve existing interest rates from 6.37%. Analysts suggest this innovative approach could pave the way for other debt-stressed African nations, potentially drawing them closer to China and reshaping regional financial dynamics beyond mere debt relief.</p>
