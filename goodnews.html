          <p>Prince William was visibly moved during a conversation with Rhian Mannings, who shared the devastating impact of her husband's suicide, which occurred five days after the death of their one-year-old son. Mannings subsequently founded the 2wish bereavement charity, which will now be a key part of a new National Suicide Prevention Network. The Royal Foundation, led by the Prince and Princess of Wales, is committing £1 million over three years to develop this crucial network across the UK. The initiative aims to deepen understanding of suicide's root causes, offer comprehensive support, and foster collaboration among various organizations. Prince William emphasized the importance of building a unified national response to this heartbreaking and preventable tragedy on World Mental Health Day.</p>

          <p>England football legend Wayne Rooney has defended his "golden generation" national team against recent criticism from Steven Gerrard, who characterized them as "egotistical losers." Speaking on his BBC podcast, Rooney acknowledged the team's lack of major tournament wins but strongly refuted claims of a poor attitude, asserting that they "worked hard, we tried." He suggested that the perceived better attitude of current England squads stems more from improved media coverage and player relationships rather than a fundamental difference in effort. Rooney maintained that despite not achieving ultimate success, his team always held a strong belief in their ability to win.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare his party ready to replace Welsh Labour at the upcoming Senedd election. At their annual conference, he will promise a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," positioning Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting. Labour has led Wales since devolution began in 1999, but recent polling suggests Plaid is now vying for leadership. Ap Iorwerth aims to appeal to a broad electorate, presenting his party as the leading anti-Reform force and offering radical policies, such as a payment to combat child poverty.</p>

          <p>London councils are allocated £36.5 million in government funding to tackle the city's homelessness crisis this winter. This investment targets rough sleeping prevention and support for families in temporary accommodation, with £28.4 million for the former and £7.1 million for the latter. The funding comes as London faces record numbers of homeless children and a significant increase in homeless deaths, with over 1,100 fatalities across the UK in 2024. While welcomed by Mayor Sadiq Khan and charities like Crisis, calls remain for a longer-term strategy to address the persistent issue.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect a mix of hope and caution regarding the Gaza ceasefire deal, with many proclaiming "Peace within reach" and "A moment of shared hope." The Daily Express and Daily Mail credit President Trump with brokering the tentative accord, portraying it as a significant diplomatic achievement. However, The Daily Telegraph and Financial Times warn of remaining sticking points, including Hamas's disarmament and the structure of an international stabilization force. Concerns also exist about the potential for Israel to renege on the deal or for terrorist actions to derail the peace process.</p>

          <p>Eva Maria Pommer, a 35-year-old German citizen, has been identified as the woman whose body was found on a Dutch beach in 2004, solving a 21-year-old cold case. Her identification came through a crucial tip-off following "Operation Identify Me," an international police campaign to name women who died in suspicious circumstances across Europe. Ms. Pommer's body was discovered near Wassenaar with no obvious injuries, but unusual attire and a key linked to Germany. While her identity is confirmed, the cause of death remains unexplained, and police continue their investigation.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Salt-Laced Ice Can Generate Electricity When Bent</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 00:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists from China and Spain have made a discovery that adding salt to ice enables it to generate electricity, potentially opening new avenues for clean power generation in cold environments. Their research found that salt-doped ice, when bent, produced an electrical response comparable to high-performance ceramic materials known for their electrical properties. This phenomenon is attributed to flexoelectricity, where an electrical charge is generated under non-uniform strain. The team has already fabricated devices using saline ice, demonstrating its potential as a low-cost energy source.</p>

The Giants' defense also performed strongly, sacking Jalen Hurts three times and securing an interception. This win, only the Giants' fourth in their last 18 games against the Eagles, demonstrated a significant turnaround for the rookies after a previous turnover-heavy loss.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planner, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), and the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) have jointly issued a policy paper to combat "disorderly price competition." The measures aim to limit intense competition that leads to price wars and self-destructive cost-cutting, which authorities believe harm industry development, innovation, and product quality. Regulators will guide industry associations to assess average production costs and help companies set reasonable prices. They also vowed to monitor market competition closely and intervene against pricing law violations to maintain market order. (not investment advice)</p>
