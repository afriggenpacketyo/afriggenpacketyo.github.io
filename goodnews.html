          <p>U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue stated that a significant meeting between President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to take place early next year rather than this fall. This assessment followed a Friday call where Trump mentioned a potential meeting in South Korea next month and subsequent reciprocal visits, details not corroborated by China's official statement. Perdue, speaking during a U.S. lawmaker delegation's rare visit to Beijing, described the relationship between Trump and Xi as "very good and very encouraging." The delegation also discussed resolving differences over TikTok ownership and stressed the importance of boosting communication, especially on military matters, to prevent misunderstandings between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>Singapore's core inflation rate, which excludes private transport and accommodation costs, registered a softer-than-expected rise of 0.3% in August, reaching its lowest point since February 2021. This figure was below economists' projections and a decrease from the previous month's 0.5%. Headline inflation also eased to 0.5%. The Monetary Authority of Singapore had projected core inflation to average between 0.5% and 1.5% for 2025. This easing occurs as Singapore anticipates weaker economic growth in the latter half of the year, despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the second quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, a pediatrician, strongly urged Australians to rely on scientific evidence for medication decisions, specifically refuting U.S. President Donald Trump's recent comments linking paracetamol (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism. Freelander highlighted that extensive studies have disproven a causative effect, with the largest Swedish and Japanese studies finding no such link, despite small associations. He stressed that paracetamol is classified as safe and crucial in pregnancy, with alternatives posing greater risks to the fetus. The article criticizes Trump and his health secretary for promoting unscientific health policies that cause distress and could lead to inappropriate health outcomes, emphasizing the importance of trusting regulatory bodies like Australia's TGA.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation uncovered an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized resale websites exploit fans by selling tickets at inflated prices or rendering them invalid. The issue was starkly illustrated when a South Korean fan paid £900 for a Tottenham ticket that was deactivated upon entry to a Brighton match. Brighton & Hove Albion Football Club is actively combating this illegal practice, utilizing new technologies and a dedicated tickets investigation officer to identify and block hundreds of touted tickets, preventing significant financial gains for touts. The club urges fans to purchase directly from official sources to avoid fraud, while the Premier League is implementing new digital ticketing rules with encrypted barcodes to further deter touting.</p>

          <p>U.S. House Representative Adam Smith, a top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, emphasized the critical danger posed by a lack of regular communication between major militaries, particularly the U.S. and China. Speaking in Beijing, Smith asserted that China, given its rapidly increasing military strength and nuclear arsenal, needs greater engagement with other large militaries to prevent miscalculations and misunderstandings. He highlighted that rapid advancements in AI and cyberspace technology amplify the risk of conflict. Smith urged Beijing to engage in conversations about its nuclear capabilities to ensure mutual understanding and avoid unintended escalation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco, Rita Lin, ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding that had been frozen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The judge granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by suspending grants without specific details or proper procedures. UCLA had faced a total of $584 million in suspended grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million to UCLA and aligns with other rulings against the Trump administration's use of federal funding to pressure elite colleges.</p>

          <p>Modern Premier League football is increasingly adopting tactics long associated with manager Sam Allardyce, such as direct play, emphasis on set-pieces, and utilizing big strikers. Allardyce, who guided Bolton Wanderers to Europe with this style, notes that his methods were once heavily criticized but are now becoming commonplace, with coaches like Luis Enrique even watching games from the stands for a better overview, a practice Allardyce pioneered. The article highlights a shift away from possession-based play and "playing out from the back" due to the high risk of conceding goals. This resurgence suggests a return to more pragmatic and effective strategies that prioritize scoring and defensive solidity.</p>

          <p>While major European financial centers face an IPO drought, Stockholm's Stock Exchange is thriving, raising nearly $2 billion in 2025. This success is attributed to Sweden's deep-seated "equity culture," a diverse pool of domestic capital, and a supportive regulatory framework developed over decades. Government policies, including tax-incentivized savings funds and the Investment Savings Account, have fostered high retail investor participation, with about 70% of household wealth held in equity. The market also benefits from "cornerstone" investors and an efficient IPO process, where private equity firms ensure value for new public investors. Despite being relative to a quiet Europe, Sweden's model provides a blueprint for fostering a robust domestic investment ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

His release, reportedly requested by the National Council for Human Rights, brings immense joy to his family, including his mother who undertook a lengthy hunger strike. Despite acquiring British citizenship in 2021, Egypt had denied him consular visits.

This call aligns with Beijing’s Global Governance Initiative, which promotes a multipolar, inclusive global order based on sovereign equality and shared development.

The verderers initiated pannage due to a "heavy acorn crop," emphasizing its importance for the forest's ecology and the well-being of other livestock. While celebrating this unique tradition, officials urge visitors to maintain a safe distance from the pigs and drive carefully, as past seasons have seen animals struck by cars.
