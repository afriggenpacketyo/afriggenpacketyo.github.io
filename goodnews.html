        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography by author Amy Odell claims that Gwyneth Paltrow had doubts about her relationship with Brad Pitt in the 1990s, believing she was "smarter, better educated, more sophisticated" than him. The book, "Gwyneth: The Biography," details how Paltrow allegedly felt Pitt's Missouri upbringing was a world away from her Manhattan background. The couple met in 1993 and were engaged before their split in 1997. The book excerpts highlight Paltrow's alleged early concerns that Pitt was not the right partner for her, despite his popularity with her family and friends.</p>

          <p>A.P. Deauville has issued a voluntary recall for more than 67,000 cases of its Power Stick brand deodorant, which was sold at major retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and Dollar Tree. The recall was initiated due to deviations from the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations, according to a notice from the agency. The recall affects three specific types of the brand's roll-on antiperspirant deodorant. The company has provided the affected lot numbers for consumers to check, though the specific nature of the manufacturing deviation has not been detailed.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a recent SEC filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows a previous divestment of about $37 million worth of shares earlier in the week. The transactions come as Nvidia's market capitalization has soared past $4 trillion, driven by immense demand for its AI-powering chips, making it the world's most valuable company.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions defeated the Wallabies 27-19 in their first Test match, with flankers Tadhg Beirne and Tom Curry delivering "immense" performances. Coach Andy Farrell praised the duo, with Curry in particular responding to recent criticism with a dominant and aggressive display before he was substituted. The Lions established a strong lead, though Australia mounted a comeback in the second half after Curry's departure. The victory gives the Lions a crucial 1-0 lead in the series as they head to Melbourne for the next match.</p>

          <p>Following a controversial penalty for slow play issued to another golfer, major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have criticized the R&A's inconsistent enforcement at the Open. Both players were warned about their pace during the third round, despite noting that earlier rounds had run significantly over the allotted time without issue. Stenson called the approach inconsistent, while DeChambeau advocated for a new system that times every shot for every player to ensure fairness. The debate highlights ongoing tensions within professional golf regarding the pace of play at major tournaments.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Generation Life, a group of young, college-aged Christian activists who engage in "beach outreach" on the Jersey Shore to promote a message of chastity before marriage. In an era of shifting sexual norms, the group attempts to connect with their peers by discussing the negative impacts of social media on relationships and self-esteem. They frame chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way to reclaim personal dignity and build deeper, non-transactional relationships. The piece explores the challenges and philosophy behind updating a traditional message for a generation facing unique social pressures.</p>

          <p>Dutch rider Thymen Arensman secured his first-ever Tour de France stage victory, delivering a win for the Ineos Grenadiers team on a difficult mountain stage. The day was marked by the withdrawal of top contender Remco Evenepoel, who was third overall but abandoned the race midway through the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet due to poor form. Overall leader Tadej Pogačar extended his lead by finishing second on the stage, just ahead of his main rival Jonas Vingegaard. Evenepoel's departure has significantly reshaped the competition for the final podium positions.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from a left knee bone bruise much faster than initially anticipated. Doctors told Muncy he was a "millisecond" away from a season-ending surgery after a collision at third base on July 2. However, he has already resumed baseball activities, including running and swinging, and is reporting no pain, raising hopes for a return that is "a lot sooner than anticipated." His absence has been felt by the Dodgers' offense, which has struggled to score runs since the slugger was placed on the injured list.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team was awarded their world championship gold medals at the London Diamond League meeting. The team, which included Roger Black and Iwan Thomas, was upgraded from silver after the U.S. team was disqualified due to a doping admission by team member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The athletes received a rousing welcome from the London crowd as World Athletics president Seb Coe presented the long-overdue medals. The ceremony corrected a historical injustice in the sport, providing a moment of recognition for the British runners.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted weekly gains, buoyed by a combination of strong corporate earnings reports and encouraging inflation data. The June Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed core inflation slightly cooler than expected, though high shelter costs remain a concern for the Federal Reserve. Producer price data also came in below expectations, suggesting wholesale inflation is manageable. While the market continues to anticipate interest rate cuts later this year, the impact of potential new tariffs on the European Union introduced some caution at the end of the week.

          <p>Self-made millionaire and author Scott Galloway claims that the worst career advice is to "follow your passion," arguing that such guidance typically comes from those who are already wealthy. Instead of pursuing a passion blindly, Galloway advises finding an intersection between what you are good at and what is lucrative. He emphasizes that success often comes from enduring rejection and pivoting based on skills and opportunities, not just desire. This sentiment is echoed by other successful leaders who suggest focusing on one's strengths and what the market values to build a successful career.</p>
