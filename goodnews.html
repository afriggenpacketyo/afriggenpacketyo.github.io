          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 20:17:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korean semiconductor firm SK Hynix announced record-breaking operating profit and revenue for the second quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. This surge is attributed to sustained high demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) chips, which are essential components in AI technology and used by clients like Nvidia. The company's HBM business has been so successful that it briefly overtook Samsung Electronics in the global DRAM market earlier this year. SK Hynix anticipates continued strong demand and plans to increase capital expenditure to support its HBM customers in the future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released its "AI Action Plan," a strategic document aimed at ensuring U.S. dominance in artificial intelligence by promoting rapid, unimpeded development. The plan emphasizes deregulation, seeking to streamline environmental reviews for data center construction and limit state-level rules that could slow innovation. Heavily influenced by recommendations from major tech firms like OpenAI and Google, the strategy advocates for a "try-first" culture and aggressive adoption of AI across government and military sectors. Critics worry the approach prioritizes speed over safety and environmental protection, effectively placing the nation's AI future in Silicon Valley's hands.</p>

          <p>Spanish midfielder Aitana Bonmati scored a dramatic extra-time winner against Germany to send her team to its first-ever Women's Euro final. Her decisive goal capped a remarkable personal journey, as she had been hospitalized with viral meningitis just days before the tournament began. The two-time Ballon d'Or winner showcased her world-class talent by skillfully maneuvering in a tight space to secure the 1-0 victory in Zurich. The win sets up a highly anticipated final against England, a rematch of the 2023 World Cup final.</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice has issued a unanimous advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions and must provide reparations for damages. This landmark decision came in response to a campaign led by the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, which suffers disproportionately from climate change despite its minimal emissions. While not legally binding, the ruling sets a powerful legal precedent that can be used in climate litigation worldwide to hold governments and corporations accountable. The opinion clarifies that existing international treaties, including the Paris Agreement, compel nations to act on climate change.</p>

          <p>NASA has successfully launched the TRACERS mission, consisting of two identical satellites designed to study the interaction between the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. Flying in tandem, the spacecraft will provide detailed measurements of how energy from the sun couples with our planet's magnetosphere, creating space weather. This phenomenon can generate spectacular auroras but also poses risks to satellites, power grids, and communication systems. The mission's findings are expected to improve our ability to understand and predict these potentially disruptive space weather events, helping to safeguard critical infrastructure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Korea's economy grew by 0.6% in the second quarter compared to the previous one, successfully avoiding a technical recession. The growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, was driven by a rebound in consumption and strong exports of semiconductors and petroleum products. This positive economic data comes as the country navigates crucial trade negotiations with the United States to avoid potential tariffs on its exports. The Bank of Korea has recently held interest rates steady, balancing low growth forecasts with a desire for financial stability as inflation remains near its target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer described the current market as a mixed environment, driven by both positive and negative forces that make it difficult to predict. On the positive side, he pointed to a less severe trade deal with Japan, strong earnings from banks and healthcare, and continued demand in the data center sector. However, he also warned of speculative "froth" reminiscent of past market bubbles, such as the dot-com era and the 2021 meme stock mania. Cramer advised investors to remain engaged but skeptical, acknowledging that while there is money to be made, significant risks persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Uber is launching a new program in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit that will allow women passengers to specifically request a female driver. The feature, called "women drivers," will appear as an option in the app, and customers can also pre-book rides with women. Similarly, female drivers can set a preference to be matched with female riders. Uber acknowledged that wait times might be longer due to the lower number of female drivers but stated the goal is to address safety and comfort preferences expressed by users. The program has already been implemented in 40 other countries.</p>

This increased spending is designated for building out the infrastructure needed to support the growing demand for its cloud and artificial intelligence services. (not investment advice)</p>
