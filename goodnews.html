          <p>A clinical trial at UCLA has provided a promising treatment for LAD-1, a rare genetic disorder that severely weakens the immune system. The Langenhop family enrolled their three children, all diagnosed with LAD-1, in the trial, which involved gene therapy to correct the genetic defect in their stem cells. Five years after treatment, all nine patients in the trial, including the Langenhop children, are doing well, showing healthy immune cell production and no severe infections. The therapy is currently under FDA review, offering hope for a potential cure for others with LAD-1.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Catalonia, Spain, lifted an order confining approximately 160,000 people to their homes after a fire at an industrial estate caused a toxic cloud of chlorine. The fire, which originated at a swimming pool cleaning products firm in Vilanova i la Geltr√∫, prompted a swift response from fire services and civil protection, who monitored toxic levels and advised residents to stay indoors. The fire was stabilized with no casualties reported. The cause of the blaze is suspected to be a lithium battery.</p>

          <p>The Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party, is challenging its classification as 'confirmed right-wing extremist' by Germany's domestic intelligence agency (BfV). The BfV has temporarily put this classification on hold following a 'standstill commitment' requested by the AfD, allowing the court time to review the case. Despite the AfD's claim of 'exoneration,' the BfV maintains its classification is correct and has only suspended the designation for the court's review. This legal maneuver is a routine administrative procedure and does not indicate the AfD's prospects of success in overturning the classification.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972 with the intention of landing on Venus, re-entered Earth's atmosphere after 53 years in space due to a booster malfunction. The spacecraft, a relic of the Cold War era's ambitious space exploration efforts, likely splashed down in the Indian Ocean. This event serves as a reminder of the Soviet Union's ventures in space and the technological challenges of interplanetary missions during the space race. While the United States focused on Mars, the Soviets aimed for Venus, achieving significant milestones in exploring the planet's harsh environment.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift's representatives have responded to her summons in a legal dispute between Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively, stating that she is being drawn into the matter to create 'tabloid clickbait.' Baldoni claims Swift encouraged him to accept script re-writes by Lively for the film 'It Ends With Us,' which is the subject of a sexual harassment case. Swift's representatives assert that she was not involved in casting or creative decisions and never reviewed or made notes on the film. The legal battle involves counter-suits between Lively and Baldoni, alleging sexual harassment, extortion, defamation, and invasion of privacy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), has been introduced to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other Schedule I substances. The bill seeks to repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that forbid federal funds from going towards research of Schedule I substances, and that require the ONDCP to oppose any attempts to legalize Schedule I substances. Proponents argue that this would allow research to catch up with increasing cannabis consumption and enable policymakers to craft more informed legislation, while opponents express skepticism about its likelihood of passage. The bill could potentially lead to increased research on the medical uses and impacts of cannabis.</p>
