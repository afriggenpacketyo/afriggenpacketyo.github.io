          <p>American tennis star Coco Gauff has addressed critics questioning her glamorous on-court appearance at the U.S. Open, asserting her right to personal expression. She explained that tennis is her profession, not her entire identity, and she takes pleasure in coordinating her outfits, hair, and nails as part of presenting her best self. Gauff believes that women should be celebrated for these choices rather than facing judgment. This article highlights her strong stance on individuality and self-confidence within professional sports.</p>

These products, which include chemical materials, electronic components, medical supplies, and solar manufacturing equipment, will continue to be exempt from levies ranging from 7.5% to 25%. The decision considers previously submitted public comments and advice from interagency committees, indicating a cautious approach to trade policy.

          <p>This article delves into parasocial relationships, which are one-sided connections fans form with public figures, feeling intimacy without actual reciprocity. Driven by modern media and social platforms, these bonds are often based on a carefully constructed public persona rather than the individual. While fandom can be deeply meaningful and positive, the piece also highlights a rise in toxic behaviors, with some fans overstepping boundaries and celebrities experiencing harassment. It encourages responsible engagement, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between a public image and the actual person behind it.</p>

          <p>Alibaba reported a stronger-than-expected net income for its June quarter, primarily fueled by an accelerated 26% year-on-year sales growth in its cloud computing division. This surge was driven by robust demand for artificial intelligence, making AI-related products a significant contributor to external customer revenue. Despite the company's overall revenues falling short of analyst forecasts, the strong performance in its cloud unit underscores Alibaba's strategic focus and significant investments in AI. Investors are closely monitoring its position as a major global player in this rapidly evolving technology sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that higher education has always been costly, and government subsidies have historically been vital for expanding access in the U.S. It traces this support from Thomas Jefferson's vision to the G.I. Bill, emphasizing education's role in national well-being and democracy. The piece critiques a shift in the 1980s, when declining state funding led to the current affordability crisis by passing costs onto students. It advocates for renewed public investment, rather than cuts, to make college affordable again, benefiting both individuals and society.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency has called for rational and localized growth in its 'AI Plus' initiative, aimed at integrating cutting-edge technology across manufacturing and services. The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) urged regions to leverage their unique strengths and avoid 'disorderly competition and blind expansion.' The government will continue to issue AI vouchers to subsidize computing power and lower R&D costs, while also piloting consumer subsidies for AI-powered products. This strategy underscores China's commitment to bolstering self-reliance as a tech powerhouse through structured innovation.</p>
