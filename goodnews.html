The message will vow that the estimated 71,000 British and Commonwealth soldiers who died will never be forgotten, echoing a broadcast made by his grandfather, King George VI, 80 years ago. The King, alongside the Queen and Prime Minister, will attend a national service of remembrance in Staffordshire, which includes a military flypast and a two-minute silence to mark the end of the war.</p>

          <p>New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs remains noncommittal about his availability for the team's season opener as he continues to recover from an ACL injury sustained last year. Despite being medically cleared and participating in limited practice, Diggs expressed uncertainty, stating he is taking his recovery day by day. After a promising six-year streak of over 1,000 receiving yards per season, his injury-shortened run with the Houston Texans preceded his new three-year deal with the Patriots. Coach Mike Vrabel has not provided a definitive timeline for the star player's return to the field.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in the beleaguered health insurer UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. The investment comes as a surprise given UnitedHealth's recent troubles, including a Justice Department investigation and a lowered earnings outlook, which caused its stock to fall significantly this year. Following the disclosure, UnitedHealth's shares surged in extended trading. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing, and other notable investors like Michael Burry have also recently bought into the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has experienced a dramatic rise since its 2020 public debut, with its stock surging over 1,700% and its market valuation exceeding $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been government contracts, particularly with the U.S. Army, which accounted for 55% of its recent quarterly revenue. While U.S. commercial revenue is also growing, the company's valuation has reached a steep premium, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio far exceeding that of tech giants like Apple and Microsoft, indicating high investor expectations for its AI-powered software.

          <p>Welsh rugby international Louis Rees-Zammit has officially returned to the sport by signing with the Bristol Bears, ending his brief foray into American football. The 24-year-old winger, who has 32 caps for Wales, had announced in January 2024 that he was leaving rugby to join the NFL's international player pathway program. After stints with the Kansas City Chiefs and Jacksonville Jaguars failed to result in a breakthrough, he chose to come back to rugby. Rees-Zammit expressed excitement about joining Bristol, a club whose values align with his ambition to be one of the world's best players.</p>

          <p>This article explores the strategy of owning multiple annuities for retirement planning, confirming that it is a viable option for diversifying income streams and managing risk. Different types of annuities can be combined to balance guaranteed income with growth potential. However, the approach introduces significant complexity, requiring careful coordination of liquidity, as each contract has its own surrender periods and withdrawal rules. It also necessitates more nuanced tax planning, making it crucial for individuals to be highly organized or work with a financial professional to manage the strategy effectively.

          <h2>New Medical Guidelines Recommend Abstaining from Alcohol and Earlier Treatment for High Blood Pressure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 16:29:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Updated guidelines from the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology advise a more aggressive approach to managing high blood pressure, including a significant change in alcohol recommendations. The new advice suggests forgoing alcohol entirely, a shift from previous guidance that permitted moderate consumption, citing evidence of its negative impact on blood pressure. The guidelines also recommend starting treatment with lifestyle changes when systolic pressure is in the 130-139 range, with medication to follow if levels don't improve. This proactive stance aims to better prevent heart disease, stroke, and dementia.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans have seen another slight decline, continuing a recent downward trend. This has left many homeowners wondering if they should apply now or wait for potentially lower rates in the future. For those considering a HELOC, waiting may not be necessary as its variable rate will adjust with future market changes. However, for a fixed-rate home equity loan, waiting could potentially lock in a better long-term rate, though there is no guarantee that rates will fall further or by how much.

          <p>David Zervos, chief market strategist at Jefferies and a potential candidate for Federal Reserve Chair, has advocated for aggressive interest rate cuts. He argues that the central bank should implement a half-percentage-point cut to stimulate the labor market and forestall a slowdown, asserting that current monetary policy is overly restrictive. Zervos, one of nearly a dozen names being considered to succeed Jerome Powell, believes his market-focused background would be a benefit to monetary policy decisions. His position aligns with President Trump's repeated calls for significant rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average rate for a 30-year mortgage has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point in ten months, offering a glimmer of hope for potential homebuyers and those looking to refinance. This article identifies several key upcoming dates that could influence whether rates drop further. These include the release of the September employment report and the next inflation data report, both of which will be closely watched by the Federal Reserve. The Fed's own policy meeting on September 17 will be the most critical event, as any decision to cut its benchmark rate could trigger another drop in mortgage rates. (not investment advice)</p>
