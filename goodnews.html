        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. and the European Union have reached a new trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a threatened 30% tariff imposition by the Trump administration. The deal establishes a new 15% tariff rate on many EU imports and includes provisions for tariff-free trade on certain products like aircraft and some generic drugs. As part of the agreement, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over the next three years. However, the legality of the tariffs remains under judicial review, with a case expected to reach the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) suggests implementing a tax on large online retailers like Amazon to fund community renewal projects. The proposal comes a year after riots in Southport, which the report argues were fueled by local disrepair and a loss of shared community spaces. The proposed "21st-century welfare fund" would be generated by higher levies on warehouses or online sales taxes, aiming to make wealthy online firms contribute more to the communities they operate in. This investment in civic infrastructure is presented as a vital defense against social division and extremism.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a significant slump in July, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly looking to acquire a position player who can upgrade their outfield defense before the trade deadline. While the team's star-studded offense has struggled, the front office believes strengthening run prevention will be key to a successful playoff run. Veteran outfielder Harrison Bader of the Minnesota Twins has emerged as a prime target due to his elite defensive skills and solid offensive production this season. The move would address defensive weaknesses and support a pitching staff that is expected to be a team strength in the postseason.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Terry Bollea, known as Hulk Hogan, this article examines the lasting impact of his landmark lawsuit against Gawker Media. The 2016 case, in which Hogan was awarded $140 million after the site published a private sex tape, is remembered as a pivotal moment for media law and digital privacy. While it didn't set new legal precedent, the verdict served as a powerful reminder of the limits of First Amendment protections, particularly concerning the publication of graphic, private material. The case underscored that even for public figures, there is a right to privacy that can trump newsworthiness, a significant consideration in the internet age.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a legal challenge from a Trump-allied investment fund that aimed to force the Federal Reserve's rate-setting committee to open its meetings to the public. The lawsuit by Azoria Capital argued that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) should be subject to the federal "Sunshine Act," which requires open meetings for government agencies. Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the FOMC is not a government agency under the act, upholding its long-standing practice of meeting behind closed doors to deliberate on interest rate policy.
