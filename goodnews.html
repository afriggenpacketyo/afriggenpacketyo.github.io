          <p>Patrick Braxton, the first Black mayor of Newbern, Alabama, won a decisive re-election victory four years after white officials allegedly locked him out of the town hall. The election was the town's first since the 1960s, held under a federal settlement after Black residents sued to end a system of "hand-me-down governance" where mayors appointed their successors. This system had resulted in a white-led government in a majority-Black town. Braxton's victory is seen as a restoration of democratic process and fair representation for the community.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Japan, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for stable and amicable relations between India and China, stating that collaboration between the two nations is essential for regional and global prosperity. He emphasized that a strong bilateral relationship is crucial for shaping a "multipolar Asia and world." This statement signals a potential warming of ties, which contrasts with India's recent strategic efforts to position itself with the U.S. as a counterweight to China's growing influence in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

Alcaraz, a former US Open champion, briefly received treatment on his knee during the second set but stated afterward that he was not concerned about it affecting his future performance in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Canadian Colombian singer Tei Shi has released her fourth studio album, her second independent project since departing from her former record label. The album, titled "Make believe I make believe," was created during a creative retreat in British Columbia and reflects her multicultural identity by blending dream-pop with Latin influences. Now in full artistic control, the artist has also announced an 11-city North American tour to support the new record, which she describes as a versatile collection capturing a wide range of feelings.</p>

          <p>With mortgage rates remaining elevated, seniors looking to tap into their home equity have several alternatives to refinancing their primary mortgage. Options include reverse mortgages, which are exclusive to homeowners 62 and older and do not require monthly repayments, instead converting equity into income. Other viable choices are home equity loans, which provide a lump sum at a fixed interest rate, and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), which offer a flexible credit line with variable rates for more adaptable borrowing.

          <p>A growing number of families are selling large, historic ranches that have been owned for generations, often due to disagreements among numerous heirs or a lack of interest from the next generation. These legacy properties are in high demand from wealthy buyers, partly fueled by the "Yellowstone" effect, who seek privacy and a connection to the outdoors. Brokers note that while these sales can be bittersweet for the families, they represent a significant transfer of wealth and a changing landscape for these unique, sprawling properties.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court's ruling, finding that the Department of Homeland Security likely lacked the authority to terminate the protections. The court noted that Congress designed the TPS system to be predictable and insulated from electoral politics, providing continued relief for individuals unable to return safely to Venezuela due to its ongoing crisis.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung's first summit with President Donald Trump was marked by a friendly and easygoing tone, easing fears of a potentially contentious meeting. Lee's preparatory efforts, which included studying "The Art of the Deal," appeared to pay off, with Trump responding favorably to proposals like a plan to revitalize the U.S. shipbuilding industry. However, analysts caution that it is too early to declare a complete victory, as key unresolved issues regarding trade details and defense cost-sharing could still test the new relationship.</p>
