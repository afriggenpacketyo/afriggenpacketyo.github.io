          <p>In a novel anti-poaching effort, scientists in South Africa have begun injecting rhino horns with a harmless radioactive substance. The initiative, known as the Rhisotope Project by the University of the Witwatersrand, aims to make smuggled horns easily detectable by customs authorities worldwide. After a six-year pilot study involving 20 rhinos confirmed the material's safety for the animals, the project is now being deployed at a larger scale. This innovative method seeks to disrupt the illegal export of horns to Asian markets, where they are used in traditional medicine and valued as status symbols.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, leaving only 250 to protect federal properties as anti-ICE protests have become less intense. The initial deployment of 4,000 troops in June to manage riots was contested by California state and local officials, who argued it was unnecessary and escalated tensions. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom praised the withdrawal, with Newsom stating President Trump's "political theater backfired." The troops had been primarily guarding federal ICE facilities amid demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Vermont Green FC, a fourth-tier soccer team, has become a sensation in its home state, selling out its USL League Two final and drawing support from figures like Senator Bernie Sanders. The club's success is built not just on its unbeaten regular season but also on a strong community-focused identity that attracts even non-sports fans. Despite being an amateur team, demand for tickets is immense, with fans finding creative ways to watch games at the sold-out Virtue Field in Burlington. The team's rise highlights a growing movement in lower-league American soccer, where community connection is valued as much as on-field performance.</p>

          <p>The Songs of Love Foundation, a nonprofit that has provided personalized songs for seriously ill children for nearly 30 years, is now using artificial intelligence to expand its mission. The organization plans to serve older adults with memory loss, a goal its founder believes is achievable by using AI to authentically recreate musical styles from past eras. The foundation has partnered with AI music platform Suno to help its volunteer songwriters create well-produced tracks. However, the move has raised concerns among some, who worry it could erode the human connection central to therapeutic music.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has approved the sale of U.S. Steel to Japan's Nippon Steel, a deal President Trump had previously opposed on the campaign trail. A key feature of the approved deal is a "golden share" provision, which grants the U.S. president significant influence over the future of the iconic American company. This special share gives the government veto power over certain critical decisions, ensuring a level of national control despite the foreign ownership. The move represents a reversal of Trump's earlier stance and introduces a novel mechanism for government oversight in a major industrial transaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand has returned two of twenty captured Cambodian soldiers as a goodwill gesture ahead of crucial defense talks aimed at maintaining a ceasefire. The move follows the worst border clashes between the two nations in over a decade, which resulted in at least 43 deaths and displaced over 300,000 people last week. A truce was brokered on Monday, partly due to U.S. diplomatic pressure linked to trade tariff negotiations. Defense ministers from both countries are now set to meet in neutral Malaysia to discuss de-escalation and border security.</p>

          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter, driven by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which was released on June 5, helping push total revenue to 572.3 billion yen ($3.8 billion). Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has kept its full-year sales forecast for the console at a conservative 15 million units. The company's shares have surged approximately 40% this year on excitement for the new hardware. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a significant change to its main civil service internship program, restricting eligibility to university students from "lower socio-economic backgrounds." The policy, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase the representation of working-class talent within Whitehall, where only 12% of graduate-level entrants came from such backgrounds in 2024. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program. The move is part of Labour's broader effort to reform the civil service and ensure it better reflects the country it serves.</p>

          <p>British 800-meter runner Max Burgin is optimistic about his chances at the upcoming World Championships in Tokyo after a strong start to the season. The 23-year-old, who broke numerous records as a junior, recently ran the third-fastest time in British history, signaling a return to form after years plagued by injuries and bad luck. Burgin's career had previously stalled while his contemporary, Keely Hodgkinson, achieved global success, but he now feels he is back on the right trajectory. He must first secure his spot at this weekend's UK Athletics Championships in Birmingham.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A forthcoming UK Supreme Court ruling could allow millions of motorists to claim compensation for being mis-sold car finance deals. The court is deciding whether to uphold a finding that hidden commission payments made by lenders to car dealers were unlawful. These "discretionary commission arrangements," where dealers were incentivized to secure higher interest rates, were banned in 2021, but the new ruling could apply more broadly. Lenders like Lloyds have set aside billions in anticipation of potential payouts, which could rival the scale of the past payment protection insurance (PPI) scandal. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new UK law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect, banning the sale, possession, and importation of ninja swords. Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, campaigned relentlessly for the law after her son was killed in a case of mistaken identity by a teenager who had easily purchased the weapon online. The law, known as Ronan's Law, also requires retailers to report suspicious knife orders and perform strict age verification. A month-long surrender scheme ahead of the ban saw over 1,000 of the weapons removed from the streets.</p>
