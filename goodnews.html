          <p>The Vera Rubin Observatory in Chile, equipped with the world's largest digital camera, has released its first images of star nurseries and galaxies. These images showcase distant objects with unprecedented clarity, marking a significant milestone for the observatory. The observatory will begin its Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) later this year, conducting highly precise scans of the night sky every day for a decade. The project will track asteroids and spot interstellar objects, and the observatory is named after Vera C. Rubin, whose research provided evidence for the existence of dark matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have discovered the first evidence suggesting that subatomic particles from cosmic rays may impact the efficiency of error correction techniques in quantum computing. By monitoring superconducting quantum chips alongside muons produced by cosmic rays, they observed quasiparticle bursts leading to correlated errors. The findings could be significant for scaling quantum processors and designing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems. The team proposes that their detection method could also be applied in cosmic ray and dark matter particle detection, opening new avenues for research.</p>

          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their gross domestic product (GDP), as the U.S. pushes for greater financial commitment. This increase is driven by ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East. While some member states are close to or willing to meet the target, others lag behind the previously agreed 2% threshold. The success of these pledges hinges on whether member states follow through with concrete action, which the U.S. and President Trump are keen to see (not investment advice).</p>
