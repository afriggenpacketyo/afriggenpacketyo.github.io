          <p>Residents of Riverton, Wyoming, are building a new community hospital after feeling that their existing hospital, acquired by a private equity firm, had deteriorated in quality and services. The town secured a $37 million loan from the USDA to fund the project, offering services that had been cut by the private equity-owned hospital. This effort challenges the conventional wisdom that private equity is the only option for struggling rural hospitals, highlighting the importance of local control and investment in community health.
