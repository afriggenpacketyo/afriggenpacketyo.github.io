He discussed the strategic importance of the Alaska LNG Project for supplying energy to Asian allies and asserted that resource development can coexist with high environmental standards, benefiting local communities. Sullivan also highlighted the growing military and strategic significance of the Arctic, praising recent investments in the Coast Guard and missile defense to counter Russian and Chinese activities in the region.

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by over 10,000 flight attendants that caused widespread cancellations. The government invoked the Canada Labour Code to force both the airline and the union into binding arbitration, extending the previous collective agreement until a new one is settled. The flight attendants' union, which is seeking higher wages and pay for on-ground work, accused the government of violating workers' rights by caving to corporate pressure instead of allowing negotiations to proceed.</p>

          <p>A former software company owner has completed a challenging, multi-year renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. Purchased for £555,000 in 2017, the historic building had been abandoned for 17 years and lacked basic utilities like running water and electricity. After a nearly five-year, £3 million transformation, the 100-man fort is now a fully equipped venue with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, ready to host parties and events once again.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink has revealed that creating vision boards was a key part of her mental strategy for recovering from a torn ACL. The practice, which involves making a collage of personal and professional goals, helped her maintain a positive outlook and manifest her comeback during the grueling 13-month rehabilitation process. Encouraged by veteran teammate Dearica Hamby, Brink focused on visualizing her success both on and off the court, which she believes was crucial for managing the anxiety and pressure associated with a major injury and her return to the WNBA.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was dramatically rescued after being trapped for two days in a cave behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. The man, an experienced climber, was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when extreme water pressure pushed him off his lines and into the precarious spot. After an extensive search involving aircraft and drones, rescuers located him alive and conscious. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew successfully hoisted him to safety, concluding what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges offer a completely tuition-free education. This article identifies nine such schools, including Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and the five U.S. service academies (Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Merchant Marine). While these institutions eliminate the financial burden of tuition, they are typically highly selective and require students to participate in work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to discover that his trail camera had captured an image of a brown bear, a species long considered extinct in the country. This rare sighting, along with another recent spotting of a bear cub, suggests the large predators may be returning to the local ecosystem.

          <p>The NoMa (North of Massachusetts Avenue) neighborhood in Washington, D.C., once an industrial zone known as "Swampoodle," has transformed into one of America's most prominent examples of "YIMBY" (Yes In My Back Yard) development. Through extensive redevelopment over the past two decades, the area has seen a massive increase in housing construction, becoming a dense, transit-oriented community. This rapid growth showcases a pro-development approach that many urbanists advocate for as a solution to housing shortages in major cities.</p>
