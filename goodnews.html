          <p>President Trump reported that Iran launched a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, but stated that no Americans were hurt and there was minimal damage. According to Trump, Iran fired 14 missiles, 13 of which were intercepted by the U.S. and Qatar, with the remaining missile deemed non-threatening. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the attack, which allowed for the prevention of casualties. He expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region and encouraged Israel to pursue the same. This incident followed U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and marked a retaliatory response from Iran, prompting international concern and diplomatic efforts to de-escalate tensions. </p>

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties. U.S. crude oil decreased by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while global benchmark Brent fell by 7.18% to $71.48. The price drop indicates investors' belief that the conflict may de-escalate after President Trump's actions against Iran. Some analysts suggest that Trump's strategy is to escalate in order to de-escalate, with the hope that Iran will not take further action. Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, which helped prevent casualties. </p>

          <p>Comedian B. Simone tearfully revealed the financial challenges of building her "legacy," stating that she doesn't have the disposable income she's used to due to investing in her lifestyle app, LTTA. She mentioned budgeting more carefully and shopping at H&M instead of Bloomingdale's. The LTTA app, aimed at women, focuses on faith, encouragement, and entertainment, costing users $9.99 monthly or $71.88 annually. B. Simone emphasized that she is investing in something with longevity rather than seeking a quick return, and her comments sparked social media backlash, with some criticizing her remarks about H&M and past preferences for entrepreneurial men. Despite the criticism, B. Simone continues to promote her app and upcoming travel plans. </p>

          <p>Miley Cyrus shared how Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy helped her overcome stage fright. EMDR is a mental health therapy method used to treat conditions resulting from past traumas, particularly PTSD. During treatment, patients move their eyes in a specific way while recalling traumatic memories, creating new healing pathways. The method relies on the Adaptive Information Processing (AIP) model, which describes how the brain stores memories. Cyrus described her experience as watching a movie of her life while on a train, which allowed her to process and release anxiety associated with performing. </p>

          <p>Super Micro Computer shares fell about 10% after announcing plans to offer $2 billion in convertible notes maturing in 2030.

Despite the recent drop, Super Micro shares are up nearly 40% in 2025, driven by strong demand for Nvidia's AI processors.
