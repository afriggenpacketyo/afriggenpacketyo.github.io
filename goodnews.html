          <p>Siarhei Tsikhanouski, a prominent Belarusian opposition leader, was released from prison after being incarcerated since 2020 by Alexander Lukashenko's regime. His release coincided with a visit from U.S. Special Envoy for Ukraine, General Keith Kellogg, who was in Minsk to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Tsikhanouski's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, expressed gratitude to the U.S. for its efforts in securing his release. Tsikhanouski, originally intending to challenge Lukashenko for the presidency, was imprisoned before the election, leading his wife to run in his place.</p>

          <p>A brutal heat wave is expected to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures. The National Weather Service has issued extreme heat alerts for over 140 million Americans, with the total number affected rising to 200 million when including heat advisories. Potential daily record highs are forecast for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures reaching well into the 90s in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. Officials are urging residents to stay indoors, use air conditioning, and remain hydrated to avoid heat-related illnesses during the prolonged period of extreme heat.</p>

          <h2>US Sunscreens Less Effective Than International Options Amid Heatwave</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 10:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a severe heatwave impacts the US, experts warn that American sunscreens may be less effective than those available overseas, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. Regulatory differences, where sunscreen is classified as an over-the-counter drug rather than a cosmetic, have limited the approval of new UV-filtering ingredients. While US sunscreens effectively block UVB rays, their UVA protection lags behind products in Europe and South Korea. A bipartisan bill in Congress aims to modernize sunscreen regulations, but dermatologists stress the importance of using broad-spectrum sunscreens with SPF 30 or higher for adequate protection.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has blocked a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. The court deemed the law unconstitutional, siding with civil liberties groups that argued it violates the separation of church and state. Republican backers of the law claimed the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana's Attorney General plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking the case to the Supreme Court, setting up a significant legal battle over the role of religion in public education.</p>

          <p>A relationship expert suggests that couples should take a compatibility test to avoid deal-breakers in the future. The expert and her husband started their relationship by creating a list of questions based on relationship science to assess their compatibility. Unlike generic questions found on dating apps, these questions are tailored to the specific couple's needs and circumstances. Focusing on key themes and open communication can help couples determine whether they are truly compatible and avoid potential issues down the road.</p>

          <p>Air conditioning is essential to the modern world, despite its environmental impact. It saves lives by preventing heat-related deaths, keeps people productive at work and school, and helps people sleep better. Air conditioning has also enabled the development of industries like movies and microchips, and allows people to live and travel in otherwise uninhabitable climates. While air conditioning is not perfect, it is a necessary adaptation tool in an ever-warming world, and we should strive for better, more efficient units powered by cleaner electricity.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, who had been struggling with heart failure for years and had a LVAD implanted, underwent a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant to address her high antibody levels. Faced with limited options, Baker agreed to the experimental procedure, which involved receiving a new heart and liver from the same donor. The surgery was successful in reducing her antibody levels, and she became a donor herself by donating her healthy liver to another patient. Her case has paved the way for similar surgeries, offering hope to other patients with complex medical conditions.</p>
