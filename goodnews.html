          <p>Novo Nordisk shares experienced a boost after the company announced that sales of its weight loss drug, Wegovy, are expected to improve in the latter half of the year due to a decrease in the availability of compounded alternatives. First-quarter sales of Wegovy fell slightly below analyst expectations due to the presence of copycat drugs in the U.S. market. However, the FDA's decision to remove the drug shortage ruling, which allowed compounding pharmacies to make legal copies, is anticipated to boost sales for Novo Nordisk.</p>

          <p>A new development in far-UVC technology, specifically secondary harmonics, could make it significantly cheaper to produce lamps that can kill airborne pathogens without harming humans. A startup called Uviquity has found a way to create far-UVC light by shooting a blue laser through aluminum nitrate crystals, potentially leading to widespread adoption of this technology in public spaces. While the effects of far-UVC on air quality are still being researched, preliminary studies suggest that it can be used safely in moderation, paving the way for a future where airborne diseases are significantly reduced.</p>

          <p>Arsene Wenger, former Arsenal manager, has proposed a change to the offside rule to increase goal-scoring in football, suggesting that a player should only be considered offside if their entire body is beyond the last defender. This proposed adjustment is inspired by a similar rule change implemented after the 1990 World Cup, which resulted in more attacking play and goals. Wenger believes this tweak could help restore the balance between attackers and defenders, particularly with the precision of VAR.</p>
