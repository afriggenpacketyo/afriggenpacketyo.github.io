        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the diverse strategies adopted by retailers Abercrombie & Fitch, Best Buy, and Five Below to counter the impact of U.S. tariffs. Abercrombie & Fitch utilizes a diversified supply chain and internal cost controls, while Best Buy front-loaded goods in anticipation of potential strikes and has a less China-reliant supply. Five Below, despite high exposure to Chinese imports, maintains flexibility with its product assortment, allowing it to adapt to price changes. These distinct approaches highlight how different business models and product types influence tariff mitigation, with industry experts forecasting increased pressure in the coming months and potential price increases for consumers.

The company also tightened its full-year sales guidance and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards, signaling improved financial health. Interim CEO Michael Bender acknowledged challenges from value-seeking customers but highlighted ongoing initiatives to revitalize the brand, including reintroducing popular sections, expanding product categories, and refining discount strategies. These positive results provide a much-needed boost for Kohl's, which has recently grappled with leadership changes and consistent revenue declines, indicating potential progress in its turnaround efforts.

          <h2>Historical Analogies to Rome Misused in Modern Politics, Expert Argues</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article, featuring an interview with renowned classicist Mary Beard, critically examines the pervasive and often misinformed use of historical comparisons, particularly with ancient Rome, in contemporary political discourse. The discussion emphasizes that while history provides valuable context, simplistic analogies to Roman decline or strongmen are insufficient for understanding modern phenomena like the re-emergence of fascism. Beard highlights significant differences, such as ancient Rome's lack of statistical data or a concept of "economy," which fundamentally distinguish its challenges from those faced by modern democracies. The article advocates for a deeper, more analytical engagement with the past, alongside upholding ideals of liberty and equality, and even humor, to address current political issues.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a locked guesthouse room in Sichuan province. Unable to open the malfunctioning door from the inside and without her phone, she resorted to biting her finger and writing "110 625" (emergency number and room number) in her own blood on a pillow. She then threw the pillow out the sixth-floor window, where it was spotted by a food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, who promptly alerted the police. This harrowing ordeal and the quick thinking of both Zhou and the delivery driver led to her eventual liberation and Zhang receiving a reward for his good samaritan act.</p>

          <p>Scientists have announced the discovery of Spicomellus afer, a peculiar new species of armored dinosaur from Morocco, characterized by meter-long spikes extending from its neck. This "punk rocker" dinosaur, dating back 165 million years, represents the oldest known ankylosaur and is unique for its armor being fused directly to the bone, a trait unprecedented in other animals, living or extinct. The extraordinary nature of this find is prompting experts to reconsider current theories on how armored dinosaurs evolved, suggesting that their elaborate defensive structures might have initially served for display before becoming functional body armor against large predators. This significant paleontological discovery offers fresh insights into dinosaur evolution.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in sales growth for its fiscal second quarter, with the Abercrombie brand experiencing a decline. However, the company surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, largely driven by a robust 19% growth in its Hollister brand. Consequently, Abercrombie raised its full-year revenue outlook, indicating optimism for its future performance. The article highlights the company's strategic initiatives to re-energize the Abercrombie brand through new product categories and significant partnerships, such as becoming the NFL's inaugural "official fashion partner." Despite these efforts, the retailer anticipates increased tariff costs, reflecting the complex interplay of market trends and external economic pressures in the retail industry.

          <p>China has substantially escalated its funding for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), with investments and construction contracts totaling $124 billion in the first half of 2025, exceeding the entirety of 2024's figures. This increased capital is predominantly channeled into Central Asia, notably Kazakhstan, which attracted $23 billion, including a significant $12 billion aluminum complex. This strategic reorientation, where funding in Europe, East Asia, and the Middle East has decreased, is influenced by China's domestic economic pressures and shifting global trade dynamics.

          <p>Google is awaiting a landmark federal ruling that could terminate its highly profitable default search contracts, potentially forfeiting over $26 billion annually, with Apple as a primary beneficiary. While this presents a significant financial challenge, some analysts suggest that being unburdened from these expensive agreements could paradoxically accelerate Google's investment and growth in artificial intelligence platforms like Gemini. The ongoing antitrust case has already determined Google's monopoly in search, with remedies aiming to stimulate competition, although experts acknowledge Google's market dominance is robust. This article delves into the intricate consequences of regulatory actions on major tech companies, indicating a potential reshaping of market strategies and a push towards AI innovation.

          <p>Germany's cabinet has approved a new voluntary service bill designed to significantly increase the Bundeswehr's active personnel to 260,000 and reservists to 200,000 by the early 2030s. This initiative responds to heightened security threats and NATO commitments. While military service remains voluntary, the legislation introduces a mandatory questionnaire for all 18-year-old men, followed by compulsory medical examinations from July 2027, even for those opting out. The plan aims to attract recruits through improved salaries and benefits. However, conservative lawmakers and military associations voice skepticism about achieving these targets without reintroducing full conscription, reflecting ongoing debate about Germany's defense capabilities and recruitment challenges.</p>
