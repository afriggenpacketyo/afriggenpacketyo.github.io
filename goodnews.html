The fourth ministerial meeting of the China-Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (Celac) Forum highlighted infrastructure as a key area of engagement for Beijing. President Xi Jinping emphasized China's role as a "good friend and partner" to Latin American and Caribbean nations, offering a substantial credit line to support development.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on a patient's spine through her eye. The patient, Karla Flores, was initially diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, but an MRI revealed a second tumor on her spinal cord. Dr. Mohamed Labib developed a unique surgical plan, approaching the tumor through the side of Flores' eye in a procedure he called the "third nostril" approach. The surgery was successful, and Flores is now cancer-free, although she continues to undergo rehabilitative therapy.</p>
