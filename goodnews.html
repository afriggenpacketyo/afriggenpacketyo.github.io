          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to bolster its domestic market to reduce its vulnerability to external economic shocks, particularly those stemming from trade tensions with the United States. Premier Li Qiang emphasized the importance of strengthening "domestic circulation" to enhance the country's economic self-reliance and create a unified internal market. This strategy aims to leverage China's internal stability and long-term growth potential to counteract global uncertainties. Analysts suggest that the focus on domestic demand reflects a realization that China can no longer depend primarily on exports for economic growth, given the increasing trend of deglobalization.</p>

          <p>Richemont, the owner of Cartier, reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, indicating that affluent consumers are continuing to spend despite global economic uncertainties. The Swiss luxury group's revenue increased by 7% year-on-year, driven by strong growth in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced a sales decline, overall annual sales rose by 4%, slightly ahead of analyst expectations. Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require continued agility and discipline, while BofA Global Research highlighted potential headwinds such as gold prices and currency fluctuations, but noted that the company's pricing power could offset some of these challenges.</p>

          <p>In a medical first, a 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, has been successfully treated with a custom gene-editing therapy. Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia administered an infusion designed to correct the baby's specific mutation, offering hope for treating thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. This innovative approach, which relies on pinpoint targeting using CRISPR technology, bypasses traditional drug development timelines and costs, potentially revolutionizing healthcare. The treatment has allowed the baby to thrive and reach developmental milestones, marking a significant advancement in personalized medicine and demonstrating the potential of gene editing to transform healthcare.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is revisiting the assisted dying bill, considering significant revisions after its initial passage in the Commons last November. The bill, which would legalize assisted dying for terminally ill adults in England and Wales, has undergone intense scrutiny and numerous amendments, including the removal of the requirement for High Court judge approval. Recent government changes to its impact assessment have sparked criticism, with some MPs describing the process as "chaotic." Despite the controversy, supporters of the bill argue that it is coming back to the Commons "even stronger" and represents a crucial opportunity to address the needs of dying individuals and their families.</p>

The company began testing these meditation exercises with select teens earlier this year and is now making them available to users of all ages. The meditation feature, designed to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" for users under 18. This initiative comes amid increasing public pressure and legal challenges related to the platform's alleged addictive nature and psychological damage to young users.</p>

          <p>An extensive genetic analysis has traced the longest human migration from Asia to the Americas, shedding light on the prehistoric human expansion that shaped the genetic landscape of the Western Hemisphere. The study indicates that Native Americans are descendants of Asian populations, particularly from the West Beringian region. Early migrants to South America formed distinct groups that remained isolated due to environmental conditions. This research, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could provide new insights into disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations, who have faced significant population declines.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April as investors shifted away from U.S. markets, influenced by President Donald Trump's trade policies. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of equities and long-term bonds, marking the largest net inflows for a calendar month since Japan's finance ministry began collecting data in 1996. However, as the U.S. softens its trade stance and strikes deals, confidence in U.S. assets is being restored, which may impact the future appeal of Japanese assets. Japanese assets are generally considered a haven, whose appeal rose as the "sell-U.S." narrative gained ground in April, said Rashmi Garg, senior portfolio manager at Al Dhabi Capital.

          <p>The Japanese parliament has enacted a law to allow preemptive acts of cyberdefense, granting the government the ability to monitor communications data during peacetime and neutralize hostile servers in the event of an attack. The "active cyberdefense" law will require operators of key infrastructure, such as those in the electricity and railway sectors, to report cyber breaches to the government. The move reflects the country's ambition to enhance its cybersecurity capacity to levels on par with the United States and major European nations.
