          <p>Poland is holding a crucial presidential election runoff between Warsaw's mayor, Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, and Karol Nawrocki, a conservative challenger supported by President Trump. Nawrocki, endorsed by figures like DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, aims to counter the current government's liberal politics, while Trzaskowski is backed by the current prime minister, Donald Tusk, and favors closer ties with the EU. The election's outcome could significantly impact Poland's relationship with the U.S. and the EU, as well as its domestic policies, with the president holding veto power over legislation. Despite differing views on foreign policy, both candidates are expected to maintain Poland's support for Ukraine in its conflict against Russia.</p>

          <p>Algerian Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until she undergoes mandatory genetic sex testing, a new requirement introduced by the organization. This decision follows controversy surrounding Khelif's eligibility after she won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics, fueled by prior claims from the IBA that she failed unspecified eligibility tests. World Boxing will require athletes to take a PCR genetic test to determine their sex at birth, aiming to ensure safety and competitive fairness. Mandatory testing procedures are set to begin on July 1, 2025, reflecting the organization's commitment to respecting the dignity of all individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are often used to convey pithy meaning, but studies show they can impede trust and create insecurity among employees. Gen Zers, who are accustomed to instant answers, may cling to jargon as a way to navigate workplace culture. Research suggests that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. While buzzwords are intended to create a culture of inclusion, they can actually distract from the core purpose of making money. The article suggests using real-human-people words instead of relying on metaphors and jargon.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a major strategic defense review, addressing a "new, dangerous era" marked by a resurgent Russia and increasing global instability. The review will emphasize the importance of nuclear weapons, NATO commitments, and modernizing the armed forces, with a focus on technology and cyber defense. There are also suggestions of a new civilian force to protect critical infrastructure, reflecting a "whole society approach" to national resilience. While the review aims to be transformative, some critics suggest its impact may be limited, with specific details on spending and procurement expected later in the year.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults suggests parents should follow their instincts, culture, and their children's interests, rather than overcomplicating parenting with too much information. She emphasizes the importance of enjoyment over strict developmental milestones and encourages parents to be their real selves, rather than striving for an unattainable ideal. The most important thing children need is love and attention, and creating a joyful and relaxed environment is key to their development. Mathilde Ross believes that every generation of parents faces unique challenges, but they always get through it.</p>
