          <p>President Trump has unveiled a 20-point proposal aimed at ending the conflict in Gaza, which includes ending the war, returning hostages, and establishing a pathway toward Palestinian self-government. The plan has garnered support from the EU, key Arab states, and the Palestinian Authority, with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu also offering qualified praise. However, its success faces significant hurdles, primarily securing Hamas's agreement to demilitarize and ensuring Netanyahu adheres to the deal amid pressure from his far-right coalition, requiring sustained diplomatic pressure from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Spirit Airlines informed a bankruptcy court that it is making "massive progress" in its Chapter 11 restructuring efforts. The budget carrier has secured agreements for up to $475 million in new financing and an additional $150 million from aircraft lessor AerCap, subject to court approval. As part of its cost-cutting strategy, Spirit plans to reject leases on 27 Airbus aircraft, many of which are grounded due to engine defects, and is also cutting routes and seeking financial concessions from its pilots' union to stabilize its operations.</p>

          <p>A recent rebound in Wall Street dealmaking is creating a bullish outlook for Goldman Sachs, highlighted by its advisory role in the historic $55 billion leveraged buyout of Electronic Arts. This trend is further supported by competitor Jefferies posting record third-quarter advisory revenue, indicating a strong environment for mergers and acquisitions. After a period of stagnation caused by higher interest rates and economic uncertainty, the revival of M&A and IPO activity is expected to significantly boost Goldman's crucial investment banking revenue stream.

In exchange for these price reductions and a $70 billion investment in U.S. facilities, Pfizer's products will be exempt from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs for three years, a model the administration hopes to replicate with other drugmakers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has ruled that top Trump administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, violated the First Amendment. The judge found they unconstitutionally targeted international pro-Palestinian students for deportation in order to suppress protected political speech and instill fear. In a searing 161-page decision, the Reagan-appointed judge condemned the actions as a "truly scandalous" misuse of power and a grave threat to freedom of speech, accusing the officials of acting with "invidious" intent.</p>
