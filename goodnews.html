          <p>Following a controversial incident where the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking system was accidentally deactivated during a key match, Wimbledon has implemented changes to prevent a recurrence. The All England Lawn Tennis Club confirmed the issue was "operator error" and has now removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system. The incident occurred during a fourth-round match, leading to a disputed point that had to be replayed. While the umpire followed existing protocols, the modification aims to ensure the technological system's integrity and avoid future human-induced failures.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining attractive, savers are debating whether to lock in funds with short-term or long-term Certificates of Deposit (CDs). Financial experts suggest that one-year CDs currently offer flexibility, allowing investors to reassess their options when the Federal Reserve likely cuts rates in the next 12 to 18 months. However, they also caution that while short-term rates may be higher now, renewal rates could be disappointing later. The consensus is that the best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, timeline, and need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Although the United States Men's National Team lost the Concacaf Gold Cup final 2-1 to Mexico, the tournament revealed significant positive developments for the squad's future. Competing with what was largely considered a "B-team," the US rediscovered its fighting spirit and showcased new talent that could challenge established players for roster spots ahead of the 2026 World Cup. Players like Diego Luna and Matt Freese emerged as strong contributors, creating new depth and internal competition. While the loss was painful, the team's growth and renewed energy provided a sense of optimism.</p>

          <p>Apple has formally appealed a 500 million euro fine imposed by the European Union, calling the penalty "unprecedented." The fine was issued after the European Commission found that Apple's App Store policies violated the new Digital Markets Act (DMA) by unfairly restricting developers from informing users about cheaper offers outside the app. Apple argues that the EU is mandating its business terms in a way that is confusing for developers and harmful to users. This appeal marks the latest chapter in the ongoing regulatory battle between major tech companies and European authorities over market competition.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to extend statutory bereavement leave to include parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated that no one should have to return to work before they are ready after such a loss. The proposed change, which is now under consultation, would provide at least one week of unpaid leave and has been praised by campaigners as a significant step in recognizing early pregnancy loss as a true bereavement.</p>

Having gone through IVF herself, Costa understood the anxiety and difficulty of self-injecting complex medications. She began offering the service to her own clients after hours, helping more than 15 women who have since had successful pregnancies. Costa is now working with a fertility clinic to potentially expand this service, aiming to reduce a significant barrier for couples undergoing infertility treatments.</p>

          <p>A recent incident where Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton's staff had to walk back her public comments has reignited a debate among Capitol Hill journalists about how to report on elderly lawmakers. Reporters are questioning the ethics and newsworthiness of publishing confusing or incoherent statements that are later corrected by aides. While some believe it's their job to report on a lawmaker's performance and mental acuity, others worry it can create confusing news cycles or that they are pulling punches to maintain access. This issue reflects a broader challenge in covering an increasingly gerontocratic Washington D.C.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following public apologies from corporate leaders, communication experts are highlighting the key elements of an effective apology from a boss. They stress that timing is critical; leaders should acknowledge a situation quickly but follow up with a thoughtful, concrete plan of action. A successful apology requires taking full responsibility, showing genuine empathy, and sounding human rather than reading from a script. Using recent examples, experts note that a failure to demonstrate vulnerability and a clear path forward can erode trust and damage company morale, as people want to hear from a person, not a brand.</p>
