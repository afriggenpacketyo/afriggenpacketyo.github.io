        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Trump administration official Kari Lake cannot unilaterally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America. The ruling states that by law, such a removal requires the backing of a congressional advisory panel, which President Trump has effectively dismantled by dismissing most of its members. Judge Royce C. Lamberth found that Lake's efforts to remove Abramowitz did not comply with statutory requirements designed to insulate the broadcaster from political pressure. The decision comes amid broader concerns about Lake's actions to significantly reduce the scope and workforce of the international news agency.</p>

          <p>Naomi Osaka demonstrated growing confidence by advancing to the third round of the US Open with a decisive 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste. This performance helps her move past a difficult experience in Montreal, where she reached her first major final since returning from maternity leave but faced criticism for her runner-up speech. Osaka expressed that she felt shame after the Montreal final but has since refocused, putting herself in a strong position for a deep run in the tournament. She is now set to face either Daria Kasatkina or Kamilla Rakhimova as she aims to reach a Grand Slam fourth round for the first time since 2021.</p>

          <p>ESPN has announced changes to its lead NBA broadcast crew for the upcoming season, promoting analyst Tim Legler to join Mike Breen, Richard Jefferson, and Lisa Salters. This team will now call the NBA Finals and other major games, with Legler taking a spot previously held by Doris Burke. Burke, a pioneering analyst, has signed a multi-year contract extension and will transition to a new role, calling a full schedule of regular season and playoff games alongside announcer Dave Pasch. The move elevates Legler, a former player and longtime ESPN analyst, while shifting Burke from the top broadcast booth.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has denied Saudi Arabia's motion to dismiss a lawsuit, allowing families of 9/11 victims to continue their legal action against the kingdom. The long-running lawsuit alleges that members of the Saudi government provided material support to some of the al Qaeda hijackers involved in the 2001 terrorist attacks. The judge's ruling found that the plaintiffs have provided reasonable evidence regarding the roles played by individuals with alleged ties to the Saudi government in assisting two of the hijackers. This decision, enabled by the 2016 Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, paves the way for the case to potentially proceed to trial.</p>

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner continued his dominant run at hard-court Grand Slams, defeating Alexei Popyrin 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 to reach the third round of the US Open. This victory marks his 23rd consecutive match win at a hard-court major, a streak that includes his title at Flushing Meadows last year and two Australian Open championships. Despite the clinical victory, Sinner expressed a desire to improve his first-serve percentage, which was lower than he preferred. The defending champion now looks ahead to his next match against Canadian Denis Shapovalov as he continues his quest for a third major title of the year.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that as Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto cracks down on illegal palm oil plantations, global demand, particularly from China, plays a crucial role in the industry's future. Indonesia is currently reclaiming millions of hectares of forest lost to illegal operations, which have caused significant environmental damage. The author suggests that palm oil is not just a commodity but a reflection of global consumption patterns, where economic growth is often achieved at the cost of ecological destruction. By leveraging its position as a major consumer, China could help influence Indonesia towards more sustainable and responsible palm oil production practices.</p>

          <p>In a blockbuster trade, the Dallas Cowboys have sent two-time All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers following a prolonged and public contract dispute. In conjunction with the trade, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The deal, which includes $136 million guaranteed, ends a standoff with Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who had refused to negotiate with Parsons' agent. In return for the 26-year-old defensive star, Dallas will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom announced the expansion of special California Highway Patrol (CHP) crime suppression teams to work with local law enforcement in major cities across the state. While touting that overall crime numbers are down, Newsom acknowledged that public perception is key and that more work is needed. The announcement is seen as a direct contrast to President Trump's threats to use military forces to address local crime, with Newsom emphasizing that his approach is collaborative with local leaders, not imposed upon them. The governor highlighted the success of previous CHP surge operations in cities like Oakland and San Bernardino.</p>

          <p>Amid rising levels of employee burnout, a lifestyle expert suggests workers can reduce stress by focusing on channeling their energy and setting clear boundaries. Maisha Wynn, author of "The Wynning Way," advises using the first few hours of the workday for high-demand tasks and saving simpler activities like returning emails for later when energy wanes. She also recommends building "micro routines," such as doodling or listening to music, to create small moments of joy and relief at the desk. A key strategy to avoid burnout is learning to say "no" when necessary, prioritizing one's own well-being to be effective for others.</p>

          <p>Meme del Real, the longtime vocalist and keyboardist for the iconic Mexican rock band Café Tacvba, is releasing his first solo album, born from a period of introspection and creative surrender.

The resulting album is sonically diverse, blending electronic soundscapes with traditional Latin genres like bolero and norteña, reflecting a playful and experimental approach. Del Real describes the process as transformative, a moment where the music simply "arrived" and he felt compelled to follow its lead.</p>

          <p>Large, gelatinous blobs that have been spotted in U.S. lakes, sparking curiosity and some alarm, have been identified by wildlife officials as magnificent bryozoans. These strange-looking masses are not single organisms but colonies made up of thousands of tiny, filter-feeding invertebrates called zooids. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service explained that these ancient creatures, which have existed for over 480 million years, are harmless and actually beneficial to their freshwater ecosystems. They play a role in cleaning the water by capturing and consuming plankton as they drift in slow-moving rivers and lakes.</p>

          <p>Best Buy reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its second quarter, but the company maintained its cautious full-year forecast due to uncertainty surrounding potential tariffs. The consumer electronics retailer saw its comparable sales rise 1.6%, the highest growth in three years, driven by strong sales in mobile phones and video gaming, including the new Nintendo Switch 2. However, the company noted that shoppers remain deal-focused and hesitant about big-ticket purchases like appliances. CEO Corie Barry stated that while the company is confident in its plans, it is prudent to maintain current guidance given the unpredictable impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
