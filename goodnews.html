          <p>Ali Riley, the 37-year-old captain of New Zealand's national soccer team and Angel City FC, is retiring after a distinguished career that included five World Cups and four Olympics. Her decision follows a challenging year marked by a chronic nerve injury, IVF treatments, and the loss of her childhood home in a fire. Riley reflects on being inspired by the 1999 Women's World Cup and speaks candidly about the physical and emotional toll of her injury, which ultimately made continuing her career untenable. She plans to remain involved in women's sports, advocating for better support for players navigating parenthood and injuries.</p>

          <p>Paxos, the blockchain firm that partners with PayPal, experienced a significant "technical error" when it mistakenly minted $300 trillion worth of the PayPal PYUSD stablecoin. The company stated that the error occurred during an internal transfer and was quickly identified and rectified by "burning" the excess tokens within about 20 minutes. Paxos assured the public that no security breach occurred and that customer funds remained safe. The incident highlights the operational risks in the digital currency space, as the erroneously created amount far exceeds the total global GDP. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>French Prime Minister Sebastien Lecornu has survived the first of two no-confidence votes in parliament, securing his government's immediate future. The motion, brought by the hard-left France Unbowed party, failed to achieve the necessary 289 votes to pass. Lecornu's strategic promise to suspend President Emmanuel Macron's controversial pension reform until after the 2027 election was key to gaining enough support to defeat the measure. While the government remains in place, the narrow victory underscores the political fragility of Macron's administration in a divided National Assembly.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third quarter, with net profits increasing by 39.1% year-over-year, significantly beating market estimates. The surge is attributed to sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strength of the AI market, the company raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure. The strong performance of Asia's largest tech company signals continued momentum in the global semiconductor industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Nestle experienced a significant jump, rising nearly 9%, after the company announced it would cut 16,000 jobs as part of a new efficiency-focused strategy under CEO Philipp Navratil. The market's positive reaction reflects investor confidence that the move will streamline operations and accelerate the company's turnaround. The company also reported better-than-expected organic growth in the third quarter, further boosting investor sentiment. The stock surge suggests that Wall Street views the painful restructuring as a necessary step to improve Nestle's long-term financial health and performance. (not investment advice)</p>

The diplomatic outreach comes at a time of strained relations, marked by mistrust over the war in Ukraine, a large trade deficit, and ongoing trade frictions. Wang also held similar discussions with foreign ministers from Spain and Sweden, signaling a concerted effort by Beijing to improve ties with key European nations.</p>

          <p>The Bradford Bulls rugby league club will be promoted to the Super League for the 2026 season after an 11-year absence from the top flight. The club's promotion comes as a result of the sport's new grading system, under which they achieved a high Grade B status, surpassing several existing Super League teams. Conversely, the Salford Red Devils, who have faced significant financial difficulties, were given a lower grade and will be relegated from the league. The move marks a significant comeback for Bradford, a dominant force in the 2000s that has since endured financial turmoil.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying a process of programmed cell death in hopes of developing new treatments for diseases like Alzheimer's and cancer. The focus is on "death fold" proteins, which can trigger a cell to self-destruct when they detect a threat, a crucial function for the immune system. Scientists believe this mechanism may be mistakenly killing brain cells in neurodegenerative diseases, while it fails to activate in cancer cells. By understanding how to control this process, researchers hope to develop therapies that can either prevent healthy cells from dying or induce death in cancerous ones.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The proposal to make city buses free, a key platform for New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, has sparked a debate among urban transit advocates. Supporters argue that fare-free transit would increase ridership, improve equity, and speed up service by allowing all-door boarding. However, skeptics contend that the money would be better spent on improving the frequency and reliability of bus service, which research suggests are bigger priorities for riders than cost. The mixed results from cities like Kansas City, which is reinstating fares after failing to find a sustainable funding source, highlight the financial and logistical challenges of the concept.</p>

          <p>As health insurance premiums for employer-based plans are expected to surge next year, a small but growing number of U.S. companies are standing out by covering the full premium costs for their employees. Firms like Boston Consulting Group and startups like Zocdoc and Bartesian offer zero-premium plans, meaning workers have no deductions from their paychecks for health coverage. Executives at these companies state that while it is a significant investment, the benefit pays off by helping to recruit and retain top talent and keeping the workforce healthy and focused.

This cautious optimism was echoed by LVMH, the world's largest luxury group, which reported its first quarterly sales growth of the year. LVMH's CFO noted that consumption in mainland China is "getting close to stabilisation," with mid-to-high single-digit sales growth. However, a full recovery is still expected to take time due to the country's persistent property slump and high youth unemployment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing body of research indicates that women may need more sleep than men due to biological and hormonal differences. Studies suggest women may require an additional 20 minutes of sleep per night to support complex brain functions, and their sleep quality is significantly affected by the menstrual cycle. Beyond biology, societal factors such as the burden of domestic labor also contribute to women experiencing greater sleep debt. Experts note that while sleeping in on weekends can help alleviate tiredness, it may not fully reverse the accumulated health effects of chronic sleep deprivation.</p>
