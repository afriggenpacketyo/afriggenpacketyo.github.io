          <p>Ram Trucks plans to introduce an industry-leading warranty covering key components for 10 years or 100,000 miles on its 2026 vehicle lineup. This extended warranty, which replaces the current five-year or 60,000-mile coverage, aims to provide customers with greater peace of mind amid rising vehicle costs. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis emphasized that the new warranty reflects the increasing investment customers make in their vehicles, particularly pickup trucks.

          <p>A recent article explores the stereotype that straight men are bad at gossiping, examining the underlying reasons and potential consequences. Research suggests that men do gossip, both positively and negatively, but may not engage in neutral social talk as frequently as women. This lack of practice, combined with societal pressures and fears of appearing "messy," may contribute to men's perceived lack of skill in sharing and interpreting social information. The article suggests that improving men's ability to gossip could potentially address the growing male loneliness epidemic by fostering closer friendships and intimacy through shared storytelling.</p>

          <p>With the rise of tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty liabilities by strategically altering products to fit into preferred harmonized system codes. This practice involves modifying materials, dimensions, or compositions to qualify for lower tariff rates. While not inherently illegal, companies must tread carefully between redesigning products and fraudulently misrepresenting product classifications. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and adding fuzzy-felt fabric to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. (not investment advice)</p>
