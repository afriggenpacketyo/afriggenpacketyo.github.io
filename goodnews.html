          <h2>Brazil Deploys Bacteria-Infected Mosquitoes to Combat Dengue Fever</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 09:19:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by breeding and releasing millions of mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia bacteria to combat dengue fever. This innovative approach works because the bacteria prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside the mosquitoes, effectively stopping its transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói demonstrated remarkable success, reducing dengue cases by approximately 90% and also significantly lowering rates of Zika and chikungunya. The Brazilian government is now expanding this 'Wolbito' program nationwide, building new insect-rearing factories to protect millions from these debilitating diseases.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old man, is recovering after a life-saving double-lung transplant, a journey that began with an incidental finding on a pre-surgery X-ray. He was diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a terminal lung disease with no known cause, and was given less than a year to live. Initially resistant, Kennedy eventually agreed to the transplant and, after a month in the hospital, successfully received new lungs. Now with his lung capacity restored, he is resuming his life and his passion for training hospital therapy dogs, viewing his recovery as a profound second chance.</p>

          <p>For the first time in its 72-year history, the People's Liberation Army Naval Submarine Academy in China has recruited female students. Ten women, who all achieved top scores on their university entrance exams, were accepted into the prestigious military institution. The academy, founded in 1953, is responsible for training the personnel who operate China's submarine fleet. This historic move marks a significant development in the integration of women into all roles within the Chinese military, with one new recruit stating she wanted to dedicate herself to national defense.</p>

          <p>Despite being Hollywood's highest-paid actor at the time of his death in 1935, Will Rogers' true passion was being a cowboy, not a movie star, according to his great-granddaughter. Jennifer Rogers-Etcheverry states that Rogers viewed his film career primarily as a means to fund his other interests, such as traveling, ranching, and playing polo. He was known as a 'common man' who never lost touch with his Oklahoma roots, even while socializing with presidents and celebrities. His entertainment career began with trick-roping in a Wild West show before he became a beloved film star, author, and widely-read columnist.</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Venus Williams humorously remarked that she returned to professional competition to regain her health insurance benefits, highlighting a common struggle for many Americans. After a break from the sport, she lost her WTA-provided plan and was moved to a costly COBRA plan. The situation illustrates the deep connection between employment and healthcare in the U.S., where losing a job often means losing affordable coverage. Williams, who manages an autoimmune condition, underscores how even wealthy individuals navigate a complex system that, prior to the Affordable Care Act, could have left her uninsurable due to pre-existing conditions.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the life of Ozzy Osbourne, who died at 76, as a story of multiple, unexpected acts. After being fired from Black Sabbath for substance abuse, he launched a hugely successful solo career, though his life remained marked by infamous acts of recklessness. In a surprising turn, he became a beloved television personality on the MTV reality show 'The Osbournes,' revealing a bumbling, endearing side to the 'Prince of Darkness.' The article notes that even while battling Parkinson's, he reunited with Black Sabbath for a final show, cementing his legacy as anything but an ordinary man.</p>

          <p>Veteran relief pitcher Kenley Jansen, currently with the Los Angeles Angels, may be traded for the first time in his 21-year professional career as the MLB trade deadline approaches. With the Angels unlikely to make the playoffs, trading pending free agents like Jansen for future assets is a logical move. The Dodgers, his former team, are in need of right-handed relievers and could be a potential match. Jansen, who once thought he would be a Dodger for life, expressed that while he is close to the 500-save milestone, his primary goal is to win another World Series, even if it means pitching in a non-closer role.</p>

          <p>A growing number of couples are using credit cards to finance their weddings, a strategy that financial experts say can be beneficial if managed carefully. Using credit cards for large wedding purchases can help couples accumulate significant rewards points for things like a honeymoon, provided the balance is paid off immediately with existing savings. However, with the average wedding cost rising, experts warn against carrying this debt, as high interest rates can create financial stress early in a marriage. Couples should also be mindful of vendor processing fees and consider wedding insurance for broader protection.</p>
