          <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland's first black professor and chancellor emeritus at Heriot-Watt University, has died at the age of 85. Born in Jamaica, he moved to the UK as a teenager and became a renowned academic and human rights advocate, known for his invention of the barley abrasion process. His work led to the establishment of the International Centre for Brewing and Distilling, and he also served as leader of Edinburgh's Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group. Tributes have poured in from colleagues and political figures, highlighting his intellectual contributions and his role as a champion for justice and equality.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exporters Using Letters of Credit to Focus on Domestic Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 02:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the United States' imposition of tariffs on imports from China, Beijing has encouraged Chinese exporters to shift their focus to the domestic market. To facilitate this transition, Beijing is promoting the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs), a financial tool that guarantees payment to the seller. Domestic L/Cs, issued by major Chinese banks, help ensure payment security and enhance credit for Chinese firms, with a payment period generally of one year. Unlike international L/Cs, domestic ones can also be used in the trade of services.</p>

          <h2>India Aims to Develop Rare Earth Reserves as Alternative to China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 01:26:56 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth element (REE) supplies in response to China's restrictions on REE exports. Experts suggest that India could become a crucial alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require increased public and private investment in the sector. Auto manufacturers across India, the U.S., Japan, South Korea, and Germany have been affected by the shortage, prompting Indian officials to explore leveraging India Rare Earths to boost rare earth magnet production. The move is seen as an opportunity for deeper U.S.-India collaboration on future economic competitiveness.</p>

          <p>An expert at the World Gold Council stated that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, are not an alternative to gold and do not threaten its role as a safe-haven investment. The expert, John Reade, said that cryptocurrencies tend to move in tandem with equities, unlike gold, which typically acts as a hedge during market volatility. He stressed that these digital assets do not represent any risks or comparison to gold. Reade's comments come as market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies continues to grow, alongside a fresh rally in gold prices amid heightened Middle East tensions and a weakening US dollar.</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. continues to climb, reaching nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The report indicates that the average age of all mothers giving birth increased from 28.7 years old in 2016 to 29.6 in 2023. Several factors contribute to this trend, including changes in social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which have dropped from 11.8% of first births in 2016 to 8.7% in 2023.</p>
