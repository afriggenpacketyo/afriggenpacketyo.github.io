          <p>Ferrari is under scrutiny after a disappointing showing at the Miami Grand Prix, with questions arising about team orders and the car's overall performance. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledged the car's pace matched Red Bull and Mercedes during the race but cited poor grid positions as the main issue. The team struggled with new tires, leading to suboptimal qualifying results for Charles Leclerc and Lewis Hamilton. Vasseur remains optimistic about upcoming upgrades in Imola and Monaco, hoping stricter rules on front wing deflection will provide a performance reset. Ferrari aims to improve its car's speed and performance to compete with top teams like McLaren. </p>

          <p>Cincinnati Mayor Aftab Pureval faces two challengers in the city's nonpartisan primary, including Cory Bowman, the half-brother of Vice President JD Vance. Bowman, an evangelical pastor and coffee shop owner, and fellow Republican Brian Frank aim to challenge the incumbent Democrat in the heavily Democratic city. Bowman stated his desire to improve Cincinnati and was inspired by his half-brother's inauguration, but insists Vance is not his political advisor. Pureval, a former special assistant U.S. attorney, won the 2021 mayoral race with nearly 66% of the vote, and is considered a rising star in the Democratic party.</p>

          <p>Despite the closure of a trade loophole and the introduction of significant tariffs on Chinese goods, experts believe Temu and Shein will continue to be major players in the U.S. e-commerce market. Both companies are adopting localization strategies, such as onboarding American sellers and shifting to local warehouses, to mitigate the impact of the tariffs. While prices have increased, many experts remain confident that Temu and Shein will maintain competitive pricing due to their agile supply chains and ability to operate on thin margins. The success of these companies is also attributed to their ability to adapt quickly to consumer trends, making them formidable competitors to established e-commerce sites like Amazon.</p>

          <p>Japan's former Emperor Akihito has been admitted to a Tokyo hospital for a medical examination following an earlier checkup that revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. The 91-year-old will undergo a series of tests at the University of Tokyo Hospital, though he has not reported any symptoms related to the condition, which reduces blood flow to the heart muscles. This hospitalization marks the first time the former emperor has been admitted since 2012 when he underwent coronary-artery bypass surgery. In 2022, he received treatment for heart failure, and he abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to do so in around 200 years.</p>

In the past, these individuals often pursued lucrative business opportunities both in China and overseas during the country's rapid economic growth. However, stricter rules around officials and their families, as part of the anti-corruption drive, combined with a slowing economy, have made government jobs more appealing.
