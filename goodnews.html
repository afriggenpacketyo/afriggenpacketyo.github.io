          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping has urged intensified efforts to develop a unified domestic market, emphasizing its critical role in bolstering China's international competitiveness and achieving national development goals. In an article in the Communist Party's Qiushi journal, Xi outlined six key tasks, prioritizing measures to combat excessive cutthroat competition. He called for industry associations to guide companies towards improving product quality over price, and to oppose low-quality goods. This directive, stemming from a July commission meeting, also seeks to phase out obsolete industrial capacity and regulate market practices to foster a more robust and cohesive economic environment domestically.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite extensive floods and torrential downpours impacting vast agricultural areas, including Punjab's worst floods in 40 years, analysts predict a limited impact on India's inflation for fiscal year 2026. Forecasts suggest inflation will remain below the central bank's 4% midpoint target, primarily due to sufficient cereal stocks and contained food inflation. While consumer inflation rose to 2.1% in August, a cut in goods and services tax, effective September 22, is expected to mitigate further price increases. The Reserve Bank of India may consider further monetary easing to support growth amidst trade concerns with the U.S., reflecting a cautious but stable economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have established a "framework" agreement regarding the ownership of TikTok's U.S. operations, potentially leading to American control. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced the deal during trade talks in Madrid, with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to finalize terms on Friday. This development comes as a September 17 deadline loomed for TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. business or face a ban due to national security concerns. Oracle is reportedly among the firms that could facilitate TikTok's continued operation in the U.S., though details on algorithm control and data storage remain sparse, indicating ongoing complexities.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has hired Mike Liberatore, formerly the finance chief at Elon Musk's xAI, as its new business finance officer, tasked with managing the AI startup's substantial infrastructure spending. Liberatore's move, just three months after joining xAI, further intensifies the rivalry between OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Musk, who were once co-founders of OpenAI. This hiring follows OpenAI's recent restructuring into a for-profit entity and its valuation by investors at $500 billion. The company has significant compute commitments, including a $300 billion deal with Oracle, underscoring the scale of its operations and the aggressive competition within the burgeoning artificial intelligence sector.</p>

          <p>A group of teenagers in Bradford, UK, participated in a five-day challenge to remove all technology from their bedrooms, aiming to observe the effects on their daily lives and sleep patterns. The initiative, part of the BBC's Teen Summit, allowed tech use only in communal household areas. Participants, including 13-year-old Elizabeth and Henry, initially struggled with the absence of private screen time but reported unexpected benefits such as improved sleep, increased family interaction, and engagement in new hobbies like ballet and baking. The experiment highlights the pervasive role of technology in teen lives and potential advantages of setting boundaries for healthier development.</p>

          <p>Google's parent company, Alphabet, has announced a new £5 billion ($6.8 billion) investment in UK artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure and scientific research over the next two years. This substantial commitment is the first of several major U.S. investments expected before President Donald Trump's state visit. Google will open a $1 billion data center in Hertfordshire, designed for air-cooling and heat redeployment for local schools and homes, powered by 95% carbon-free energy from Shell. The investment underscores the UK's appeal for advanced science and Google's "AI First" strategy, despite global concerns about AI's energy consumption and potential job displacement in various sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are exploring the possibility of using star player Shohei Ohtani in a relief pitching role during the playoffs, in addition to his planned starts. President of baseball operations Andrew Friedman confirmed Ohtani is expected to be a starter but acknowledged unforeseen playoff scenarios could necessitate bullpen appearances, drawing parallels to Walker Buehler's 2024 postseason role. The decision is complicated by Ohtani's two-way status, as current MLB rules would mean losing him as a designated hitter if he enters a game as a reliever. The team is weighing these complex logistical and strategic options as the regular season concludes, seeking to maximize his impact.</p>

          <p>California is poised to potentially designate Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday after the Legislature passed Assembly Bill 268.

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ensuring her participation in an upcoming key interest rate vote. The divided court upheld a lower court's ruling that Cook's dismissal would likely violate the Federal Reserve Act's "for cause" removal provisions, designed to protect the central bank's independence. Trump had sought to remove Cook, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, citing unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. Cook's attorneys argued that her removal based on pre-appointment conduct does not meet the legal standard, emphasizing the importance of insulating the Fed from political pressure.</p>
