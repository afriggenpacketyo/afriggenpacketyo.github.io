        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. These changes are designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without an actual increase in real income. For 2026, married couples filing jointly will see a standard deduction of $32,200, while single filers will have a deduction of $16,100. The adjustments reflect a projected inflation rate of 2.7%, a smaller increase compared to the significant adjustments made in preceding years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, author D.J. Waldie, known for his evocative writing about Los Angeles, reflects on the city's complex identity and the necessity of loving it, imperfections and all. Waldie argues that a deeper understanding of the city's true history, beyond clichés and booster myths, is crucial for its residents to make better political and social decisions. He suggests that this "attunement" to the past allows people to reinhabit their communities and resist forces that seek to deconstruct the city. His work aims to foster an "affective history" that encourages readers to feel something for their home.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss announced fiscal third-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations, attributing the success to targeted price increases and a strategic shift toward direct-to-consumer sales. The denim company's gross margin expanded to 61.7%, and it has raised its full-year sales growth forecast to 3%. CEO Michelle Gass stated that the price hikes have not negatively impacted consumer demand, and the company plans further increases next year. The growth in direct sales and expansion into non-denim categories like tops have also contributed significantly to the positive financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian novelist László Krasznahorkai, the 2025 Nobel Prize in Literature laureate, is celebrated for his challenging yet profound work that explores the effects of political oppression. His novels, such as "The Melancholy of Resistance," are characterized by long, labyrinthine sentences and a mood of existential dread, yet they defy the acceptance of stultifying political conditions. The article suggests that while his style is experimental, his selection aligns with the Nobel committee's tradition of honoring writers who translate specific historical contexts into timeless, universal art. Krasznahorkai's work is described as both placeless and deeply relevant.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on the initial phase of a U.S.-backed plan to end the conflict in Gaza, with an Israeli cabinet vote expected to formalize the deal. The first stage includes a ceasefire, the withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza, and the release of 20 living hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners. Following this, hundreds of aid trucks are expected to enter Gaza. Subsequent phases of the plan, which require further negotiation, address the long-term governance of Gaza and the disarmament of Hamas.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Gaza Peace Deal Creates New, Long-Term US Responsibilities in the Middle East</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that while former President Trump's successful negotiation of the Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal is a major achievement, it also commits the United States to a significant, long-term role in the region. The author suggests a corollary to the "you break it, you own it" rule: "you patch it, you own it," meaning the U.S. is now responsible for the plan's complex implementation. The article outlines numerous challenges ahead, including Hamas's disarmament, managing a multinational stabilization force, and overseeing Gaza's reconstruction. The success of this endeavor, it concludes, will require a massive, expert-led effort from the U.S. government.</p>

          <p>In his first solo directing project, "The Smashing Machine," Benny Safdie explores the life of mixed-martial artist Mark Kerr, played by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. The film focuses on the champion's struggle with painkiller addiction and his career decline, examining what happens when a winner starts to lose. Safdie explains his interest in making a seemingly unrelatable, top-tier athlete's story accessible by focusing on his vulnerability and faltering moments. The film presented a unique opportunity for Johnson to take on a complex, dramatic role that required a significant physical transformation and challenged his heroic public image.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film adaptation of "Kiss of the Spider Woman," directed by Bill Condon, is praised as a "sexual and scatological dazzler." The movie musical stars Diego Luna as a political prisoner and Tonatiuh as his gay cellmate, who escapes their grim reality by recounting the plot of a musical starring a fictional actress played by Jennifer Lopez. The review highlights the film's clever use of musical fantasy sequences to contrast with the harsh prison drama, celebrating humanity and the need for joy even in oppression. Lopez's performance as the film-within-a-film's star is lauded, as is Tonatiuh's breakout performance.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the personal and cultural journey of learning English as a second language, moving from a forced requirement in Spain to a means of identity formation in the United States. The author discusses the nuances between different forms of English and the initial challenges of being lost in translation. Drawing on past articles from The Atlantic, the piece explores the cognitive and personal benefits of multilingualism, such as enhanced self-awareness. Ultimately, the author concludes that mastering a foreign language is an odyssey that creates new imagined selves, a profound experience that AI translation tools may render obsolete.</p>

          <h2>Trump Reportedly Reconsiders Jared Isaacman for NASA Administrator Role</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 15:21:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former President Donald Trump has reportedly met with billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman to reconsider nominating him to lead NASA. Trump had previously nominated Isaacman for the position but withdrew the nomination after a public dispute with Elon Musk, a close associate of Isaacman's, and after labeling Isaacman a "blue blooded Democrat." Isaacman, a seasoned private astronaut and founder of Shift4, has deep ties to the space industry, particularly through his collaborations with SpaceX. The new discussions suggest a potential reconciliation and a renewed effort to fill the top job at the U.S. space agency.</p>
