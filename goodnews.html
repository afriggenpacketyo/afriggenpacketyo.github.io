          <p>Japan and the United States are engaged in ongoing negotiations to reach a mutually beneficial trade agreement, though significant differences remain on tariff issues. Despite these challenges, both countries aim to finalize a deal by mid-June, with further talks planned to address trade, non-tariff barriers, and economic security. Japan is advocating for the removal of additional tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, arguing that these measures negatively impact the Japanese economy. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba emphasized that while progress is desired before his meeting with President Donald Trump, national interests will not be compromised for the sake of a rushed agreement.

          <p>The Met Office has issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England, parts of the Midlands, and most of south Wales, predicting potential disruption to transport and services. The warning is in effect from 09:00 to 18:00 BST, with the possibility of 10-15mm of rain falling in less than an hour in some areas. Frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds are expected to be additional hazards. The unsettled weather follows a record-breaking dry spring, with the potential for more rainfall on Saturday than in the entire month of May in some locations, but the storms are expected to ease off in the west from mid-afternoon.</p>

          <p>WorldPride is being held in Washington, D.C., marking the first time the international LGBTQ+ festival has been hosted in the city since its inception in 2000. This year's event coincides with the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., which typically draw hundreds of thousands of attendees. Despite the usual magnitude of the celebrations, organizers note that the current political environment has dampened enthusiasm due to executive orders that limit the rights of trans people. Some corporate sponsors have also withdrawn support in response to the Trump administration's policies, and the National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park has sparked controversy, however the parade is expected to bring large crowds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore, achy feet, including foot doming, wall stretches, toe spreads, toe yoga, calf raises, and foot massages. These exercises can improve flexibility, motor control, stability, and blood flow to the feet. Foot doming strengthens the "foot core," while wall stretches help with plantar fasciitis and toe spreads improve flexibility. Toe yoga enhances balance, and calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles, while massaging feet can relieve tension. These exercises can be incorporated into daily routines to maintain foot health and prevent pain.</p>

While a shift in foreign policy towards the US and Japan is anticipated, continuity in trilateral military cooperation with the US and Japan is also expected. Lee's administration may differ from his predecessor's emphasis on stronger security cooperation with Washington and Tokyo, potentially leading to a recalibration of Seoul's relationship with China and North Korea.
