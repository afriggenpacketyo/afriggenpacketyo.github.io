          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, falling short of analysts' expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption in the world's second-largest economy. Despite this, industrial output saw a stronger-than-expected increase of 6.1%, suggesting that the impact of U.S. tariffs was not as significant as anticipated. Fixed-asset investment also expanded, though slightly below forecasts, while the urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%. The statistics bureau acknowledged the presence of unstable external factors, emphasizing the need to further consolidate the foundation for sustained economic recovery. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The South Solon Meeting House in Maine holds a unique secret: its interior is adorned with 70-year-old fresco murals, leading some to call it "the Sistine Chapel of Maine." Painted by artists in the 1950s, the murals have gained renewed attention thanks to a website created by Colby College students. The meeting house, built in 1842, served as a church until the 1940s and was later revitalized by Margaret Day Blake, who invited young artists to create the frescoes under the supervision of the Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture. Today, the meeting house is a community space open to the public, hosting gatherings and artistic events.</p>

          <p>Former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. has been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones, according to a statement from his office. The diagnosis came after Mr. Biden reported urinary symptoms, which led doctors to find a nodule on his prostate. While the cancer is Stage 4, it appears to be hormone-sensitive, which allows for effective management. President Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris issued supportive statements, as experts note that while the cancer cannot be cured, patients can live for many years with treatment.</p>

          <p>British mountaineer Kenton Cool has achieved a record-breaking 19th summit of Mount Everest, surpassing his own record for the most climbs by a non-Sherpa. Cool reached the summit accompanied by Nepali sherpa Dorji Gyaljen, amidst the climbing season that has seen at least two other climbers die on the mountain. Cool's achievement is hailed by fellow climbers, noting his extensive experience and valuable contribution to the Everest community. This milestone occurs as Kami Rita, another Nepali sherpa, is attempting to set a new record for the most Everest summits.</p>

          <p>Portugal's governing right-of-center Democratic Alliance has won the snap parliamentary elections, marking the third election in as many years, but once again failing to secure a majority. The party's leader, Lu√≠s Montenegro, pledged to stimulate investment and ensure prosperity and social justice. Socialist leader Pedro Nuno Santos announced his resignation after his party finished second, nearly tying with the far-right Chega party, a relatively new political force. The final results could shift further depending on votes from abroad.</p>

          <p>Astronomers have discovered a perfectly spherical bubble in the Milky Way galaxy, baffling scientists with its unusual symmetry. Named Teleios, after the ancient Greek word for "perfection", the object appears to be a supernova remnant glowing faintly in radio wavelengths. The researchers have struggled to determine the distance to Teleios, with estimates ranging from 7,175 to 25,114 light-years, which significantly impacts its estimated size and age. One of the biggest puzzles is the lack of X-ray emissions, which are typically associated with Type Ia supernovae remnants.</p>

          <p>Liberal, pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, Nicusor Dan, has won the Romanian presidency, defeating a strong challenge from right-wing nationalist George Simion after months of political turmoil.

Dan secured 54% of the vote, emphasizing the need to build Romania together, irrespective of voting preferences. Simion, who attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv, initially claimed victory but later conceded, as Dan's supporters celebrated a profound change in Romania.</p>
