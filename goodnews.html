          <p>President Donald Trump announced the US has "no stronger partner" than Saudi Arabia during his first major foreign trip, pledging to lift sanctions against Syria and announcing a $142 billion arms deal with Saudi Arabia. The trip, focused on shoring up investment, included meetings with business leaders like Elon Musk and Sam Altman. Trump lauded the US-Saudi relationship as "more powerful than ever before" and expressed his "dream" for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, while only briefly addressing the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has made it clear that will not happen until there is a permanent end to the war in Gaza and a clear path to Palestinian statehood.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89; he was known as the world's "poorest president" due to his modest lifestyle. Mujica, a former guerrilla, governed Uruguay from 2010 to 2015, becoming a well-known political figure in Latin America and beyond for his simple way of living, his criticism of consumerism, and the social reforms he promoted, including the legalization of recreational marijuana. During his administration, the Uruguayan economy grew, poverty was reduced, and unemployment remained low. He will be remembered for his simple lifestyle he adopted in and out of politics.</p>

          <p>Jos√© Mujica, the former president of Uruguay, has died at the age of 89. Serving from 2010 to 2015, he refused to accept a presidential salary or live on a presidential estate as he sought to improve the lives of ordinary citizens. Known as Pepe, Mr. Mujica was elected president in 2009 at the age of 74 as a generation of leftist Latin American governments were losing their populist luster. A self-described philosophical anarchist, he was known for his brash charisma, his skepticism of capitalism‚Äôs excesses, his modest way of life and his intent to inject purpose and humility into government during a time when Uruguay‚Äôs left was ascendant.</p>

The bill includes changes to Medicaid and food stamps to fund tax cuts, but divisions remain among Republicans on Medicaid overhauls and tax deductions. Democrats criticize the bill, asserting it will cause millions to lose health insurance, while Republicans insist they are targeting waste and protecting benefits for eligible recipients. The Ways and Means Committee is proposing to raise the debt limit by $4 trillion and extend tax cuts enacted during Mr. Trump's first term.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has questioned hospitals‚Äô rapid adoption of DeepSeek , warning that it creates clinical safety and privacy risks, raising red flags over the rush to use the artificial intelligence (AI) start-up‚Äôs cost-efficient open-source models. As of early March, at least 300 hospitals in China have started using DeepSeek‚Äôs large language models (LLMs) in clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek‚Äôs tendency to generate ‚Äúplausible but factually incorrect outputs‚Äù could lead to ‚Äúsubstantial clinical risk‚Äù, despite strong reasoning capabilities.</p>

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a microbiologist in Brazil, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long research into soil bacteria that act as fertilizer, boosting farmers' harvests. Hungria isolated useful strains of bacteria called rhizobia which inhabit nodules on soybean roots, capture nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form that feeds the plant. According to Bortolon, most seeds of major crops like soybeans or corn in Brazil now are coated with microorganisms before planting.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration, under the leadership of Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is seeking to remove prescription fluoride supplements for kids from the market. These are fluoride tablets, drops or lozenges that are recommended for kids who don't get fluoridated water to help prevent cavities. The FDA claims that ingested fluoride changes the human microbiome in a concerning way, even though the research it cites is inconclusive.</p>

          <p>Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, discussed the company's business strategy, highlighting how Disney bundles streaming services in connection with leveraging its linear television arm. Walden countered skeptical sentiments about linear TV, saying Disney's sports programming is growing on the platform. She also explained how linear bolsters streaming, claiming the company has "made good sense of these two forms of distribution." Disney's bundling strategy is also paying off, Walden continued. The company announced Tuesday it would offer a stand-alone ESPN streaming service for $29.99 per month.</p>
