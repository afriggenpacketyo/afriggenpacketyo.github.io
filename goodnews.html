        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the key differences between stablecoins and central bank digital currencies like China's digital yuan, highlighted by South Korea's recent pivot towards stablecoins. The digital yuan is a state-controlled currency intended for domestic retail payments and is not directly exchangeable for foreign currencies. In contrast, stablecoins are privately issued, blockchain-based tokens pegged to assets like the US dollar, with issuers holding reserves to back their value. This distinction in design, purpose, and management is central to the global debate on the future of digital money. (not investment advice)</p>

Planned projects include a "Great America State Fair," a "National Garden of American Heroes" sculpture park, and an oral history project with the Library of Congress.

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite a high-profile democratic socialist victory in New York City, the true future leaders of the Democratic Party are pragmatic, center-left figures like Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia. Both women, who have backgrounds in national security, won governorship primaries by focusing on kitchen-table economics, infrastructure, and individual freedoms rather than ideological purity tests. The author suggests their success in competitive districts shows that persuasion and coalition-building, not performative activism, are key to winning general elections and building durable majorities.</p>

          <h2>The Caribbean Indigenous Roots of American Barbecue Culture</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The tradition of barbecue, a staple of American summer holidays, has its origins with the Indigenous Ta√≠no people of the Caribbean. The term itself is derived from the Ta√≠no word "barabicu," which described the wooden frames they used to cook meat over an open fire. Spanish explorers encountered this method in the 15th century and adapted the word into "barbacoa." Over centuries, this cooking style transformed and diversified as it spread through the U.S., influenced by various immigrant cultures and local ingredients to create the distinct regional barbecue styles known today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new version of President Trump's sweeping domestic policy bill, passed by the Senate, includes enhanced incentives for the semiconductor industry. The legislation would increase the investment tax credit for chip manufacturers building plants in the U.S. from 25% to 35%. This move aims to further encourage companies like Intel and TSMC to expand advanced manufacturing within the United States, building on the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act. The bill reflects Washington's ongoing strategy to onshore the semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on Asia, using both tax incentives and the threat of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

This follows a similar rejection of an approach from Barcelona earlier in the summer. Liverpool considers the Colombian international a key player, especially after he scored 22 goals for both club and country last season, and is adamant about keeping him on their roster for the upcoming season.</p>

Speaking ahead of his 90th birthday, the spiritual leader stated the process of finding his reincarnation should follow past traditions and be handled by his Gaden Phodrang Trust, without outside interference. The move is politically significant for Tibetans seeking to preserve their identity and autonomy.</p>

Rather than causing a sell-off, the release of 69 million shares, representing a 40% stake, was met with strong investor demand. The company's stock has surged over 1,300% since its debut in June 2024, driven by strong branding, pricing power, and rapid sales growth. Analysts believe the company's expansion into overseas markets will provide further room for growth, justifying its high valuation compared to competitors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, has signaled a move to crack down on the intense price wars affecting many of the country's industries. At a high-level economic meeting, officials used the specific phrase "disorderly low-price competition" to describe the problem, indicating a more focused approach than previous discussions of "involutionary competition." Beijing views this practice as a threat to the economy because it harms innovation, reduces product quality, and hinders industrial upgrading. The new policy aims to guide companies toward quality improvement and facilitate the exit of outdated production capacity. (not investment advice)</p>
