        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents the concluding text from Justice Anthony Kennedy's majority opinion in the landmark Supreme Court case that legalized same-sex marriage nationwide. The opinion eloquently argues that marriage is a profound union embodying the highest ideals of love, fidelity, and family, and that the petitioners sought not to disrespect the institution, but to find its fulfillment for themselves. Kennedy wrote that to deny them this right would be to condemn them to loneliness and exclude them from a foundational institution of civilization. The Constitution, he concluded, grants them the right to equal dignity in the eyes of the law.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw is now just three strikeouts away from reaching the historic 3,000 career milestone after a strong performance against the Colorado Rockies. In the 3-1 victory, Kershaw recorded five strikeouts over six innings, bringing his career total to 2,997. Manager Dave Roberts removed him from the game after 69 pitches, preserving the opportunity for Kershaw to achieve the milestone in front of a home crowd at Dodger Stadium. He is set to become the 20th pitcher in MLB history to join the prestigious 3,000-strikeout club.</p>

          <p>The British government is set to announce significant concessions on its proposed welfare reforms to avoid a parliamentary defeat. Following pressure from over 100 Labour backbenchers, the deal is expected to protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit from planned cuts. The changes, which aim to save ¬£5 billion annually, will now primarily affect future claimants. This marks a major climbdown for the government and is the third such U-turn in a month, raising questions about the prime minister's authority.</p>

          <p>The White House has clarified that the United States and China have reached a "framework" agreement to implement a trade deal, following an earlier, less detailed announcement by President Trump. Trump had stated that the U.S. had signed a trade agreement with Beijing the previous day, which prompted the need for clarification. A White House official explained that the two nations agreed to an "additional understanding for a framework" based on talks that began in Geneva. The statement suggests progress in ongoing trade negotiations between the two economic powers.</p>

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images of what is believed to be a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The planet, named TWA 7b, is estimated to be the mass of Saturn and orbits a young star named TWA 7. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging with a coronagraph, a tool that blocks the star's bright light to reveal fainter nearby objects. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet shaping its star's debris disk.</p>

          <p>A state appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top advisor to ex-Los Angeles District Attorney George Gasc√≥n, delivering a sharp rebuke to the prosecution led by California's Attorney General. Teran was accused of improperly downloading confidential police records, but the court ruled that the documents in question were publicly available court records. The unanimous decision stated her actions were not criminal, as she conveyed nothing a member of the public couldn't learn from public court files. The case had been a focal point of political criticism against Gasc√≥n's progressive policies.</p>

This run of shows comes as Tesfaye has hinted he may soon retire the Weeknd persona, stating he no longer has the desire for the headspace it requires.

The film is described as bigger and goofier than its predecessor, content to provide entertainment through robot-on-robot combat and a shaggy sense of humor. The plot involves M3GAN's creator, Gemma, rebranding as an anti-technology crusader while the AI dolls seek control of the global digital infrastructure. The review praises the film's self-aware humor and its commentary on humanity's strange relationship with technology, even if the central plot feels familiar.</p>

          <p>The market for stablecoins is attracting significant interest from Wall Street, with experts predicting it could grow into a multi-trillion dollar industry, comparable to the introduction of credit cards. Recent moves by firms like Fiserv and Mastercard to integrate stablecoins highlight the trend of bridging traditional finance with digital assets. Companies like Circle have seen their stock soar as they facilitate global payments for major private firms. As regulatory clarity increases, traditional banks are expected to enter the space to capture a share of this rapidly expanding market. (not investment advice)</p>
