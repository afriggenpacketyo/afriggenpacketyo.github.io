          <p>President Trump stated that the U.S. is planning to meet with Iran the following week, following a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Speaking at a news conference after a NATO summit in The Hague, Trump mentioned that a formal agreement with Iran might not be necessary due to the destruction of their nuclear sites. He emphasized that the U.S. is primarily concerned with preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, noting that recent strikes have significantly hampered their enrichment efforts, potentially setting them back for decades. Trump also addressed the Israel-Hamas conflict, expressing optimism about progress being made in Gaza. The president's remarks followed meetings with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, discussing defense spending and peace efforts.

          <p>Emil Bove, a former defense attorney for President Trump and current DOJ official, faced a Senate Judiciary Committee confirmation hearing for a federal judgeship. Bove disputed claims that he acted as Trump's "henchman," asserting his independence and integrity. The hearing was complicated by a whistleblower complaint alleging Bove suggested defying judicial orders related to immigration enforcement, which he denied.

          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant decline in its incarceration rate, potentially reaching a 60% reduction in the prison population by the next decade. After peaking at over 1.6 million in 2009, the prison population fell to 1.2 million by the end of 2023 and is projected to drop to around 600,000. This decline is attributed to falling crime rates since the 1990s and a lower-crime generation not replacing the older, high-crime generation at an equal rate. The trend is expected to continue, with the imprisonment rate potentially falling as low as 200 per 100,000 people by 2035, which may cause states to tear down their most deteriorated and inhumane correctional facilities.

          <p>According to public speaking consultant Bill McGowan, the biggest communication mistake people make is using corporate jargon in an attempt to seem intelligent. McGowan, who has coached CEOs and celebrities, says that using bland and boring language confuses people and sounds inauthentic.
