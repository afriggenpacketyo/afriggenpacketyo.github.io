          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a method to protect savings from inflation, with top accounts currently offering rates that surpass the inflation rate. The article notes a significant difference between national average CD yields and the higher rates available, particularly from online banks which have lower overhead costs. It also explains the phenomenon of an "inverted yield curve," where short-term CDs presently offer better returns than long-term ones, suggesting a laddering strategy to capitalize on this trend.

          <p>The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits saw a modest increase last week, rising by 7,000 to 226,000. Despite the slight uptick and recent signs of a cooling labor market, the figure remains within a range considered historically healthy, suggesting that layoffs are still low. This report comes after a weaker-than-expected July jobs report created market uncertainty and drew criticism from the White House. The data indicates that employers are largely retaining their workers despite broader economic concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery's second-quarter earnings were significantly boosted by the strong performance of its film studios, which saw revenues increase by 55% to $3.8 billion.

CEO David Zaslav highlighted the studio's turnaround, crediting new leadership and a focus on major franchises like "Superman" and "Lord of the Rings" for rebuilding the division and positioning it for sustained profitability.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter financial results, missing earnings-per-share estimates but beating revenue expectations. The company's performance was bolstered by strong international demand and solid growth at Tim Hortons, which helped offset a 1.4% decline in same-store sales at Popeyes. Burger King saw modest growth, with its U.S. turnaround efforts continuing as more than half of its domestic locations have now been renovated.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee voted by a slim 5-4 majority to cut its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 4.0%. The decision reflects the challenge of balancing persistent inflation, which recently rose to 3.6%, against a cooling labor market and stagnant economic growth. The close vote, which required two rounds to reach a majority, highlights the deep division among policymakers about the correct path forward. The bank stated that its approach to further monetary easing will remain "gradual and careful." (not investment advice)</p>

The outreach aims to understand the new leadership's priorities and ensure India is not excluded from future reconstruction efforts in the war-torn nation. Analysts suggest the move reinforces India's non-aligned stance and protects its strategic interests in regional stability, energy security, and trade corridors, mirroring its pragmatic engagement with the Taliban in Afghanistan.</p>

The strong performance comes as the company also released new trial data for an experimental obesity pill and braces for potential U.S. tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals.</p>
