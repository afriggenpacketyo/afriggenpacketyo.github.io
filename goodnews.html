          <p>Supermodel Heidi Klum has revealed she is undertaking a worm and parasite cleanse, a wellness trend she noticed on her social media feeds. The 52-year-old model explained that she and her husband are using herbal pills containing ingredients like clove and papaya seeds, which she believes are effective against parasites. While Klum is embracing this new routine, health organizations like the Mayo Clinic and Healthline note there is little research to support the effectiveness of such cleanses for treating parasitic infections.</p>

          <p>A Czech safari park has announced the birth of four rare Barbary lion cubs, a subspecies that has been extinct in the wild for decades. The public debut of the three females and one male is part of an international endangered species program aimed at preserving their genetic diversity in captivity. The zoo is also in preliminary discussions with Moroccan authorities about a long-term plan to potentially reintroduce the majestic lions to their native habitat in the Atlas Mountains. Fewer than 200 Barbary lions are estimated to exist in captivity worldwide.</p>

          <p>In Altadena, a community ravaged by a recent fire, resident Laurie Scott has started a free plant stand called "Regrow Altadena" to help her neighbors find solace and hope. After losing her own garage, Scott found comfort in a small houseplant and was inspired to share that feeling by propagating and distributing plants, seeds, and soil. The initiative has since grown, with community members contributing everything from succulents to saplings, providing a tangible symbol of growth and recovery for residents, many of whom are displaced and rebuilding their lives.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has given its final approval for a €13.5 billion project to construct the world's longest suspension bridge, connecting Sicily to the mainland. The 3.3-kilometer bridge over the Strait of Messina has been a long-debated project, previously shelved due to concerns over cost, environmental impact, and potential mafia involvement. Proponents, including Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, claim it will create 120,000 jobs and boost the economies of two of Europe's poorest regions, though it still faces opposition and further regulatory hurdles.</p>

          <p>German football star and longtime Bayern Munich player Thomas Müller has made a surprise move to Major League Soccer, signing with the Vancouver Whitecaps. The 36-year-old World Cup winner's decision to join the Canadian club, rather than a more high-profile U.S. team, is seen as a major coup for the Whitecaps. Pundits believe Müller's renowned intelligence, leadership, and jovial personality will be a significant asset both on and off the field for the contending Vancouver squad.

          <p>As Americans take on more responsibility for their retirement, certificates of deposit (CDs) and annuities are popular low-risk options, but they serve different purposes. CDs offer simplicity and FDIC-insured safety, making them ideal for short-term goals, but their returns may not outpace inflation. Annuities are specifically designed to provide a guaranteed income stream for life, addressing the risk of outliving one's savings, though they are more complex and less liquid. The best choice depends on an individual's specific needs, risk tolerance, and existing portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
