          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 04:05:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions across the UK are bracing for extensive travel disruption over the upcoming bank holiday weekend, due to a combination of busy roads, a planned rail strike by the RMT union, and ongoing engineering works. Significant impacts are expected on CrossCountry rail routes, with no services on Saturday and limited operations on Monday, while the RAC warns of particularly heavy traffic on key motorways like the M5. Despite these transport challenges, the weather is forecast to be largely dry, encouraging large attendances at numerous festivals and events nationwide, including Notting Hill Carnival and Reading and Leeds festivals. This period marks the final long weekend before Christmas for many regions.</p>

          <p>Pet dogs are becoming integral to wedding ceremonies, often serving as ring bearers, greeters, and participants in family portraits, reflecting their growing status as cherished family members. Couples like Ellie and Brad, whose sheepadoodle Newton played multiple roles, highlight the joy and emotional support these animals bring to special occasions. Services like Precious Pets Weddings and Paws2Party have emerged to help couples incorporate their pets, managing logistics and even "sprucing up" dogs with special attire. This trend signifies a broader cultural shift where pets are deeply embedded in family life, inspiring others to include their beloved companions in significant life events.</p>

          <h2>Europe's Prolonged Heatwave Drives Surge in Demand for Chinese Air Conditioners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 04:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Europe is currently enduring a prolonged and intense summer heatwave, with temperatures reaching up to 36 degrees Celsius in cities like Madrid and Paris. This extreme weather, linked to global warming, has highlighted the continent's lack of infrastructure for such high temperatures, despite its typically northern latitude. As a direct result, demand for air conditioning units has skyrocketed, leading to a nearly 60% increase in Chinese AC exports to Europe in July compared to the previous year. This surge is significantly boosting business for Chinese manufacturers, who produce about 80% of the world's cooling units.</p>

          <p>The owner of OnlyFans, Leonid Radvinsky, received $701 million in dividends last year as the subscription-based content platform, known for adult content, prepares for a potential multi-billion-dollar sale. The UK-based company reported a 9% revenue increase to $1.4 billion in its 2024 financial year, with pre-tax profit rising 4% to $683.6 million. The platform saw a 13% increase in creator accounts to 4.6 million and a 24% rise in fan accounts to 377.5 million, indicating substantial growth and profitability. Radvinsky has now received over $1 billion in dividends from the business, which connects creators, including sex workers and celebrities, directly with their audiences.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has significantly scaled back his threat of high tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports from the European Union, agreeing to cap them at 15% in a newly detailed trade deal. This comes after earlier threats of tariffs as high as 250% on pharmaceuticals. The agreement specifies that the US will apply the 15% rate on most European goods, including semiconductors and lumber, from September 1. In return, the EU is expected to reduce tariffs on all US industrial and agricultural goods to zero, with a conditional reduction for European car exports pending this legislative action. The deal aims to provide predictability for businesses and stabilize the transatlantic trading partnership.</p>

This modification comes after an August 11 order for widespread removal of dogs, which sparked protests from animal rights activists who criticized its feasibility and humanitarian implications.

          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled to 3.1% in July, slightly higher than the 3% expected by economists but marking its lowest level since March. Headline inflation also dropped to 3.1%, the lowest since November 2024, as rice inflation continued to ease from its previous highs. Despite this moderation, the 3.1% headline figure represents the 40th consecutive month above the Bank of Japan's 2% target, prompting some experts to argue the BOJ is "behind the curve" in raising interest rates.

The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he implied "people in the palace" instigated a 2014 military coup. The court interpreted the law literally, ruling that he did not name specific individuals covered by the statute. This verdict provides significant relief to the Shinawatra family's political movement, coming as Thaksin's daughter, the current suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn, faces her own legal challenges.</p>
