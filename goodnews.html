          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that had been dive-bombing residents of Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been taken in by a local falconer. The hawk, which had attacked approximately 50 people, causing injuries in some cases, was captured and trained by Wayne Housden, who spent around ¬£1,000 building an aviary for the bird. Housden believes the hawk was likely a captive-bred bird that had been lost by its owner, and intends to keep it full-time, with plans to eventually let it fly loose. The falconer also plans to bring the hawk to the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival in August.</p>

At age 12, Musk created a video game called Blastar, which he sold to a magazine for $500. His first company, Zip2, was sold for around $300 million, netting him $22 million. Musk also launched a perfume called Burnt Hair and Tesla Tequila.

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the importance of UK saltmarshes as vital "sinks" that store climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these tidal habitats in the official UK inventory of carbon emissions and removals, aiming to incentivize their restoration and protection. Working with researchers, WWF has installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that these plants absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in winter. The UK has lost approximately 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, with many being drained for agriculture.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has initiated its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to choose different surnames. Three opposition parties have submitted separate bills, but their passage is uncertain due to reluctance from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), which fears it could harm family cohesion. Currently, Japanese law requires married couples to share a single family name, typically the husband's. Public support for a dual family-name system is growing, with a recent poll showing 71% in favor, yet the LDP has not reached a consensus on the issue.</p>

This agreement follows technical talks between the two nations and may take a few months to implement, as the registration process must be completed and products must pass radiation checks.

          <p>The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has formally dropped its lawsuit against Binance and its founder, Changpeng Zhao, effectively ending one of the last remaining crypto enforcement actions brought by the agency. The lawsuit, initiated in June 2023, accused Binance of illegally serving U.S. users, inflating trading volumes, and commingling customer funds. This dismissal marks a significant shift as the Trump administration aims to be an ally to the crypto industry. The Justice Department has also shut down its crypto enforcement team, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission is set to be led by a venture capitalist with crypto ties.</p>
