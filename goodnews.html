          <p>An explosion in the boiler room of a 20-story public housing building in the Bronx caused a corner of the structure to collapse.

Remarkably, no injuries or fatalities were reported among the residents of the Mitchel Houses complex. Officials have evacuated 38 apartments as a precaution while engineers inspect the building's structural integrity, and the incident is currently under investigation.</p>

The campaign aims to resonate with the growing population of renters by highlighting the brand's affordability. This tongue-in-cheek approach reflects recent data showing the median age of first-time homebuyers has reached an all-time high, making homeownership a distant dream for many younger Americans.</p>

The judge ruled that New York is likely to prove the funds were improperly withdrawn, noting the city's high risk of terrorist attacks.
