          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement, filed in a Washington D.C. federal court, remain confidential.

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi outlines three limiting beliefs that often prevent people from increasing their income. The first is the false notion that one should already know how to manage money and earn more, which creates shame and prevents seeking help. The second is the belief that success should come easily if one is talented, ignoring the necessity of patience and systematic effort. Finally, the habit of procrastination, or telling oneself they will start "later," is a major obstacle to taking the necessary first steps toward financial growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election, as part of its plan to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the initiative at the party's annual conference, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The policy is central to Labour's economic growth strategy and emulates the post-war government's new town developments. However, the plan faces challenges, including industry pressures and concerns from local residents who feel uninformed about the scale of the projects.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Latinos in the U.S. are installing personal air quality sensors at their homes and community centers to gather localized pollution data. This citizen-led initiative, highlighted by the Hispanic Access Foundation's "El Aire Que Respiramos" project, aims to address data gaps and advocate for better environmental regulations in communities disproportionately affected by poor air quality. The effort comes as the Trump administration moves to roll back pollution regulations. By collecting their own data, these communities hope to provide concrete evidence to officials about the health risks they face from nearby industrial sources and traffic.</p>

          <p>Cepee Tabibian, an American who moved to Spain and founded a community for women moving abroad, dispels six common misconceptions about expatriate life. She cautions that living abroad is not as cheap as many believe, with housing costs rising globally. Tabibian also refutes the idea that Americans are unwelcome, noting that anti-tourism sentiment is distinct from attitudes toward residents who integrate. Other myths she addresses include the fear of loneliness, the fantasy of a perfect life without bureaucracy, the pressure to find a "forever home" on the first try, and the belief that it's ever "too late" to make such a life-changing move.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's aggressive expansion is fueled by a series of massive infrastructure deals, creating a complex financial ecosystem with its partners. The company has secured staggering commitments, including a potential $100 billion investment from Nvidia and a $300 billion deal with Oracle, to fund its $500 billion Stargate supercomputer project. This web of dealmaking is raising concerns among some analysts, who point to the self-referential nature of the investments, where partners like Nvidia invest in OpenAI, which in turn buys their products. Despite burning cash, CEO Sam Altman defends the strategy as necessary to build the infrastructure required for future AI breakthroughs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite the persistent threat of fires in cities, the United States has seen a dramatic improvement in fire safety over the last 40 years. The per-capita civilian fire death rate has decreased by approximately two-thirds since 1980, while the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This progress is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements, including the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms and automatic sprinkler systems. Other key factors include safer furnishings, a major decline in cigarette smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety standards in modern building codes.</p>

The Trump administration is reportedly considering a similar equity stake in Lithium Americas for its Nevada mine.

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe, discovered by a Fort Myers resident during the cleanup after Hurricane Ian in 2022, has been preserved by state archeologists. The 9-foot dugout is unique among the 450 ancient canoes found in Florida because it is made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside the state, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing it in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating is ongoing, researchers are exploring the theory that it could be a cayuco built by Spanish settlers in the 16th century.</p>
