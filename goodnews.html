          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 20:07:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a surprising move, the Trump administration has sided with the Biden administration's earlier request to dismiss a lawsuit aimed at restricting access to mifepristone, an abortion pill. The Justice Department argued that the case, brought by conservative attorneys general, was filed in the wrong venue and lacks legal standing. This decision avoids addressing the merits of the case, potentially buying time for the Trump administration to formulate a strategy on mifepristone. The lawsuit seeks to reverse regulatory changes that expanded access to the pill, which now accounts for nearly two-thirds of pregnancy terminations in the United States.</p>

          <p>Credit Suisse Services AG pleaded guilty to conspiring with wealthy American taxpayers to hide over $4 billion in offshore accounts, agreeing to pay $511 million in penalties. The DOJ said that Credit Suisse committed new crimes and breached its May 2014 plea agreement with the United States. The scheme, which ran from 2010 through 2021, allowed clients to evade U.S. tax obligations, resulting in a tax loss of over $71 million. The agreement requires Credit Suisse and UBS to fully cooperate with ongoing investigations and disclose information about U.S.-related accounts.</p>

          <p>Senate Democrats are pushing for stricter regulations on cryptocurrency legislation due to concerns about the Trump family's involvement and potential conflicts of interest.

Concerns include potential money laundering and the bill's benefits to overseas stablecoin firms.

          <p>Indian industries, particularly textiles, are facing challenges due to cheaper Chinese imports flooding the market, exacerbated by Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. Despite assurances from China, concerns about 'dumping' are widespread across various sectors in India. The Indian government has established a committee to monitor the influx of inexpensive Chinese goods and has imposed taxes on certain steel imports. India's trade deficit with China has surged, underscoring the difficulty in reducing reliance on Chinese goods despite efforts to boost local manufacturing.</p>
