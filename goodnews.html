          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America (AAFA) released its annual allergy report, identifying the most challenging cities for seasonal allergy sufferers, with Wichita, Kansas, topping the list for the third consecutive year. The report considers tree, grass, and weed pollen counts, over-the-counter allergy medicine use, and the availability of allergists. Dr. Purvi Parikh recommends starting medications early, washing clothes after being outdoors, and paying attention to pollen count timing, which is highest in the mornings and late afternoons. She also advises consulting a doctor to differentiate between allergy symptoms and those of colds or viruses.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 05:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While Chinese electric vehicle (EV) exports to the United Kingdom have decreased, plug-in hybrid vehicle exports are experiencing a significant surge, nearly 600% in the first quarter of the year. This trend is driven by affordability, as one Londoner mentioned choosing a Chinese EV due to Tesla's higher price. Unlike the European Union, the UK only applies a standard 10% import tariff to Chinese EVs, fostering a more competitive market. In March alone, China's hybrid EV exports to the UK skyrocketed by 1,849% year-on-year, reaching 3,898 units.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Saudi Aramco reported a 5% year-on-year decrease in first-quarter net profit, amounting to $26 billion, due to reduced crude prices and production. The company's free cash flow also declined from $22.8 billion to $19.2 billion, reflecting continuing strain on its balance sheet amid global trade dynamics and economic uncertainty. Aramco reduced its performance-linked dividend payout for the fourth quarter of 2024 and repeated the reduced figure for the first quarter of 2025, although its base dividend increased. CEO Amin Nasser highlighted the importance of disciplined capital planning during volatile times, with banks and energy agencies downgrading oil price outlooks for the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this New York Times guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that mothers are often unfairly blamed for their children's problems and are held to unrealistic standards of perfection. She suggests that being flawed is an important part of motherhood, as it teaches children to accept their own imperfections. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that they are already doing enough, and she emphasizes the importance of give and take in close relationships, advocating for mothers to prioritize their own well-being as well.</p>

          <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed restarting direct talks with Ukraine in Istanbul on May 15, without preconditions, after European leaders threatened increased sanctions if Moscow did not accept an unconditional 30-day ceasefire. Putin referenced the unsuccessful 2022 Istanbul peace talks and expressed openness to a ceasefire during direct discussions with Ukraine. Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had previously stated his readiness for peace talks after a ceasefire is established. The European leaders' ceasefire proposal, supported by President Trump, includes potential sanctions on Russia's energy and banking sectors if non-compliance occurs.</p>

          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the US has remained steady at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year but still below the 7.09% rate from a year ago. Meanwhile, the rate for 15-year fixed-rate mortgages decreased slightly to 5.89%. Mortgage rates are influenced by factors including global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve interest rate policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and increasing home prices continue to present affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, contributing to a lackluster start to the spring home buying season.</p>

Experts credit US Secretary of State Marco Rubio's call to Pakistan's Army Chief as a crucial point in de-escalation. Despite initial reluctance from the US, the deepening crisis prompted diplomatic intervention, with Pakistan sending "dual signals" and the US amplifying Delhi's positions in Islamabad.</p>

          <p>A report by ODI Global reveals that China is increasingly directing its energy investments in Africa towards renewable projects, with solar and wind power now comprising 59% of its energy projects on the continent. Between 2010 and 2024, China's energy sector investment and construction activity in Africa amounted to US$66 billion. Africa has also become a key market for Chinese solar and wind technology, with exports surging 153% from 2020 to 2024, driven by rising energy demand and China's dominance in solar panel production. This shift aligns with global trends showing China's energy investment moving away from fossil fuels.</p>
