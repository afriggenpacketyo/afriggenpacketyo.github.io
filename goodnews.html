          <p>South Koreans are participating in a snap election to select a new president following the removal of Yoon Suk Yeol, a conservative leader who faced rebellion charges related to his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest a likely win for Yoon's liberal rival, Lee Jae-myung, amidst public dissatisfaction with conservatives after Yoon's actions. Lee has emphasized patience regarding Trump's tariff policies, while Kim has expressed a desire to meet with Trump promptly, and the winning candidate will immediately assume office for a five-year term, facing challenges such as a slowing economy and strained relations with North Korea. Lee has also acknowledged the difficulties in achieving a summit with Kim Jong Un soon, expressing support for restarting talks with Kim Jong Un, potentially involving South Korea in North Korean projects. Optimism surrounding the political climate is tempered by the potential for continued domestic divisions.</p>

          <p>One of Big Bear's bald eaglets, Sunny, has successfully taken its first flight from the nest, while her sister, Gizmo, remains behind. The eaglets, born in March, are nearly 13 weeks old, which is prime time for fledging, and viewers of the Big Bear Eagle Nest Cam have been anticipating this moment. Sunny's flight followed days of practice, and young eagles often return to the nest soon after their first flight. It is expected that both eaglets will remain in the habitat for one to three months after fledging, before venturing off on their own in the fall.</p>

The stadium, built in 2006, has had a financial impact of nearly $300 million over the last decade, and the city insisted that the downtown stadium be part of an ambitious, mixed-use development. The ballpark has sparked a renaissance in the city's West End downtown, transforming a blighted area into a vibrant hub with new businesses and residential neighborhoods.

          <p>Shigeo Nagashima, a legendary figure in Japanese baseball and recipient of the People's Honor Award, has died at the age of 89. Nagashima was a key player for the Yomiuri Giants, leading them to nine consecutive Central League and Japan Series titles, and his popularity transcended the sport. Known as "Mr. Giants," he was celebrated for his flashy fielding and game-breaking heroics, and his death marks the end of an era for many Japanese who remember his contributions to the country's baseball legacy. Nagashima's retirement speech, declaring "My Giants are forever immortal," remains a significant part of Japan's cultural lexicon.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily halting its plan to garnish Social Security benefits for individuals who have defaulted on their student loans. The Department of Education stated this decision aims to protect Social Security recipients who rely on fixed incomes, and this action marks a policy shift for the administration, which had previously announced the resumption of collection activities on student loans. The pause allows older borrowers more time to address their defaulted loans and avoid reductions in their Social Security checks, and more than 450,000 federal student loan borrowers aged 62 and older are currently in default, highlighting the potential impact of this policy change. This move provides a measure of relief to older Americans struggling with student debt.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has pardoned Tanner Mansell and John Moore Jr., two shark divers who were convicted of theft for freeing sharks and a grouper from a fisherman's longline off the Florida coast. The men, who believed the line was illegal, were initially ordered to pay restitution and faced restrictions on voting, firearm ownership, and international travel due to their felony convictions. The pardons erase these convictions, and the divers' attorney argues that the case should never have been filed. The case highlights the tension between conservation efforts and legal regulations regarding fishing practices.</p>

          <p>Pop Mart, the company behind the popular collectible character Labubu, has seen its shares surge, leading some analysts to compare its success to that of Sanrio's Hello Kitty. Labubu, a small monster charm, has gained popularity among high-profile fans and driven significant international sales growth for Pop Mart, and its popularity has pushed Pop Mart‚Äôs Hong Kong-listed shares to a record high of HK$234 last week. Some analysts believe that Labubu's success demonstrates a new model for Chinese cultural exports by tapping into universal emotions through strong design and marketing, and JPMorgan Chase initiated coverage of Pop Mart last week with a rating of overweight.</p>

          <p>NPR is gathering information on songs that parents sing to their babies, following a Yale University study that found singing to babies improves their moods and overall well-being. The study indicated that infants who are sung to frequently are generally happier throughout the day, and NPR is inviting parents to share what songs they sing to calm or delight their babies. Samuel Mehr, an associate professor at the Yale University Child Study Center, noted that parents can sing any type of song, including those beyond traditional lullabies, to provide their baby with the opportunity to hear their voice.</p>

          <p>Police in San Jose have confirmed that the 1978 murder of high school teacher Diane Peterson was committed by a student, Harry "Nicky" Nickerson, who was seen with a knife bearing the words ‚ÄúTeacher Dear‚Äù. The case remained unsolved for 47 years until a relative disclosed that Nickerson admitted to stabbing Peterson shortly after it happened. Nickerson had been a person of interest in the case but authorities were unable to corroborate the claim at the time, and Nickerson, who had a history of criminal convictions, committed suicide in 1993. This resolution brings closure to a long-standing mystery, though the suspect will never face trial.</p>
