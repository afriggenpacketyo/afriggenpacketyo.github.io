          <p>President Trump is reportedly considering accepting a luxury jet from the Qatari royal family to serve as the new Air Force One, which has raised legal and ethical questions. The administration plans to retrofit the Boeing 747-8 jet for official presidential use and transfer it to Trump's presidential library foundation after his second term. This move comes as Trump expresses frustration over delays and budget overruns in modernizing the existing Air Force One aircraft, with Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg collaborating with Elon Musk to expedite the process. The White House claims full compliance with all applicable laws regarding foreign gifts.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to mutually lower extra tariffs on each other's imports by 115 percentage points and suspend additional 24 percent duties for 90 days, effective by Wednesday.

While the U.S. will retain a 10 percent tariff on all Chinese imports and a 20 percent levy on illegal drugs, China will retain a 10 percent retaliatory tariff on all American goods and tariffs on select U.S. products.

          <p>President Trump's upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates is expected to prioritize securing business deals worth over $1 trillion, rather than focusing on strategic foreign policy objectives. This trip aligns with the Trump family's expanding business interests in the Middle East, including real estate and golf projects backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. The Qatari government is reportedly considering donating a luxury Boeing 747-8 to serve as Air Force One, raising ethical concerns about potential conflicts of interest. Dennis B. Ross notes that the trip is more about economics than strategy, emphasizing financial transactions that Mr. Trump will promote as job creation for American workers.</p>

          <p>A recent study suggests that consuming large quantities of cinnamon may reduce the effectiveness of some medicines, as its main component, cinnamaldehyde, activates receptors that metabolize medication. The health risk may depend on the type of cinnamon, with cassia cinnamon containing high levels of the blood thinner coumarin, which can be hazardous for individuals on blood thinners. Individuals with chronic illnesses should be cautious when using cinnamon supplements, and people should talk to their healthcare providers before using any supplements with prescribed medication. While sprinkling cinnamon on coffee is unlikely to cause an issue, highly concentrated cinnamon as a dietary supplement might.</p>

          <p>Cognitive neuroscientist Leor Zmigrod argues in her book, 'The Ideological Brain,' that political beliefs aren't just beliefs but also neurological signatures that change our brains over time. Zmigrod defines ideology as a fixed doctrine resistant to evidence and a fixed identity influencing judgment. She distinguishes ideology from culture by its rigid prescriptions and intolerance of deviation. Cognitive flexibility, tested through unconscious assessments, plays a role in one's comfort with change and ambiguity, impacting political views. Ideologies serve as coping mechanisms, solving the problem of uncertainty for our predictive brains.</p>

The Chinese will also remove the countermeasures that they have in place.

Sekiwake Daieisho, gunning for a big win total that could earn him ozeki promotion, improved to 2-0 by thrusting down No. 2 maegashira Gonoyama.</p>

          <h2>Chimps' Rhythmic Drumming and Complex Calls Hint at Origins of Human Language</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have found two important building blocks of human speech in wild chimpanzees, one of our closest relatives. A pair of studies finds that chimp communication includes both rhythmic structures and call combinations , two key elements of spoken language. The study of rhythmic structures, which appears in the journal Current Biology, analyzed the drumming patterns of chimps from the rainforests in East and West Africa. The study of call combinations focused on two-call combinations, known as bigrams, and found that there is some shift in meaning when these single calls are embedded into these bigrams.</p>
