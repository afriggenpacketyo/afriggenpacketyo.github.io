          <p>King Charles and other senior royals attended the funeral of Katharine, the Duchess of Kent, at Westminster Cathedral, though Queen Camilla was absent due to acute sinusitis. The Prince and Princess of Wales were among the mourners at the Requiem Mass, which marked the first Catholic funeral for a member of the Royal Family in modern times. A message from Pope Leo praised the duchess for her dedication to official duties and care for vulnerable people. Despite her illness, Queen Camilla still plans to participate in the state visit of President Trump later in the week. The score is 75.</p>

          <p>United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence in the airline's expansion plans, citing customer loyalty and the company's product, network, and technology as key factors. Despite an oversupply of flights forcing other airlines to scale back, United's growth is outpacing its rivals. Kirby believes the company's fourth-quarter results will demonstrate the upside when the economy recovers. United is set to grow domestic U.S. capacity by 5.7% in 2025, while U.S. airlines, on average, are expanding by just under 2%. The score is 70.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent believes President Trump's proposal to switch from quarterly to semiannual company earnings reports would be good for investors. Trump argues that this change would allow executives to focus on long-term goals rather than short-term metrics, potentially revitalizing public markets. While companies in the U.K. and E.U. report semiannually, some investors worry that less frequent reporting could reduce transparency and investor protection. Bessent suggests that this move could make the U.S. market more attractive to European companies by lowering compliance costs. (not investment advice) The score is 65.</p>

          <p>Oracle and Silver Lake are reportedly set to play key roles in a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the U.S., with Presidents Trump and Xi expected to discuss the matter. The deal involves a consortium of firms and a blend of new and existing investors, but the extent of Chinese firms' involvement and control over TikTok's algorithm remains unclear. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the commercial terms have been agreed upon, while China has affirmed its commitment to safeguarding the interests of its enterprises. The potential deal follows years of bipartisan concern over national security risks posed by the app. The score is 60.</p>

While Brussels is giving EU gas stocks an extra month to reach 90% capacity, the bloc remains vulnerable to geopolitical shocks and weather volatility.
