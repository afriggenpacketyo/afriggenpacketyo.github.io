          <h2>England to Open Urgent Mental Health Centers Nationwide</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 23:47:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS has announced plans to open specialist mental health crisis centers across England over the next decade, aiming to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These clinics will be accessible to walk-in patients, referrals from GPs, and police, providing specialized care for individuals in acute mental distress. While NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails this as a pioneering model of care, Andy Bell, CEO of the Centre for Mental Health, expresses skepticism, citing concerns about funding and the complexity of separating physical and mental health issues, advocating for robust testing before national rollout. A recent study highlighted the increasing number of people facing long waits in A&E, underscoring the urgent need for improved mental health services.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Army confirmed that air traffic controllers briefly lost contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near the Pentagon on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, which has since been moved. Despite the aircraft continuously broadcasting its location via ADS-B, federal air traffic controllers had difficulty pinpointing the helicopter's precise location, leading to confusion. This incident adds to concerns about close calls between government helicopters and commercial airplanes near the airport, prompting the Army to pause flights into and out of the Pentagon while addressing safety issues with the FAA.</p>

He argues that as the United States becomes more U.S.-centric, AI could become a bargaining chip, making it crucial for Japan to develop its own secure and efficient information systems and cybersecurity capabilities.

          <p>Faced with record-high rice prices, Japanese supermarket operators are increasing sales of cheaper, foreign-grown rice to provide consumers with more affordable options. Aeon Co. will begin selling California-sourced rice at a significantly lower price than domestically-grown rice, while other retailers like Ito-Yokado Co. and Seiyu Co. have also seen strong demand for rice from California and Taiwan. The decision reflects consumer interest in affordable alternatives, as the average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has doubled compared to the previous year due to a poor harvest. This move aims to increase overall rice consumption by offering customers greater choice and affordability.</p>

          <p>With a ban on disposable vapes set to take effect on June 1st, many vapers in the UK are stockpiling the devices, fearing changes in taste and convenience. Retailers have reported a surge in sales as customers buy up popular flavors, while ex-smokers like Baroness Claire Fox express concern that the ban will lead people back to cigarettes. The government aims to reduce environmental impact and deter youth vaping, but critics argue the ban overlooks public health benefits. A recent poll indicates that some vapers will either stockpile by buying abroad or revert to smoking, raising concerns about the ban's effectiveness.</p>

While it's unclear if the departures are directly related to the deal, the move follows Trump's earlier targeting of Paul Weiss for employing individuals critical of him.

          <p>Japan's new farm minister, Shinjiro Koizumi, announced plans to sell government stockpiled rice directly to retailers, aiming for a retail price of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms. The move comes amid mounting criticism of the government's failure to curb rising rice prices. The government is expected to begin procedures for negotiated contracts and explore online sales to ensure broad distribution. The average price of rice in Japanese supermarkets has reached a record high, prompting the government to release 300,000 tons of stockpiled grain.</p>

          <p>A 443-foot cargo ship ran aground in Norway, coming within feet of a cabin as its owner slept. The helmsman of the ship was reportedly asleep at the time of the accident, and only one person was on the bridge.
