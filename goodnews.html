          <p>President Trump's potential acceptance of a free jet from the Qatari royal family has sparked debate regarding Qatar's influence in Washington. Despite past accusations of funding terrorism, Qatar has become a major non-NATO ally and a key mediator in peace negotiations, particularly between Israel and Hamas. The article highlights Qatar's strategic importance to the U.S., citing its role in hostage negotiations and its financial investments in the U.S., including a new Trump Organization golf resort, while also acknowledging concerns about its past support for terror groups. Critics suggest the U.S. has historically turned a blind eye to Qatar's problematic associations due to its strategic usefulness.</p>

The proposed policy involves fully covering expenses for normal deliveries under the public medical insurance system. Currently, normal childbirth is not covered by medical insurance, leading to varying costs among prefectures. The government provides a lump-sum payment of 500,000 yen per childbirth, but delivery costs often exceed this amount.
