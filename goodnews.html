          <p>Germany is seeking to strengthen its collaboration with Israel on cybersecurity, as announced by Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt during a visit to the country. The plan includes establishing a joint cyber-research center and enhancing cooperation between the two nations' intelligence and security agencies. Dobrindt emphasized the need for a significant upgrade in civil defense to bolster Germany's overall defensive capabilities. This move is part of Germany's broader effort to draw upon Israel's defense expertise as it boosts its military and security posture in response to perceived global threats.</p>

          <p>The eastern German city of Magdeburg recently hosted the finals of the country's first dachshund racing competition, drawing a crowd of enthusiastic owners and spectators. A total of 220 short-legged dogs were entered into the event, competing in heats on a 40-meter course. Handlers used whistles, toys, and treats to encourage their dogs toward the finish line in various classes, including miniature and standard breeds. The unique event provided a lighthearted spectacle celebrating a dog breed believed to have originated in Germany in the early 18th century, possibly for hunting badgers.</p>

          <p>Belarusian opposition figure Sergei Tikhanovsky has been released from prison after five years in solitary confinement and is now in exile. Tikhanovsky, who was arrested in 2020 after challenging authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko, was freed along with 13 other political prisoners following a rare visit by a senior US delegation. Despite losing significant weight and enduring harsh conditions, he states his spirit is unbroken and he is determined to continue fighting for a democratic Belarus. His wife, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who became the opposition leader in his absence, expressed caution about the regime's motives.</p>

          <p>As England's women's national football team prepares to defend its European title, key questions about the starting lineup are being answered. A decisive 7-0 victory over Jamaica in their final warm-up match offered strong hints about manager Sarina Wiegman's plans, with players like Jess Carter and Ella Toone making strong cases for their inclusion. The team is also boosted by the return of key players Lauren James and Georgia Stanway from injury. Despite the recent retirement of several experienced players, the squad maintains a confident blend of veteran leadership and emerging talent.</p>

If successful, the 25-year-old would join a very small group of wrestlers who have won their debut tournament as a grand champion. Onosato is the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, the former Kisenosato, achieved the rank in 2017. He expressed a desire to energize his home prefecture of Ishikawa, which was affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake, by achieving success in the prestigious tournament.</p>

          <p>China's customs authority has announced a conditional resumption of seafood imports from certain regions of Japan, partially lifting a ban that was imposed in 2023. The initial suspension followed by a full import ban was a response to Japan's release of treated wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The new measure allows for the import of aquatic products from most of Japan but maintains the prohibition on shipments from ten prefectures, including Fukushima, Tokyo, and Chiba. This move signals a potential, albeit limited, thaw in trade relations between the two nations.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax just one day before the first payments were due, following a halt in trade negotiations by the United States. President Donald Trump had announced he was terminating all trade discussions with Canada in response to the tax, which would have imposed a 3% levy on large tech firms like Amazon and Google. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney stated the move would support a resumption of negotiations for a comprehensive trade arrangement, though the retreat is seen by some as a significant concession to US pressure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trade deal between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, reducing a 25% tariff on British car imports to 10%. The move is expected to unleash pent-up demand for UK-made vehicles like Mini, Aston Martin, and Range Rover, which had seen shipments drop by over half after the tariff was imposed. While the auto industry welcomes the relief, the deal has drawn criticism from British farmers, who argue that agricultural concessions, such as on US beef and ethanol, were used as bargaining chips to secure the agreement for the car industry.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, a growing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration patterns of EVs, particularly the low-frequency slowing caused by regenerative braking systems, are more likely to induce queasiness than conventional cars. Researchers in China and Hong Kong are investigating this issue, noting that motion sickness affects not only passenger comfort but also their health. This research aims to find solutions as the world continues its rapid transition to new energy vehicles.</p>
