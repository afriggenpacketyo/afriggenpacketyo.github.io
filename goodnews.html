          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace was unlawful, stating that efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to dismantle the agency are "null and void." The ruling asserts that President Trump's unilateral action exceeded his constitutional authorities and violated the statute establishing the USIP. The judge criticized the use of law enforcement to carry out the executive order, describing it as a "gross usurpation of power." The ruling allows USIP to continue its work promoting peaceful conflict resolution around the world.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is investigating a brief radio system outage at the Philadelphia air traffic control center responsible for handling flights at Newark Liberty International Airport. The FAA reported that the control center lost radio frequencies for two seconds, though all aircraft "remained safely separated." This marks the fourth such incident at Newark Airport since April 28, amid persistent equipment and staffing issues. The U.S. Transportation Secretary said upgrades to the nation's air traffic control system are underway, including updating the system with new software and equipment in a revamp that will cost "tens of billions of dollars."</p>

          <p>With credit card balances remaining high and interest rates unlikely to decline materially soon, it's important for borrowers to consider their options for debt relief. Credit card interest compounds daily, making it difficult to pay down debt, especially with high interest rates. There are various debt relief options available, including debt consolidation loans, debt management programs, and credit counseling. In some cases, credit card debt forgiveness programs may be an option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent gold price drop opens up new opportunities and risks for precious metal investors. While not dramatically lower than what it had been, the price decline marks an almost 6% decline since late April. In this climate, it is important to re-evaluate gold holdings, consider buying more, remember gold's long-term benefits, explore alternative types, and avoid panicking or rushing to sell. Understanding the broad, long-term dynamics of gold investing helps investors make informed decisions during price fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>
