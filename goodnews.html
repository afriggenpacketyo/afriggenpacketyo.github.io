        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has announced a major trade agreement with Japan, which includes imposing a 15% tariff on Japanese goods imported into the United States. President Trump stated that the deal also involves a commitment from Japan to invest $550 billion in the U.S. and to open its markets further to American products, specifically including cars, trucks, and certain agricultural goods. This agreement follows a period of intense negotiations where the U.S. had threatened higher tariffs, reflecting the administration's broader strategy of using such levies as leverage to restructure global trade relationships and address perceived imbalances.

          <p>The United Nations' highest court, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), is set to deliver a historic advisory opinion on the legal obligations of countries regarding climate change. This action was prompted by a request from the UN General Assembly, led by vulnerable island nations like Vanuatu that face existential threats from rising sea levels. While the court's opinion will be non-binding, it is expected to establish a significant legal precedent for what nations must do to protect the environment from greenhouse gas emissions. This ruling could become a foundational tool for future domestic and international climate-related legal actions and agreements.</p>

          <h2>Singapore's Inflation Rate Holds at Four-Year Low, Paving Way for Potential Policy Easing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 02:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's headline inflation rate held steady at 0.8% in June, remaining at its lowest point in over four years and falling short of economists' forecasts. Core inflation, which excludes volatile transport and accommodation costs, also remained unchanged at 0.6%, providing a clear signal of easing price pressures within the economy. This sustained low-inflation environment gives the Monetary Authority of Singapore significant flexibility to consider easing its monetary policy in its upcoming decision. The central bank remains cautious, citing a subdued domestic growth forecast due to an uncertain global trade environment and the lagging effects of international tariffs on the nation's export-dependent economy.

          <p>Laurent Mekies has taken over as the new team principal and CEO of Red Bull Racing in Formula 1, following the dismissal of Christian Horner. The 48-year-old Frenchman is tasked with reversing the competitive decline the team has experienced over the past 18 months, a key factor in the leadership change. Mekies, who has extensive experience with Ferrari and the FIA, plans to take a listening-first approach to understand the team's dynamics before implementing changes. His immediate goal is to harness the existing talent within the organization that previously produced historically dominant seasons and guide it back to the top without its former high-profile leaders.</p>

          <p>Despite a difficult retail climate in the UK, specialty stores like Duck World, which sells hundreds of varieties of rubber ducks, are managing to stay afloat in prime London locations. The business, co-founded by Irina Fedotova, caters to tourists, collectors, and gift-seekers, leveraging the iconic status of the rubber duck and the "treatonomics" trend where consumers buy small, affordable luxuries. While facing pressures from inflation and rising business costs, the company has built a loyal customer base. Retail analysts suggest that the high-margin, low-production-cost nature of such collectibles provides a buffer against broader economic downturns, though the business model relies on maintaining its novelty appeal.</p>

The rocket was carrying two NASA satellites for the TRACERS mission, designed to study the Earth's magnetosphere. The launch, which was also affected by a ground stop at the local airport, has been rescheduled for the following day, with the rocket and its payload remaining in good condition.</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams achieved a historic milestone at the DC Open, becoming the second-oldest woman in the professional era to win a tour-level singles match at 45 years old. In her first singles victory in nearly two years, Williams defeated 23-year-old Peyton Stearns 6-3, 6-4, showcasing glimpses of her classic power with serves exceeding 110 mph. The victory was particularly meaningful as it marked her return from a long layoff due to surgery. The only player to win a match at an older age was Martina Navratilova, who was 47 in 2004, placing Williams' achievement among the most remarkable feats of longevity in the sport.</p>

          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge after it was announced that the U.S. would lower its tariff on imported vehicles to 15% from a threatened 25%.

The news provided immediate relief to Japan's auto industry, which is a cornerstone of its economy and heavily reliant on exports to the American market. The reduced tariff was part of a broader trade agreement announced by President Trump, which he hailed as a historic deal beneficial to the U.S. economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 13-million-year-old fossilized leg bone of a 'terror bird,' a large, flightless predator, displays distinct teeth marks that scientists believe were made by an even larger reptile. Researchers in Colombia used 3D digital scans to match the bite marks to an extinct caiman species called Purussaurus neivensis, which could grow up to five meters long. The analysis suggests a violent confrontation between two of the era's top predators in the ancient swamps of what is now the Tatacoa Desert. Because the bone shows no signs of healing, scientists conclude the terror bird either died in the attack or was scavenged shortly after, providing rare insight into this prehistoric ecosystem.</p>
