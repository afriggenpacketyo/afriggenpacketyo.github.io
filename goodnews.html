          <p>General Motors (GM) has significantly raised its 2025 financial guidance, surpassing Wall Street's third-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of $2.80 and revenue of $48.59 billion, exceeding analyst estimates. This positive outlook is further bolstered by a reduction in the anticipated impact of tariffs, indicating strong performance heading into the fourth quarter. Despite these gains, the article notes a 57% decrease in net income attributable to stockholders due to a $1.6 billion charge related to its all-electric vehicle strategy, which more than halved its net income compared to the previous year.

          <p>The North Atlantic right whale, among the world's rarest, has shown an encouraging population increase, now estimated at 384 animals. This marks a continued slow growth over four years, a welcome reversal from a 25% decline observed between 2010 and 2020. Scientists credit conservation efforts, especially new Canadian measures, for this positive shift. The article highlights that while threats like ship strikes and fishing gear entanglement remain, the recent birth of 11 calves, including from four new mothers, offers cautious optimism for the species' future. Researchers emphasize the importance of sustaining these measures, noting that the population can quickly change.</p>

          <h2>Southern California Anticipates Light Rain and Thunderstorms This Week</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southern California is expecting light rain and a slight chance of thunderstorms this week, primarily in interior valleys and mountain regions. While the precipitation won't match the intensity of last week's atmospheric river, there's a low but present risk of isolated dry lightning, which could potentially ignite fires, although recent soaking rains have temporarily reduced this danger. The National Weather Service meteorologists indicate that this moisture is unlikely to reverse the overall dry winter outlook, as La Niña conditions, known for driving drought in Southern California, have officially returned. This article highlights the region's continued vulnerability to fire and severe drought despite intermittent rainfall.</p>

          <p>A wild American black bear caused a stir at the Sequoia Park Zoo in Eureka, California, when it was discovered observing the facility's captive bears from outside their habitat. Described as "polite" and non-aggressive, the bear interacted with the zoo animals through the fencing, prompting a response from the Eureka Police Department and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The article highlights that the wild bear's entry method remains unknown despite secure perimeter fencing, suggesting it likely originated from the adjacent Sequoia Park. Officials safely guided the bear back into the woods, emphasizing the importance of maintaining distance from wildlife. The unusual visit sparked playful public commentary online.</p>

          <p>In Madagascar's Bay of Ranobe, scientists are employing an innovative approach to combat hunger and ecosystem collapse by building artificial coral reefs. This article highlights how overfishing, exacerbated by climate-driven migration and widespread deforestation, has devastated natural reefs and the local fishery, impacting the livelihoods of desperately poor coastal communities. The project, led by the nonprofit Reef Doctor, aims to increase fishing areas and improve food security by creating new habitats for marine life, rather than imposing traditional fishing restrictions that often fail in impoverished regions. Researchers are studying the impact of these artificial reefs on both ecosystem health and human well-being.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines flight en route from Denver to Los Angeles was forced to divert to Salt Lake City last week after pilots detected a crack in one of the aircraft's multilayer windshield panels. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is investigating the incident, with WindBorne Systems, a weather balloon company, suggesting one of its balloons may have struck the plane. The windshield is designed to maintain integrity even with a damaged layer, and the NTSB is currently examining the component in its laboratory. This article notes that WindBorne Systems has implemented a software update to reduce its balloons' time at active flight levels and is cooperating fully with the FAA and NTSB.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of cruciate ligament ruptures, a common knee injury, particularly prevalent in competitive sports and among women. It explains the function of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments in knee stabilization and how tears often occur through non-contact movements like sudden twists or stops. The consequences, including pain, swelling, and instability, are detailed, alongside treatment options ranging from surgery to conservative rehabilitation. The article highlights that women face a higher risk due to anatomical, genetic, and hormonal factors, and emphasizes the importance of physiotherapy for recovery and preventing long-term complications like osteoarthritis.</p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was successfully averted after police arrested Billy Cagle, 49, who had allegedly streamed threats to "shoot it up" online. Cagle, a convicted felon reportedly facing mental health challenges, was apprehended inside a terminal, while a semi-automatic AR-15 rifle and ammunition were discovered in his parked truck. Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum credited the swift action of Cagle's family, who alerted authorities, and the rapid, collaborative response of law enforcement for preventing a tragedy.

The operation is part of a broader crackdown on cybercrime, although the region itself is under contested control.
