        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has formally requested that Sainsbury's and Morrisons cease advertising heated tobacco products, citing a 2002 law banning tobacco advertising.  Morrisons argues that the law doesn't apply to heated tobacco, which doesn't produce smoke, while Sainsbury's is in contact with the government.  The government maintains that the law does apply to these products, emphasizing the health risks of all tobacco products.  Surveys show that awareness of heated tobacco products has increased, particularly among young adults.</p>

          <p>A 27-year-old man, Kieran Innes, received a kidney transplant from his 63-year-old father, Brian, enabling him to proceed with his dream wedding and honeymoon.  Kieran was diagnosed with kidney failure at 25, facing the prospect of dialysis three times a week.  His fianc√©e, Lara, rallied their families to seek a live kidney donor, with Brian ultimately being selected.  The transplant has strengthened their father-son bond, and Kieran is now able to enjoy his life without the burden of his illness.</p>

          <p>Reports of a feud between Brooklyn Beckham and his wife, Nicola Peltz, and the rest of the Beckham family threaten to overshadow David Beckham's recent knighthood.  The alleged feud, which began three years ago, has resurfaced recently due to the couple's absence from David Beckham's 50th birthday celebrations.  Experts suggest that the constant media speculation is damaging the family's carefully cultivated public image.  The family's silence on the matter fuels further speculation.</p>
