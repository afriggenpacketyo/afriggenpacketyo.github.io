          <p>Vox reports on a Waymo study suggesting that autonomous vehicles could drastically reduce traffic fatalities. The study, analyzing 56.7 million miles driven without human safety drivers, found significantly fewer crashes and injuries compared to human drivers. Extrapolating the data suggests that widespread adoption of self-driving cars could save approximately 34,000 lives a year in the US. The article acknowledges caveats, such as the limited testing environments and public skepticism, but argues that slowing down autonomous vehicle development is costing lives.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article delves into the human need for belonging and how it's being sought in various ways, from traditional religion to secular communities. It references the author's personal experience leaving the Mormon church and the subsequent flood of stories from readers about their own journeys with faith and community. The article also highlights a global study showing that people flourish when they have strong social connections, and that religion can provide robust communities. Ultimately, the article suggests that meaningful connection is a universal craving in a world often characterized by division.</p>

          <p>This New York Times analysis suggests that the global turmoil caused by President Trump's policies played a role in the re-election of Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. While Albanese did not campaign as an explicitly anti-Trump figure, voters were wary of the economic uncertainty and erratic behavior associated with the U.S. president. The article highlights how the conservative opposition leader's alignment with some of Trump's ideas contributed to his defeat, with voters opting for a more sensible and centrist approach.</p>

          <p>The Guardian highlights the revitalization of traditional facial tattoos among Native American women, particularly within the south-eastern Indigenous nations. The Inchunwa Project is working to reclaim this millennia-old practice, offering opportunities for community members to receive and learn about the tattoos. The tattoos, often done by hand poke, represent a commitment to community, ancestral connection, and personal growth. This revival is part of a broader effort to reclaim traditions after centuries of forced assimilation, affirming that Native American culture is a living, evolving entity.</p>
