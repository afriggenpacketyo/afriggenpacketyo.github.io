          <p>Pattern Group, a major third-party reseller on Amazon, made its public debut on the Nasdaq, with its stock opening at $13.50 per share. The IPO raised $300 million, valuing the Utah-based e-commerce accelerator at approximately $2.5 billion. The company helps over 200 brands, including Nestle and Panasonic, optimize their sales on various online marketplaces. Despite its success, Pattern's prospectus acknowledges significant risks, including its heavy reliance on Amazon's platform and the uncertainty of global trade policies, particularly tariffs between the U.S. and China.

He purchased a local club's license and has invested his own money to build a new team, which has become a unifying force for Russian-speaking immigrants from various post-Soviet nations.

          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence startup, xAI, is reportedly in the process of raising $10 billion in a funding round that values the company at $200 billion. This follows a trend of soaring valuations for AI firms, such as Anthropic and OpenAI. Much of the new capital is expected to be used for building large-scale data centers with advanced GPUs to develop next-generation AI models and to attract top talent. The fundraising occurs despite controversies surrounding its Grok chatbot and its perceived performance lag compared to competitors like OpenAI's GPT models. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After months of delays, the Senate has confirmed Mike Waltz, a former national security adviser to President Trump, as the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. The confirmation fills an eight-month vacancy in the critical diplomatic role just before the U.N. General Assembly's high-level meetings. Waltz's confirmation proceeded despite earlier controversy over his involvement in a Signal chat that disclosed sensitive military details. During his hearing, Waltz emphasized the need for U.N. reform while stressing the importance of U.S. participation to counter China's growing influence and address global conflicts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times, ruling that the legal complaint violated court rules by not providing a "short and plain statement" for the claims. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday characterized the 85-page lawsuit as repetitive, superfluous, and a platform "to rage against an adversary." The judge has given Trump's legal team 28 days to file an amended complaint that conforms to federal court standards. The lawsuit is part of a broader context of the Trump administration's critical stance toward news organizations it deems unfavorable.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cut Lowers Monthly Payments for Large Mortgages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 13:53:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut has led to a notable decrease in mortgage rates, providing financial relief to homebuyers. The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to around 6.13%, its lowest point in nearly three years. For a $750,000 mortgage, this reduction translates to a monthly payment of approximately $4,560, saving homeowners over $450 per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of 2025. This shift enhances affordability for new buyers and creates significant refinancing opportunities for existing homeowners looking to lower their long-term interest costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minneapolis Federal Reserve President Neel Kashkari has indicated his support for two more interest rate cuts before the end of the year, in addition to the one just approved. He believes that the inflationary impact of President Trump's tariffs will likely be a temporary, "one-time effect," leaving room for more accommodative monetary policy. Kashkari's more dovish stance is influenced by a weakening labor market and contained inflation expectations, despite current inflation running above the Fed's 2% target. He emphasized that the central bank is not comfortable with 3% inflation but sees easing conditions ahead. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The governments of the United Kingdom and Ireland have unveiled a new joint framework aimed at addressing the legacy of the Northern Ireland Troubles. The deal is intended to replace the UK's widely opposed Legacy Act, which had included a conditional amnesty and caused a rift between the two nations. Northern Ireland Secretary Hilary Benn called the previous act "flawed and undeliverable," while Irish Deputy PM Simon Harris described the new agreement as an "honest attempt" at reconciliation. Key components include cross-border cooperation, reforms to the legacy commission, and the restoration of inquests that had been halted.</p>

          <p>The book publishing industry is grappling with the rise of artificial intelligence, treating it as both a legal threat and a compelling new subject for authors. While publishers are suing AI companies like Anthropic for copyright infringement over training models on pirated texts, they are also releasing a wave of books exploring the technology. These works range from fiction novels where chatbots replace loved ones to non-fiction debates between AI "doomers" and "accelerationists." Some authors, like Vauhini Vara in her memoir "Searches," are even incorporating interactions with AI into their creative process, using it as a tool to provoke new ways of thinking.</p>

          <p>In a dissenting opinion among his colleagues, newly appointed Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran stated he does not believe President Trump's tariffs will cause significant macroeconomic inflation. Miran, who was the lone vote against the recent quarter-point rate cut in favor of a larger half-point reduction, argued there is no evidence that import-intensive goods are inflating at a faster pace. He attributed some recent price pressures to immigration's effect on shelter costs, suggesting that stricter border policies could have a disinflationary effect. His views place him in the minority on the Federal Open Market Committee regarding the economic impact of trade policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong confirmed on social media that the account recovery was complete, following public comments from Durant and his agent about their inability to resolve the issue. The situation has drawn attention to broader customer service challenges at the cryptocurrency exchange, with many users sharing similar frustrations. When Durant first invested, Bitcoin was trading for under $1,000; it is now valued at around $116,000, meaning his forced holding period proved highly profitable.</p>

The lawsuit also claims Ticketmaster engages in deceptive "bait-and-switch" pricing tactics.

Other specialized funds focus on "fabless" chipmakers that design but do not manufacture chips.
