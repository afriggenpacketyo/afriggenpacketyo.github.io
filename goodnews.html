The call precedes Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's visit to the White House, where he will meet with President Trump to discuss a potential peace deal with Russia. European leaders have expressed support for the diplomatic efforts but emphasize that any agreement must involve President Zelensky and respect Ukraine's sovereignty. This united front aims to ensure robust security guarantees for Ukraine are a key component of any final settlement to end the war.</p>

          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet that had been lost by a Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan eleven years prior. The wallet, containing an employee ID, cash, and gift cards, had apparently fallen from the worker's pocket into the vehicle's airbox during assembly in 2014. After finding the owner on Facebook, the mechanic mailed the wallet back to him, much to the original owner's surprise. The retired autoworker was pleased to find that the $250 in Cabela's gift cards he had planned to use for Christmas were still valid after more than a decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in China are developing a hypersonic drone carrier concept featuring a unique rotating 'scissor wing' design, reviving an idea once explored by NASA. The proposed aircraft would have a single, centrally mounted wing that adjusts its angle based on speed. At low speeds, the wing would be perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, but as it approaches Mach 5, it would pivot to become parallel, merging with the aircraft's body to function as a 'waverider.' This innovative design aims to solve the challenge of maintaining both low-speed efficiency and high-speed stability in a single airframe.</p>

          <p>A former software CEO has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, owner Mike Conner undertook the immense challenge of making the off-grid island habitable, a process that involved helicopters for supplies and cutting through rock for plumbing. Now equipped with 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub, the historic fortress that once protected against French naval attacks is back on the market as a unique private venue.</p>

          <p>With food prices rising, parents are employing meticulous planning and creative cooking to manage the increased cost of feeding children during the school summer holidays. Strategies include stocking freezers with 'yellow-sticker' reduced-price items, batch cooking meals, and organizing the fridge to ensure food with the nearest use-by date is used first. Some parents also pre-portion daily snacks into separate bags to prevent them from being consumed too quickly. These tactics have become essential for many families as the absence of subsidized school meals adds significant pressure to household budgets.</p>

          <p>A group of GCSE students have opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago, during the COVID-19 lockdown of 2021. As 11-year-olds just starting secondary school, they wrote about their fears of the pandemic, their hopes for the future, and more personal questions. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill hope during a disruptive period, provided a moment of reflection for the students as they prepared to receive their exam results. The letters captured the unique challenges their cohort faced, with an education shaped by remote learning and social distancing measures.</p>

          <p>During his summit in Alaska, President Donald Trump hand-delivered a personal letter from First Lady Melania Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin. The letter addresses the plight of children affected by the Russia-Ukraine war, appealing to Putin to help restore their safety and innocence. While the letter does not explicitly mention the alleged abduction of Ukrainian children by Russia, for which Putin faces an international arrest warrant, Ukrainian officials expressed gratitude for the First Lady's efforts. The gesture highlights a humanitarian focus amidst the high-stakes political negotiations aimed at ending the conflict.</p>
