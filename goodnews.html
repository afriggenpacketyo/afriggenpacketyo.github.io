        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to unveil its proposed countermeasures against potential tariffs imposed by the United States. European Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic announced that further details would be released on Thursday, outlining possible rebalancing measures and areas for future discussions. The EU aims for a negotiated solution that respects their interests and regulatory autonomy, but requires the U.S. to demonstrate readiness for a fair deal. These actions are in response to Trump-era tariffs on goods from the EU, including those on foreign cars, steel and aluminum imports, with the EU having previously paused its retaliatory measures targeting U.S. goods.
