        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Post Office has agreed to compensate hundreds of former sub-postmasters after a data breach accidentally leaked their names and addresses on its corporate website, a mistake described by the then-Post Office chief executive as a "truly terrible error". Individual payouts of up to ¬£5,000 will be provided, with the potential for higher sums for those pursuing further claims. The law firm Freeths secured the payouts on behalf of affected sub-postmasters, many of whom were already involved in a separate battle for compensation related to the Horizon IT scandal. Chris Head, a former sub-postmaster, expressed relief but noted the prolonged effort required to address the issue.</p>

          <p>Kim Kardashian's recent appearance in a Paris courtroom, adorned with millions of dollars in diamonds, marks a reclamation of her freedom and identity following a traumatic robbery in 2016. The article contrasts the current media response with the victim-blaming that Kardashian faced after the robbery, highlighting a shift towards greater sensitivity towards female celebrities. Kardashian's choice to wear extravagant jewelry is interpreted as a deliberate act of reclaiming her narrative and defying past criticisms of conspicuous consumption. The article suggests that Kardashian has successfully rebuilt her brand and influence, demonstrating that there is no such thing as being "too public" about your wealth in today's media landscape.</p>

          <h2>Experts Explain Delayed Prostate Cancer Diagnosis for Former President Biden</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 18:46:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the announcement that former President Joe Biden was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer, oncology experts explained why the diagnosis may have occurred relatively late. Factors include the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force's recommendations against PSA-based screening for men age 70 and older, the possibility that the cancer grew rapidly between screenings, or that screening results were borderline. Experts emphasize that it is common for patients with advanced prostate cancer to be asymptomatic, and shared decision-making between patients and physicians is crucial in determining screening and treatment options.</p>

          <p>The federal government plans to sell the historic U.S. Courthouse in downtown Los Angeles as part of a broader effort to reduce its real estate holdings. The 14-story Art Moderne building, designed by Gilbert Stanley Underwood, housed federal courts and agencies before a new courthouse opened nearby in 2016. Real estate experts estimate the property could sell for around $60 million, attracting interest from wealthy individuals or family offices willing to redevelop the site, possibly into apartments. Concerns have been raised about the rapid sale of a building central to the city's civic center.</p>

          <p>Researchers are deploying specially trained dogs to combat the spread of the invasive spotted lanternfly, which damages trees and fruit crops. These dogs can sniff out the insect's eggs, helping to eradicate them before they hatch. In Cleveland, four dogs have already uncovered over 4,000 egg masses, potentially eliminating as many as 200,000 lanternflies. The dogs, trained through a Virginia Tech University research project, are rewarded with treats for each egg mass they find.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's and Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) takeover and dismantling of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) were unlawful. The ruling orders the reinstatement of USIP's acting president, George Moose, and deems the officials who replaced him "illegitimately installed". The judge emphasized that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The ruling is another in a series of judicial rebukes of efforts by President Trump and DOGE to reduce the size of the federal government.</p>

          <p>Cathie Wood, founder of Ark Invest, believes that healthcare, specifically drug discovery, is the most overlooked sector set to benefit from artificial intelligence. Wood argues that AI is dramatically reducing the time and cost associated with drug development, and the market has yet to fully recognize this potential. She also believes the U.S. is entering a more innovation-friendly environment, which will further boost overlooked sectors. Wood's strategy aligns with Ark's focus on identifying long-term growth stories that have not yet been priced into the market.</p>

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer emphasized the need to move on from past Brexit debates and find practical solutions.
