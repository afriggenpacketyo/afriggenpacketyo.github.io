          <p>Sony Group Corp. shares experienced a rise amidst choppy trading after the company announced a share buyback program worth up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the last quarter beat analyst estimates, though it was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed a partial spinoff of its financial unit, planning to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. The outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was lackluster.</p>

          <p>A new book reveals that Joe Biden's aides privately discussed the possibility of him needing a wheelchair if he won re-election, citing concerns about the degeneration of his spine. The book also highlights the White House's efforts to conceal the reality of Biden's condition during his re-election campaign. The article quotes sources indicating that Biden's doctor warned staff that he was trying to keep the president alive.

          <p>The United States and China have reduced their recently imposed tariffs on each other's imports and suspended reciprocal duties for 90 days, following high-level trade talks in Switzerland. The U.S. administration cut tariffs on Chinese imports to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China reduced its retaliatory tariffs to 10 percent from 125 percent. However, both countries will retain a portion of the tariffs, which will be negotiated during the 90-day pause. During the talks, China agreed to suspend or remove nontariff countermeasures, including export controls on rare-earth minerals.</p>

The song, which includes the phrase "Heil Hitler" and artwork resembling a swastika, has been banned on platforms like Spotify and YouTube but remains on X.

          <p>Family offices are facing a talent crunch as they struggle to find qualified money managers to handle the wealth of the ultra-rich. The number of family offices is expected to grow significantly by 2030, leading to a shortage of advisors. Family offices prioritize trust and long-term relationships over other criteria when hiring, which limits the pool of potential candidates. Young employees are often reluctant to work at family offices due to the lack of clear corporate structure and career progression. </p>
