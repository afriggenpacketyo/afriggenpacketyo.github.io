          <p>With interest rates on high-yield savings accounts currently over 4%, savers can earn significant returns on large deposits. A $20,000 deposit in an account with a 4.35% APY could earn approximately $870 in interest over one year, assuming the rate remains constant. However, these accounts have variable rates that are expected to decline if the Federal Reserve cuts its benchmark rate later this year. This makes it impossible to predict exact long-term earnings, but highlights the current opportunity to capitalize on elevated rates. (not investment advice)</p>

He ran four runs before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run victory for India.

          <p>This article compares the earning potential of a $10,000 deposit in a 6-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a money market account. With current rates, a CD at 4.45% APY would earn slightly more over six months than a money market account at 4.32% APY. The key difference is that the CD rate is fixed, guaranteeing the return, whereas the money market account rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates. This makes a CD a more predictable option for maximizing interest in the short term. (not investment advice)</p>
