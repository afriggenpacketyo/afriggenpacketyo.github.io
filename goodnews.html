          <p>Shares of clean energy companies, including NextEra Energy and AES, experienced a notable increase after a controversial tax on solar and wind projects was removed from the Senate's version of a major Republican spending bill. The proposed tax would have targeted projects using components from foreign entities like China, potentially adding a $7 billion burden to the industry. While its removal provided immediate relief and a stock market boost, industry groups like SEIA and ACP remain critical of the overall bill, warning that it still undermines renewable energy expansion by phasing out key tax credits.

          <p>Spanish banking giant Santander has announced a deal to acquire UK lender TSB from its owner, Sabadell, for ¬£2.65 billion. If approved, the takeover would create Britain's second-largest bank by personal current accounts and likely lead to the TSB brand disappearing from the High Street as it is integrated into Santander UK. While the companies describe it as an exciting new chapter, the merger is expected to result in job losses, particularly in duplicated back-office roles, and potential branch closures as Santander continues its shift towards digital banking.</p>

Website owners using Cloudflare's services will now have to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their content, and a new model will allow them to charge for this access. This policy shift addresses concerns that AI companies are training their models on vast amounts of web data without compensating publishers, thereby depriving them of traffic and revenue.

The proposal, which differs slightly between the House and Senate versions, would offer an additional deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers over 65, phasing out for higher-income individuals. This approach differs from President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate all taxes on Social Security benefits, a change prohibited under the reconciliation process used to pass the bill.

The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by 19 state attorneys general, who argued the plan would cause "devastating consequences" to public health services. The judge found there was "no rational basis" for the restructuring and that the executive branch does not have the authority to implement such wholesale changes to congressionally created agencies without authorization.</p>
