          <p>Viktor Gyokeres, once a little-known player who never played a Premier League game for Brighton, has transformed into a highly sought-after striker in Europe after scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting CP. Despite Rio Ferdinand's skepticism about his suitability for the Premier League, top clubs like Arsenal, Juventus, and Al-Hilal are interested in acquiring him. Sporting's president states they have not received an offer, but would consider one above ¬£59m. Gyokeres' journey from loan spells in the Championship and Germany to Champions League success highlights his remarkable development and potential. </p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions, Chinese companies are increasingly focused on global expansion, with the U.S. being a key market. Camera company Insta360, for example, saw its shares soar after a Shanghai listing, noting that the U.S., Europe, and China each account for over 23% of its revenue. Other companies like CATL and Roborock are also expanding globally, building international brands with local offices and employees. This trend reflects a shift from manufacturing for foreign brands to building independent international brands, driven by slower growth in China and a desire to meet consumer needs worldwide.

This development positions China for significant advancements in artificial intelligence, 6G, and quantum computing. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's use of TFLN material may lead to gains in technical performance. The production line is the result of 15 years of research, overcoming challenges related to the brittle nature of TFLN. </p>
