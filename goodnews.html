        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Met Office issued a yellow warning for thunderstorms across southern England and Wales, predicting potential disruption to transport and services. The warning, in effect until 6 PM BST, anticipates 10-15mm of rain within an hour, with some areas possibly receiving 30-40mm over several hours. The weather agency cautioned about frequent lightning, hail, and strong winds as additional hazards. The storms are expected to ease off in the west by mid-afternoon, but isolated thunderstorms may still occur elsewhere in the UK. The warning highlights the contrast with the dry spring and the challenges of predicting localized thunderstorm activity.</p>

          <p>WorldPride 2025 concludes in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade, marking the first time the city has hosted the international LGBTQ+ festival since its inception in 2000. This year also commemorates the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., traditionally one of the largest celebrations in the country. However, organizers note that the current political environment, including executive orders limiting the rights of trans people, has dampened the excitement. Despite some corporate sponsors withdrawing support, law enforcement is preparing for a large celebration, though the National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park has sparked controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Foot care experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore, achy feet, focusing on strengthening and increasing blood flow. These exercises include foot doming to target the 'foot core,' wall stretches for plantar fasciitis relief, and toe spreads to improve flexibility and stability. Toe yoga can enhance balance, while calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles and ligaments. The final exercise involves massaging the feet to relieve tension and promote gratitude. Regular foot exercises can reduce injury risk, alleviate pain, and improve overall foot health, but consulting a healthcare provider is advised for those with pre-existing foot conditions.</p>

It remains uncertain whether Saka will participate in the friendly against Senegal on June 10.
