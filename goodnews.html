          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed 2,000-year-old wall paintings from a Roman villa in Central London, piecing together thousands of fragments of wall plaster. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, revealing details about the affluence of the area during Roman times, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London". The team is still searching for a missing fragment bearing the artist's name, scored with the Latin word "Fecit," meaning "has made this." The find suggests a thriving settlement outside of central Roman London, indicating the Romans' commitment to settling and investing in the city.</p>

Justin Wrobleski provided stellar relief, and Will Smith secured the win with a walk-off home run in the ninth inning.

          <p>Faced with rising tariffs, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions. This legal practice involves reclassifying products under different "harmonized system codes" to qualify for lower tariff rates. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum elements to qualify for lower duties, and clothing companies modifying designs to fit into different categories. The Supreme Court has previously ruled such practices legal, as long as goods are honestly presented to customs officers.</p>

Nippon Steel finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly-owned subsidiary after receiving approval from President Trump, reversing his initial opposition.
