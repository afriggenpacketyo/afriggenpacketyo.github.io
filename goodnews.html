          <p>The stock market has experienced a significant rally, driven by positive developments in U.S. tariff negotiations and easing trade tensions with China. Many stocks have benefited, with nine portfolio stocks gaining over 20% in the past month. Disney shares surged along with other economically sensitive names on hopes that a tariff-driven recession can be avoided now that trade tensions are cooling. Broadcom is one of the top monthly performers due to the AI chipmaker doing substantial business overseas, with China accounting for 20% of its overall revenue in 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA will continue approving updated COVID-19 vaccines for seniors and high-risk individuals but will require vaccine makers to conduct new clinical trials for broader use. This decision means many Americans without underlying conditions may not have access to updated shots this fall. The agency cited concerns over the one-size-fits-all regulatory framework for past boosters and is urging new randomized studies, particularly in adults aged 50-64. Experts have raised concerns about limiting booster options and the transparency of the FDA's decision-making process.</p>

          <p>Lowe's has reaffirmed its full-year forecast, driven by increasing sales to home professionals, which are compensating for reduced demand from do-it-yourself customers. The company's first-quarter earnings slightly missed Wall Street expectations, but earnings per share exceeded estimates. Despite unfavorable weather conditions impacting sales, growth in online sales and professional customer engagement contributed positively.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has announced that the top-selling RAV4 SUV will be exclusively offered as a hybrid or plug-in hybrid model starting in 2026, eliminating the traditional gas engine option. The decision is driven by the growing popularity and customer demand for hybrid vehicles. This move aligns with Toyota's broader strategy to expand its hybrid offerings, despite the slower-than-expected adoption of all-electric vehicles. Roughly half of RAV4 sales last year were hybrids, and the company expects to continue growing its hybrid offerings, including additional plug-in hybrid electric vehicle offerings.</p>

          <p>A new report indicates that requiring employees to work in the office five days a week is an outdated practice. The study suggests that telework offers advantages in productivity, culture, and resilience when leaders embrace strategic culture-building, robust performance tracking, and available regulatory guidance.

          <p>The Northern Jaguar Project (NJP) is working to conserve jaguars in Sonora, Mexico, by partnering with ranchers. Through the Viviendo con Felinos program, ranchers place motion cameras on their land, and NJP pays them for photos of wild cats, turning jaguars from a perceived threat into a source of income. This approach is changing attitudes towards jaguars and expanding protected areas, as ranchers become more tolerant of their presence. The success of the program is also benefiting efforts to restore jaguars to the US.</p>
