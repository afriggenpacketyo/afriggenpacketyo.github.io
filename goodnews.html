        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil and China have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the feasibility of a transcontinental railway connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast with Peru's Pacific port of Chancay. The proposed 4,500-kilometer railway could dramatically reduce shipping times to Asia by up to 12 days, offering an alternative to the Panama Canal route. The project's estimated cost exceeds $70 billion, but the current agreement is limited to technical, environmental, and economic studies that are expected to take up to five years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has eliminated its long-standing requirement for passengers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints nationwide. The policy, instituted in 2006 after an attempted shoe-bombing, was officially ended by Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who stated the change aims to improve the travel experience while maintaining safety. Previously, only members of the TSA PreCheck program were exempt. While the change is expected to shorten security lines, TSA officers will retain the discretion to request shoe removal for additional screening if necessary.</p>

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares of Amazon stock, valued at approximately $665.8 million, over two days in July. This transaction is part of a pre-announced plan to sell up to 25 million shares of the company through May 2026. Bezos, who stepped down as CEO in 2021, remains Amazon's largest shareholder with a stake valued at nearly $200 billion. The sale occurred shortly after his high-profile wedding to Lauren Sanchez in Venice, which was attended by numerous celebrities.</p>

          <p>Chelsea secured a place in the Club World Cup final after defeating Brazilian side Fluminense, thanks to two powerful goals from their new forward, João Pedro. The former Fluminense star scored in each half, first with a dipping long-range shot and second with a rising drive off the crossbar, leading his team to a decisive victory. The match was played in difficult, hot conditions at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. Chelsea will now face either Paris Saint-Germain or Real Madrid in the final, with a chance to win £97 million in prize money.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the USS New Orleans, a famed U.S. warship, resting on the seafloor in the Solomon Islands. The heavy cruiser's bow was torn off by a Japanese torpedo during the Battle of Tassafaronga in November 1942, an event that killed over 180 crew members. Despite the catastrophic damage, the crew heroically saved the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service. The discovery was made by the Ocean Exploration Trust during seafloor mapping and confirmed by international experts.</p>

A letter-writing campaign from her community drew the attention of House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who intervened on her behalf. Although she had been denied asylum decades ago, she was allowed to remain in the country under supervision due to her good character.</p>

          <p>With a Federal Reserve meeting approaching, savers are encouraged to act strategically to capitalize on currently high Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates. The article suggests that before potential rate cuts, individuals should carefully calculate deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties. It also recommends shopping at online banks, which often provide higher returns than traditional institutions, and locking in a favorable rate as soon as one is found. This proactive approach can help protect savings and maximize interest earnings in a changing economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review of 'Superman' Finds Film Entertaining but Lacking Sincere Heroism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new "Superman" movie, directed by James Gunn, presents a rebooted hero who is more impulsive and overwhelmed than idealistic, according to this review. The film pits Superman, played by David Corenswet, against Lex Luthor in a plot that is described as impatient but entertaining, filled with quirky side characters and action. While the movie avoids the cynicism of recent superhero films, it struggles to convey sincerity, making the Man of Steel come off as somewhat obtuse. The review suggests the film is more confident with its comedic, pop-punk tone than with moments of genuine earnestness.</p>
