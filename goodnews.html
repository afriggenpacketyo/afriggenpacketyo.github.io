          <h2>American Eagle Stock Rises Amid Meme Stock Rally Fueled by Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:37:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Eagle Outfitters' stock experienced a significant jump, positioning it as the latest "meme stock" to attract attention from individual investors. The rally is partly attributed to high short interest and the company's inherent brand recognition, amplified by a new denim campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. This surge follows similar volatile trading for other companies like GoPro and Krispy Kreme earlier in the week. American Eagle's executive creative director highlighted Sweeney's allure in promoting the brand's denim, which is leaning into the growing preference for the fabric amid a boom in Western styles. This action provides a reprieve for the stock, which had tumbled about 35% in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom and India have signed a "landmark" free trade agreement, hailed by UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a blueprint for shared prosperity. The deal, described as the UK's most economically significant since Brexit, is expected to create over 2,200 British jobs and boost the UK economy by £4.8 billion annually. It includes lower tariffs on a wide range of goods, from Indian textiles, footwear, and jewelry to British gin, whisky, and aerospace parts, making trade easier and more affordable. Beyond economic benefits, the agreement also strengthens collaboration in defense, education, climate, technology, and enhanced intelligence sharing to tackle organized crime.

          <p>An arrest has been made in Arizona, four decades after the cold-case murder and sexual assault of two teenagers in Burney, California. Roger Neil Schmidt Sr., now 64, was apprehended after forensic genetic genealogy linked his DNA to the crime scene. In December 1984, Terrance Arndt was fatally shot while protecting a female victim who was then sexually assaulted and left for dead. The Shasta County Sheriff's Office, which pursued the case for years with "thousands of hours" of work, expressed hope that the arrest brings closure to the female victim and Arndt's family. The sheriff acknowledged the profound and lasting trauma the crime inflicted on the community.</p>

          <h2>Researcher Highlights Unexpected Benefits of Four-Day Workweek Trials</h2>

          <p>Economist and sociologist Juliet Schor, a lead researcher with 4 Day Week, has detailed surprising benefits from global four-day workweek experiments. Her studies, involving hundreds of organizations and thousands of employees across several countries, reveal not only maintained productivity but also significant improvements in employee well-being, including reduced burnout, stress, and anxiety, and better mental and physical health. Unexpectedly, second job-holding decreased, and the pace of work did not accelerate, indicating a company-wide reorganization rather than just harder work. Despite these positive outcomes, Schor notes that managerial control and ingrained five-day week norms are barriers to wider adoption, though AI advancements could accelerate the shift by increasing productivity and necessitating fewer hours.</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the SUPPLY Act, has been introduced in the House, aiming to make it easier for homeowners to finance the construction of Accessory Dwelling Units (ADUs), such as granny flats or backyard cottages. The bill would allow homeowners to take out government-backed second mortgages, addressing a current financing gap that disproportionately affects lower- and middle-income households, who often rely on cash or home equity loans. This proposal seeks to help alleviate the U.S. housing shortage of approximately 4 million homes by boosting supply, especially in high-demand states like New York and California. ADUs can also provide homeowners with crucial rental income to offset rising housing costs, though local zoning laws remain a barrier.</p>

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet Public Health suggests that walking just 7,000 steps a day can significantly boost brainpower and protect against various diseases, including cancer, dementia, and heart disease. This finding offers a more realistic and evidence-based target than the commonly cited 10,000 steps, which originated from a 1960s Japanese marketing campaign. The research, based on data from over 160,000 adults globally, found that 7,000 steps was linked to reduced risks of cardiovascular disease (25%), cancer (6%), dementia (38%), and depression (22%). Even modest activity, like 4,000 steps, showed benefits compared to very low activity, encouraging people to spread physical activities throughout the day.</p>

          <p>Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates are currently offering strong returns, surpassing the present inflation rate and providing a secure way to save money. These accounts allow investors to lock in today's high rates for a specified term, offering stability and predictability for savings, and are generally FDIC or NCUA insured up to $250,000. Leading online banks are providing competitive rates, with 6-month CDs reaching 4.45% APY and 1-year CDs at 4.40% APY, significantly higher than national averages. Financial experts recommend considering short-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve, where shorter terms currently offer higher rates, and suggest laddering CDs to take advantage of these favorable conditions while maintaining liquidity.

          <p>Garry Ringrose, a player for the British and Irish Lions, has withdrawn from the second Test against Australia due to lingering concussion symptoms, a decision lauded by former rugby players as a significant step for player safety. Despite being set to make his Test debut, Ringrose selflessly reported symptoms after training, highlighting increased awareness and seriousness around head injuries in the sport. This decision underscores the effectiveness of protocols like 'smart' mouthguards, which register impact, and World Rugby's head injury assessment process, which allows for belated symptoms. Experts praise Ringrose for prioritizing his long-term health, setting a powerful example in professional rugby, especially given increased focus on concussion following legal actions by former players.</p>

          <p>Current mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates present a mixed landscape for homebuyers and those looking to refinance, with high rates and limited inventory posing challenges. As of July 24, 2025, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.79%, while 15-year rates are at 6.01%, with refinance rates slightly higher. Experts suggest that a strong credit score in the mid- to high-700s can help secure better rates, and shopping around among different lenders is crucial, even beyond one's current mortgage provider. Borrowers may also see some relief if the Federal Reserve pauses rate hikes, potentially stabilizing mortgage rates. Understanding loan terms, fees, and locking in rates are vital steps for securing an affordable option. (not investment advice)</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen highlighted China's efforts in fast-tracking licenses for these materials, emphasizing that a reliable supply is crucial for Europe and aligns with China's long-term economic and strategic interests. The deal seeks to repair trust in their trade relationship, which had been strained by China's earlier imposition of licensing requirements in April in response to U.S. tariffs, causing temporary production halts at some European carmakers.

Walsh, who has played for Barcelona, emphasized the respect between the teams and the importance of the players receiving proper recognition for their incredible football. She highlighted that the World Cup win did not bring the expected spotlight to the Spanish team due to the off-field issues, which she found disappointing as a professional.</p>
