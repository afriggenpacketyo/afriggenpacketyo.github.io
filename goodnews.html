          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut off forecasters' access to a critical satellite data program used for hurricane prediction. The decision to suspend the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data had sparked alarm among scientists, who warned it could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) cited a request from NASA for the delay, stating the original move was intended to mitigate a significant cybersecurity risk. The data is also vital for tracking changes in polar sea ice.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new initiative called "Organizing Summer" to drive voter registration and engagement ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The effort aims to learn from the party's 2024 defeats and connect with voters in non-traditional settings, with an initial six-figure investment planned. The program will focus on key battleground districts and states, utilizing thousands of volunteers to communicate the party's message and counter the Republican agenda. This move comes as national Democrats seek to project unity and focus on future elections after recent internal party disputes.</p>

Lululemon is seeking damages for lost profits and a court order to stop Costco from manufacturing and selling the contested items.

          <p>England's victory over India in the first Test was significantly influenced by the performance of fast bowler Josh Tongue, particularly his ability to quickly dismiss India's lower-order batsmen. An analysis highlights that India's last four wickets contributed minimal runs in both innings, with Tongue taking three wickets in each. His aggressive and intimidating bowling style, which dismantled the tail with a triple wicket-maiden in the second innings, is seen as a key art in modern Test cricket. The ability to "kill the tail" is considered a crucial factor for England's future success, especially in the upcoming Ashes series.</p>
