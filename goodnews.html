          <p>This article reflects on the significant cultural impact of young adult literature, particularly Judy Blume's 1975 novel "Forever," which marks its 50th anniversary. The book is remembered as a rite of passage for many teenagers, offering a rare depiction of sexuality from a female protagonist's perspective during a period of social change. The article argues that such novels provide young readers a crucial opportunity to see their own anxieties and desires reflected, validating their internal experiences. It posits that the art and literature discovered during adolescence hold a unique power, helping individuals to understand themselves and imagine their futures.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman to work as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Davis broke significant barriers in the 1960s, a time when the news industry was dominated by white men, and became a trusted and respected figure in Bay Area media. Throughout her career, she covered major historical events, from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning eight regional Emmy Awards. Colleagues and public figures, including Oakland Mayor Barbara Lee, remembered her as a mentor who opened doors for a new generation of journalists through her integrity, courage, and perseverance.</p>

This asset class, which involves lending to companies by non-bank institutions, has traditionally been available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new ETF aims to provide a liquid and efficient vehicle for indirect exposure to business development companies (BDCs) that invest in private credit. Proponents highlight that private credit can offer attractive income streams, potentially yielding double-digit distribution yields for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD has publicly addressed Berkshire Hathaway's decision to sell its remaining stake in the company, framing the move as a normal part of investing. A BYD executive expressed gratitude for the 17 years of support from Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger, emphasizing that buying and selling stocks is Berkshire's business. Despite the amicable statement, BYD's shares fell over 6% in Hong Kong following the news. The divestment comes as BYD shows signs of cooling growth, having recently cut its 2025 sales target and reported its first quarterly profit decline in over three years. (not investment advice)</p>

In his retirement, he became a dedicated advocate for the legacy of the Tuskegee Airmen, who were collectively awarded the Congressional Gold Medal in 2007.</p>

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has relocated to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, where he lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month. His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill for his master's degree studies, and part-time work teaching English. Ryan contrasts his current lifestyle, which allows him to focus on personal happiness and goals, with the financial pressures and lack of motivation he felt in the United States. He describes Vietnam as a safe and calm country where the lower cost of living removes the constant feeling of being in "survival mode," enabling a more fulfilling and human experience.</p>

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investor with a 3.65% stake, is calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), a major out-of-home advertising company. This move follows a previous activist campaign by Legion Partners in 2023, which prompted CCO to divest its European and Latin American businesses to become a U.S. pure-play. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has underperformed, trading at a lower multiple than its peers. Anson argues that a sale is now the most viable path forward, as the streamlined company is a more attractive acquisition target for potential buyers like JCDecaux, Lamar, or private equity firms.

          <p>Colorado-based modular homebuilder Fading West is positioning itself as a solution to the national housing shortage and affordability crisis. By constructing homes in a 110,000-square-foot factory, the company claims it can reduce costs by up to 20% and cut delivery time in half compared to traditional on-site construction. The company recently demonstrated its rapid production capabilities by building 82 homes in two months for residents displaced by the 2023 wildfires in Lahaina, Maui. While modular construction currently represents a small fraction of the housing market, proponents believe its efficiency and controlled building process could be key to making home ownership more attainable for many Americans.</p>

          <p>This article provides advice for interracial couples on how to navigate conversations about race, culture, and family dynamics. Experts recommend that couples openly discuss their differences early on to build understanding and prevent future conflicts. A key strategy is to co-create a unique family culture by blending traditions from both partners, rather than having one dominate. When disagreements arise, negotiation and curiosity are essential tools to find compromises that respect both individuals' backgrounds. The article also stresses the importance of establishing a united front to support each other when facing biases from family or the community.</p>

          <p>Georg Stefan Troller, a celebrated journalist and writer known for his unconventional television interviews, has died at the age of 103. Born in Vienna to a Jewish family, Troller fled the Nazis at 16, later returning to Europe as a U.S. soldier who helped interpret during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp. He became famous for his German television show "Personenbeschreibung" (Describing People), where he conducted sensitive and insightful interviews with international figures like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen. Troller viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing" after losing 19 relatives in the Holocaust, using his craft to explore the human condition.</p>

Imani underwent successful brain surgery at Holtz Children's Hospital in Miami, followed by 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the course of a year.

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing new cockpit alert technology, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react to potential runway hazards and prevent collisions. The system was demonstrated by recreating recent near-disasters, showing how it provides clear audio and visual warnings like "Traffic on runway!" when a collision is imminent. The development comes amid rising concerns over serious runway incursions at U.S. airports, which peaked in 2023. While not yet required by regulators, safety experts and some airlines are embracing these advanced alerts as a critical layer of protection in increasingly congested airport environments.</p>

          <p>The "dirty soda" trend, which involves mixing soda with flavored syrups and cream, has surged from its origins at the Utah-based chain Swig to become a national phenomenon influencing major food and beverage companies. Propelled by social media, the customizable drink concept is being adopted by fast-food giants like Taco Bell and TGI Fridays. In response, PepsiCo is launching ready-to-drink versions, such as "Dirty Dew," to capitalize on the craze. This trend is credited with helping to revive the sluggish carbonated soft drink category by attracting younger consumers and providing an accessible, affordable treat that restaurants can easily add to their menus.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece reflects on the 1977 case of neo-Nazis seeking to march in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb with many Holocaust survivors, to explore the complexities of the First Amendment. The author recalls the pain the event caused survivors but highlights the ACLU's argument that protecting offensive speech is essential for free expression. The ACLU lawyer on the case, who is Jewish, argued that the real client was the First Amendment itself. The article concludes that if speech can be denied simply because it is offensive, officials gain the power to suppress any expression they dislike, emphasizing that free speech must apply even when we disagree with the content.</p>
