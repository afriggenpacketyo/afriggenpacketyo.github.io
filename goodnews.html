          <p>Recent protests and unrest in Los Angeles have temporarily united factions within the Trump right, who were previously divided on issues like trade. The unifying factor is a shared belief that progressives and left-wing activists pose an existential threat to the United States. This sentiment is rooted in a narrative drawn from the events of 2020, which conservatives view as a culmination of Covid restrictions, calls for social change, and street upheaval. The right sees Trump as the best defense against a repeat of what they consider the excesses and dangers of modern progressive politics.</p>

          <p>A senior Chinese tech executive from iFlytek admitted that using mainland-produced semiconductors, such as Huawei's Ascend 910B, could delay AI model development by three months. This is due to the need for additional computing resources compared to using Nvidia chips. However, iFlytek insists on using domestic chips to avoid losing access to imported technology, given its placement on the US Entity List. The company reports that the training efficiency of the Ascend 910B has increased significantly, but still lags behind Nvidia's A800.</p>

          <p>Homeowners are finding ways to save on insurance premiums by upgrading their houses to withstand disasters, such as hurricanes and wildfires. States are developing insurance discount programs, modeled after Alabama's, to encourage homeowners to strengthen their houses. In Alabama, strengthening roofs can qualify homeowners for discounts of 20% to 35% off the wind portion of their insurance. However, some experts argue that discounts alone are insufficient and that insurance companies need to account for home improvements when deciding whether to offer coverage.</p>

          <p>Seattle is grappling with balancing the need for more housing with the importance of preserving trees for climate change mitigation. A new state law requires increased housing density but not more trees, prompting innovative solutions like the Bryant Heights development, which integrates housing units around existing trees. This approach requires extra negotiation with the city to ensure new construction doesn't harm the trees. Seattle updated its tree protection ordinance to preserve trees on private property during development, aiming for 30% canopy coverage by 2037.</p>

          <p>UniCredit CEO Andrea Orcel stated that Commerzbank's share price is currently too high for a takeover offer, despite UniCredit holding a significant stake in the German bank. Orcel mentioned that a merger bid is unlikely unless the share price aligns with the fundamentals, stressing the need for a constructive solution to opposition from the German government. UniCredit's interest in Commerzbank has faced resistance, with German authorities favoring an independent Commerzbank. The bank is also facing hurdles with its simultaneous takeover offer for Italy's Banco BPM.</p>
