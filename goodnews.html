          <p>Frank Bisignano, the newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration (SSA), told agency staff that he had to Google the position when offered the job by the Trump administration, despite his background as a Wall Street executive. Bisignano, who previously led financial technology company Fiserv Inc., aims to modernize the SSA and improve its efficiency, including integrating AI into phone support systems. He assured staff that Social Security is "not going away" and addressed concerns about potential staff reductions, stating he has no intention to implement reductions in force at this time. Bisignano also emphasized the need for a "digital-first" mindset, comparing the agency's services to those of tech giants like Amazon. </p>

          <p>Judith Hope Blau, known as the Bagel Lady, passed away at 87, leaving behind a legacy of turning bagels into art and toys. What began as a dare from her husband led to a thriving business of bagel necklaces, napkin rings, and other creations. Her work eventually expanded into children's books and toy design, including the popular Sweetie Pops and Baby Check-Up dolls. Despite facing health challenges early in life, Blau found creative outlets and turned her artistic passion into a successful career. </p>

          <p>Corey O‚ÄôConnor won the Democratic primary for mayor of Pittsburgh, signaling a potential turn away from the progressive policies championed by the current mayor, Ed Gainey. O'Connor's victory is reminiscent of his father's, Bob O'Connor, who also won the primary for mayor in 2005. Voters chose O'Connor, who has been controller for Allegheny County since 2022, over Gainey, favoring a manager promising a smooth-running city rather than a leader with a grand vision. His win represents a notable turn for the city and the party, four years after Ed Gainey rode a wave of pandemic-fueled progressivism to defeat two-time incumbent Bill Peduto in the Democratic primary. </p>

The meeting, the first since the Trump administration took office, focused on selecting a COVID-19 strain to target in upcoming vaccines and formalizing new FDA rules limiting vaccine access. The plan includes limiting access to COVID-19 vaccines to people 65 and older and others who are considered high-risk, as well as requiring manufacturers to conduct clinical trials to show whether the vaccines benefit healthy younger adults and children. </p>

The order prevents the administration from firing half of the department's workforce and transferring the management of federal student loans to the Small Business Administration.

          <p>The United Kingdom has signed an agreement to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, while simultaneously securing a long-term lease for a strategically important U.S. military base on Diego Garcia. The deal allows the U.K. to lease Diego Garcia for at least 99 years, ensuring the continuation of the key military facility. The agreement follows a lengthy dispute over the islands and has drawn criticism from some Chagossians who feel it does not adequately secure their right to return to their homeland. </p>
