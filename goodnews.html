          <p>The United States and China have agreed to prolong their ongoing trade truce, officially suspending the implementation of drastically higher tariffs for an additional 90-day period. This extension, confirmed just hours before the previous deadline expired, maintains the current U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports at 30% and Chinese duties on American goods at 10%. The White House stated that the delay provides crucial time for further negotiations aimed at remedying trade imbalances and what it terms as unfair trade practices. Despite this temporary stability, official figures show that trade flows between the world's two largest economies have already contracted significantly this year compared to 2024.

          <p>Law enforcement sources have confirmed the arrest of four individuals suspected in a series of burglaries across Los Angeles, which included a break-in at actor Brad Pitt's home. The incident at Pitt's Los Feliz residence occurred in June while the actor was out of the country promoting a film. The suspects allegedly scaled a security fence, smashed a window, and stole valuable items after ransacking the property. The arrests were made by the Los Angeles Police Department in South L.A. following an ongoing investigation into what appears to be an organized burglary ring.</p>

          <p>Greek authorities have arrested three members of a transnational criminal group after seizing nearly 600 pounds of cocaine, valued at over $6.5 million, from a banana cargo container. The shipment, which originated from Latin America, was intercepted at the northern port of Thessaloniki following a crucial tip from the UK's National Crime Agency. This seizure highlights the continued use of banana shipments as a common and popular method for smuggling large quantities of cocaine internationally. The suspects include individuals allegedly responsible for logistics, communication, and transport within the criminal organization.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has rejected a highly unusual request from the U.S. Attorney's office to dismiss all charges against a convicted Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy, ordering him to begin his prison sentence. The deputy, Trevor Kirk, was found guilty by a jury for using excessive force during a 2023 arrest of a woman. The post-conviction effort to overturn the case, which had already seen a felony reduced to a misdemeanor, was described by the judge as "contrary to the public interest." The ruling concludes a controversial case that had prompted resignations within the prosecutor's office.</p>

The organization offers free, multi-week career courses that provide technical and soft skills, then connects participants directly with local employers. Magnet also provides crucial "wraparound supports" to remove barriers like lack of childcare or transportation, helping people like Mary Lamar, a formerly incarcerated woman who is now a homeowner and supervisor.

          <p>In the historic canals of Xochimilco, Mexico City, scientists are using an innovative technique to find the critically endangered axolotl salamander, which is now nearly impossible to spot visually. Researchers are filtering water to detect "environmental DNA," or genetic particles shed by the creatures, to monitor their dwindling population and presence. Once plentiful, the unique species has declined from an estimated 6,000 per square kilometer in 1998 to just 36 in the last census. The method has successfully found traces of axolotls in protected refuge areas, offering a glimmer of hope for the species' resilience if its habitat can be restored.</p>

          <p>The White House has confirmed a deal where Nvidia and AMD will give the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from certain chip sales to China. In exchange, the semiconductor companies will receive licenses to export specific AI chips, which the administration had previously restricted, allowing them to regain access to a lucrative market. This arrangement, described by some analysts as a novel form of tariff, allows the government to collect a portion of the profits directly. The policy shift comes amid broader efforts by the administration to control advanced technology trade with China while generating federal revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The three-year mystery of a missing Scottish cyclist, Tony Parsons, was solved after his killer's new girlfriend bravely went to the police with crucial information. The killer, Alexander McKellar, confessed to his girlfriend, Dr. Caroline Muirhead, that he had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried the body in a remote location. After McKellar showed her the shallow grave, she secretly dropped a Red Bull can as a marker and later contacted authorities. This clever and courageous act led police directly to the site, allowing them to recover Parsons' body and bring a long-awaited resolution to his family.</p>

          <p>A new 51-story residential skyscraper has received official approval from the Los Angeles City Council for a location in the downtown South Park neighborhood. The proposed tower is planned to contain 536 rental units, ground-floor retail space, and parking for over 500 vehicles. However, the developer has not yet commented on a construction start date, as the project faces a challenging financial climate for new construction. Industry experts note that high interest rates, tariffs on materials, and rising labor costs have created significant uncertainty for many developers, despite high demand for housing in the city.</p>
