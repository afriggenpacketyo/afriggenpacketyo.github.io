          <p>The traditional midlife crisis, often associated with drastic changes and material pursuits, doesn't quite resonate with millennials entering their 40s. This generation, shaped by economic instability and a focus on mental health, seeks opportunities for personal growth and reevaluation rather than abandoning their lives. For many, the stability sought by previous generations remains elusive, leading to a sense of uncertainty and longing for security. The article explores how factors like economic recessions and evolving lifestyles contribute to a unique millennial midlife experience, emphasizing the importance of self-awareness and adaptability in navigating this transition, as well as the importance of looking at midlife as an opportunity rather than a 'crisis'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals burdened by personal loan debt, understanding how to qualify for debt forgiveness is essential. Although complete forgiveness is rare, debt settlement, involving the lender accepting less than the full amount owed, offers a viable path. To qualify, borrowers typically need to be behind on payments, demonstrate financial hardship, and be prepared to offer a lump-sum payment. Alternatives such as debt management plans, refinancing, and consistent communication with lenders can also provide relief, especially for those ineligible for forgiveness (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found that Pepto Bismol may not be effective in preventing travelers' diarrhea. The study compared participants who took bismuth subsalicylate, the active ingredient in Pepto Bismol, with those who took a placebo and found no significant difference in symptoms of loose stool or diarrhea. While bismuth subsalicylate is approved for treating diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion, nausea, and upset stomach, the study suggests it may not be beneficial for preventing diarrhea among international travelers. The authors noted further studies are needed to determine if there is a benefit in certain traveler groups or under certain circumstances.</p>

          <p>Lee Jae-myung, South Korea's new president, has framed his political career around his personal experiences of poverty and hardship. Rising from a childhood spent working in factories, Lee entered politics with a promise to create a society that provides a safety net for its most vulnerable. Lee's policies as mayor of Seongnam focused on welfare, and though his recent attempts to smooth his public persona and mend partisan rifts, questions remain about his ability to unite a divided nation and navigate relations with President Trump.</p>
