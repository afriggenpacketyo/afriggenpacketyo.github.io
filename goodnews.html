          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly increased on Monday following the announcement of Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba's resignation, which came after mounting pressure over his national election defeat last year. Japan's Nikkei 225 jumped 1.5%, while the Topix climbed 1% to a record high, with Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae emerging as likely contenders to take the helm. The market responded positively, particularly to Takaichi, who favors deregulation and opposes interest rate hikes, with the Japanese yen weakening against the dollar as bond yields rose due to persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of uncertainty in Japan as the country heads into the fourth quarter of 2025.</p>

          <p>Backup tight end Jake Tonges made a miraculous catch in the fourth quarter to secure a 17-13 victory for the San Francisco 49ers over the Seattle Seahawks in their season opener. With George Kittle sidelined due to a hamstring injury, Tonges stepped up to make a crucial touchdown grab, reeling in a deflected pass from Brock Purdy with a defender draped on him. Nick Bosa sealed the win with a strip-sack on Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold in the final minute. Purdy passed for 277 yards and two touchdowns, while Christian McCaffrey contributed 69 rushing yards and 73 receiving yards.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece in *The Wall Street Journal* suggests that China could serve as an external threat to restore internal cohesion in American politics. The author argues that China's threat is real and potent, questioning whether Americans can overcome their divisions to address it. However, the article posits that it is not China's fault that American voters chose Trump a second time. The author disagrees with the premise that China has ever been the enemy and challenges the notion that the U.S. needs an enemy to maintain internal unity.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has reached an agreement with the U.S. to release its citizens detained in an immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. A chartered plane will be sent to bring the detainees home once administrative procedures are completed, with authorities working to improve the visa system to prevent future incidents. President Trump addressed the raid, calling on foreign companies to hire Americans while respecting immigration laws. The White House defended the operation, while South Korea expressed concern over the timing of the raid amidst sensitive trade talks.</p>

The U.S. Tennis Association requested broadcasters to avoid showcasing off-court disruptions during the event, but videos of the booing crowd circulated on social media.</p>
