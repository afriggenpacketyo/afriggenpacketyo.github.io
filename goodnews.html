          <p>James Lovell, one of NASA's most traveled astronauts and the commander of the harrowing Apollo 13 mission, has passed away. Lovell flew in space four times, including the first mission to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8, which provided humanity's first view of an 'Earthrise'. His calm leadership during the 1970 Apollo 13 crisis, where an explosion crippled the spacecraft, transformed a potential catastrophe into a story of survival and heroism, famously dramatized in the film "Apollo 13". Though he never walked on the moon, Lovell's career epitomized the courage and ingenuity of the early space program, cementing his legacy as a true American hero.</p>

          <p>Pope Francis, the first pope from the Americas, has passed away, leaving a legacy of reform and a more inclusive vision for the Catholic Church. From the moment he chose his name, inspired by a saint who lived in poverty, he signaled a shift in papal priorities, focusing on social justice, the poor, and the environment. He adopted a more welcoming tone towards the LGBTQ community and criticized the global financial system, earning him the title "the People's Pope." While his progressive stances drew criticism from conservatives, his humility and charisma had a profound rejuvenating effect on many Catholics and non-Catholics alike.</p>

          <p>Gene Hackman, a two-time Academy Award-winning actor celebrated for his ability to masterfully portray complex characters, has died. Renowned for his rough-hewn authenticity, he delivered iconic performances in classics like "The French Connection," for which he won his first Oscar, and the revisionist western "Unforgiven." Hackman moved effortlessly between genres, from crime dramas and thrillers to comedies like "Get Shorty" and his role as Lex Luthor in the "Superman" films. After retiring from acting in 2004, he pursued a second career as a novelist, leaving behind a rich and varied legacy as one of his generation's finest actors.</p>

          <p>George Foreman, who rose from poverty to become a two-time world heavyweight boxing champion and a beloved entrepreneur, has died. After winning his first title in 1973, he famously lost to Muhammad Ali in the "Rumble in the Jungle." A subsequent religious experience led him to retire from boxing for a decade to become an evangelist, but financial struggles prompted an improbable comeback. In 1994, at age 45, he became the oldest heavyweight champion ever, a victory that launched a second career as the successful and ubiquitous pitchman for the George Foreman Grill, making him a household name for a new generation.</p>

For 11 seasons, she portrayed the by-the-book head nurse, but actively worked with writers to develop her character beyond a one-dimensional foil, giving her depth, independence, and complexity. Swit believed the show's enduring legacy came from its honesty about the ugliness of war, with humor serving as a necessary survival mechanism for its characters. Her performance earned her two Emmy Awards and inspired countless women to pursue careers in nursing.</p>

          <p>Felix Baumgartner, the Austrian extreme athlete who famously completed the world's first supersonic skydive, has passed away. In 2012, as part of the Red Bull Stratos team, he jumped from a capsule 24 miles above Earth, breaking the sound barrier in a free-fall that captivated a global audience. A former military parachutist and BASE jumper, "Fearless Felix" was known for his death-defying stunts, including leaping from skyscrapers and the Christ the Redeemer statue in Brazil. He said his record-breaking jump from the edge of space made him feel humble, remarking, "Sometimes we have to get really high to see how small we are."</p>

          <p>An Algerian man survived a perilous ride on the outside of a high-speed train in Austria after it departed a station without him. The 24-year-old had reportedly stepped onto the platform for a cigarette break and, upon seeing the train leave, jumped onto the space between two carriages. He banged on windows to alert passengers, prompting the conductor to make an emergency stop. A railway spokesman condemned the act as incredibly irresponsible, noting such incidents usually end fatally and endanger rescue personnel, but confirmed the man was brought aboard safely before being met by police in Vienna.</p>

          <p>Leaders from France, Germany, Poland, and the U.K. have issued a joint statement emphasizing that Ukraine must be included in any peace negotiations with Russia. The statement comes as President Trump prepares to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Alaska to discuss an end to the war. While European leaders welcomed efforts to "stop the killing," they asserted that the path to peace cannot be decided without Ukraine's direct involvement and called for robust security guarantees for the nation. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has maintained that he will not cede any territory, making his potential participation in the talks a critical issue.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pro-Israel demonstrators marched through central London, calling for the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas in Gaza. Led by the U.K.'s chief rabbi, protesters carried Israeli flags and placards with the faces of the hostages. Many expressed anger at the U.K. government's conditional intention to recognize a Palestinian state, viewing it as a "reward for Hamas." The protest highlighted the ongoing anguish over the hostages, some of whom were recently shown in a video looking emaciated. The demonstration remained largely peaceful, though the Metropolitan Police made three arrests for assault following minor scuffles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's remarkable 13% stock advance last week was primarily fueled by a massive short squeeze, where investors betting against the stock were forced to buy shares to cover their losses. Short-sellers had targeted Apple due to its perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential threats from antitrust rulings and tariffs on its products manufactured in China and India. However, a public endorsement from President Trump regarding Apple's U.S. investments and a pivot to Indian manufacturing helped trigger the squeeze. The rally of the $3 trillion company obscured negative trends in the broader market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meteorologists are closely monitoring a tropical rainstorm in the Atlantic that is expected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the 2025 season by late this week. The system, which formed near the Cabo Verde Islands, is benefiting from warm water and a lack of disruptive wind shear. If it develops as predicted, it will be named Erin. While it is expected to bring heavy rain to the Cabo Verde Islands, current models suggest it will turn northward and remain east of the U.S. coast, though it could still generate rough surf and rip currents along East Coast beaches next weekend.</p>

          <p>The Japanese mindfulness practice of 'shinrin-yoku,' or forest bathing, is gaining popularity as a method for improving mental health and focus. The practice involves immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the natural environment. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks designed to help people slow down, disconnect from technology, and be present, which can lower stress levels. Proponents emphasize that the benefits can be achieved in any green space, such as a local park or backyard, and even short, 15-minute sessions of quiet reflection can have a positive impact on well-being.</p>
