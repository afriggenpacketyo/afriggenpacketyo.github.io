          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 15:10:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares for the space infrastructure company Rocket Lab increased by 8% on Monday, extending a significant rally over the past two months. This surge is attributed to a series of successful launches, including deploying two rockets from one site in 48 hours, and a new partnership with the European Space Agency to deploy navigation satellites. The company, which now has a market value over $19 billion, reports it is producing a new Electron rocket every 15 days to meet rising demand in the increasingly competitive space industry. This recent performance builds on a 63% year-to-date gain for the stock. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent CBS News feature highlighted two uplifting stories from viewers, showcasing resilience and kindness in local communities. One story followed Jessica Caldwell, a Texas custodian and mother of four, who successfully earned four college degrees over a decade while working full-time overnight shifts at the very university she attended. The other featured a postal worker, Ian Burke, who adopted a dog named Pretty Boy Floyd from his former route after the dog's elderly owner passed away, ensuring the animal wouldn't stay in a shelter. Both stories emphasize persistence and the positive impact of community connections.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian officials have responded positively to Donald Trump's announcement of a new military aid package, while Russian officials have largely dismissed the accompanying threat of sanctions. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude for the deal, which will provide Patriot anti-aircraft systems funded by European allies. In contrast, Russian lawmakers and pro-war commentators described the 50-day sanctions ultimatum as "hot air," with Moscow's stock index even rising after the announcement. The differing reactions highlight the complex geopolitical landscape and skepticism about the immediate impact of the U.S. plan on the conflict.</p>

          <p>England cricket captain Ben Stokes delivered a player-of-the-match performance to secure a dramatic 22-run victory against India in their latest Test match. Despite a recent hamstring surgery, Stokes bowled two crucial, lengthy spells on the final day, taking key wickets to help bowl out the tourists for 170. Stokes described the effort as one of the toughest of his career but confirmed he would be fit for the next match. The win, which puts England 2-1 up in the series, was also notable for the successful return of bowler Jofra Archer.</p>

          <p>Meta announced it has removed approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 for impersonating large content creators as part of a crackdown on spam. The company is also taking action against 500,000 other accounts for inauthentic behavior by demoting their content to curb monetization. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to promote original content and combat the rise of low-quality, AI-generated posts, often called "AI slop." The move comes as other platforms like YouTube also implement stricter policies against mass-produced, unoriginal content.</p>

          <p>The U.S. housing market is continuing to cool, with annual home price growth slowing to just 1.3% in June, its slowest rate in two years. According to mortgage technology firm ICE, nearly one-third of the 100 largest housing markets are now experiencing annual price declines. This trend is driven by a combination of high mortgage rates, rising inventory, and falling demand. While prices are still rising in the Northeast and Midwest, they are softening significantly in the South and West, with markets in Florida, Texas, and California seeing notable drops.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article explores the "age 75 rule," a common belief that retirees should wait until age 75 to buy an annuity to receive higher payouts. While payouts do increase with age because of shorter life expectancy calculations, the article argues this rule is an oversimplification. Waiting until 75 may mean forgoing years of needed income, drawing down other assets, and risking changes in health that could limit options. The best time to buy an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including retirement goals, other income sources, and risk tolerance, rather than an arbitrary age. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial expert Suze Orman identifies critical accounts for building a strong retirement plan, including the 401(k) and the Roth 401(k). She emphasizes maximizing employer matching contributions in a traditional 401(k), as many people fail to contribute enough to receive the full match, effectively leaving free money on the table. Orman also strongly advocates for using a Roth 401(k) if available, as contributions are made with after-tax dollars, allowing for completely tax-free withdrawals in retirement. This strategy provides significant long-term tax advantages for savers. (not investment advice)</p>
