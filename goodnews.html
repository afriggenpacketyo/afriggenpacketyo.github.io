          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly ordered the military to cease all offensive operations in the Gaza Strip, permitting only defensive actions. This development follows a comprehensive peace plan proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, which has also garnered support from the World Health Organization. According to sources, Israel is preparing to send a negotiating team and considers the release of all hostages a top priority. The halt in intense bombardment comes after Hamas expressed its willingness to engage with the proposed ceasefire plan.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Have Originated in Tang Dynasty China</h2>

          <p>Italian researchers have proposed a new theory that Venice's famous bronze statue, the Lion of St Mark, may have originated as a tomb guardian in Tang dynasty China over a thousand years ago. A study published in the journal Antiquity points to stylistic similarities with Chinese mythical beasts and uses lead isotope analysis to trace the statue's copper to ore sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate that the statue could have been transported to Venice by the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo, before being altered to become a symbol of Venetian power.</p>

          <p>A new film starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, titled "The Smashing Machine," explores the dramatic life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr. Based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, the movie chronicles Kerr's rapid rise to the top of the sport in the late 1990s and his subsequent fall due to a severe addiction to opioids and alcohol. Johnson, who has been interested in the project for years, portrays Kerr's journey from a dominant fighter to a man struggling with personal demons. The film, which received a standing ovation at the Venice Film Festival, represents a second chance at notoriety for Kerr.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an extraordinary endurance project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The challenge, called "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling between the peaks and running up each one, covering over 3,000 miles across six states. The project showcased his minimalist and artistic approach to mountaineering, as he chose what he called "the most aesthetic line" rather than the easiest routes. For Jornet, the journey was not about setting records but about personal exploration and connecting with the American wilderness.</p>

          <p>A look into the history of the Nobel Prize reveals several intriguing and controversial facts that are often overlooked. For instance, Marie Curie's family amassed five Nobel Prizes across two generations, while Albert Einstein gave his prize money to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement. The prize has also faced criticism for overlooking key female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin, whose crucial contributions to major discoveries were not recognized. Furthermore, the Nobel Prize has never been revoked, even for laureates whose scientific findings were later debunked or who promoted questionable beliefs.</p>

          <p>With Sunderland's return to the Premier League, former manager Peter Reid has looked back on "Premier Passions," a 1998 BBC documentary that gave viewers an unprecedented inside look at the club's 1996-97 season. The series became famous for its raw depiction of dressing room dynamics, including Reid's expletive-filled rants at his players, which he now says would likely not be acceptable in today's society. The documentary captured a pivotal moment in English football, chronicling the club's move from its historic Roker Park stadium and the growing commercialization of the sport, all while ending in the heartbreak of relegation.</p>
