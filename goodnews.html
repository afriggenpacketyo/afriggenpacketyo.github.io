          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves' Spending Review outlines government spending from 2026, impacting various sectors and public services. While defense and the NHS will receive significant funding, other areas like the Home Office, Foreign Office, and Department for Transport will face budget cuts, potentially affecting jobs and wages. The government plans to continue the ¬£3 bus fare cap until at least March 2027 and invest in transport projects like Northern Powerhouse Rail. The review also includes measures to help pensioners with winter fuel payments and improve home insulation to reduce energy bills, along with money for community renewal projects, but also suggests future rises in council tax.

          <h2>Inflation Steady as Trump's Tariffs Await Full Impact</h2>

          <p>Inflation remains relatively stable, with consumer prices rising 2.4% annually in May, as President Trump's tariffs have yet to fully impact the economy. Gasoline prices fell, offsetting increases in rent and groceries. While tariffs may have contributed to rising prices for some goods, overall goods prices held steady. Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that Trump's tariffs could reverse progress made on inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>US prices continued to rise in May, with annualized inflation ticking up to 2.4%, as companies and consumers grappled with President Trump's tariffs. Economists had expected a higher CPI reading, amid uncertainty over the US economy. Multiple retailers have said they will increase prices due to tariffs.

          <p>Despite recent market volatility due to President Trump's tariff policies, investor portfolio balances may not differ significantly from when he took office. The S&P 500's annualized return for Trump's second presidency is positive, at 1.58%. While there have been unnerving days, the market's resilience highlights the peril of impulsive exits during turbulence. Investors generally aim to keep their money in the market over decades, and most presidential terms have seen healthy stock market returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors plans to invest $4 billion in three American assembly plants, moving or increasing production of two Mexican-produced vehicles to U.S. plants. The investment will add assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox to U.S. plants and convert an idled plant in Michigan to make gas-powered SUVs and trucks in 2027. This move is likely influenced by President Trump's tariffs on imported vehicles and auto parts from Mexico. The investment will enable GM to assemble more than two million vehicles per year in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>
