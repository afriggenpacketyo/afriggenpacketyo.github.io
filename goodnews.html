          <h2>Chinese Researchers Announce Less Invasive Brain-Computer Interface, Challenging Neuralink</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 00:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has reported the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a method that avoids open-skull surgery. This minimally invasive technique successfully allowed a 67-year-old paralyzed patient to regain some limb movement, positioning it as a potential alternative to more invasive procedures like those developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The procedure involves inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein, which reportedly reduces surgical risks and significantly shortens patient recovery time. This development marks a notable advancement in neurotechnology, highlighting a different approach to connecting human brains with computers.</p>

          <p>A Shandong Airlines flight traveling from Qingdao to Shanghai was forced to execute an emergency landing in Nanjing due to an aircraft malfunction. Passengers aboard flight SC4667 reported hearing loud bangs and smelling a burning odor, with one witness suggesting an object may have been ingested by the plane's left engine. Despite the frightening experience, which included several minutes of shaking, the crew handled the situation effectively, and the captain announced the diversion to Nanjing. The landing was conducted smoothly, and no injuries were reported. The airline confirmed the incident, stating all passengers were safely accommodated and another aircraft was dispatched to complete the journey.</p>

          <p>Despite a performance their manager described as imperfect, the Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, moving into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball. The game featured key offensive contributions, including a leadoff home run and a game-tying triple from Shohei Ohtani, and a go-ahead single from Mookie Betts. Starting pitcher Dustin May struggled, lasting only four innings, but the bullpen delivered five scoreless frames to secure the win. The victory came down to a tense ninth inning, where closer Tanner Scott induced a game-ending double play with the bases loaded, showcasing the team's ability to win even when not at their peak.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found that working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet exhibit lower rates of depressive symptoms. The research assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, cooked vegetables, and green tea among nearly 12,500 employees. While 30.9% of the cohort showed depressive symptoms, those adhering to the Japanese diet were less likely to do so, even after accounting for other potential factors. The institute suggests that nutrients like folic acid in vegetables and omega-3 fatty acids in fish may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding neurotransmitter release and reducing inflammation.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement has captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence and will be moved to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, involved inmates breaking through a faulty cell door and a wall. The incident has drawn criticism of the parish sheriff's management of the facility. With Massey's capture, only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest.</p>

The opulent event attracted a frenzy of media attention and a guest list of around 200 A-listers, including the Kardashian-Jenner family, Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Oprah Winfrey. S√°nchez wore a custom Dolce & Gabbana gown inspired by a Sophia Loren film. The wedding, held on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, was not without controversy, as some locals protested the event as an example of the city being packaged for the ultra-rich, with one activist unfurling a banner that read: "The 1% ruins the world."</p>

          <p>A BBC science correspondent has detailed a fascinating experiment in phage therapy, a century-old medical concept being revisited to combat antibiotic resistance. By collecting dirty water samples, including one from his own toilet, he successfully isolated a bacteriophage‚Äîa virus that preys on bacteria. In a university lab, this specific phage was shown to effectively kill a bacterial infection collected from a hospital patient with a recurring urinary tract infection. The article highlights the growing crisis of antimicrobial resistance and explores how these 'friendly viruses' could become a crucial alternative to failing antibiotics, with regulators now beginning to establish pathways for their clinical use.</p>

          <p>The European Space Agency's new Biomass satellite is providing the first-ever detailed views beneath the dense canopies of the world's rainforests. After twenty years in development, the satellite uses a unique P-band radar frequency that can penetrate clouds and thick foliage to measure the woody material in tree trunks, where most carbon is stored. The first images have revealed previously hidden wetlands and concealed deforestation, offering scientists an unprecedented tool to understand these vital ecosystems. The ultimate goal is to create a global 3D map of the world's forests, enabling more accurate estimates of carbon storage and helping authorities react more swiftly to illegal logging.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior from Waunakee, Wisconsin, found a unique way to reconnect with classmates after years of feeling isolated by social anxiety. Over the course of the year, she spent approximately 600 hours in her garage loft painting detailed portraits of 44 of her peers whom she knew from elementary and middle school. She then presented the paintings to each student as a gift. The project was met with amazement and some regret from her classmates, who wished they had paid more attention to her. Schafer's act of connection has become an inspiring story about overcoming isolation and the power of reaching out.</p>

          <p>A fourth federal judge has permanently blocked one of President Trump's executive orders targeting an elite law firm, ruling the action unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan struck down the order against the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it a 'resounding victory for the rule of law.' This marks the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's campaign to punish law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes. The orders have sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts. In all four cases brought by different firms, judges have found the orders to be an unconstitutional attack on First Amendment rights.</p>
