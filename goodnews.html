          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) are presented as a secure savings option with returns currently outpacing the inflation rate. The article notes that while national average yields for CDs are modest, top rates, especially from online banks, are significantly higher. It highlights that short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, are presently offering higher yields than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. This makes them an attractive vehicle for savers looking to lock in high rates safely. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An international study published in The New England Journal of Medicine suggests that increasing potassium intake could lower the risk of serious heart problems. The research followed 1,200 high-risk patients with implantable defibrillators, finding that those who increased their potassium levels through diet or supplements had a significantly lower incidence of dangerous heart rhythms, hospitalizations, or death. Researchers concluded that raising potassium to mid-to-high normal levels could be an inexpensive and effective treatment strategy for patients with a wide range of cardiovascular diseases.</p>

          <p>Career experts are divided on whether the traditional 'September surge' in job hiring will occur this year following a slow summer market. Historically, hiring picks up in the fall as companies aim to use remaining budgets and meet year-end goals. However, some recruiters express caution, citing recession fears and cost-cutting measures as potential dampeners on a significant hiring rebound. To prepare, experts advise job seekers to update their LinkedIn profiles to match their resumes and to be strategic in their applications rather than applying indiscriminately.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With mortgage rates remaining high, homeowners have several options to reduce their monthly payments without waiting for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Experts suggest three main strategies: refinancing to a lower rate if the current rate is above 7%, applying for a mortgage recast by making a large lump-sum payment to lower the principal, or seeking a loan modification in cases of financial hardship. Each option has different requirements, costs, and impacts on the loan terms, so homeowners should carefully assess their financial situation to choose the most suitable path.</p>

          <p>James Talarico, a 36-year-old Democratic state lawmaker and Presbyterian seminarian, has announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat in Texas currently held by Republican John Cornyn. Known for his eloquent, faith-based arguments against conservative policies, Talarico is seen by some Democrats as a promising figure who could potentially appeal to a broader electorate in the traditionally red state. The article profiles his political style, his background as a teacher, and his potential to energize voters, while also noting the significant challenges he faces against more established candidates.</p>

          <p>Shake Shack is launching a new premium menu centered around French onion soup flavors, including a French Onion Soup Burger, beer-battered onion rings, and Parmesan garlic fries. This move is part of the company's strategy to offer "democratization of fine dining" by providing high-end items at a relatively affordable price point, with the new burger priced at $10.99. The strategy aims to attract customers with unique, limited-time offerings rather than engaging in price wars on its core menu. The launch follows the successful, sold-out run of its high-priced Dubai Chocolate Pistachio Shake.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to implement binding targets to significantly reduce waste from food and textiles by 2030. Member states will be required to cut food waste from households, restaurants, and retailers by 30%, and waste from food manufacturing by 10%. Additionally, the new rules will establish an extended producer responsibility scheme, making textile and footwear companies financially responsible for the collection, sorting, and recycling of their products. This initiative aims to address the substantial environmental and climate impact of the nearly 60 million tons of food and 12.6 million tons of textiles wasted annually in the bloc.</p>

          <p>The article analyzes why large orders for Boeing aircraft have become a recurring feature in trade deals negotiated by the Trump administration. Experts suggest that high-value, high-profile airplane deals serve as visible symbols of reducing bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S., a key goal for President Trump. Unlike agricultural or steel imports, purchasing American-made aircraft is often not politically sensitive for partner countries. Furthermore, the long delivery timelines for these orders mean countries can announce major purchases without immediate financial strain, making them a pragmatic and performative tool in international trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Zookeepers at the Exotic Zoo in Telford, UK, are celebrating what they describe as one of the rarest events in the animal kingdom: a "virgin birth." A female casque-headed iguana, which had never mated with a male, successfully produced eight healthy hatchlings through a natural phenomenon called parthenogenesis. This process allows unfertilized eggs to develop into embryos, resulting in offspring that are genetic clones of the mother. The zoo highlights the event as a significant moment for both scientific understanding and conservation education.</p>
