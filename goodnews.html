          <p>Donald Trump has endorsed Jack Ciattarelli, a former critic, for New Jersey governor, praising him as a terrific America First candidate. Ciattarelli responded with gratitude, emphasizing the need to unite the party and make New Jersey affordable and safe again. The Fox News article highlights Ciattarelli's past criticisms of Trump, calling him a "charlatan" in 2015, but notes his apparent change in stance since then. Other candidates, such as Bill Spadea, have reacted negatively to the endorsement, and the New Jersey Democratic Governors Association has criticized it as confirmation that Ciattarelli would prioritize Trump over New Jersey.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on the anticlimactic auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York, which was seen as a bellwether for the art market. The article suggests economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs may have dampened enthusiasm, with many objects presold and a lack of lively bidding. While the sale totaled $272 million, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. The article also notes some signs of life in the 20th Century Evening Sale that followed, but overall indicates a weaker market compared to previous years.</p>
