          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to convene his cabinet to discuss a proposed Gaza Strip ceasefire deal, expected to be approved by the wider government. The agreement, based on a U.S. presidential proposal, involves the release of all remaining hostages, both alive and dead, in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The Israel Defense Forces will also withdraw to an agreed-upon "yellow line" in Gaza. U.S. President Donald Trump announced the first phase of the deal, with living hostages anticipated to be released within days of ratification, marking a significant step toward de-escalation after two years of intense conflict.</p>

          <p>Despite a 46% annual decrease in direct investments, ultra-wealthy family offices continue to back artificial intelligence and healthcare startups, according to Fintrx data. High-profile investors like Jeff Bezos and Eric Schmidt participated in a $300 million seed round for Periodic Labs, an AI-powered scientific research automation startup. Michael Dell's DFO Management also contributed to a $130 million raise for primary-care clinic group Harbor Health. These firms are making opportunistic bets, such as the Mitchell Family Office acquiring luxury beauty retailer Cos Bar, intending to integrate AI-powered smart mirrors. The trend highlights sustained confidence in these sectors despite a broader private equity slowdown. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Sridhar Ramaswamy, CEO of AI data firm Snowflake, dismisses stock market distractions, emphasizing the company's commitment to "value creation" amidst fears of an AI bubble. Snowflake, a cloud data storage platform, saw its shares rally over 60% year-to-date, but analysts are wary of distinguishing hype from reality. Ramaswamy advises incremental AI implementation, acknowledging not all projects will succeed and employee resistance to job displacement. He believes AI's potential to accelerate data value is significant, despite market turbulence. The CEO remains confident in Snowflake's long-term value, even as some senior executives have sold shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hungarian author László Krasznahorkai has been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, recognized for his "compelling and visionary oeuvre that, in the midst of apocalyptic terror, reaffirms the power of art." Krasznahorkai, known for his postmodern works like "Satantango" and "The Melancholy of Resistance," is praised as a "great epic writer" in the Central European tradition, characterized by absurdism and grotesque excess. His writing often explores social unrest and existential themes, as seen in his 2021 novel "Herscht 07769." This prestigious award acknowledges his profound contributions to contemporary literature, making him the second Hungarian to receive the honor.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines reported better-than-expected third-quarter profits and a strong forecast for the end of 2025, buoyed by rising airfares and robust demand for luxury travel. The airline projected adjusted earnings of $1.60 to $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, surpassing analyst estimates. Premium travel revenue surged by 9% to nearly $5.8 billion, significantly outperforming main cabin revenue. CEO Ed Bastian noted no signs of consumer pullback for high-end products, indicating improved demand and less flight surplus. Delta anticipates full-year earnings at the upper end of its forecast, demonstrating resilience despite earlier consumer confidence fluctuations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research indicates that Democratic candidates could regain Rust Belt voters by adopting a populist stance and openly criticizing their own party establishment. A study across Pennsylvania, Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin found a "Democratic penalty," where candidates with identical economic populist platforms fared 8 points worse if labeled Democrat. Voters expressed frustration with Democrats being "out of touch" and ineffective, rather than primarily concerned with "wokeness." The research suggests that strong anti-corporate rhetoric and concrete policies like capping drug prices and raising taxes on the wealthy resonate more, even on issues like immigration. This approach could blunt the negative impact of the party brand.</p>

          <p>All victims of the Post Office Horizon IT scandal seeking compensation are now entitled to free legal advice, a significant improvement announced by the UK government. This change, part of broader reforms in response to a public inquiry, aims to address criticisms of slow and inadequate compensation schemes. More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, with many forced to use personal savings to cover fictitious shortfalls. Business Secretary Peter Kyle emphasized the commitment to delivering justice, as over £1.2 billion has already been paid out across various schemes, with a new appeals process also being established for those who accepted low fixed payouts.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Wyoming's Campbell County, has won a $700,000 settlement after being fired amidst controversy over books with sexual and LGBTQ+ themes. Lesley, who served for 27 years, sued the county, alleging her First Amendment rights were violated when officials sided with objectors who sought to remove books deemed inappropriate for youth. The lawsuit claimed she faced a hostile work environment and termination for refusing to remove the challenged books and for welcoming LGBTQ+ individuals. Her attorney hopes the settlement sends a message to other jurisdictions that constitutional obligations against discrimination must be upheld.</p>

          <p>A U.S. drone manufacturer has demonstrated that backpack-sized C100 drones, equipped with lasers, can effectively designate targets for fighter jets like the F-35, a task traditionally performed by exposed troops or expensive aircraft. This innovation allows soldiers to operate from concealed positions, significantly reducing risk to personnel and costly assets. The C100, which can be deployed from a rucksack in under five minutes, proved successful in guiding precision munitions dropped from an F-35. This technology offers a cost-effective and safer alternative for target designation, enhancing military capabilities while minimizing the dangers associated with traditional methods.</p>

Despite this success, PepsiCo faced declining volume in North America for both food and beverages, prompting plans for aggressive cost reduction, innovation, and price-pack architecture initiatives in its home market. The company is investing in "permissible" snack offerings and new packaging to attract health-conscious and price-sensitive consumers.

          <p>Donald Trump's announcement of a Gaza ceasefire deal represents a significant moment, bringing hope for an end to the two-year war and the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners. The agreement has sparked widespread relief, with celebrations in Tel Aviv and Gaza, highlighting the human impact of the conflict. While a major breakthrough, this is a ceasefire, not a peace deal, leaving thorny issues like Hamas's disarmament and Gaza's future governance unresolved. Trump is credited with exerting pressure on allies and mediators, accelerating negotiations that had previously stalled, but the long-term success hinges on implementing the agreement and addressing deeper political challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates a surprising and statistically significant shift towards sobriety among Republicans, with the percentage of those consuming alcohol dropping by 19 points in two years to 46%. This decline is more aggressive than among Democrats or independents, who also report drinking less. Theories for this trend include the influence of prominent abstinent figures like Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson, a potential revival of Protestant temperance, or a "Make America healthy again" movement emphasizing wellness. The phenomenon reflects a broader cultural shift towards health consciousness, amplified by right-wing self-help podcast culture, though its long-term impact remains to be seen.</p>
