        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United has reportedly made a substantial third bid for Brentford forward Bryan Mbeumo, with the offer potentially reaching £70 million. This proposal includes an initial payment of £65 million, supplemented by an additional £5 million in performance-related add-ons, though Brentford has not yet engaged in discussions regarding the offer. Manchester United remains optimistic about integrating the Cameroon international into Ruben Amorim's squad before their departure for three pre-season games in the United States. This aggressive pursuit highlights the club's strategy to strengthen its roster, aiming to enhance its competitive edge following earlier summer signings of Matheus Cunha and Diego Leon.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives is set to vote on the GENIUS Act, a landmark bill designed to regulate stablecoins and establish a framework for the cryptocurrency market. This vote follows a period of uncertainty caused by a right-wing Republican rebellion that initially stalled the bill, with holdouts seeking to merge it with legislation banning a central bank digital currency. President Trump intervened, leading to a deal where the CBDC ban would be tied to the annual defense bill, clearing the path for the GENIUS Act. Despite bipartisan support for some regulation, House Democrats have raised concerns about the bill's consumer protection and national security provisions.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust has initiated a new position in Cisco Systems, purchasing 550 shares, citing the company's strong advancements in artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Cisco, traditionally a networking equipment provider, is now seen as crucial for connecting powerful AI data centers, having already achieved $1 billion in AI infrastructure orders ahead of schedule. The investment also recognizes Cisco's successful transition towards higher-margin subscription software sales, which now constitute 56% of total revenue. This strategic shift, combined with a seemingly undemanding valuation and a track record of returning cash to shareholders, positions Cisco for potential upside. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New York City is evaluating the potential for wealth flight following Zohran Mamdani's rise in the mayoral race and his proposal for a 'millionaire tax.' This additional 2% tax on high earners would push the combined city and state tax rate to nearly 17%, the highest in the nation, raising concerns about residents moving to neighboring counties or states. While some real estate brokers report increased inquiries from the wealthy, data suggests New York City's millionaire population has more than doubled in the past decade, indicating a strong capacity to replenish wealth. Experts debate whether tax rates or lifestyle factors are the primary drivers of migration.</p>

          <p>For 70 years, Disneyland and its global counterparts have successfully leveraged Disney's vast intellectual property (IP) to create immersive theme park experiences. This strategy, rooted in Walt Disney's original vision, has made the experiences division a leading profit driver for the company, consistently surpassing its content-centric entertainment unit. Recent acquisitions like Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm have further fueled this approach, leading to the creation of themed lands and attractions that expand Disney's audience and revenue streams. While some long-time fans lament the re-theming of older rides, this IP-driven strategy is central to Disney's substantial $60 billion investment pledge for experiences over the next decade.</p>

          <p>Swiss pharmaceutical giant Novartis anticipates its breast cancer treatment, Kisqali, will become its next blockbuster drug, reducing reliance on its top-selling heart failure therapy, Entresto. Kisqali sales surged by 64% globally in the second quarter, including 100% growth in the U.S., driven by rising global breast cancer diagnoses. Novartis is also optimistic about its prostate cancer treatment Pluvicto and leukemia drug Scemblix, both on track for blockbuster status. This strategic shift comes as Entresto faces U.S. patent expiry next year, prompting the company to defend its intellectual property while showcasing a robust pipeline to maintain strong financial performance and shareholder returns.</p>

To counter soft demand, PepsiCo is focusing on protein-centric and multicultural product offerings, enhancing in-store placement, and implementing cost-cutting measures, including plant closures and logistics efficiencies, while reiterating its full-year financial outlook.

          <p>Britain's government has announced a significant electoral reform, lowering the national voting age from 18 to 16 before the next general election, a key promise from the Labour Party's 2024 manifesto.

The comprehensive reform package also includes measures to tighten campaign finance rules, introduce automatic voter registration, and expand acceptable forms of voter identification to include bank cards.

Key hurdles include security concerns, with nations fearing increased terrorism and uncontrolled entry, and worries about losing visa application revenue.
