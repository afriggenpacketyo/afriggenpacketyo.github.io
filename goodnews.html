          <h2>Strategies for Seniors to Bridge Medicare Insurance Coverage Gaps</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 16:16:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation impacting seniors' finances and Medicare often not covering full medical expenses, many older adults seek ways to fill insurance gaps. This article explores three primary options: Medicare supplemental insurance (Medigap), reverse mortgages, and annuities. Medigap covers out-of-pocket costs like copays and deductibles, while reverse mortgages allow homeowners aged 62+ to access home equity without immediate repayments. Annuities provide consistent future monthly payments in exchange for an upfront lump sum, ensuring a reliable income source for ongoing medical needs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Intel's CFO David Zinser confirmed the semiconductor giant received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, an investment stemming from the White House's decision to acquire a 10% stake in the company. Zinser also hinted at the possibility of seeking external investment for Intel's foundry unit, which produces computer chips for other firms and has been a source of recent investor concern. Despite the cash infusion, the White House indicated the deal's details are still "being ironed out," and Intel had previously cautioned about potential "adverse reactions" from various stakeholders due to the government's involvement.

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, a move that could significantly influence Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak. Woltemade, a 23-year-old German international, is expected to undergo a medical, with the fee potentially setting a new club record. This acquisition might encourage Liverpool to revisit their £110m bid for Isak, which Newcastle previously rejected, as the Magpies had stated a need for two quality strikers before considering selling Isak. Woltemade's impressive performance and potential make him a key figure in Newcastle's strategy.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's stock dipped despite reporting better-than-expected earnings, as investors grappled with robust AI demand offset by ongoing uncertainty in the China market. Sales surged 56% to $46.74 billion, with adjusted earnings per share topping estimates. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted a "full steam" AI revolution, projecting $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. However, the fate of Nvidia's H20 chip in China, blocked by the Trump administration and subject to an unfinalized deal, remains a significant concern, impacting revenue guidance.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article clarifies whether reverse mortgages affect Social Security or Medicare benefits for seniors. It explains that reverse mortgages do not directly reduce standard Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare eligibility, as these are not means-tested. However, a crucial caveat is that need-based programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid can be impacted. Large lump-sum withdrawals from a reverse mortgage, if kept in a bank account, could count towards asset limits, potentially reducing or eliminating eligibility for these specific programs. Financial consultation is advised for those relying on such benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an era dominated by digital devices and wellness platforms, this article posits poetry as a timeless, analog solution for mindful living and immersing oneself in the present. It argues that poetry, unlike tech-driven mindfulness, tracks our inner experiences without aiming for optimization, addressing the feeling of life slipping away. The piece highlights Linda Gregg's poem "The Last Night in Mithymna" as an example, where her evocative language and deliberate omission of verbs guide the reader into a state of deep self-awareness and contentment, proving poetry's enduring capacity to foster genuine mindfulness.</p>
