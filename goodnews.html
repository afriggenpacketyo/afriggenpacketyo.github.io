          <p>Leaked audio from President Joe Biden's 2023 interview with Special Counsel Robert Hur has surfaced, raising further questions about his mental acuity. The audio reveals Biden struggling to recall the date of his son Beau's death and the year Donald Trump was elected president. These memory lapses contributed to Hur's conclusion that Biden's memory was "significantly limited." The White House had previously kept the audio under wraps, but the release has sparked renewed debate about Biden's cognitive abilities.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through Chicago, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has ever done so and the first time the warning has included the city itself. The storm was caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, carrying dust into the air and across the Chicago area. The dust storm disrupted travel, delaying flights at Midway International Airport and causing traffic congestion on expressways. Residents reported feeling the dirt in their eyes and were advised to wear glasses.</p>
