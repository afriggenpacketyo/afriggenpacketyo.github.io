          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has addressed U.S. concerns about China's military potentially using his company's advanced AI chips, stating that China cannot rely on technology that could be restricted at any moment. Speaking ahead of another trip to China, Huang reiterated his criticism of U.S. export controls, arguing they are counterproductive to maintaining American tech leadership, as half of the world's AI developers are in China. While navigating the delicate balance between Washington's security policies and access to a major market, Huang faces scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers. Analysts note the difficulty in completely preventing military applications of such powerful technology.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. The growth was primarily driven by a 5.5% year-over-year expansion in the manufacturing sector, which analysts attribute to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential U.S. tariff changes. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the remainder of the year due to global trade tensions. The country's central bank has recently loosened monetary policy, and economists are divided on whether the current growth is sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Philippine Defense Department confirmed that Defense Secretary Gilberto Teodoro Jr. renounced his Maltese citizenship before his 2023 appointment, complying with laws that generally disqualify dual citizens from high public office. Teodoro, a vocal critic of Chinese aggression in the South China Sea, reportedly acquired a Maltese passport in 2016 but surrendered it before a 2021 senate run. His department stated this information was disclosed to the congressional committee that confirmed his appointment, suggesting recent reports are attempts to undermine him. The revelation comes as Malta faces pressure from the EU to end its controversial "golden passport" investment scheme.</p>

          <p>In the Nile Delta, archaeologists have unearthed multistory buildings within the ruins of the ancient Egyptian city of Imet, now known as Tell el-Fara’in. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, a British and Egyptian team identified dense architectural remains, including tower houses with thick foundations designed for a growing urban population during the Ptolemaic Period (332-30 B.C.). The excavation also revealed granaries, a ceremonial road linked to the cobra goddess Wadjet, and various artifacts like a bronze rattle and a stone slab depicting a god. These discoveries offer new insights into the urban planning, religious life, and daily activities of this once-thriving city.</p>

The event, held at Madison Square Garden, showcased MVP's ability to produce and market major fights, building on Paul's own controversial but lucrative boxing career. While Paul's fights have generated immense revenue, MVP is now focused on building a sustainable promotional company that isn't solely reliant on him competing. The company is particularly investing in women's boxing, aiming to create a cohesive program and establish itself as a new power broker in the sport.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has stated he does not support a merger between his electric vehicle company, Tesla, and his artificial intelligence firm, xAI, responding with a simple "No" to a question on the social media platform X.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding analysts' expectations and showing resilience amid global trade uncertainties. The growth was supported by a temporary tariff truce with the United States, which slowed the decline of shipments to America, and a significant surge in exports to other regions, including a 16.8% jump to Southeast Asian nations. The data also revealed a record high for steel exports and a 60% surge in rare earth shipments. Despite the positive month, economists remain cautious, forecasting that the export momentum could falter later in the year due to ongoing tariff risks and the potential for fading front-loading effects.

This rhetoric is reminiscent of the 2015 "supply-side structural reform" that targeted overcapacity in industries like steel and coal. However, analysts note that today's economic landscape is different, with a larger role for private firms, weaker overall growth, and limited fiscal space, making the new initiative potentially more challenging to implement.</p>
