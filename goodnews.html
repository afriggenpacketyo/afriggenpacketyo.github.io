        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has a disproportionately high number of successful actors in Hollywood, including Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, and Cate Blanchett. This phenomenon is attributed to factors like excellent training grounds, such as the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA), and a strong work ethic among Australian actors. NIDA emphasizes devising original work and instills a "can do, will tell" attitude, encouraging actors to create their own opportunities. The country's remoteness also allows actors to develop their skills away from the immediate pressures of Hollywood, fostering a unique blend of skill, confidence, and humility.</p>

          <p>A strong geomagnetic storm forecast for Sunday night could make the northern lights visible across parts of the U.S., potentially reaching as far south as northern California and Alabama. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center detected a solar flare associated with the storm. The storm, spurred by a coronal mass ejection, could disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. While the ejection is weakening, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event, making for optimal viewing conditions in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper, a 23-year-old British tennis player, has impressed many with his rise in the sport, with his next opponent, Alexander Bublik, describing it as "insane." Draper, known for his powerful left-handed serve and forehand, has made significant strides on clay this season, reaching his first clay final in Madrid. Bublik, whose ranking fell before a change in approach, acknowledged Draper's improvement, though Draper will be keen to ensure a first Grand Slam quarter-final appearance has to wait. The two players are set to compete at the French Open.</p>
