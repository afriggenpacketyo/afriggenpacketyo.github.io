        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru secured a significant by-election victory in Caerphilly, triumphing over the far-right populist Reform UK and the incumbent Labour Party. This outcome is widely interpreted as a crucial indicator for broader UK political trends, especially given Reform UK's current strength in national polls. Plaid Cymru, a center-left party advocating for Welsh independence, emphasized its commitment to "practical solutions" and a "pro-Wales vision" for the future. The result marks a notable setback for Labour in a historically safe, working-class seat and underscores the dynamic shifts occurring within Welsh politics.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration declared a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, increasing average retirement benefits by approximately $56 per month starting in January. This annual adjustment aims to help benefits keep pace with inflation, impacting about 75 million people. However, for many beneficiaries, this increase might not fully alleviate the strain of higher prices. The COLA is calculated based on the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W) and is in line with expert projections. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is selling 25 shares of Eaton at approximately $380, reducing its weighting in the electrical equipment maker. This move follows Eaton's stock almost fully recovering from an August decline, which the Trust deemed undeserved due to strong performance in its Electrical Americas business. The Trust is downgrading the stock to a "2" rating, suggesting a wait for a pullback before buying more, despite continued belief in the AI infrastructure trade. This profit-taking aligns with monitoring market "overbought" indicators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The decaying lakeside villa, originally built for Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels, has been temporarily transferred to the municipality of Wandlitz, with plans to host guided tours and events. This initiative represents a concerted effort to prevent the demolition of the historic complex, which has been unused since 2000 and requires an estimated €300 million for full renovation. The state of Berlin will continue to bear the annual management costs, grappling with Germany's ongoing challenge of how to appropriately manage and repurpose former Nazi sites. The villa, once Goebbels' private retreat, later served as a youth facility for East German communists.</p>

          <p>Shares of Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) surged over 6% following a report indicating that IBM can successfully utilize AMD's field-programmable gate array chips to run specific quantum error-correction algorithms. This positive development builds upon an existing agreement between the two technology giants to jointly advance quantum computing capabilities. Quantum computing, which aims to tackle complex problems beyond the scope of traditional computers, is a rapidly developing field with major players like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon also investing heavily. IBM's ambitious goal is to debut a functional quantum computer by 2029, further fueling interest and investment in the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, known as "Brother Wang," an alleged fentanyl kingpin, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States, facilitated by the Mexican government. Accused of international drug trafficking, money laundering, and alliances with cartels like Sinaloa, Zhi escaped house arrest in Mexico in July. This extradition follows increased pressure from the Trump administration on Mexico and China to curb fentanyl trafficking. Fentanyl, a potent synthetic opioid, has largely replaced heroin as a cause of overdoses in the U.S.</p>

          <p>Police have dismantled an international plot spanning three countries to sell suspected forgeries of famous artworks by artists like Rembrandt, Picasso, and Frida Kahlo for millions. The main suspect, a 77-year-old German man, allegedly attempted to sell 20 fake paintings, including a copy of Rembrandt's "De Staalmeesters" for $150 million, despite the original being in a museum. Ten accomplices are also under investigation.

          <p>Guillermo del Toro shares his profound connection to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, describing horror literature as a "refuge of spirituality" that allows us to explore primal fears and existential questions safely. He emphasizes how Shelley, writing as a teenager, poured her contradictions into the monster's tale, creating a tragedy without a villain. Del Toro highlights the novel's exploration of science's arrogance and the infinite sorrow of an abandoned creation, resonating with themes of father-son relationships and the "lineage of pain" he also explores in his own films. The article serves as an introduction to a new edition of the classic work.</p>

          <p>New research from the Pasteur Institute, analyzing DNA from fallen soldiers' teeth, has identified two previously unexpected pathogens—paratyphoid fever and relapsing fever—that contributed to the decimation of Napoleon's 600,000-strong army during its 1812 Russian campaign. These findings complement earlier evidence of typhus and trench fever, painting a grim picture of soldiers under constant microbial assault. The study highlights how modern paleogenomic techniques can reconstruct rich historical medical data, offering insights into disease emergence and spread during wartime, and the brutal realities of past conflicts.</p>

However, the company noted flat overall volume, indicating waning demand in some categories as inflation-weary consumers seek value, leading to "K-shaped" shopping behaviors. P&G plans innovation to justify prices and combat heightened competition, while adjusting its tariff cost outlook after Canada rescinded retaliatory tariffs, though new U.S.-Canada trade tensions could impact future costs.

          <p>A significant change for 2025 requires certain non-spouse beneficiaries of inherited IRAs, such as adult children, to begin taking annual required minimum distributions (RMDs) while depleting the account over 10 years. Failure to do so could incur a 25% IRS penalty, though waivers are possible. This update clarifies "10-year rule" ambiguities, impacting a substantial portion of the projected "great wealth transfer."
