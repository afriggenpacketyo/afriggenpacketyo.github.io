          <p>Iowa Republican Rep. Randy Feenstra is reportedly planning to announce his candidacy for governor, setting up a potentially competitive primary race. This follows Gov. Kim Reynolds' decision not to seek reelection, opening the field for both Republicans and Democrats. State auditor Rob Sand has already entered the race on the Democratic side. Feenstra's entry could lead to a high-profile primary, possibly including Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, who is considered a favorite of President Trump. Other potential GOP candidates include U.S. Rep. Zach Nunn and state Sen. Mike Bousselot. This race is expected to be closely watched both within Iowa and nationally, especially for those eyeing the 2028 presidential election cycle.</p>

          <p>The Kurdistan Workers‚Äô Party (P.K.K.), a Kurdish militia group, has announced it will lay down its arms and disband after a four-decade-long insurgency against the Turkish state. This decision follows calls from imprisoned leader Abdullah Ocalan, who believes the group's armed struggle has achieved its purpose and further progress can be made through political means. The P.K.K. began as a secessionist group but has more recently sought greater rights for Kurds within Turkey. The move could end a conflict that has claimed over 40,000 lives and could potentially boost President Erdogan's support among Kurds. The long conflict has led to bombings and military responses, but this could lead to expansion of Kurdish cultural rights.</p>

          <p>Treasury yields increased after the U.S. and China agreed to reduce tariffs on each other's goods. The 10-year Treasury yield rose by 5.8 basis points to 4.431%, while the 2-year Treasury yield jumped more than 10 basis points to 3.983%. The agreement involves lowering tariffs from 125% to 10%, although U.S. duties on Chinese imports related to fentanyl remain at 20%, resulting in total tariffs of 30%. This development has shifted sentiment regarding Trump's trade war in a positive direction, potentially affording the Federal Reserve more flexibility. Economists had previously expressed concerns about a potential recession if high tariffs remained in place.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at lowering drug prices by implementing a "most favored nations drug pricing" model. The order seeks to ensure Americans pay the lowest price for drugs, matching prices in other developed countries, potentially reducing costs by 50 to 90%. The White House intends to take action against foreign countries engaged in practices that unfairly undercut market prices. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) opposes the order, arguing it will jeopardize investments in America and increase reliance on China for innovative medicines. The White House says the order directs the U.S. Trade Representative and Secretary of Commerce to take action to ensure foreign countries are not engaged in practices that purposefully and unfairly undercut market prices and drive price hikes in the United States.</p>

The article argues that while Arsenal may be winning the metrics, they are not consistently winning games, pointing to a lack of ruthlessness and a tendency to concede cheap goals. The author suggests that manager Mikel Arteta may be too focused on controlling the game and struggles to accept the inherent chaos of football. Ultimately, the article concludes that winning the game is what truly matters, and Arsenal currently lacks the necessary edge to do so consistently.</p>

Diners on GLP-1s are figuring out which types of restaurants they feel comfortable visiting, how to leave food on their plates without insulting the chef or their dining companions, and how to get the most value out of the experience. Those not on the drugs are contending with the pros and cons of going out with people who don‚Äôt do much eating. The article explores how dining habits are changing as a result of these weight-loss medications.</p>

          <p>The U.S. and China have agreed to a temporary reduction in tariffs for 90 days, signaling a breakthrough in trade negotiations. Both countries will lower tariffs by 115 percentage points for three months, providing room for further negotiations. The temporary reductions will reduce the U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to about 30%, while China will reduce its levies on American imports to 10%. China has also agreed to ease some non-tariff barriers. The agreement has boosted stock markets, but some analysts question its long-term sustainability.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom is urging cities, towns, and counties to ban homeless encampments on public property. He has created a template for a local ordinance that municipalities can adopt to outlaw encampments and clear existing ones. The move coincides with the release of more than $3 billion in state-controlled housing funds that local officials can use to put his template in place. The model ordinance requires cities to offer shelter or housing and give homeless people at least 48 hours‚Äô notice before clearing an encampment.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement represents progress in the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products for strategic necessities. While the U.S. is not seeking a generalized decoupling from China, Bessent emphasized the importance of securing resilient supply chains, particularly for critical materials like steel, medicines, and semiconductors. The agreement is a 90-day pause that will see reciprocal duties halted, although the 10% tariff and a 20% charge related to fentanyl will remain in place.</p>

Despite the White House‚Äôs bluster, the Trump administration ultimately backed off, for now, from the steepest tariffs, and agreed to hold more formal talks with Beijing after companies and consumers started showing signs of economic strain.</p>
