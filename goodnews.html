          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, retaining her undisputed super lightweight titles via a controversial majority decision at Madison Square Garden. The bout concluded their highly anticipated trilogy, with all three fights ending in contested victories for Taylor. Despite landing fewer punches in their second fight and facing another close contest this time, Taylor's hand was raised, extending her professional record to 25-1. Following the satisfying win, Taylor acknowledged she has little left to prove in the sport and is considering her future, including potential retirement.</p>

          <p>Chelsea faces a significant challenge against a dominant Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, a match seen as a major test for their youth-focused project. Despite being underdogs against a PSG team that recently defeated Real Madrid 4-0, Chelsea's manager Enzo Maresca insists they will not abandon their tactical identity by "parking the bus." The club views its progress to the final as validation of its long-term strategy, regardless of the outcome. The article highlights the tactical matchup, key player absences, and the financial and reputational stakes involved for the London-based team.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures forecasted to reach a peak of up to 34°C on Saturday. The hottest conditions are expected in the Midlands and south Wales, while amber heat health alerts remain active for much of England. The sustained warm and dry weather has prompted hosepipe bans for over seven million people in several regions to manage record-level demand for drinking water. The heatwave is expected to subside by Monday as cooler Atlantic air moves in, bringing showers and clouds.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Clippers forward Kobe Brown showcased his potential with a strong performance before exiting with a right ankle contusion during a Summer League game against the Houston Rockets. Brown scored 14 points in 20 minutes, demonstrating his ability to contribute as a rotational player before the precautionary removal. In his absence, Jordan Miller, who was recently waived but re-added to the summer roster, stepped up with an impressive 23 points and 11 rebounds. Rookie center Yanic Konan Niederhauser also made a significant defensive impact in the Clippers' 95-92 win.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a $6.7 billion deal to acquire a second batch of 180 K2 main battle tanks from South Korea, reinforcing its position as a major European military power. This acquisition is part of a larger 2022 agreement to procure nearly 1,000 tanks, as Poland increases defense spending in response to Russia's aggression in neighboring Ukraine. The deal underscores South Korea's growing role as a key arms supplier to U.S. allies, who are seeking to replenish stockpiles depleted by support for Ukraine. The tanks will be produced both in South Korea and, eventually, in Poland.</p>

          <p>Italian luxury brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers following a cultural controversy. The move comes after the fashion house was criticized for showcasing sandals at Milan Fashion Week that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals without acknowledging their origin. In response to the outcry, Prada held a meeting with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. This initiative is being viewed as a potential model for respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company secretly used their voices, recorded for what they were told were internal tests, to create and sell AI-generated voice clones on its platform. While the judge dismissed a federal copyright claim on their voices themselves, claims of breach of contract and deceptive practices will proceed. The case is a significant development for artists concerned about the unauthorized use of their work by AI companies.</p>

          <p>Chinese law firms are increasingly establishing an international presence to meet the growing legal demands of Chinese companies expanding abroad. As more domestic businesses operate globally, they show a preference for legal support from Chinese lawyers, whom they trust to navigate complex international environments. According to China's Ministry of Justice, the number of overseas offices for Chinese law firms grew by 70 percent between 2018 and the end of last year. While serving compatriots is the primary driver, lawyers acknowledge that winning over non-Chinese clients is challenging amid current geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>China's pharmaceutical industry is preparing to enter the lucrative global weight-loss drug market, with approximately 60 similar drugs currently in clinical trials. The market is set to become highly competitive as the Chinese patent on semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular drugs like Ozempic, expires next year. This is expected to lead to the launch of cheaper generic versions from numerous domestic drug makers, potentially making these treatments more affordable for patients. Analysts predict this will significantly increase competition and drive down prices within the rapidly growing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a $365 million terminal expansion project, signaling confidence despite a recent slowdown in port activity linked to rising tariffs and global trade tensions. The project, led by operator International Transportation Service, will expand the quay to accommodate larger ships and is expected to boost cargo-handling capacity by 50 percent. Officials acknowledged the current uncertainty in the shipping industry but emphasized the long-term need for infrastructure investment to strengthen America's supply chain.

As part of his plea agreement, he will cooperate with prosecutors and forfeit $80 million in assets, likely receiving a reduced sentence. His 2023 capture in Mexico and subsequent extradition were major events in the ongoing effort to dismantle the powerful cartel.</p>
