          <p>Emily Thornberry has officially pulled out of the race for the Labour deputy leadership position, narrowing the field to four remaining candidates. Announcing her decision on social media, Thornberry, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, had only secured 13 nominations from MPs, falling significantly short of the 80 required to advance. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently leads the race with 116 nominations, positioning her as the clear frontrunner. The contest is seen by some as a potential distraction for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, as it could become a platform for party members to voice discontent with the current leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index soared to a new all-time high, driven by optimism following positive U.S. inflation data and hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts. Tech investment giant SoftBank Group was a major contributor, with its stock jumping over 10% following a report of a massive cloud-computing deal between Oracle and OpenAI. This connection is significant due to SoftBank and Oracle's joint involvement in the U.S. government's $500 billion Stargate AI initiative. The rally in Japanese markets reflects a broader positive sentiment seen across several Asian and U.S. stock indices. (not investment advice)</p>

The IPO raised $1.37 billion, valuing the company at approximately $17.3 billion and marking a significant win for early investors like Sequoia Capital. Known for its 'buy now, pay later' services, Klarna's successful public offering signals strong investor appetite for new tech listings. The company's future performance will test Wall Street's confidence in its expansion into broader banking services, including debit cards and deposit accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Liverpool defender Andre Wisdom has opened up about the 2020 stabbing incident that he says irrevocably changed his professional career. Wisdom was attacked and robbed by masked men, sustaining multiple wounds that required surgery and left him with permanent nerve damage and chronic pain. Although he returned to play for Derby County just months later, he felt his physical capabilities were diminished and his career at the top level was effectively over. Now 32, Wisdom plays for the semi-professional club FC United of Manchester and reflects on his journey with a sense of gratitude for being able to continue playing the sport he loves.</p>

          <p>A recent Morgan Stanley report indicates that U.S. investor interest in Chinese equities has reached its highest point since early 2021, with over 90% of surveyed investors expressing a willingness to increase their exposure.

The bank suggests that the return of capital to China is just beginning, as many global and emerging-market funds are likely to increase their allocations over time after conducting due diligence on individual stocks.

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force has banned 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers from its procurement projects following a sweeping anti-corruption investigation. The force, which manages China's strategic nuclear missiles, announced the disqualifications on a military procurement network, with some entities being barred from all PLA projects. This crackdown is part of a broader review of military equipment procurement that intensified after the downfall of former defense minister Li Shangfu in 2023. The move signals a significant effort by President Xi Jinping's administration to root out corruption within the country's critical defense sectors.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers completed a series sweep against the Colorado Rockies with a 9-0 victory, extending their National League West lead to three games. Mookie Betts led the offense with a four-hit, five-RBI performance that included a grand slam, while pitcher Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings with 11 strikeouts. However, the win was tempered by the last-minute scratch of catcher Will Smith, who experienced renewed swelling in his hand from a recent bone bruise. The incident underscores the team's ongoing struggle with injuries as they aim to field a fully healthy lineup for the final stretch of the season.</p>

          <p>Everton has undergone a remarkable turnaround, moving from a relegation battle to a top-five position in the Premier League, thanks to a significant overhaul of its squad and finances. The club recorded its highest-ever net spend in a summer transfer window, investing £97 million in nine new players after years of minimal spending. This financial transformation has been driven by the takeover by the Friedkin Group, which has managed the club's debts, and the promise of increased revenue from their new stadium. The strategic recruitment, including the key loan signing of Jack Grealish, reflects a shift away from past costly transfer mistakes.</p>

          <p>Amid a sector-wide slump, high-end luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Prada are diversifying their product lines with less expensive items, such as cosmetics and accessories, to attract new customers. Louis Vuitton recently launched a beauty collection featuring $160 lipsticks, aiming to engage a broader range of aspirational consumers without devaluing its core high-ticket products. This strategy, sometimes called "treatonomics," bets that shoppers will still splurge on small luxuries even while cutting back on major purchases. The move echoes tactics from a previous industry downturn, where brands successfully used streetwear and smaller items to bring a younger demographic into their ecosystem.</p>

          <p>Stock markets around the world are rallying to new records, fueled by growing investor confidence as inflation pressures ease and expectations for U.S. interest rate cuts increase.

This positive sentiment marks a significant shift from earlier in the year, when fears of persistent inflation and geopolitical risks dominated markets. The rally is supported by resilient corporate earnings and recent U.S. economic data suggesting a cooling labor market, bolstering the case for the Federal Reserve to begin easing its monetary policy.

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan over the past five years in a strategic mineral exploration program, resulting in significant new discoveries of oil, gas, and critical minerals like lithium and uranium. Officials reported that since 2021, geologists have identified over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, including 10 major oilfields and 19 large gas fields. These breakthroughs are part of China's broader effort to enhance its energy security, dominate critical mineral supply chains, and reduce its dependence on foreign imports. The discoveries are expected to support stable domestic production of oil and natural gas for years to come.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, marking their first face-to-face meeting in over a year and a half. The 50-minute meeting is being viewed as a small but potentially significant step toward mending their fractured relationship, following years of public criticism and family tension. In recent months, Prince Harry has publicly expressed a desire for reconciliation, and the quiet coordination of this meeting suggests a mutual, albeit cautious, effort from both sides. While a full family reunion remains distant, particularly with no signs of a meeting with Prince William, this encounter is seen as a positive development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from real estate company Redfin suggests that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a level of "normalcy" relative to local incomes, reaching a mortgage-to-income ratio last seen in July 2018. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with rapidly rising wages in the tech sector. However, this return to a pre-pandemic equilibrium does not mean the city has become affordable in absolute terms, as San Francisco households still spend a much larger share of their income on housing than the national average. The analysis highlights a growing divergence between high-earning homeowners and renters, who face spiking costs driven by the local AI boom.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has discovered rocks on Mars containing organic carbon and mineral compounds that represent one of the strongest indications yet of potential ancient microbial life. The samples, collected from a dry river channel in Jezero Crater, contain iron phosphate and iron sulfide specks, which on Earth are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. Scientists emphasize that non-biological processes could also be responsible and that conclusive proof requires returning the samples to Earth for in-depth analysis. Despite the ambiguity, the discovery is being hailed as a significant step forward in the search for extraterrestrial life.</p>
