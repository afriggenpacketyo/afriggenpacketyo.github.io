          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher, has been released from immigration detention following a judge's ruling that his detention violated his right to free speech and due process. US authorities had accused him of spreading Hamas propaganda and having ties to terrorism, claims the judge refuted, stating there was no evidence of statements supporting Hamas. Suri's lawyers argued he was targeted for speech in support of Palestinian rights and family ties to Gaza. Despite the release, the Trump administration is still seeking to deport Suri in separate proceedings, raising concerns about the targeting of academics and students advocating for Palestinian rights.</p>

          <p>China-Philippine ties face uncertainty as President Marcos' efforts to undermine the Duterte camp have been unsuccessful, with Duterte likely to survive an impeachment trial. Observers suggest Duterte, with her pragmatic stance on China, could become a strong presidential candidate in 2028, potentially improving relations between the two countries. Despite accusations of misusing public funds, Duterte appears to have enough support to avoid conviction, preserving her eligibility for the 2028 race. Qi Huaigao, a professor at Fudan University, noted Marcos' failure to eliminate the Duterte political dynasty, indicating a potential shift in diplomatic strategy depending on future election outcomes.</p>

          <p>While the US President Donald Trump has said that white Afrikaners are being persecuted in their home country, and that they are being subjected to a "genocide", this is a claim that has been circulating for many years even though it has been widely discredited. Although some white farmers have been attacked and killed, South Africa has one of the world's highest murder rates, so this is an issue that affects all of its citizens, whatever their race. Some Afrikaners express pride in their heritage and commitment to South Africa, while others feel persecuted and seek refuge in the US. The article explores the complex debate surrounding the status of Afrikaners in South Africa and the differing perspectives on Trump's offer of resettlement.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claimed they acted in self-defense after years of alleged abuse. A cousin of the brothers said that if they are free, she assumes the brothers would advocate for victims of sexual abuse and childhood trauma. The case will now go to the California Board of Parole Hearings before being sent to the governor's office, marking a significant development in a case that has captivated public attention for decades.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is investigating the deaths of numerous birds found in a Richmond neighborhood under mysterious circumstances. While some birds showed signs of trauma consistent with being shot by a pellet or BB gun, others were initially suspected of electrocution. PG&E, the local utility company, stated that the birds they evaluated showed no evidence of electrocution, but residents in the area report seeing birds appearing to be fried on the power lines. The investigation is ongoing to determine the cause of the bird deaths and address community concerns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government will now permit foreign states to own up to 15% of British newspapers and news magazines under new legislation. This decision reverses a previous ban prompted by a takeover bid for the Telegraph and the Spectator, which was backed by the Abu Dhabi ruling family. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said the changes aim to protect media plurality while enabling publishers to secure vital funding. The move follows consultations indicating that a complete ban was too restrictive for attracting investment, balancing national security concerns with the financial needs of the news industry.</p>

          <p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom has announced his support for two bills aimed at streamlining housing development in urban areas, emphasizing the need to cut red tape to address the state's housing crisis. Newsom's revised budget proposal includes provisions to reform the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and remove other obstacles to new housing construction. The proposals aim to expedite the permitting process for infill projects and force permit deadlines on the Coastal Commission. These measures seek to accelerate urban development and address California's high cost of living by easing regulatory burdens.</p>

          <p>Santa Monica's City Council has approved a proposal to allow public drinking on the Third Street Promenade, aiming to transform the commercial strip into an entertainment zone and boost business recovery post-pandemic. The new policy, set to begin in June, will permit visitors to purchase alcoholic beverages from participating businesses and consume them outdoors on weekends. The initiative seeks to increase foot traffic and support local businesses in the area, which has experienced declining activity in recent years. The goal is to create a vibrant outdoor patio atmosphere and encourage leasing in the unique downtown area.</p>

          <p>Overdose deaths in the United States experienced a significant decline last year, dropping by nearly 30,000, signaling progress in combating the opioid crisis. The CDC data indicates a decrease in fatalities across major drug categories and in most states. Despite this positive trend, proposed budget cuts to federal health programs, including those addressing substance abuse, threaten to undermine the progress made. Experts express concern that these cuts could reverse the momentum and lead to a resurgence in drug-related deaths, highlighting the need for sustained investment in addiction treatment and prevention efforts.</p>
