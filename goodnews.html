        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>France has enacted a stringent new anti-smoking law, banning smoking in most public spaces, including beaches, parks, and areas near schools and libraries. The legislation aims to "denormalize" smoking, particularly among young people, as tobacco-related illnesses claim 75,000 lives annually in the country. Violators of the new ban face significant fines, potentially up to 700 euros, though an initial grace period is expected. While the move is supported by health organizations and a majority of the public, some smokers feel their freedoms are being restricted, with caf√© terraces remaining one of the last public refuges for them.</p>

The company has demonstrated strong growth, with a 46% revenue increase in the first quarter and over 1,000 clients contributing at least $100,000 in annual revenue.

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by a convincing 24-run margin in Bristol, taking a 2-0 lead in the five-match T20 series. Despite a strong start from England's bowlers that left India at 31-3, a pivotal 93-run partnership between Jemimah Rodrigues and Amanjot Kaur powered the tourists to a competitive total of 181-4. In response, England's batting lineup faltered early, slumping to 17-3 and failing to recover despite a half-century from Tammy Beaumont. The victory showcases India's growing strength and consistency ahead of the upcoming 50-over World Cup, while highlighting recurring weaknesses for England.</p>

For "Rebirth," he aimed to honor Williams' iconic themes while introducing new motifs for adventure and danger, balancing his own artistic tendencies with the director's push for memorable, hummable melodies.

The analysis compares his earnings to the top contracts in the NFL, which are dominated by quarterbacks, and MLB. It concludes that Gilgeous-Alexander's deal is a low-risk investment given his age and elite performance. (not investment advice)</p>

This innovative material is designed as a "drop-in" ingredient, meaning it can be integrated into existing diaper manufacturing processes.

If the deal is approved by shareholders, Santander intends to fully integrate TSB into its UK operations, which would likely mean the end of the TSB brand on the UK high street. The takeover would create the UK's third-largest bank by personal current account share. While it is "business as usual for now," Santander has indicated that the merger will result in job cuts due to duplicated roles and potential branch closures where their networks overlap.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by SmartAsset has identified Bend, Oregon, as the city with the best job market in the United States, followed by Richmond, Virginia, and Seattle, Washington. The ranking of 348 cities was based on six key metrics, including unemployment rate, income growth, health insurance coverage, commute time, remote work prevalence, and housing affordability. Bend scored highly for its low unemployment, significant income growth of 44% since 2020, and excellent work-life balance, featuring a short 16-minute median commute. The study also highlighted cities like Santa Clara, California, for health coverage and Frisco, Texas, for a high percentage of remote workers.</p>
