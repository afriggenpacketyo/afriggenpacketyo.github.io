          <p>Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker has officially announced his bid for a third term, launching his campaign with a video and a formal event in Chicago. In his announcement, Pritzker highlighted his administration's achievements, including seven balanced budgets, multiple state credit upgrades, and the legalization of marijuana, while positioning himself against the policies of the Trump administration. He outlined future goals such as restructuring education for the AI era and making housing more affordable, though he avoided committing to serving a full term amid speculation about a potential 2028 presidential run.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially launched his reelection campaign, positioning himself as a blue-collar leader with a record of reducing crime and creating jobs. Running as an independent, Adams contrasted his practical achievements with the progressive platform of his chief rival, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani, whom he criticized as inexperienced. Adams' first term was marked by a federal corruption probe that was later dismissed, and he now faces a general election contest against Mamdani and Republican Curtis Sliwa in his bid for a second term.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, demonstrating a significant recovery from a sharp decline in April that was triggered by new tariff announcements. Analysts attribute the rebound to several factors, including easing concerns about trade disputes as negotiations enter a quieter phase and strong performance from the technology sector, particularly AI-related companies like Nvidia. Optimism is also fueled by forecasts of potential interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve later this year, which could further stimulate economic activity and investor confidence.

In a recent game against the Colorado Rockies, the 37-year-old left-hander recorded five strikeouts over six innings, bringing his total to 2,997. The team strategically removed him from the game early, preserving the opportunity for him to achieve the milestone in front of a home crowd at Dodger Stadium. Upon reaching it, Kershaw will become just the 20th pitcher in MLB history to join the prestigious 3,000-strikeout club.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured the first direct evidence of a planet outside our solar system since its launch, a significant milestone for the observatory. The exoplanet, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young star. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to suppress the star's bright light, revealing the faint planet nearby. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly points to it being a previously undiscovered planet.</p>

Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police records, but her defense successfully argued the documents were publicly available court records used for a legitimate purpose. The court's unanimous ruling found her actions were not criminal, ending a politically charged case that had been heavily criticized by criminal justice reform advocates as unfounded.</p>
