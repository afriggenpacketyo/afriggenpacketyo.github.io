        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a lack of federal oversight, 23 U.S. states have passed or expanded laws to regulate the collection and use of biometric data, including facial recognition technology. New rules in states like Colorado, Texas, and Oregon now mandate consent for data usage and, in some instances, prohibit the sale of such information. These legislative efforts aim to curb the widespread digital tracking by tech companies and protect consumer privacy. Illinois's stringent biometric privacy law, uniquely granting individuals a private right of action, has already resulted in substantial settlements from major tech firms, although pursuing elusive overseas companies like PimEyes remains difficult for legal action.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Social Security is a vital income source for many retirees, with a significant percentage depending on it for half or more of their income. This article details three strategies to maximize retirement benefits: delaying claims until age 70 for an 8% annual increase, working longer to replace lower-earning years in the 35-year calculation, and coordinating spousal benefits, especially for higher earners. These actions can lead to substantially larger monthly checks. Additional options for supplementing retirement income include purchasing annuities, utilizing reverse mortgages, and maintaining a diversified retirement portfolio to cover rising costs.

          <p>Choosing between a Certificate of Deposit (CD) and a money market account for a $40,000 deposit involves weighing fixed versus variable interest rates in a changing economic climate. This article compares their potential earnings, noting that while money market accounts might offer slightly higher returns for very short durations, CDs provide guaranteed rates, making them potentially more secure. Given anticipated Federal Reserve rate cuts, money market account yields are likely to decrease, making the fixed returns of a CD more appealing for those prioritizing certainty. Savers should consider the trade-off between current slight advantages and future rate stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nike is undertaking another round of corporate layoffs, impacting less than 1% of its staff, as CEO Elliott Hill drives a strategic realignment to spur growth. This initiative is part of a broader restructuring, following previous cuts, aimed at repositioning sport and sport culture at the company's core. The new approach reverses a prior strategy that segmented the business by gender and kids, with Hill seeking to enhance innovation and strengthen connections with athletes and retail partners. Employees in the U.S. and Canada will work remotely next week as impact conversations are held, with new roles taking effect by September 21.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 13:02:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eli Lilly, the company behind the popular weight loss drug Mounjaro, has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers, which is expected to soften a previously announced price increase for consumers. Earlier, the drug's list price was set to surge by up to 170%, potentially raising the highest dose to £330 per month. Under the new agreement, the BBC understands the highest dose will be sold to suppliers for £247.50, significantly reducing the impact on patients who largely purchase the drug privately. This move comes after Eli Lilly aimed to align UK prices with higher rates in other countries.</p>

          <p>Nvidia's recent earnings report showcased a 56% increase in quarterly sales to $46.74 billion, driven by strong AI demand, though clarity on its China operations remains elusive. The Trump administration's prior ban on Nvidia's H20 chip sales in China has created significant uncertainty, despite ongoing negotiations for a potential restart. CEO Jensen Huang highlighted the immense, early-stage opportunity in AI, projecting $3-4 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2030, but acknowledged the geopolitical complexities. Analysts view the results as consistent with Nvidia's growth objectives, indicating sustained industry-wide AI investment despite the specific market challenges. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for discounts of up to £3,750 under a new government grant scheme. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier qualify for the maximum discount, with an additional 26 models receiving £1,500 off, applicable to new cars priced up to £37,000. This initiative aims to reduce the upfront cost barrier for drivers switching to EVs, aligning with the government's 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. The £650 million scheme is expected to make EVs more financially accessible, though concerns about charging infrastructure persist.</p>
