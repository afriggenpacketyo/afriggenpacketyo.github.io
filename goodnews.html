        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples' dynamics has identified the five most common sources of conflict in relationships. These include tone of voice or attitude, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. The psychologist emphasizes that contempt, often conveyed through tone and body language, is a strong predictor of divorce. Uneven distribution of labor, particularly the "invisible load" of managing household tasks and appointments, is a frequent cause of arguments over chores. Effective communication strategies, such as the "five-second rule" for taking time-outs during heated discussions, can help couples navigate these challenges.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara has formed off the southwestern coast of Mexico and is expected to intensify into a hurricane, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is located about 170 miles southwest of Zihuatanejo, Guerrero, with maximum sustained winds of 60 mph. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect, the storm may bring two to four inches of rainfall to western Mexican states, potentially causing flooding and mudslides. Additionally, Barbara is expected to generate dangerous sea swells and rip currents along the southwestern coast. NOAA officials have predicted a 60% chance of an above-normal hurricane season in the Pacific.</p>

          <p>The UK government is exploring stricter online safety measures, potentially including time limits for children's social media use, such as a two-hour cap on individual apps and a 22:00 curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the "addictive nature" of some apps and smartphones. Online safety campaigner Ian Russell criticized the government's delays in enacting tougher laws to protect children. While some parental controls and screen time limits are already available, their usage is reportedly low, prompting discussions on more effective regulations to ensure children's online safety.</p>
