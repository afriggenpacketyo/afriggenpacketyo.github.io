          <p>Representative Jerry Nadler, a long-serving Democrat from New York, has announced he will not seek reelection in 2026, ending a congressional career that began in 1992. Citing a "necessity for generational change," the 78-year-old stated that a younger successor might be better equipped to confront the political challenges posed by Donald Trump. Nadler is a prominent figure in the Democratic party, having served as the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, where he played a key role in both of Trump's impeachments. His retirement marks a significant transition for New York and national politics.</p>

          <p>Marie Tidball, a Labour MP with a congenital disability, is raising awareness about the significant accessibility issues within the historic Houses of Parliament. Despite the passage of the Equalities Act 15 years ago, she points out that many areas of the estate remain difficult to navigate for people with disabilities, citing heavy doors with smooth handles, distant accessible toilets, and physically demanding voting procedures. Tidball emphasizes that with 22% of the voting-age population being disabled, Parliament must become more inclusive to better reflect the society it serves. A modernization committee is currently reviewing these issues.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Chargers running back Najee Harris has confirmed that his vision is fine following a fireworks accident in July and that he expects to be ready for the season opener against the Kansas City Chiefs. After being cleared for contact, Harris described the incident as a "humbling experience" but stated the eye injury was superficial. He has been practicing with a tinted visor and has never missed a game in his four-year NFL career, a streak he hopes to continue. Coach Jim Harbaugh noted that Harris has looked "really, really good" in practice since his return.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is celebrated as a masterpiece of rustic architecture and a benchmark for national park lodges across the United States. Built in 1904, it was advertised as the world's largest log cabin and was constructed using some 10,000 trees, including many with unique, twisted shapes that give the structure its distinct character. For over a century, the inn has hosted millions of visitors, including presidents and royalty, and has survived natural events like earthquakes and wildfires. Its iconic style influenced the design of other famous lodges in parks like Yosemite and Glacier.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell has experienced a career revival, partly fueled by a new audience on TikTok and support from artists like Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas. Odell recounts how a 2016 show he considered a personal failure deeply inspired Finneas to pursue his own music, a lesson Odell says taught him about his unseen impact on others. After going independent from his record label, his song "Black Friday" became a global hit, allowing him new creative and financial freedom. This success has led to a new album and tour dates opening for Eilish.</p>

          <p>Premier League clubs have set a new spending record, with their total outlay during the summer transfer window surpassing £3 billion for the first time. The final figure was pushed past the milestone by several major deadline-day deals, including Alexander Isak's £125 million British record move from Newcastle to Liverpool. This summer's spending significantly eclipses the £1.96 billion spent last year and is more than the combined total of all clubs in the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, and Serie A. This financial dominance highlights the widening gap between the Premier League and other top European leagues.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has shattered its previous transfer spending habits, concluding the summer with an unprecedented £415 million outlay, the highest ever by a single club in one window. This strategic shift, under new manager Arne Slot, was highlighted by the British record £125 million signing of striker Alexander Isak from Newcastle. The club's aggressive spending was fueled by a combination of factors, including strong commercial growth, player sales, and a desire to capitalize on their recent Premier League title win. This marks a significant departure from the more conservative financial approach seen under former manager Jurgen Klopp.</p>

          <p>Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson is generating early Oscar buzz for his dramatic turn as UFC fighter Mark Kerr in the new film "The Smashing Machine," which premiered at the Venice Film Festival. Johnson stated he had a "burning desire" to take on a more intense and raw role after feeling "pigeon-holed" as a blockbuster action star for years. The film, directed by Benny Safdie, explores Kerr's career, his struggles with substance abuse, and his personal relationships. Critics have praised Johnson's performance as a "revelation," noting his sincere and ego-less portrayal of the complex fighter.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a group of 10 Eurasian nations including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a joint development bank. The initiative aims to fund key infrastructure projects and insulate member countries from the perceived risks of the U.S. dollar-dominated global financial system. Analysts suggest that creating such a lender is a logical step for the bloc, promoting regional economic integration and providing an alternative to Western-led financial institutions. The move reflects a broader trend among these nations to strengthen their economic and strategic autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study has precisely dated the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, to be at least 286,000 years old. This new minimum age, determined using advanced uranium-series dating techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of conflicting estimates. The findings strengthen the theory that the fossil belongs to Homo heidelbergensis, a species considered a common ancestor of Neanderthals and modern humans. This suggests that distinct archaic human populations coexisted with emerging Neanderthals in southeastern Europe, adding complexity to our understanding of human evolution.</p>

          <p>The aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, may be visible across much of the United Kingdom in the coming days due to heightened solar activity. According to the Met Office, a recent coronal mass ejection from the sun has increased the likelihood of sightings much further south than usual. While visibility is never guaranteed and depends on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, there is a "decent chance" for a memorable display. The best opportunities for viewing are expected on Monday and Tuesday nights, particularly in areas with less cloud cover, such as the Midlands.</p>
