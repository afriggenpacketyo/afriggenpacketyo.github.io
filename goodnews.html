          <h2>Financial Advisor Ric Edelman Advocates for Significant Crypto Allocation in Portfolios</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 17:22:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman has significantly revised his guidance on cryptocurrency investments, now suggesting that portfolios could allocate between 10% and 40% to the asset class. This marks a substantial increase from his previous recommendation of a low single-digit percentage, reflecting his view that crypto has evolved into a mainstream asset. Edelman attributes this shift to the resolution of earlier uncertainties regarding regulation and adoption, as well as the obsolescence of the traditional 60/40 stock-bond model due to increased human longevity. He argues that crypto's lack of correlation with other assets makes it a valuable tool for portfolio diversification and achieving higher returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and twelve other municipalities, benefiting over 800,000 workers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these state-level increases range from $0.35 in Oregon to $1.09 in Alaska, resulting in average annual pay boosts of $420 and $925, respectively. The pay hikes come as the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25 per hour since 2009. These local and state-level adjustments are part of a broader trend to align baseline pay with the rising cost of living through ballot measures and inflation-based formulas.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the signing of a historic U.S.-brokered peace agreement between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, aimed at ending a conflict that has caused immense bloodshed for nearly three decades. The deal seeks to stabilize eastern DRC, where a Rwandan-backed militia has been active, and was signed by officials from both nations in Washington. Trump stated the U.S. would apply significant pressure, including financial penalties, to ensure both sides honor the agreement. As part of the deal, the U.S. will gain access to the DRC's substantial mineral deposits, including critical resources like copper and lithium.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record high of 6,173, driven by growing investor optimism over signs of easing global trade tensions and potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. This marks a significant rebound of approximately 24% since the market's sharp decline in April following the announcement of widespread tariffs by the Trump administration. The market's recovery has been further supported by a strong performance in technology stocks and recent positive trade developments, including a reported agreement with China. Despite the renewed confidence, some analysts caution that complacency regarding ongoing trade and tariff issues could still pose a risk to financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Brentford Football Club has rejected an improved offer from Manchester United for forward Bryan Mbeumo, with the second bid reportedly worth up to ¬£62.5 million. This follows an earlier rejected bid of ¬£45 million plus add-ons for the 25-year-old Cameroon international. Manchester United is seeking to strengthen its attack, having already signed another forward this season. Sources suggest Brentford is holding out for a higher upfront fee for Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season and has one year remaining on his contract. The player is also attracting interest from other top clubs, including Tottenham.</p>

While many of the company's products, like Uncrustables, are already free from these additives, the change will affect items such as sugar-free jams and some Hostess brand snacks.

The film "F1" stars Brad Pitt as a veteran race car driver, delivering spectacular racing sequences alongside a solid, if sometimes clich√©, dramatic storyline that explores the broader racing industry. In the sci-fi horror sequel "M3gan 2.0," the titular AI doll returns in a bigger, more comedic follow-up that pits her against a new android threat. While the sequel leans more into humor and action than horror, it is praised as an entertaining and visually improved film that cleverly comments on the anxieties surrounding artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>California legislators have voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and industry workers who have been lobbying for support as productions are increasingly lured to other states with more generous incentives. This expansion aims to revitalize the local industry, which has faced challenges from the pandemic, labor strikes, and out-of-state competition. A related bill is also advancing that would broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the potential tax offset for productions filming within the state.</p>

Initially canceled after one season in 2005, it was revived for a second season in 2014 and has since garnered a dedicated cult following.

Gallo, who is also an intersex, first-generation Latine artist, uses the film to delve into themes of masculinity, family, and self-acceptance.

          <p>This opinion article argues in favor of new congressional bills aimed at prohibiting federal law enforcement officers, particularly from ICE, from wearing masks that conceal their identities during operations. The authors contend that such practices are evocative of authoritarian regimes and undermine the principles of transparency and public accountability essential to a democratic society. They assert that masked officers create safety risks, enable impersonators, and erode the legitimacy of law enforcement. The piece concludes that while it should be an unspoken norm, the current reality necessitates codifying a ban on masking to ensure officers remain identifiable and answerable to the public.</p>
