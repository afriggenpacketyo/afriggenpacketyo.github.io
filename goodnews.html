          <p>My Chemical Romance performed their iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety during a sold-out show at Dodger Stadium. This tour marks a new peak for the influential emo band, who reunited in 2019 and are now playing stadiums for the first time without new music to promote. The concert featured elaborate theatrics, including a satirical narrative involving a fictional dictator, but the article highlights that the enduring power of their music was the main draw. The band also played a selection of other hits and a previously unreleased song, demonstrating their lasting appeal and influence on a new generation of artists.</p>

          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his status among the sport's greats. Despite heavy rain and having already secured a significant lead, Pogačar displayed his characteristic aggressive style by attacking on the final stage in Paris, ultimately finishing fourth for the stage but winning the overall race by a margin of 4 minutes and 24 seconds. The 26-year-old's victory marks the fifth consecutive year that he and Jonas Vingegaard have finished first and second. This win adds to Pogačar's impressive career, which already includes 21 Tour stage wins and a Giro d'Italia title.</p>

          <p>Ichiro Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be inducted, headlined the 2025 Baseball Hall of Fame ceremony in Cooperstown. He was joined by six-time All-Star pitcher CC Sabathia and dominant reliever Billy Wagner, who was elected in his final year of eligibility. Suzuki, a 10-time All-Star and Gold Glove winner, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection, a distinction only held by Mariano Rivera. The induction also posthumously honored Dave Parker and Dick Allen. The event celebrated the significant impact of these players on the sport, with Suzuki's enshrinement coinciding with a new exhibit on the connection between Japanese and American baseball.</p>

          <h2>US and EU Announce Trade Agreement, Averting Potential Tariff Escalation</h2>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have finalized a major trade deal, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. This agreement averts a threatened 30% tariff that was set to take effect. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy products and investing $600 billion in the American economy, which includes military equipment. The deal, which stabilizes a €1.4 trillion trade relationship, also establishes zero tariffs for key sectors like aircraft, certain chemicals, and critical raw materials, aiming to bring stability and predictability to both economies.</p>

          <h2>United States and European Union Finalize Trade Deal with 15% Tariff Rate</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following high-stakes negotiations in Scotland, the U.S. and EU have reached a trade agreement framework, setting a 15% tariff on most EU goods. Both President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen hailed the outcome as a significant achievement that provides stability. The deal prevents a potential trade war, as Trump had threatened a 30% tariff rate. In return for the moderated tariff, the EU will significantly increase its investment in the U.S. and boost purchases of American energy, a move intended to rebalance the trade relationship between the two economic powerhouses.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri secured victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, capitalizing on a key strategic moment to overtake his teammate Lando Norris.

Norris, on more durable hard tires, chased Piastri for the remainder of the race but was unable to close the gap, hindered by a few minor errors. The article analyzes the critical decisions, including tire strategy and restart timing, that swung the advantage between the two McLaren drivers in their ongoing championship battle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This financial article analyzes the recent drop in Honeywell's stock price, which occurred despite the company reporting positive earnings and raising its guidance. The author attributes the sell-off to investor impatience with the company's complex, long-term plan to split into three separate entities and a perceived lack of exposure to the booming data center market. Arguing that the market is overlooking the company's strong fundamentals in aerospace and automation, the author expresses strong conviction that the stock is undervalued. The piece concludes that the current discouragement presents a significant buying opportunity for patient investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The latest attempt to bring Marvel's first family to the big screen, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," has debuted with a strong $118 million at the North American box office. This opening makes it the fourth-largest of the year and the biggest for a Marvel film since last summer's "Deadpool & Wolverine." The film, directed under the supervision of Kevin Feige, also garnered $100 million internationally, for a total global launch of $218 million. Analysts suggest that the success of this film, along with DC's recent "Superman" movie, indicates that audiences are tired of bad movies, not necessarily superhero movies.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Greater Bay Area, encompassing Hong Kong, Macau, and cities in Guangdong, is well-positioned to become a global leader in sustainable tourism. Policymakers are already investing in green infrastructure, such as Hong Kong's new electric ferry and Shenzhen's fully electrified public transit system. The author suggests creating a low-carbon tourism corridor that links the region's cities through clean and smart travel options. To achieve this, the article emphasizes that hardware alone is not enough; it must be supported by coordinated policies, industry partnerships, and experiences that cater to the evolving priorities of environmentally conscious travelers.</p>
