          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported its eighth consecutive month of over 30,000 car deliveries in June, demonstrating resilience amid an intense price war in China's EV market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, other competitors like Nio and Li Auto showed mixed results, facing pressure from new models and aggressive pricing from companies like Xiaomi. This competitive landscape, which has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for its "disorderly" nature, is also impacting Tesla, which has seen its market share and sales in China decline. The article highlights the dynamic and challenging environment for both domestic and international automakers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that Israel has agreed to the "necessary conditions" for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the proposal. The deal, mediated by Qatar and Egypt, would provide a window to negotiate a permanent end to the conflict. This announcement comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. An Israeli official indicated readiness for a ceasefire but noted that Hamas's acceptance remains uncertain, as the group continues to demand a permanent truce and full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to revoke the status in September, well before its scheduled expiration in February 2026. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official end date. This ruling prevents the immediate loss of legal status and work permits for Haitians who rely on the program due to ongoing instability in their home country.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the United States' most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to cancer and other health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare liver cancer at age 20. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The effort was driven by Strande's powerful testimony about the public health crisis in her community, which was contaminated by waste from the 3M corporation.</p>

Developed by a volunteer-led effort, these magnetic extractors allow surgeons to safely and quickly remove metal fragments, even from delicate organs like the heart, with minimally invasive procedures. The article highlights the story of a soldier whose life was saved when a magnet was used to pull a large piece of drone shrapnel from his heart.
