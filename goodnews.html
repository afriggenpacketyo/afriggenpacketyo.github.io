          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst expectations, with profit rising 22% to $3.72 billion. The strong performance was largely driven by its trading divisions, which generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, particularly in equities trading. This success reflects a broader trend on Wall Street, where market volatility from policies like tariffs has boosted trading activity. The bank's investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% jump, though its asset and wealth management division experienced a slight revenue decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Westinghouse's interim CEO, Dan Sumner, revealed a plan to build ten large-scale AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction slated to begin by 2030. The announcement, made during a roundtable with President Donald Trump, aligns with the administration's goal to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value. To improve efficiency and avoid past project delays, Westinghouse is partnering with Google to utilize AI in the construction process.</p>

          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a recovery as investor optimism grew for the potential passage of key stablecoin legislation by the U.S. House this week. Prices for Bitcoin and Ether rose after briefly dipping when the bills, known as the GENIUS Act and CLARITY Act, failed to advance on Tuesday. The rebound was bolstered by a social media post from President Donald Trump suggesting that several Republicans had reversed their opposition following a White House meeting. Passage of the legislation is seen as a crucial step for providing regulatory clarity and stability to the digital asset industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Operations at Vancouver International Airport were briefly halted Tuesday following a report that a small Cessna 172 aircraft had been hijacked. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police received information that the plane was entering the airport's airspace with a single suspect onboard. The aircraft landed safely, and the suspect was arrested without incident, leading to a 39-minute grounding of all flights. Nine inbound flights were diverted during the security response, which officials confirmed was handled efficiently, preventing a more prolonged disruption.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced it is scaling down the National Guard presence in Los Angeles, releasing 2,000 troops from their federal mission. The deployment was initiated by the Trump administration in June to address protests related to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) operations. The move has been met with mixed reactions; Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass called it a "retreat" resulting from public pressure, while California Governor Gavin Newsom urged the administration to send all remaining troops home. The deployment has been a point of legal and political contention between state and federal authorities.</p>

The new tie-breaking rule, introduced in 2022 to avoid running out of pitchers, provided a dramatic conclusion to the game.

          <p>The United Kingdom has lifted its five-year-long ban on airlines from Pakistan, allowing them to apply to resume flights. The ban was originally imposed in 2020 after a scandal revealed that nearly a third of Pakistan's pilots had obtained their licenses fraudulently. The decision follows significant improvements in Pakistan's aviation safety standards, which also led the European Union to lift its own ban earlier this year. Pakistan's national carrier, PIA, which was heavily impacted by the suspension, is now planning to resume its profitable UK routes as soon as possible.</p>
