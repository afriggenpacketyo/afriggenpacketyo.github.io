          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the Azerbaijan Grand Prix in a highly eventful qualifying session that was halted a record six times by red flags. The session, which lasted two hours due to numerous crashes, saw Williams' Carlos Sainz secure second place, while championship contender Oscar Piastri crashed and will start in ninth. The frequent stoppages and light rain created unpredictable conditions, challenging drivers and disrupting team strategies. Verstappen managed to set the fastest time in the final moments, navigating the difficult track to start at the front of the grid.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clinched their 13th consecutive playoff berth after a 6-3 victory over the San Francisco Giants. The win was particularly poignant as it occurred during what was announced as pitcher Clayton Kershaw's final regular-season home game before his retirement. This achievement ties the Dodgers with the New York Yankees for the second-longest playoff streak in MLB history. While a postseason spot is secured, the team is still focused on winning the NL West division title, holding a four-game lead over the San Diego Padres.</p>

          <p>A year after Hurricane Helene devastated parts of the southeastern U.S., a resident of Leicester, North Carolina, has creatively rebuilt his home using salvaged materials from the storm's wreckage. John Saunby, seeing value in the debris, collected items like porch posts and kitchen floorboards that were otherwise destined for a landfill. With these reclaimed treasures, he is constructing a unique house featuring Black Locust bark siding and tree trunk supports. The project represents a personal milestone for Saunby, who is fulfilling a long-held creative vision with the help of his partner, Appalachian recording artist Jenny Kimmel.</p>

          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, has secured a place in their seventh consecutive World Cup final after a hard-fought 35-17 victory over France. Full-back Ellie Kildunne was instrumental in the win, scoring two tries upon her return from a concussion. Although France provided a tough challenge and kept the score close initially, England's dominance, particularly in their driving maul, proved decisive in the second half. The Red Roses will now face Canada in the final at a sold-out Twickenham's Allianz Stadium, aiming to cap off their impressive tournament run.</p>

          <p>Lexi Smith, a 24-year-old former teacher from Atlanta, relocated to Japan's Chiba Prefecture to teach English and found a significantly lower cost of living. Her employer secured her a one-bedroom apartment with a balcony for just 35,000 yen, or about $238 per month, within walking distance of her school. Smith's move was motivated by a desire for a cultural change and dissatisfaction with the U.S. school system and her salary. While enjoying her experience in the Japanese countryside, she plans to return to the U.S. after her one-year contract to be closer to family.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has suggested using the Civil Contingencies Act, typically reserved for wartime and national emergencies, to clear the country's asylum application backlog. The plan involves establishing temporary "Nightingale processing centres" and doubling the number of caseworkers to expedite decisions and reduce the costly use of hotels for housing asylum seekers. Home affairs spokeswoman Lisa Smart argued that invoking these emergency powers is necessary to secure the funds and resources for a rapid and effective response. The proposal is part of the party's focus on law and order at their annual conference.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has intervened to halt the planned shutdown of a U.S. Steel plant in Granite City, Illinois, by exercising its newly acquired "golden share" rights. These rights, a condition of the recent $14.1 billion takeover of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon, grant the White House veto power over major strategic decisions like plant closures. After U.S. Steel informed nearly 800 workers of the impending closure, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick warned the company that the administration would not permit it, prompting a reversal of the decision.</p>

Lewinsky credits younger generations for re-evaluating her story with a modern perspective on power dynamics and abuse of power.

This trend is driven primarily by the high cost of U.S. colleges and a desire to avoid accumulating substantial student debt. Additionally, the current political turmoil and campus protests in the U.S. are motivating some students to look for opportunities overseas. Consultants who help students study abroad report a dramatic spike in interest since the 2024 election, reflecting a search for both affordability and a different social environment.</p>

          <p>A leading dermatologist is reminding the public that significant exposure to harmful UV rays can occur indoors, simply by sitting near a window. Dr. Adam Friedman explains that while windows may filter out UVB rays, which cause sunburn, they do not block UVA rays, which penetrate deeper into the skin and are associated with accelerated aging and skin cancer. He emphasizes the importance of using a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher to protect against both types of ultraviolet radiation. This "silent" exposure can cause damage without any visible signs like a burn.</p>
