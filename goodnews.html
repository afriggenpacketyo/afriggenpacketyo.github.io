        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has outperformed traditional safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys, driven by concerns over fiscal sustainability and geopolitical instability. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference highlighted gold's appeal as it is not a liability of any government, unlike sovereign bonds and currencies. The dollar index has weakened, and U.S. Treasurys faced a sell-off after tariff rollouts and a credit rating downgrade, compromising their safe-haven status. Gold's demand has been fueled by uncertainty, particularly with developments in the Middle East, making it a sought-after asset.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer secured a tariffs deal with the US, announced alongside President Trump at the G7 summit. The agreement removes tariffs completely for the aerospace industry and imposes a 10% levy on the car industry, preventing significant job losses. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminum, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities regarding proof of UK-made steel. The deal also includes reciprocal access to 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, ensuring British farmers can export beef to the US.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) announced it would slow the pace of government bond purchases from April of next year, while holding the benchmark rate at 0.5% amid rising growth risks. The BOJ aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets to support stability. Despite indicating a reduction in bond purchase cuts, Governor Kazuo Ueda stated the central bank would continue to raise rates once there is more conviction that underlying inflation will approach 2%. Japan's economy faces growth uncertainty, while inflation has remained above the BOJ's target for around three years.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are set to vote on decriminalizing abortion, with two Labour MPs proposing rival amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill. The current law in England and Wales states that abortion is illegal but allowed under certain circumstances, with approval from two doctors. Tonia Antoniazzi's amendment aims to prevent women from being investigated, arrested, or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners. The debate comes amid concerns about investigations into women who end their own pregnancies outside of the existing law.</p>
