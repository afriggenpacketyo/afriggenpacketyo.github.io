          <p>A federal judge struck down an executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. This marks the third time a judge has rejected Trump's executive orders against law firms, asserting the need for an independent judiciary and bar. The order against WilmerHale, which previously employed Robert Mueller, was seen as an attempt to suppress disfavored speech and impose sanctions. The ruling underscores the ongoing legal battles surrounding Trump's efforts to reshape American civil society.</p>
