          <p>Former U.S. President Donald Trump voiced his discontent to Apple CEO Tim Cook regarding the company's plans to increase production in India, despite Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the U.S. Trump emphasized his preference for Apple to build its products in the United States, citing the high tariffs imposed by India and urging Apple to prioritize domestic manufacturing. Apple has been shifting some of its production to India to reduce its reliance on China, with a goal of manufacturing 25% of its global iPhones in India within a few years. Trump's comments reflect his broader trade protectionist policies and his desire to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.</p>

          <p>The Eurovision Song Contest, organized by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU), faces ongoing challenges in maintaining its apolitical stance amidst geopolitical tensions. Despite strict rules against political statements, the competition is frequently impacted by debates over which countries are allowed to participate, particularly concerning Israel's involvement given the conflict in Gaza, and the earlier exclusion of Russia following the invasion of Ukraine. The EBU insists that Eurovision is a contest between broadcasters, not nations, but struggles to consistently define what constitutes a political statement. As the competition grows globally, especially with Russia planning a rival contest, the effort to keep politics at bay remains a difficult balancing act for the EBU.</p>

          <p>Foxconn, a major Apple supplier, has secured approval from the Indian government to establish a semiconductor plant in a joint venture with HCL Group, involving a $433 million investment. This move aligns with Apple's broader strategy of diversifying its supply chain away from China, amid ongoing trade tensions between Beijing and Washington. The plant, located in Uttar Pradesh, is projected to be operational by 2027 and will manufacture display driver chips used in various electronic devices. The facility is designed to produce up to 20,000 wafers and 36 million display driver chips monthly, bolstering India's semiconductor manufacturing capabilities.</p>

          <p>During a traffic stop in Vallejo, California, police discovered half a pound of methamphetamine in the vehicle of 50-year-old Clifford Vincenty, leading to a search warrant at his residence. The search yielded an additional pound of methamphetamine, over $2,000 in cash, a live spider monkey, and two live rattlesnakes. Animal Control safely removed the animals, with the spider monkey, named Violeta, being placed in the Oakland Zoo, which reported her to be in decent health. Vincenty now faces additional charges, including possession of a controlled substance for sale and potential violations related to the possession of exotic animals, highlighting the intersection of drug trafficking and wildlife crime.</p>

          <p>Senator John Kennedy argues that the Supreme Court should use upcoming cases to eliminate the practice of universal injunctions, which allow individual district court judges to halt federal government policies nationwide. He contends that this practice gives judges excessive power and undermines the judicial decision-making process by forcing the Supreme Court to rush rulings on complex legal issues. Kennedy highlights that universal injunctions were initially uncommon but have become increasingly prevalent, destabilizing the judiciary and the entire system of government. He hopes the court will seize the opportunity to end this unlawful practice, emphasizing that the issue transcends ideological and partisan lines.</p>

          <p>As the Supreme Court considers President Trump's push to end birthright citizenship, a new NPR/Ipsos poll indicates that most Americans oppose altering the longstanding principle of automatic citizenship for those born on U.S. soil. The poll shows public attitudes toward Trump's hardline immigration policies remain relatively stable, with subtle signs of softening support for some policies since January. While nearly half of respondents support quickly deporting alleged gang members, a larger percentage opposes ending birthright citizenship. The survey also reveals deep divisions over due process, with conflicting views on whether immigrants without legal status deserve the same legal protections as American citizens.</p>

          <p>An underwater volcano, Axial Seamount, located off the coast of Oregon, is anticipated to erupt sometime this year, potentially creating a hotspot for marine life. The volcano, which lies a mile below the ocean's surface, has erupted three times in the last 30 years, and its impending eruption is expected to generate hydrothermal vents, which are rich in warmth and nutrients. While the eruption is not expected to impact humans due to its depth and distance from the shore, it could trigger small earthquakes and temporarily cover some vents with magma. Scientists are monitoring the volcano through the Ocean Observatories Initiative, using the site as a key location to advance underwater volcano forecasting.</p>

The key elements include singing about personal liberation in English, alluding to folk music without sending a pure folk song, and going all-out on the staging with fire or pyrotechnics. Novelty acts are generally discouraged, though exceptions exist, and the performance must be memorable and engaging. These guidelines reflect the evolving trends in Eurovision, where self-empowerment, cultural integration, and visual spectacle are highly valued.</p>

However, analysts cautioned that the strong growth rate may not continue due to impending import tariffs and increased employer taxes.

The move comes as Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged to transform the Bundeswehr into the "strongest conventional army in Europe." While some propose a compromise of 3.5% for military spending and 1.5% for defense-related infrastructure, the commitment to increase defense capabilities reflects a broader effort to strengthen NATO.</p>

          <p>Despite organizers' efforts, the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel faces political tensions, protests against Israel's singer, and controversial songs. The EBU's code of conduct prohibits political statements, but Israel's participation has sparked protests and calls for its exclusion, mirroring Russia's ban in 2022. Scandals include complaints about Estonia's entry mocking Italian clich√©s and requests to tone down sexually suggestive performances. Amid the controversies, folk-pop and ballads are emerging as favorites, reflecting a blend of traditional elements and contemporary pop styles.</p>

          <h2>Japan Considers Increasing Rice Stockpile Release to Curb Price Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 03:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government is contemplating doubling the supply of stockpiled rice to approximately 600,000 tons in an effort to control rising rice prices amid a supply shortfall. This measure involves releasing an additional 300,000 tons of reserve rice over three months, supplementing the 321,000 tons already auctioned between March and April. The move aims to address concerns about hoarding and increased rice consumption, particularly in restaurants catering to foreign tourists. However, the reduction in stockpile levels raises questions about Japan's ability to respond to future poor harvests or natural disasters.</p>
