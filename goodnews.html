          <p>President Trump hinted at a possible resolution with Harvard University regarding the enrollment of international students, even as a federal judge blocked the administration from revoking Harvard's access to a crucial student visa system. Trump stated that negotiations were progressing well and a "mindbogglingly" historic deal could be reached soon. The Department of Homeland Security had previously threatened to revoke Harvard's student visa certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism, leading to a lawsuit from the university. The conflict has significant implications for Harvard, where approximately one in four students are from outside the United States, with potential caps on foreign student enrollment also being discussed.</p>

          <p>Meta, formerly Facebook, reportedly considered acquiring artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI. While discussions occurred, a deal was never finalized, with sources suggesting either a mutual dissolution or Perplexity's withdrawal. This attempt highlights Mark Zuckerberg's strong push to enhance Meta's AI capabilities amidst competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet. Zuckerberg is reportedly determined to attract top AI talent and close the gap with rivals in both AI models and consumer applications.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate and activist Mahmoud Khalil on bail, after he was detained by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for over three months. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or a threat to the community, despite the government's claims that his presence in the US could pose adverse foreign policy consequences. Khalil, a prominent voice in Columbia's pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations in New York and Washington DC. His attorneys argued that the government was violating his free speech rights, and the judge expressed skepticism of the government's requests to keep him detained, setting the stage for his reunion with his family. </p>

Darden's CEO noted that consumers are continuing to spend on casual dining, possibly taking wallet share from fast food and fast casual establishments.

Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are around 4.49% for 6-month CDs.

          <p>The article discusses the increasing trend of adding protein to various foods, even those that don't traditionally contain it, such as protein iced tea and protein water. While protein is essential for building muscle and feeling full, the author questions whether the average person needs the excessive amounts found in these products. The food industry's push to add protein to everything is seen as a marketing tactic to make products more appealing, but some of these protein-enhanced foods may not be as healthy as they seem. The author concludes by emphasizing that a Snickers bar with 20 grams of protein is still a Snickers bar.</p>
