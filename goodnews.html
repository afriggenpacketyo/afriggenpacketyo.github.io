          <p>AMD reported strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing expectations with 96 cents per share adjusted earnings and $7.44 billion in revenue. Despite these positive results, the company anticipates a $700 million hit to revenue in the current quarter due to U.S. export controls on AI chips to China. CEO Lisa Su highlighted that the company faces headwinds from dynamic macro and regulatory environments, including these export controls, but believes they are offset by a strong product portfolio. AMD's data center sales surged by 57%, driven by demand for Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, with its chips being used for AI training and deployment. (not investment advice)</p>

Thom Tillis of North Carolina announced his opposition to President Trump's nomination of Ed Martin as the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing Martin's defense of individuals involved in the January 6th Capitol riot. Tillis, a key Republican vote on the Senate Judiciary Committee, expressed concerns about Martin's past inflammatory comments and defense of Jan. 6 defendants, stating he has "no tolerance for anybody who entered the building on January the 6th." Martin's interim term expires on May 20, and with Tillis's opposition, his confirmation faces an uphill battle.</p>

          <p>Rivian Automotive beat Wall Street's expectations for the first quarter but adjusted its 2025 targets for vehicle deliveries downward, now projecting 40,000 to 46,000 units, while increasing capital expenditure guidance to $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. The company cited concerns over President Trump's tariffs and the uncertain global economic landscape as reasons for the adjustments. Despite these challenges, Rivian reaffirmed its plans to achieve a "modest positive gross profit" this year. The automaker achieved its second consecutive quarter of gross profit during the first quarter, unlocking an expected $1 billion from Volkswagen Group as part of its investment in Rivian following the formation of their joint venture.</p>

          <p>J's Grocery in Clarksdale, Mississippi, has reopened after renovations to include fresh produce, aiming to revitalize the majority-Black town and combat food insecurity. The project is a collaboration between store owner Al Jones, Partnership for a Healthier America (PHA), Rootswell, Novo Nordisk, and other groups. The store now offers culturally relevant produce like collard greens and Swiss chard, with plans to introduce more staples. The initiative seeks to address the lack of access to fresh food in the Mississippi Delta, where most farmland is dedicated to cash crops rather than food for local consumption.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have finalized a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, designed to ease exports for UK firms in sectors like whisky and cars, and reduce taxes on Indian clothing and footwear exports. The British government calls it the most economically significant bilateral trade deal since Brexit, projecting an additional ¬£25.5 billion in trade annually by 2040. The deal includes tariff reductions on goods like gin, whisky, aerospace products, and medical devices, while also providing exemptions from social security payments for some Indian and British workers transferred between the two countries. However, opposition parties have raised concerns about potential impacts on UK businesses and the lack of parliamentary vote on the deal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tariffs enacted by President Trump are expected to raise prices on flowers ahead of Mother's Day, as approximately 80% of flowers bought in the United States are imported. While Trump paused hefty tariffs he announced in early April for 90 days, a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports is in effect. Small growers are also affected, as imported bulbs used for growing flowers are subject to the tariffs, potentially costing small businesses thousands of dollars. Some florists are trying to absorb the costs or source more local flowers to avoid raising prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>Restaurants across the country are increasingly serving whole-leaf salads, opting for the dramatic appearance and textural integrity despite the inelegance of eating them. Chefs argue that whole leaves cradle breadcrumbs, seeds, herbs, and cheese more effectively, creating the perfect bite. While some diners appreciate the visual appeal and unique textures, others find it inconvenient to disassemble and eat these salads, questioning the practicality of cutting lettuce like a steak. The trend reflects a shift towards prioritizing aesthetics and textural experience in dining, even if it sacrifices some ease of consumption.</p>
