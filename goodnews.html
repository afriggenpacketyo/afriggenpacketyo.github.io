          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey announced that the retail giant will be increasing prices on some items due to tariffs, despite a temporary reduction in duties on Chinese imports. While Walmart aims to absorb some of the higher costs, consumers are likely to see price increases, particularly towards the end of May and into June. The tariffs impact goods from various countries, including Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia, affecting the prices of items like bananas, avocados, coffee, and roses. Walmart is also adjusting its inventory and sourcing strategies to mitigate the impact of tariffs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments regarding President Trump's executive order seeking to end birthright citizenship, focusing primarily on the authority of lower courts to issue nationwide injunctions against presidential policies. The case does not directly address the constitutionality of the birthright citizenship order itself, which aims to deny U.S. citizenship to children born to parents unlawfully or temporarily in the country. Justices questioned the practicality and constitutionality of the order, with concerns raised about creating a patchwork system of citizenship and violating the 14th Amendment. The court's decision could significantly impact the power of the executive branch and the role of the judiciary in checking presidential actions.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is implementing workforce reductions in its Silicon Valley offices, cutting 122 positions as part of a broader reorganization and restructuring effort within the company. These layoffs represent a fraction of the 6,000 jobs being eliminated globally, marking one of the company's largest job cuts in recent years. The reductions come amidst the rise of artificial intelligence, which is raising questions about the future of software engineering and other tech roles. Software engineering positions accounted for over half of the job cuts in Silicon Valley, reflecting Microsoft's efforts to increase efficiency and reduce redundancies as it competes in the AI space.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is revisiting its approval of azodicarbonamide (ADA), a food additive used to whiten cereal flour and improve bread dough, after long-standing safety concerns.

The FDA previously deemed ADA safe, citing studies indicating that semicarbazide, a byproduct of ADA, only caused tumors in mice at levels far exceeding human consumption.

          <p>Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark, accused federal prosecutors of attempting to humiliate him by requiring him to provide fingerprints and a mugshot for a second time after a court appearance. The trespassing charge stems from his arrest at an immigration detention center protest with members of Congress. Baraka's attorney suggested the charges are a "selective prosecution" due to the mayor's outspoken opposition to the Trump administration's immigration policies. The mayor maintains his actions were within his constitutional rights and denies violating any laws.</p>

The questioning focused on the logistics of denying citizenship at birth and the implications for hospitals and states. The Trump administration argues that district court judges lack the authority to issue sweeping injunctions against the policy. Justice Sotomayor suggested the executive order contradicts previous Supreme Court decisions, while Justice Jackson framed the government's argument as creating a "catch me if you can regime."</p>

          <p>Investing in gold requires a strategic approach rather than a fixed schedule, according to financial experts. Gold is often used as a hedge against inflation and can offer diversification in a portfolio. Experts recommend allocating no more than 10% of your overall portfolio to gold, and the frequency of investment should be determined by how quickly you want to reach that threshold. Given gold's recent price surge, starting sooner rather than later is advisable, but this article is not investment advice.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously rejected a legal theory that narrowly limited lawsuits against police officers for using deadly force, ruling that courts must consider all relevant circumstances, not just the "moment of threat." The case stemmed from a 2016 incident where an officer shot a driver during a traffic stop. Justice Kagan emphasized that assessing the reasonableness of an officer's force requires examining the events leading up to the critical moment. The court returned the case to lower courts for reconsideration under the broader standard, however this article is not investment advice.</p>

While Walmart will try to keep food prices low, consumers can expect to see higher prices on general merchandise items, potentially starting at the end of May.

          <p>U.S. supreme court justices on Thursday took issue with Donald Trump‚Äôs attempt to sidestep the constitution to limit birthright citizenship, a case that, while technically about immigration, could reshape presidential power and the role of federal courts. The plan is likely to be ultimately struck down, as it directly contradicts the 14th amendment, which grants citizenship to ‚Äúall persons born or naturalized in the United States‚Äù. The legal team isn‚Äôt asking the supreme court to rule on whether his policy is constitutional, and very little of the arguments focused on the immigration issues at the heart of Trump‚Äôs order. Instead, they are challenging whether lower court judges should be able to block presidential orders nationwide ‚Äì a move that could overall weaken judicial checks on executive power.</p>

          <p>The streaming platform Max, formerly known as HBO Max, is rebranding and reverting to its original name, HBO Max, two years after the initial change. Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) hopes the rebrand will capitalize on the popularity of HBO originals and strengthen the service's unique brand identity. The decision follows criticism of the name "Max" and its perceived shift towards broader, more family-friendly content. WBD says that it added 22 million subscribers in the past year, and it hopes the rebrand, slated for this summer, will build on that momentum.</p>

          <h2>Researchers Urge Newsom to Fund Post-Fire Soil Testing in Los Angeles County</h2>

          <p>A group of environmental researchers is calling on the Newsom administration to fund soil testing at homes destroyed in the Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County. The researchers argue it is essential to test the soil for toxins, citing the federal government's refusal to do so. They also point to recent soil testing that found elevated lead and arsenic levels at homes cleared by federal debris removal crews. Local officials are concerned about the drop in tax revenue due to the wildfires and are expediting the rebuilding process.</p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill in the House proposes tax cuts that could impact the wallets of millions of Americans, but the bill is likely to change as it moves through the legislative process. The measure includes making Mr. Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while also adding a host of other reductions. Some of the additional tax cuts include those promised on the campaign trail by Mr. Trump, such as eliminating taxes on overtime pay, as well as new provisions that would lower taxes for senior citizens and parents.

          <p>Doctors have successfully treated a baby born with a rare genetic disorder using a gene-editing therapy specifically tailored to repair his unique mutation. The baby, KJ Muldoon, received infusions containing microscopic gene-editors that targeted a mutation in his liver, showing signs of reversing his condition and reducing the risk of brain damage. This marks the first time a custom gene-editing treatment has been used on a patient, offering hope for treating other rare diseases. Scientists are working to develop a template for similar conditions to streamline the process and make treatments more accessible.</p>

          <p>Some Republicans are concerned about their party's ability to recruit competitive Senate candidates, especially after high-profile figures like Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and former New Hampshire Governor Chris Sununu declined to run. The reasons for declining to run may be personal but the difficulty in recruiting these candidates could be a symptom of the party's struggle to attract moderate candidates. Some Republicans believe that candidates too closely aligned with Trump may struggle in statewide races. Several Republicans have announced their candidacy since, including Representative Buddy Carter.</p>
