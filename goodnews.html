          <p>India is emerging as a key manufacturing hub as companies diversify their supply chains amidst the U.S.-China trade war.

While India faces challenges like logistical bottlenecks and regulatory hurdles, its stability and democratic setup make it an attractive alternative for companies seeking resilient supply chains. This shift presents both opportunities and risks for investors, as India's rise in manufacturing is part of a broader global realignment. (not investment advice)</p>

Short-term CDs, particularly those with terms around six months to one year, currently offer competitive interest rates.

The U.S. government has provided bipartisan support, including banning Russian uranium imports and unlocking federal funding to expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity, but even with this support, the U.S. will continue to depend on other countries for uranium.</p>
