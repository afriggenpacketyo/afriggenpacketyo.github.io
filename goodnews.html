          <p>The United States and the United Arab Emirates are collaborating to establish a framework for Abu Dhabi to acquire advanced American-made AI semiconductors, as announced by President Trump during his visit to the Emirati capital. This agreement may involve a preliminary deal for the UAE to import 500,000 of Nvidia's H100 chips annually, enhancing the nation's AI infrastructure development. While the Trump administration intends to roll back the 'AI diffusion rule' that imposed strict export controls, security professionals and lawmakers are voicing concerns about potential technology transfer to rivals like China, highlighting the delicate balance between economic cooperation and national security.</p>

          <p>Jay Shah's appointment as chairman of the International Cricket Council has amplified India's influence in global cricket, sparking concerns about the sport's governance and equity. India's financial strength, political connections, and media control through the Board of Control for Cricket in India and the Indian Premier League, which generates a significant portion of the ICC's revenue, enable it to shape tournament schedules and media rights. The intertwining of Indian politics and cricket governance, exemplified by the exclusion of Pakistani players and IPL scheduling influenced by political events, raises questions about the ICC's neutrality and the game's diversity, particularly affecting smaller cricketing nations.</p>

          <p>President Trump's criticism of 'activist' judges is not new, as past presidents have also accused courts of overreach. The term 'judicial activism,' coined in 1947, describes judges who base rulings on personal policy views rather than legal interpretation. Criticism has come from both sides of the political spectrum, with presidents like Roosevelt and Nixon challenging court decisions. Trump's approach marks a highly politicized phase, where judicial rulings are frequently contested, prompting responses from Chief Justice Roberts defending judicial independence and highlighting the ongoing debate over the role of the courts.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals exploring their queer identity, finding a supportive community can be affirming. Experts recommend overcoming impostor syndrome by recognizing there's no right or wrong way to be queer. Narrowing down interests, whether it's shared racial identity, hobbies, or values, can help find the right fit. Attending events with a friend or creating a new space if existing ones don't resonate can also be beneficial. Trusting the process and seeking connections online or through literature are additional ways to build community, as queer and trans people have always been present and will continue to be.</p>

          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, indicating that wealthy consumers are continuing to spend on luxury goods despite global economic uncertainties. Revenues rose 7% year-on-year, driven by double-digit growth in the Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. While sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, full-year sales rose 4% to 21.4 billion euros. The company noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require strong agility and discipline, with potential headwinds including gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>

The debate comes after the government revised its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for assisted deaths in the first year. While a final vote is unlikely this Friday, MPs will consider amendments ensuring no obligation to participate and preventing doctors from discussing assisted death with under 18s. The bill has sparked division, but a recent convert suggests there are enough safeguards to protect terminally ill people.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, driven by investors seeking safe havens amidst President Trump's tariff policies. Overseas investors bought 8.21 trillion yen ($56.6 billion) worth of assets, the largest monthly inflow since 1996, as the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield spiked while Japan's 10-year yield fell. With the U.S. softening its trade stance and striking deals, confidence in U.S. assets is getting restored, raising questions about the sustainability of the inflows into Japanese assets, which are generally considered a haven in times of economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>A 9¬Ω-month-old boy with a rare genetic disorder, CPS1 deficiency, has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment, offering hope for others with uncommon genetic diseases. The personalized infusion, designed to fix his specific mutation, has allowed him to eat more protein and reduced his need for medication. This treatment, which relies on pinpoint targeting using CRISPR technology, has the potential to transform healthcare by providing a new path for developing cheaper and more accessible personalized treatments for thousands of rare genetic disorders.</p>
