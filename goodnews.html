          <p>Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte, are planning to present photographic and scientific evidence in a US court to refute claims made by right-wing influencer Candace Owens that Brigitte Macron was born male. Their lawyer stated that the claims are "incredibly upsetting" and a "distraction" to the French president, requiring Brigitte to undergo a very public and unpleasant process to set the record straight. Owens' lawyers have responded with a motion to dismiss the claim, arguing the case should not have been filed in Delaware. The Macrons initially won a defamation case in France against similar claims, but the ruling was overturned on appeal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Edward Enninful, former editor-in-chief of British Vogue, expressed concerns that the fashion industry risks regressing on diversity, with "anti-woke" rhetoric potentially leading to a return to Eurocentric and super-thin beauty norms. Enninful, who recently launched an inclusive media platform called EE72, believes the industry needs to reaffirm its commitment to diversity and inclusivity. He dismissed reports of a falling out with Anna Wintour, stating his departure from Vogue was a planned decision after six years in the role. Enninful also commented on the Sydney Sweeney jeans advert controversy, suggesting people may be reading too deeply into the imagery.</p>

          <p>Blake Snell delivered a dominant performance, pitching seven scoreless innings with 12 strikeouts, leading the Dodgers to a 5-0 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies. Manager Dave Roberts initially appeared to be considering removing Snell in the seventh inning but ultimately decided to leave him in, a decision that paid off when Snell struck out Otto Kemp to end the inning. Freddie Freeman homered, and Ben Rortvedt and Kiké Hernández contributed RBI singles to support Snell's strong outing. The bullpen also performed well, with Alex Vesia and Tanner Scott securing scoreless innings.</p>

The Guardian focuses on the government's announcement of £150bn of US investment in the UK, suggesting this will appease critics of Trump's visit. The Daily Mail reports on the Home Secretary's criticism of migrants who lodge last-minute legal challenges against deportation. The Daily Telegraph claims a Home Office-backed charity is advising migrants on how to circumvent the system, which the charity denies.</p>

          <p>Huawei has announced the development of a "world's most powerful" supernode computing cluster using local chipmaking processes, boosting China's self-reliance in AI computing. The company plans to launch upgraded Ascend AI chips over the next three years, competing with AI chips from Nvidia and AMD. This announcement comes as Beijing urges tech giants to stop buying Nvidia's tailor-made chips for China, designed to comply with US export restrictions. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed disappointment but acknowledged the larger agendas between China and the United States.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed in the central Atlantic Ocean, ending a nearly three-week storm-free period during peak hurricane season.

The National Hurricane Center forecasts that Gabrielle will become a hurricane by Sunday as it moves northwest. The United States is not expected to experience direct impacts, but high surf may occur on the East Coast next week.</p>

          <p>Former Vice President Kamala Harris said she would have picked Pete Buttigieg as her running mate last year but felt America wasn't ready for the pairing. In an excerpt from her new book, Harris writes that Buttigieg "would have been an ideal partner" but that selecting a woman, a Black woman, and a Black woman married to a Jewish man was already asking a lot of America. Harris ultimately selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, but they lost the election after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race.</p>

          <p>Analysts predict that China's central bank will likely proceed with only moderate easing this year, even after the US Federal Reserve delivered its first interest rate cut of the year. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the yuan's midpoint rate lower, following the Fed's widely expected rate cut. Experts believe the PBOC's rate cut pace will be smaller than the Fed's, narrowing the interest rate gap and easing capital outflow pressures on the yuan. This approach is expected to lend support to the yuan. (not investment advice)</p>
