          <p>A federal judge extended a temporary block on President Donald Trump's proclamation that would bar foreign Harvard University students from entering the U.S., pending further consideration of a preliminary injunction.

The government argued it does not trust Harvard to monitor foreign students, citing concerns about foreign entanglements. The judge questioned the government's arguments, noting the ban seemed motivated by concerns about antisemitism and suggesting the government was singling out Harvard without sufficient evidence.</p>
