          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging in the second quarter, partly driven by the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones. While Apple still leads, its recent decline and Samsung's diverse product range, from budget-friendly to premium folding devices, signal a renewed and intense competition between the tech giants. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond with its own foldable iPhone and a new slimmer model to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy provides a three-step framework for building emotional endurance, the capacity to manage stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings. The process involves visualizing learning as a non-linear journey, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe internal narratives, and undertaking small, manageable experiments to build tolerance for discomfort. These techniques help individuals view challenges as growth opportunities rather than signs of failure, fostering greater resilience over time.</p>

          <p>A recent Gallup survey indicates that alcohol consumption in the United States has fallen to its lowest level since 1939, with only 54% of Americans reporting that they drink. This trend is accompanied by a growing public awareness of the health risks associated with alcohol, as a majority now believe even moderate drinking is unhealthy. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, marking a significant public health success that could lead to fewer alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social problems.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has acquired an approximate 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor and is publicly calling for significant strategic changes to address its underperformance. In a letter to the board, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes improving operational execution, cutting costs, optimizing its portfolio through divestitures, and refreshing the board of directors. The firm argues that years of self-inflicted mistakes, including poor capital allocation, have destroyed shareholder value and that a sale of the company should be considered if a turnaround is not viable.

          <p>Yara Souza, an American archaeology student from Newcastle University, discovered a rare 9th-century gold object during her very first excavation in Northumberland, England. The artifact, believed to be a high-status item used for religious or ceremonial purposes, was found near the route of a major Roman road. This find is particularly significant as it was unearthed near the location of a similar discovery in 2021, suggesting the site was important for elite individuals over a thousand years ago and offering new insights into the early medieval period in the region.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons company is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones connected by fiber-optic cables, making them immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming. The firm, Fold, aims to extend the drone's range to nearly 100 kilometers, a significant increase that would allow Ukrainian forces to strike high-value targets far behind enemy lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, this development represents a critical evolution in drone warfare as both sides seek technological advantages on a rapidly changing battlefield.</p>

          <p>Baltimore is experiencing a dramatic decline in violent crime, with its murder rate on pace to reach its lowest level in nearly 50 years. This turnaround is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy implemented by Mayor Brandon Scott's administration, which focuses on identifying individuals at the highest risk of violence and offering them intensive support services as an alternative to criminal activity. The approach, which combines social intervention with targeted law enforcement, has shown remarkable success, though recent federal funding cuts threaten its continuity.</p>

          <h2>Financial Planners Advise Saving for Retirement Earlier Than Most Americans Think Ideal</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While a recent survey found that Americans believe age 27 is the ideal time to start saving for retirement, certified financial planners recommend beginning even earlier to fully leverage the power of compound returns. Starting in one's early 20s allows savings more time to grow, potentially creating a much larger nest egg by retirement. Many Americans express regret over not starting to save sooner, as a later start often requires more aggressive saving strategies to catch up and achieve retirement goals, such as the surveyed ideal retirement age of 58.
