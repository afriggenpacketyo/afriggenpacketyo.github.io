        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines President Trump's claims of a surge in US business investment under his administration. While initial data showed a jump, economists argue it's too early for definitive conclusions and that pre-existing plans and factors like a Boeing strike skewed the figures.  The article cites examples of companies whose investment pledges were partially underway before Trump's presidency, highlighting the difficulty in attributing investment solely to his policies.  The White House's reported figures are significantly higher than independent analyses, suggesting an exaggeration of the impact of Trump's economic policies. (not investment advice)</p>
