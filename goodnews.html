          <h2>Novo Nordisk Anticipates Wegovy Sales Rebound as Copycat Drug Competition Lessens</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 06:03:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge following the company's announcement that it expects sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug to improve in the latter half of 2025. This positive outlook is attributed to the anticipated phasing out of copycat compounded drugs, which had previously impacted Wegovy's market share in the U.S. The company's CEO, Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen, stated that the end of the FDA's drug shortage ruling would enable sales to recover, and Novo Nordisk intends to pursue companies unlawfully distributing copycat drugs. The company reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, and is launching an online pharmacy to lower Wegovy costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is defending its newly-agreed trade deal with India against claims that it could disadvantage British workers, specifically regarding an exemption on National Insurance contributions (Nics). Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds asserts that the deal will not undercut British workers, highlighting that the UK has 16 agreements preventing double taxation of work. The deal extends the Nics exemption from one to three years for people on short-term visas, which opposition parties argue could make Indian workers cheaper to employ. The deal aims to boost trade between the UK and India by making it easier for UK firms to export goods like whisky and cars, and cutting taxes on India's clothing and footwear exports to the UK.</p>

          <p>Footage showing an Egyptian military officer in a Chinese J-10 fighter jet during the joint Eagles of Civilisation 2025 exercise has renewed speculation about a potential arms sale between China and Egypt. The 18-day exercise, the first joint air training between the two countries, is seen as a possible indicator of Cairo's interest in acquiring Chinese jets. This follows reports of Egypt's potential purchase of the latest J-10C model, which has been compared to upgraded versions of the US F-16 Fighting Falcon. A deal with Egypt would expand Beijing's arms exports to a key US ally and potentially reshape the regional geopolitical landscape.</p>

          <p>A Republican state representative in Texas, Stan Gerdes, has introduced the Forbidden Unlawful Representation of Roleplaying in Educational Spaces (FURRIES) Act, aiming to ban schoolkids from acting like animals. Gerdes claims to have heard reports of "furry-related incidents" in schools, though he couldn't provide evidence of schools providing litter boxes for students identifying as felines. Critics argue this is a cynical attempt to attack public schools and justify defunding them, distracting voters with culture war issues to pass legislation benefiting the wealthy. Texas governor Greg Abbott referenced the FURRIES Act while promoting a bill allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition.</p>

          <p>A recent Pew Research Center report indicates a decline in interpersonal trust, with only 30% of Americans generally trusting one another, a decrease from 50% in the 1970s. Experts suggest that economic inequality, technology, increasing diversity, and political polarization contribute to this rise in distrust. Trust is essential for vulnerability, sharing dreams, and feeling safe in relationships, and while skepticism is healthy, cynicism is not preferable. Research suggests that people assess competence, benevolence, and integrity when deciding to trust someone, with genetics playing a role in how trusting we are, while distrust is shaped by past experiences. The article offers tips for fostering trust, including approaching differences with curiosity, embracing a team mindset, and leaning into transparency.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age to become a train driver from 20 to 18 in an effort to tackle driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander announced the change as a way to improve train services and unlock thousands of jobs, opening up opportunities for school or college leavers. The move is supported by union Aslef and the Rail Safety and Standards Board, citing research that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The government hopes the change will alleviate disruption caused by driver shortages and replace retiring drivers with new recruits.</p>

The proposal targets workforce shortages in critical areas like manufacturing, cybersecurity, and defense logistics, directing the Department of Defense to provide information about civilian employment opportunities to medically disqualified recruits. The bill also seeks to expand existing Air Force best practices by establishing Army and Navy personnel management programs, improving access to the hiring process without guaranteeing jobs.</p>

          <p>Community Plate, an organization in Maine, is combating loneliness by creating potluck suppers in rural towns where people can connect and share stories. Founded by Karl Schatz and Margaret Hathaway, the initiative aims to address the epidemic of loneliness, which is associated with various health risks. The potlucks offer a welcoming environment for people to come together, share food, and form connections, with story sharing providing a deeper level of engagement. These gatherings are creating a sense of community and offering an antidote to disconnection in rural areas.</p>
