          <p>Michelle Renee, a California bank manager, and her daughter Breea were kidnapped and held hostage by masked men who forced Michelle to rob her own bank. The kidnappers strapped fake dynamite to Michelle, her roommate, and Breea, threatening to detonate it if Michelle didn't comply with their demands. Michelle followed the kidnappers' instructions, successfully robbing the bank of $360,000 and returning home to rescue her daughter. The perpetrators were eventually apprehended, but during the trial, Michelle was falsely painted as a criminal, enduring a brutal cross-examination that attacked her credibility and maternal instincts. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study in Scientific Reports reveals that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently transfer their anxiety to their canine companions. The research found that dogs belonging to owners with high job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one individual to another, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on human feelings through subtle cues. The study suggests that employed dog owners may benefit from avoiding work-related ruminations at home to protect their pet's well-being.</p>

The Dodgers' bullpen, already overworked, faced further strain, highlighting the team's reliance on their starters' performance.
