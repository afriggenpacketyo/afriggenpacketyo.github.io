          <p>The Italian government has approved a €13.5 billion project to build the world's longest single-span suspension bridge, connecting Sicily to the mainland. The project, first conceived in 1971, has faced numerous cancellations but is now slated to begin construction in 2026. Proponents, like construction firm Webuild, highlight the potential for economic prosperity and the creation of over 100,000 jobs. However, the project faces challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone and local opposition from groups who argue the funds should be used for existing infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Etiquette expert Elaine Swann provides advice on how to be a good houseguest, emphasizing respect for the host's space regardless of familiarity. Key recommendations include giving ample notice, being prepared for a "no," and keeping visits to a manageable length, typically around four days. Swann advises guests to be self-sufficient, communicate plans clearly, and be mindful of their footprint by staying tidy. A thoughtful thank-you gift and a follow-up invitation are also suggested to ensure a positive experience and a future welcome.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a 13% year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. According to a report from the European Travel Commission (ETC), 72% of Chinese tourists expressed a desire for long-haul travel to the continent, a figure much higher than other key markets like the U.S. and Japan. This trend is seen on the streets of major European cities like Brussels, where Mandarin is increasingly heard. The article suggests this shift may be partly influenced by external factors, including trade turbulence and U.S. policies.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores the Rise of 'Grifter' as a Prominent Political Insult</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 04:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "grifter" has become a ubiquitous insult in modern political discourse, used to accuse opponents of being con artists profiting from their beliefs. The article traces the word's increased usage, noting its application to figures from Nigel Farage to the Sussexes, and its debut in the UK Parliament. This trend is linked to the rise of influencer culture, where sowing insecurity for profit is a common business model, and a broader societal paranoia fueled by scam warnings and true-crime stories about fraud. The insult reflects a deep-seated suspicion of opponents' motives, assuming they are driven by nefarious personal gain.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood established a four-shot lead at the St. Jude Championship in Memphis before severe weather suspended the second round. After an opening-round 63, Fleetwood shot a six-under 64, bringing his total to 13 under par as he seeks his first PGA Tour victory. When play was stopped due to lightning, Collin Morikawa and Akshay Bhatia were tied for second place in the clubhouse at nine under. The round is scheduled to resume on Saturday, with 21 players, including Justin Rose, yet to complete their rounds.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has rejected any possibility of U.S. military operations within Mexico, following reports that President Trump directed the Pentagon to target Latin American drug cartels. Sheinbaum affirmed that while the two countries cooperate on security, a U.S. "invasion" is "absolutely ruled out." The reported U.S. directive follows the designation of several Mexican cartels as terrorist entities. Despite the firm stance against military intervention, officials noted that collaboration has recently led to a record low in border crossings and a significant decrease in fentanyl seizures.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell became an American hero in 1970 after an explosion crippled his spacecraft on its way to the Moon, turning a near-tragedy into what NASA called its "finest hour." He was also part of the Apollo 8 crew, the first to orbit the Moon, making him the first person to travel to the Moon twice without ever landing. His family and figures like Tom Hanks, who portrayed him in the film "Apollo 13," remembered his optimism and leadership.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, the Red Roses, is preparing for a crucial match against France as a key step on their journey to the World Cup final. Coach John Mitchell has used the metaphor of climbing Mount Everest to frame their campaign, emphasizing that every step must be timed correctly. Winger Abby Dow, who has recovered from a hand injury, highlights the importance of learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over France. The team is focused on peaking at the right time to claim the World Cup, a goal Dow says is her sole focus for the current rugby cycle.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two of their generation's greatest pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces delivered strong six-inning performances, with Kershaw allowing only one run to Scherzer's two. The pivotal moment came when Mookie Betts hit a go-ahead, two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning. The game was a nostalgic showcase for the two pitchers, who first competed against each other in 2008 and continue to perform at a high level for first-place teams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The EU's recent sanctioning of an Indian refinery for processing Russian crude has raised questions about the future of a long-delayed EU-India free trade agreement. However, experts suggest that the threat of much larger U.S. tariffs on Indian goods poses a greater challenge and may paradoxically strengthen India's resolve to finalize a deal with the EU. As India seeks reliable economic partners, the EU's more measured approach becomes more attractive. This dynamic could benefit the EU-India relationship while potentially pressuring India to reduce its reliance on Russian oil. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully created high-purity hexagonal diamonds, a rare structure first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This type of diamond, also known as lonsdaleite, is believed to form under intense heat and pressure and has a distinct atomic arrangement compared to common cubic diamonds. Previous attempts by global research teams to synthesize the material often resulted in mixed-phase samples. The Chinese team's breakthrough, published in the journal Nature, produced pure hexagonal diamond crystals up to 100 micrometers in size, providing definitive proof of the material's macroscopic existence.</p>
