          <p>Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif will be banned from World Boxing competitions until undergoing mandatory genetic sex testing, according to World Boxing. The organization will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers who want to participate in their competitions. The decision came in part due to the controversy surrounding Khelif after the boxer won a gold medal at the Paris Olympics. The test, which can be conducted by nasal/mouth swab, saliva or blood, reveals the presence of the Y chromosome to determine the biological sex.</p>

          <p>China is scaling up the use of AI in urban management, with cities like Nanjing employing drones for nightly patrols to deter crime in overlooked areas. The Chinese leadership views AI as a tool for transforming the economy and refining governance, launching the ‚Äúsmart cities‚Äù initiative and other programs. Despite rapid progress, China's AI governance faces challenges such as privacy protection and limited community involvement. These challenges are mirrored globally as governments adopt the technology.</p>

She emphasized that the photos show an athlete being a mom at the same time, and those things not actually competing with one another.

          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising just 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Overall consumer spending rose 0.2% in April from March, down from a 0.7% rise in March. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, though the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. The inflation-fighters at the Federal Reserve said at their most recent meeting May 6-7 that inflation is still elevated, compared with their target of 2%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The F/A-18s from the carrier Harry S. Truman returned to Naval Air Station Oceana in Virginia Beach after an 8 1/2-month deployment. The aircraft carrier and its strike group spent more than five months defending merchant mariners and military vessels from Houthi drones and missiles in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The air wing lost three F/A-18s during that time, but no crew members were injured. One of the fighter jets was shot down accidentally by friendly fire, another fell overboard, and a third crashed into the Red Sea after failing to land on the carrier.</p>

Playing as wicketkeeper, Jones's century occurred in England's first one-day international under the new leadership of Nat Sciver-Brunt and Charlotte Edwards. Edwards' tactical move to promote Jones back up the order proved successful. Jones expressed relief and pride in achieving the century, particularly after receiving the opportunity to bat at the top of the order.</p>
