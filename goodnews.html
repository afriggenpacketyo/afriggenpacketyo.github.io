        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked memo reveals that Angela Rayner suggested Labour consider tax increases to generate ¬£3-4 billion annually, including raising corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax threshold, and scrapping tax-free dividend allowances. These proposals were reportedly not implemented by Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who instead focused on welfare cuts. Environment Secretary Steve Reed maintained cabinet unity behind the government's economic plan, while Conservatives urged Reeves to rule out future tax increases. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride said the note confirms that we are still living with the Labour Party of Jeremy Corbyn.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, who has allowed himself to be bitten by venomous snakes over 200 times, has developed immunity to multiple types of venom. Researchers are studying Friede's blood to potentially synthesize a universal antivenom that could treat various snake bites. The World Health Organization estimates that millions of people are bitten by venomous snakes annually, resulting in tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities. Existing antivenoms are derived from animals injected with specific venoms, making a universal solution highly desirable.</p>

Downing Street said bosses at the troubled firm "rewarding themselves for failure is clearly not acceptable".

          <p>President Donald Trump unveiled plans for his ‚ÄúGolden Dome‚Äù missile defense shield, predicting that the ambitious plan to expand the country‚Äôs air defense system would be completed by the end of his term. U.S. officials have said the Golden Dome is necessary to protect against ‚Äúcatastrophic attacks,‚Äù but experts say it faces logistical and financial hurdles. Trump said he was confident that the United States could complete the project in about three years and be ‚Äúfully operational before the end of my term.</p>

          <h2>Focus on Young Women's Leftward Shift, Not Just Young Men's Alleged Right Turn</h2>

          <p>The media's focus on young men supposedly voting far right is flawed and misses a more significant shift: young women are turning left in greater numbers. While there's a gender gap in support for far-right policies, young women stand out as more politically interesting. The media's male gaze strengthens the far right by normalizing male views. Center-left parties should prioritize the values of female voters to transform political debate and encourage greater participation.</p>
