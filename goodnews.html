        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners seeking low-cost financing are weighing Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) against home equity loans, both offering rates around 8% in September 2025, significantly lower than credit cards or personal loans. While HELOCs currently have slightly lower average rates (8.10%), they feature variable rates, making them susceptible to future Federal Reserve decisions, whereas home equity loans offer fixed rates and predictable payments. Experts advise considering repayment terms, additional fees like closing costs, and individual financial goals, as HELOCs suit flexible needs and quick payoffs, while fixed-rate loans are better for lump sums and long-term stability. The choice depends on a borrower's comfort with rate changes and their specific borrowing purpose. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Netflix is updating its "Moments" feature on mobile devices, allowing users to customize and share specific clips from shows by selecting start and end points. This enhancement aims to capitalize on viral content, such as the popular dance scene from "Wednesday," which is the platform's most-viewed show. The new "clip" option saves segments to a user's "My Netflix" tab for easy rewatching or sharing. This initiative is part of Netflix's broader strategy to revamp its brand and user experience, which includes a redesigned homepage and a TikTok-like vertical video feed, alongside business moves like an ad-supported plan and password-sharing crackdown.</p>

          <p>Legendary band Radiohead has announced their first tour in seven years, with dates set for London, Berlin, Bologna, Copenhagen, and Madrid in November 2025. Drummer Philip Selway confirmed the reunion, stating the band rehearsed last year and felt a strong desire to reconnect with their musical identity and perform live again. This highly anticipated return follows a period where frontman Thom Yorke and guitarist Jonny Greenwood focused on their side project, The Smile, and other members pursued solo work. The announcement, which comes after subtle teasers and fan speculation, signals a significant moment for fans who have eagerly awaited the British group's return to the stage.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 10:25:06 EDT</div>

          <p>Five years after closing all its UK stores, Topshop is making a High Street comeback through a partnership with John Lewis, with products available in 32 stores from February 2026. The brand, acquired by online retailer Asos after the collapse of Sir Philip Green's empire, will feature a 120-piece spring collection curated by John Lewis. This strategic move aims to re-engage customers and attract new demographics, leveraging John Lewis's retail presence to revitalize Topshop's iconic status. While the brand previously struggled with changing shopping habits and sustainability concerns, this collaboration is seen as a "canny move" to bring back a beloved name, with potential for future standalone stores.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder Teoscar Hernández is enduring a disappointing season, marked by injuries, slumps, and defensive miscues, despite being a key player last year. Manager Dave Roberts recently benched Hernández for a game, aiming for a "two-day reset" and emphasizing the need for him to regain his "edge" and "fight." Hernández, who re-signed with the Dodgers for $66 million, has struggled to replicate his previous performance, with his batting average and OPS significantly lower. The team hopes his renewed health and a shift in mindset will help him contribute more consistently as the season's stretch run approaches, acknowledging his value but also the need for on-field performance.</p>

          <p>An exhibition in Gdansk, "Our Boys," is sparking heated debate in Poland by showcasing photos of Polish citizens who served in the Nazi German Wehrmacht during World War II. Historically a taboo subject, the exhibition aims to explore the nuanced, tragic choices faced by Poles forcibly conscripted into the German army after their territory was annexed. Right-wing conservatives, including former President Andrzej Duda, have condemned the exhibition as a "historical falsehood" and "moral provocation," arguing Poles were victims, not participants, of German terror. The controversy highlights a deep divide in Poland's politics of remembrance, challenging a black-and-white view of history and revealing hidden traumas.</p>

          <p>Alphabet shares surged 9% after U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta ruled against the most severe breakup proposals in Google's antitrust case, which began in September 2023. Despite being found to hold an illegal monopoly in internet search, Google will not be forced to divest its Chrome browser or Android operating system. The company can continue paying Apple billions to be the default search engine on iPhones, though exclusive contracts conditioning payments are prohibited. This ruling is seen as a significant win for Google, removing a major overhang on its stock and bolstering investor confidence in the long-term durability of its search business, especially as it invests heavily in AI with Gemini.

          <p>Macy's shares jumped 20% after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's estimates and raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance. CEO Tony Spring attributed the positive performance to revamped stores, a "better customer experience," and a growing business across its portfolio, including Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury. Despite concerns about President Trump's tariffs, which Macy's has incorporated into its outlook, the company remains cautiously optimistic, noting consumer resilience and spending on new fashion items. This marks Macy's best comparable sales growth in 12 quarters, signaling strong momentum and effective strategies to mitigate economic headwinds. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst high mortgage rates and fluctuating home prices, reverse mortgages are gaining appeal for older homeowners looking to convert home equity into cash, especially for aging in place. However, experts warn of unique risks, including rising costs for insurance, maintenance, and property taxes, which borrowers must still cover to avoid foreclosure. Falling home prices in some areas can also reduce the amount of equity available or make qualification difficult, though government-backed HECMs offer protections against owing more than the home's value. The article emphasizes that reverse mortgages can deplete inheritance for heirs and may not be cost-effective for those planning short stays, advising careful consideration of long-term financial goals.

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller, a potential successor for Fed chair, has publicly advocated for the central bank to begin cutting interest rates in two weeks, emphasizing the flexibility to adjust the pace later. Waller, who dissented from the July FOMC decision to hold rates steady, believes current rates are 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points above their "neutral" level and foresees multiple cuts over the next few months. Despite acknowledging tariffs as a consumer tax that could slow growth, he does not predict a recession. Waller also reiterated the critical importance of the Fed's independence, stating it will remain apolitical regardless of leadership. (not investment advice)</p>
