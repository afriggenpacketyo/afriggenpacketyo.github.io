          <h2>German Defense Firm Renk Taps Auto Sector Talent Amid Expansion</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>German defense company Renk, a tank parts manufacturer, is looking to hire talent from the struggling auto sector to meet rising demand due to increased military spending. The company's stock has surged over 300% this year, with its order book jumping 164%. Renk's CEO and COO, both with automotive industry experience, aim to leverage this talent to improve efficiency and quality, while a trade union warns against a one-sided industrial policy focused on rearmament. Analysts see this as an opportunity to address overcapacity in the auto industry and benefit the defense sector as it scales up production, with Germany's automotive industry increasingly seeking collaborations with adjacent sectors.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-over-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher U.S. tariffs on imported cars. Global production also increased by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota has stated it will not pass on the tariff costs to U.S. consumers, analysts believe the company may face pressure to do so if the higher levy remains long-term. For the full business year through March, Toyota anticipates a 34.9% drop in net profit to 3.1 trillion yen due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. </p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggests that increased purchases of U.S. defense equipment could help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. While emphasizing that security matters and tariff negotiations are based on different standards, the negotiator acknowledges the possibility of including defense spending in the discussions. Japan seeks the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, and steel and aluminum imposed by the U.S. However, the Trump administration has resisted complete removal, leading Japan to consider lower duty rates to strike a trade deal. </p>

          <p>CBS has secured a victory in its legal battle with Sony Pictures Television, as an appellate court ruling allows the network to continue distributing ‚ÄúWheel of Fortune‚Äù and ‚ÄúJeopardy!‚Äù during the ongoing appeal. The ruling pauses a previous decision that would have prevented CBS from distributing the shows, which Sony owns and produces. CBS maintains that Sony lacks the legal right to unilaterally sever ties and has accused Sony of entering into unauthorized licensing deals. The legal dispute revolves around distribution fees and historical agreements dating back to the early 1980s. </p>
