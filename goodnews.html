          <p>The Labor Department's Office of Inspector General has initiated a probe into the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) data-collection efforts, citing concerns about the challenges the BLS is encountering. This review comes in response to the BLS announcing a reduction in its data collection for key inflation metrics. The internal watchdog aims to assess the effectiveness and accuracy of the BLS's data-gathering processes, potentially leading to recommendations for improvement.

          <p>Several German schools are implementing smartphone bans to combat excessive phone use among students, with Dalton High School being one example where students must keep phones in their bags throughout the school day. The initiative, called "Smart ohne Phone," has led to improved social behavior and focus, particularly among younger students, who are now engaging in activities like sports and board games. While teachers and parents largely support the ban, older students are more skeptical, and the initiative is part of a broader debate in Germany about how to handle student smartphone use. A similar project in Solingen involves fifth-grade classes taking a complete break from social media, supported by trained 'media scouts'. </p>

          <p>Morningstar has introduced the Modern Market 100 Index to track the combined performance of public and private equity assets, reflecting the increasing desire among investors for private market exposure. The index comprises 90 public firms and 10 venture-backed companies, aiming to capture the performance of the largest U.S. companies. This 90/10 skew mirrors Morningstar's view of the modern asset universe, where private markets offer expanding opportunities and companies remain private longer. The index addresses the challenge of pricing private assets by utilizing secondary trading platforms and incorporates liquidity screens, quarterly rebalances, and daily calculations.

          <p>Qatar, a hereditary monarchy in the Middle East, plays an influential role in regional diplomacy and soft power on the world stage, deriving its wealth mainly from fossil fuel extraction. The nation's strategic position has been both a blessing and a curse throughout its history, marked by conflicts and occupations. Qatar has positioned itself as a global conflict mediator, drawing comparisons with Switzerland due to its financial power and diplomatic ties. While Qatar enjoys good relations with the US and has mediated in conflicts, it has also faced criticism for human rights abuses and its engagement with controversial actors. The country seeks to expand its cultural, diplomatic, and humanitarian engagement to solidify its position as a global player. </p>

          <p>California is considering a bill to allow healthcare providers to anonymously mail abortion drugs, aiming to protect access to medication abortion. The measure would allow doctors, pharmacists, and others authorized to prescribe abortion drugs to omit their names from the prescription label. Abortion rights advocates say this adds to existing protections under the state's shield law, safeguarding doctors who mail abortion pills out of state from legal actions. Opponents argue that shield laws turn states into safe havens for criminal activity, while advocates assert that protecting doctors ensures patient access to abortions. </p>

          <p>Uber plans to integrate helicopter services into its app through a partnership with Joby Aviation, an electric air taxi maker, potentially launching as early as next year. This announcement follows Joby's acquisition of Blade Air Mobility, which provides helicopter and seaplane flights, for $125 million. Once integrated, passengers will be able to book flights directly in the Uber app in the most populated cities globally. The cost and specific deployment locations for the new service are yet to be announced, but Blade currently offers flights between Manhattan and airports in New York and New Jersey for $195. </p>

          <p>Wholesale prices in the U.S. unexpectedly fell by 0.1% in August, according to a Bureau of Labor Statistics report, potentially influencing the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. The producer price index (PPI), which measures input costs, declined against expectations of a 0.3% rise, providing the Fed with room to consider an interest rate cut. The core PPI, excluding volatile food and energy prices, also decreased by 0.1%. This release precedes the Federal Open Market Committee's meeting, where a rate cut is widely anticipated, and the PPI data is being closely monitored for further indications.

The guidance says patients must be given all the information necessary about treatments, including how likely they are to be successful and the risks and benefits involved.
