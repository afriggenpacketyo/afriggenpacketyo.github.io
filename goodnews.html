          <h2>Government Considers Social Media Time Limits for Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 14:23:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is exploring stricter online safety measures, including potential time limits on social media use for children, with proposals suggesting a two-hour cap on individual apps and a 10 PM curfew. Technology Secretary Peter Kyle cited concerns about the addictive nature of apps and smartphones, while online safety campaigners like Ian Russell, whose daughter died after viewing harmful content, urge for stronger legislation to protect children. Current parental controls offered by Apple and Google, as well as TikTok's default 60-minute limit for users under 18, have seen low adoption rates. The government aims to define a healthy online life for children and remove barriers to achieving it. Optimism is tempered by the challenges of enforcement and potential circumvention of these limits, but the intention to safeguard young users is evident.</p>

          <p>A 6.3 magnitude earthquake struck central Colombia, causing alarm among residents in cities like Bogota, Medellin, and Cali. The shallow quake, with a depth of 6.2 miles, was centered near Paratebueno, approximately 116 miles southeast of Bogota. The Colombian Geological Service reported additional tremors following the initial quake. While there were no immediate reports of casualties, authorities are assessing the situation in various municipalities, with images showing people evacuating buildings in Bogota. Colombia's location within the Pacific Ring of Fire makes it prone to frequent seismic activity.</p>

          <p>Costco has introduced a new frozen strawberry lemonade at its food courts, sparking varied reactions from members. Some customers find the drink refreshing and enjoyable, while others find it too tart or prefer the previous strawberry banana smoothie. One commenter noted that the strawberries were nice but the drink was a bit too sweet, and another recounted a story of struggling to drink it due to fruit chunks clogging the straw. The new beverage replaces the strawberry banana smoothie and joins other recent food court changes, including the revival of the combo pizza as a calzone and the replacement of Pepsi with Coca-Cola products.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contemptuous tones can signal deeper issues, while disagreements about family often stem from unmet needs and value clashes. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication patterns also contribute to friction. The psychologist suggests strategies such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring partners of their importance, acknowledging the invisible load of domestic work, and using a designated phrase to signal the need for a time-out during heated conversations. Addressing these underlying issues can lead to healthier and more fulfilling relationships.</p>

Jos Buttler's impressive 47 and Harry Brook's 34 contributed to England's successful chase of 197, despite a mid-innings wobble. Jacob Bethell's explosive cameo of 26 runs from 10 balls and Tom Banton's unbeaten 30 off 11 sealed the victory for England. Earlier, West Indies posted 196-9 after a late onslaught, with Luke Wood taking an early wicket but Adil Rashid proving expensive with figures of 1-59.</p>
