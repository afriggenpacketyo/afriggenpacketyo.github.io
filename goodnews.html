          <p>Residents of Boca Chica Village in Texas are voting on whether to incorporate as a new municipality called Starbase, largely driven by Elon Musk's SpaceX presence. Most of the 283 eligible voters are SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase would establish a local government with control over planning, taxation, and other local issues, though some residents oppose the measure due to environmental concerns. If approved, a state bill could grant Starbase officials the power to close a local highway and restrict access to nearby Boca Chica Beach and Boca Chica State Park for rocket launches.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party in California is facing an uncomfortable question regarding the age of its leaders, with some members suggesting a mandatory retirement age for state and local officeholders. This discussion has emerged in the wake of concerns about leaders holding onto power past their prime, including the late Senator Dianne Feinstein and former President Joseph R. Biden. The proposal, initiated by San Francisco Democrats, aims to address the issue of leadership transitions and make way for younger candidates.</p>

          <p>The world's most powerful solar telescope, located atop a volcano in Hawaii, has achieved a significant milestone by capturing a detailed image of sunspots using its new Visible Tunable Filter (VTF). Scientists anticipate that this instrument will enhance their ability to predict potentially damaging solar storms. Sunspots, areas of intense magnetic activity, can trigger solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which can disrupt Earth's radio communications and electrical grids. The VTF's success offers promise for better predicting and mitigating the impact of these geomagnetic disturbances.</p>
