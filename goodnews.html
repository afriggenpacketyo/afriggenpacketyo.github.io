          <h2>NPR Lawsuit Challenges Trump's Attacks on Press Freedom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit challenging President Trump's executive order to cut federal funding to media organizations deemed "biased." The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech, as Trump has openly criticized NPR and PBS for their coverage and LGBTQ themes. Experts believe NPR has a strong case, citing Trump's explicit targeting of the network based on its perceived bias. The lawsuit represents a significant pushback against the administration's broader attacks on the media. </p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, identifies an archaeological site in central Yunnan as one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. This finding fills a gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia. The research verifies a hypothesis that academics had speculated about but had not been able to test, furthering understanding of human migration and adaptation. </p>

          <p>The French series "Reformed" on Max follows Rabbi L√©a Schmoll as she navigates the challenges of making ancient rituals relevant in the modern world. The show focuses on the actual work of being a rabbi, as L√©a balances the nihilism of contemporary society with the rigidity of Orthodox traditions. The series highlights her struggle to interpret religious texts and provide meaning to her congregation. The show is roughly based on the book Living With Our Dead, by Delphine Horvilleur, which was published in an English translation last year. </p>

          <p>The article discusses how to fight back against President Trump's policies by drawing lessons from historical poor people's movements. The author cites the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as an example of effective grassroots organizing. The Johnnie Tillmon model, which emphasizes uniting the poor across differences and building visionary projects of survival, is presented as a relevant strategy for today. The article advocates for a new social contract that lifts from the bottom of society to benefit everyone. </p>
