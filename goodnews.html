          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his commitment to protecting Social Security, vowing to prevent any cuts to the program if congressional Republicans pursue a reconciliation bill. He emphasized focusing on eliminating unnecessary expenditures while safeguarding Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. This article notes Trump's consistent stance on protecting the federal program, even as projections from the 2025 Trustees Report indicate the Social Security trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2033, potentially leading to a 23% reduction in benefits. The administration's efforts also include a temporary tax deduction for seniors and a push for Social Security to become a 'digital-first agency.' (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the factors determining the maximum Social Security payment seniors can receive in 2025, noting that the highest possible monthly benefit is $5,108 for those retiring at age 70. Achieving this maximum requires exceptional lifetime earnings, consistently meeting or exceeding the taxable maximum for at least 35 years, and claiming benefits at the optimal age of 70. For the majority of retirees who will receive significantly less, the article explores additional income strategies like reverse mortgages, annuities, part-time work, and investment portfolios. It emphasizes the importance of early financial planning beyond Social Security for retirement security. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new LendingTree study reveals that nearly six million full-time workers in the U.S. without a bachelor's degree earned at least $100,000 in 2023, highlighting diverse pathways to high-paying careers beyond traditional four-year degrees. This article identifies 20 occupations where over 40% of non-college-educated workers achieve six-figure salaries, including software developers, sales engineers, and aircraft pilots, alongside entrepreneurs who start their own businesses. The findings come as rising tuition costs and student debt lead many to question the value of a college degree, with companies increasingly loosening degree requirements for applicants and opening up more opportunities.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's engagement announcement triggered an immediate and widespread response from numerous brands, eager to connect with the pop culture moment through social media posts, memes, and special deals. This article explores how companies, from food chains to airlines, leveraged the news, with some, like Ralph Lauren and DoorDash, seeing tangible commercial benefits and engagement. However, marketing experts debate whether this rapid capitalization is effective or if it risks becoming opportunistic and tiring for consumers, suggesting that truly resonant brand engagement requires genuine relevance and contribution to the cultural discourse, rather than merely jumping on trends.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has decided to scrap its recently unveiled new logo and revert to its original design, following widespread public criticism and a dip in its market value. The article details how the company's attempt at a brand refresh, which removed the iconic 'Uncle Herschel' character and barrel from its logo, was met with accusations of going 'woke' and prompted President Donald Trump to publicly urge a return to the old design. Marketing experts criticized the initial redesign for abandoning the brand's core story and emotional connection with its customers. The company's stock price subsequently rose after the announcement to reinstate the traditional logo.</p>

          <p>This article explores the ongoing and increasingly polarized debate surrounding unrestricted cash transfers and universal basic income (UBI), once heralded as a solution to poverty. Recent studies have yielded mixed results, showing that while cash aid can keep families housed and pay bills, it doesn't always lead to lasting improvements in mental health or financial well-being, challenging some proponents' earlier claims. The piece highlights how conservatives are using these findings to criticize welfare, while some Democrats emphasize cash aid's role in providing basic security and addressing market failures. Despite new pessimism, the movement for cash assistance continues, with new experiments and positive outcomes in specific contexts.</p>

          <p>This article explores the remnants of the ancient Nabataean civilization in the Negev desert, focusing on a remarkably intact 1,500-year-old Christian church and its baptismal pools at the long-abandoned city of Mamshit. Known for their trading prowess and the city of Petra, the Nabataeans transitioned to Christianity around the 4th century A.D. The discovery of a smaller pool for babies and a larger, cross-shaped one for adults speaks to this historical shift. The article reflects on how these enduring traces, despite the harsh desert environment, serve as a poignant reminder of the constant change societies undergo and that even significant cultures do not last forever.</p>
