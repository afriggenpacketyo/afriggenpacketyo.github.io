          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were slated to be laid off. The injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge Myong Joun in Boston, emphasizes the department's need to fulfill its functions and obligations mandated by Congress. This decision follows the Education Department's announcement on March 11 of a significant staff reduction. The Department of Education was established in 1979 by former President Jimmy Carter and has faced multiple existential threats over the decades.</p>

          <p>A train struck a tractor and trailer on a level crossing in Herefordshire, causing significant disruption to rail services. The incident occurred on a farm track used by agricultural vehicles, and authorities are investigating the circumstances leading up to the crash. While the train did not derail, six of the 56 passengers were assessed for minor injuries. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch is gathering evidence to determine if a full investigation is necessary, adding to concerns about rail safety following a previous fatal crash involving Transport for Wales trains last month.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a 4-4 decision, the Supreme Court has blocked a plan to allow Oklahoma to use public funds for a Catholic charter school, St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, leading to the tie. The deadlock upholds the Oklahoma Supreme Court's ruling against the school, which aimed to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum. This decision means that the long-standing guarantee of secular public schools remains in effect, but the future of religious charter schools remains uncertain as proponents may attempt to establish such schools in a way that does not require Justice Barrett's recusal.</p>

          <p>A tax bill includes a $1,000 baby bonus in "Trump Accounts," which function similarly to 529 college savings plans with tax-deferred earnings and long-term capital gains tax rates on qualified withdrawals. These accounts offer an alternative to custodial brokerage accounts and 529 plans, providing tax advantages for parents saving for their children's future. While 529 plans offer tax-free growth for education expenses, Trump Accounts have fewer limitations on fund usage, though 529 plans have higher contribution limits and can now be rolled into Roth IRAs.</p>

          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some trainers and clothing in the US from early June, following a similar warning from Adidas. The sportswear giant attributed the price adjustments to regular business evaluations. The move comes as companies contend with the uncertainty of the Trump administration's trade policies. Almost all of Nike's goods are made in Asia, a region targeted by President Donald Trump's tariffs.</p>
