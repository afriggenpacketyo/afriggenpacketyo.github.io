          <p>China has initiated an aviation management training program for eight Southeast Asian nations in Beijing, aiming to promote its domestically produced civilian aircraft, including the C919. The 14-day workshop covers critical areas like safety, airworthiness, and green development, as China seeks to expand its presence in a region increasingly accepting its aircraft deliveries. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to challenge the long-standing duopoly of Airbus and Boeing in the global large jet market. Experts note this aligns with growing economic cooperation between China and Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Chinese social media platform Xiaohongshu, often compared to Instagram, saw its valuation climb 19% to $31 billion in three months, according to recent transactions by a GSR Ventures Management fund. This surge reflects robust investor interest, particularly as the company emerges as a potential competitor to TikTok, which faces regulatory challenges in the U.S. The increased confidence follows China's pledge to support private firms, revitalizing the country's startup ecosystem. Xiaohongshu constituted a significant portion of GSR's fund assets, highlighting its importance to the firm's portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is actively exploring a return to the Senate, eyeing the open New Hampshire seat in the 2026 midterm elections. With Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen not seeking re-election, Republicans view Sununu, from an influential political family, as a strong candidate for a state that has been challenging for GOP Senate hopefuls. Sununu plans to travel the state and make a decision by the end of next month, emphasizing his desire to appeal broadly across the political spectrum. His potential candidacy sets up a competitive primary against other Republican contenders.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, despite lingering economic concerns. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix indices, along with Australia's S&P/ASX 200 and South Korea's Kospi, all registered increases in early trading. Global bond markets remain under scrutiny, with long-dated borrowing costs rising, partly due to a U.S. court ruling questioning the legality of certain tariffs. This market movement indicates cautious optimism driven by the tech sector's performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have announced the recovery of "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century Italian painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during World War Two. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before it disappeared in 1945 after being acquired by Hermann Göring. The painting was discovered last month in an online real estate listing in Argentina, traced to the daughter of a Nazi lawyer. This recovery marks a significant step in repatriating stolen cultural heritage, prompted by the efforts of Dutch journalists.</p>

The brand's "Great Jeans" ad featuring Sweeney sparked public debate but generated immense impressions and sold out her signature jeans. This marketing success has prompted the company to project low single-digit sales growth for the coming months, despite earlier economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration unlawfully froze $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, calling it an "ideologically-motivated assault" on premier universities. The ruling supported Harvard's argument that the freeze was retaliatory, stemming from the university's refusal to accept demands that violated First Amendment protections and academic freedom. The judge noted that the administration's swift action lacked connection to antisemitism concerns, which were used as a "smokescreen" for broader ideological control. This decision restores critical funding for numerous research projects across various fields, affirming the university's rights.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling there was "no invasion or predatory incursion" to justify its application. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an incursion, asserting that an armed, organized force was not present. This decision marks a significant legal victory for civil liberties advocates, who argued that migrants were denied due process and that the U.S. was misusing a wartime statute during peacetime. The ruling underscores the judiciary's role in scrutinizing executive power in immigration matters.</p>

The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups intervened, arguing these actions violated the National Voter Registration Act and had partisan motives.
