          <p>Following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, the U.S. is actively seeking the quick deployment of an international peacekeeping force to stabilize the Gaza Strip. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the composition of the force must be acceptable to Israel, which has reportedly rejected Turkish involvement. The peace plan also calls for a temporary committee of independent technocrats to manage Gaza's civil affairs, though Hamas's role and disarmament remain unresolved issues. The humanitarian situation remains dire, with the U.S. also confirming that the UN agency UNRWA will not be active in post-conflict Gaza.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After Kim Kardashian revealed her diagnosis of a brain aneurysm, seemingly linking it to stress, medical experts have clarified the connection. Doctors state that while stress itself does not directly cause an aneurysm, it can elevate blood pressure, a key factor in their formation and potential rupture. The primary risk factors are identified as genetics, high blood pressure, smoking, and age-related arterial changes. Most aneurysms are small, asymptomatic, and do not rupture, but managing blood pressure and avoiding smoking are crucial for prevention.</p>

          <p>Zhi Dong Zhang, a Chinese citizen known as "Brother Wang" and accused of being a major fentanyl trafficker, has been extradited from Cuba to the United States. The transfer was facilitated by the Mexican government, from which Zhang had previously escaped house arrest. U.S. authorities allege Zhang ran a vast drug trafficking and money laundering operation, coordinating the importation of fentanyl from Mexico and working closely with the Sinaloa and Jalisco cartels. His extradition is a significant development in the U.S. effort to combat the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals from overseas.</p>

          <p>In a significant show of support, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Democratic Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. The endorsement comes just before the start of early voting and helps unify the Democratic party behind Mamdani, a democratic socialist who is the frontrunner in the polls. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers. The endorsement contrasts with that of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, who recently backed Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the permanent closure of the S&W Atlas Iron & Metal recycling facility in Watts, Los Angeles, and imposed a $2 million penalty on its owners. The scrap yard, located next to Jordan High School, had a long history of endangering students and staff with toxic dust, explosions, and flying shrapnel. The owners pleaded no contest to criminal charges related to illegal handling of hazardous waste after a compressed gas canister exploded on the first day of school. The ruling provides long-awaited justice for the community, which has suffered from the facility's "reckless disregard for safety" for generations.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicated that inflation rose at a 3% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than the 3.1% forecast by economists. The data suggests that the impact of the Trump administration's tariffs on consumer prices has been somewhat muted, as businesses absorb some of the costs. This inflation reading is crucial as it is used to calculate the annual cost-of-living adjustment for Social Security. Despite the increase, the benign report is seen as unlikely to deter the Federal Reserve from implementing another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. (not investment advice)</p>

While concerns about inflation and a potential government shutdown persist, retailers are "cautiously optimistic," believing that resilient consumers will still show up for key discount events.
