          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a significant resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic halted operations in 2020. Pent-up travel demand and new investments are fueling a surge in maritime journeys, with Japanese ports seeing record domestic passenger numbers. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism reported a 14.2 percent year-on-year increase in the Japanese cruise market in 2024, reaching 224,100 passengers. Major shipping companies like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines Ltd. are expanding their cruise ship fleets to capitalize on this growing market, with new vessels offering luxurious amenities and entertainment options. The Asuka III, set to launch in July, will be the largest passenger ship in the Japanese fleet, featuring frescoes and private seaside balconies in all cabins, reflecting the growing interest in cruise travel.</p>

          <p>Students may encounter limited course availability as universities grapple with financial constraints and consider cutting programs. A government review is underway to address the long-term funding of higher education in England, while the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration among institutions. Universities UK suggests that increased collaboration could help institutions reduce costs and improve efficiency, potentially mitigating the risk of subject "cold spots." Some universities have already begun delivering courses collaboratively to benefit students, but legal concerns around competition laws hinder more widespread cooperation.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her involvement in the January 6 Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon offered by President Trump. Hemphill believes the pardons contribute to a false narrative and undermine the accountability of those who participated in the riot. She has sought formal acknowledgment from the Department of Justice that she will not accept the pardon, contrasting with other Capitol riot defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons. Hemphill's stance reflects a growing divide among those involved in the riot regarding the legitimacy and consequences of their actions.</p>
