          <p>Real Madrid defeated Borussia Dortmund 3-2 in a dramatic match to advance to the Club World Cup semi-final against Paris Saint-Germain. Goals from Gonzalo García and Fran García gave Madrid a comfortable lead, but a chaotic final 10 minutes saw Dortmund score twice, requiring a last-minute save to secure the win. The match also featured a spectacular acrobatic goal from Kylian Mbappé and a red card for new defender Dean Huijsen, who will miss the upcoming semi-final. The performance showcased both the team's emerging young talent and the brilliance of its established stars.</p>

          <h2>Actress Julie Bowen Reveals She Received a Pacemaker at Age 29</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 18:11:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>"Modern Family" star Julie Bowen disclosed that she was fitted with a pacemaker at age 29 due to a heart rhythm disorder called sick sinus syndrome. Her condition, which caused a dangerously low resting heart rate, was discovered by her sister, who was then in medical school. Bowen initially feared her life was over but was convinced to get the device after doctors warned she could pass out while driving and cause an accident. She now says she often forgets about the pacemaker, which has required battery replacements about three times over the years.</p>

          <p>Lifeguards at Newport Beach performed 350 rescues on July 4th as swimmers were caught in powerful and dangerous rip currents. In one dramatic incident, a "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 people far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and a police helicopter. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions and elevated surf along the Southern California coast for the holiday weekend. The event serves as a stark reminder of the dangers of ocean currents even on popular beach days.</p>

          <p>Sonay Kartal, at 5ft 4in, is the shortest player in the women's singles draw at Wimbledon but has reached the fourth round for the first time. The 23-year-old British player says she is a "proud short person" and has compensated for her lack of height by focusing on her speed and power. After overcoming injuries and a period of being self-funded, Kartal has seen a rapid rise in the world rankings to 51st. She draws inspiration from other shorter players like Jasmine Paolini and is set to make her Centre Court debut, viewing her successful run as a major confidence boost.</p>

          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible final-day chase of 536 runs against India, the England cricket team may be reconsidering its aggressive "Bazball" philosophy that shuns draws. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick suggested that the team is not "stupid enough" to ignore the possibility of batting for a draw to preserve their 1-0 series lead. This marks a potential shift from the team's defiant mantra of always playing for a win, regardless of the situation. The final day's play will be a major test of whether England will adapt its strategy when victory is out of reach.</p>

          <p>This article presents an excerpt from "Mark Twain," a new biography by Pulitzer Prize-winner Ron Chernow. The selected passage details Twain's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, which he undertook to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi." Traveling with his publisher, Twain found the river and its towns much changed, a poignant experience that contrasted with the timeless feeling of being back in a steamboat's pilot house. The excerpt captures Twain's deep nostalgia for his youth and the freedom he associated with his early career as a river pilot.</p>

          <p>Mark Twain's full autobiography was published a century after his death, as per his specific instructions, revealing his uncensored thoughts on everything from politics to personal relationships. The work is highly unconventional, composed of daily dictations rather than a linear narrative, making it feel like a modern blog. Twain chose to delay its publication to speak freely without hurting those he criticized and as a brilliant marketing ploy. The release offers a raw, unfiltered look at the mind of one of America's greatest literary figures and first global superstars.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris anticipates a highly competitive British Grand Prix, suggesting a "six-car fight for the win" is possible among McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, and Ferrari. Qualifying was extremely close, with the top six cars separated by just 0.23 seconds. Teams have opted for different aerodynamic setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while others focus more on cornering grip, which could lead to a varied and exciting race. The outcome may depend heavily on tire management and potential changes in weather at the Silverstone circuit.</p>
