          <p>Approximately 60,000 runners participated in the 44th Great North Run, one of the world's largest half marathons, held on Tyneside. The 13.1-mile race from Newcastle to South Shields attracted over 200,000 spectators who cheered on the participants. Event founder Sir Brendan Foster noted the event's growing popularity, particularly among younger runners and women, with female participation rising from 8% in the first race to 49% last year. Newcastle United's Jacob Murphy and Nick Pope were among the famous faces who officially started the iconic North East event, which continues to be a major fixture in the running community.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has dispatched Y-20 military transport aircraft to deliver emergency humanitarian aid to Afghanistan following a series of devastating earthquakes. The initial supplies consist mainly of tents and blankets to assist those affected by the quakes, which have resulted in over 2,200 fatalities and thousands of injuries. This aid mission is part of a 50 million yuan (US$7 million) emergency relief package pledged by Beijing's foreign aid agency at the request of Kabul. Additional aid flights are planned in the coming days to support the recovery efforts in the disaster-stricken region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The company Pray.com is generating significant online attention with its AI-created videos that visualize biblical stories, such as the Book of Revelation, in a style reminiscent of Hollywood action movies or video games. While the company reports positive engagement, particularly from younger audiences who find the content spiritually impactful, some theologians are critical of the approach. These critics argue that reducing complex scripture to "edutainment" or a "Marvel Universe of faith" strips it of its profound spiritual power and transforms divine revelation into mere spectacle. The debate highlights the ongoing tension between leveraging new technology for evangelism and preserving the theological integrity of sacred texts.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 04:56:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A total lunar eclipse, creating a "Blood Moon" effect, will be visible across much of the United Kingdom this evening. The phenomenon occurs when the Earth passes directly between the Sun and the Moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a deep red hue. While the full eclipse lasts for over an hour, visibility in the UK is limited to the period after moonrise, with eastern parts of the country getting the best and longest view. Astronomers advise finding a location with a clear view of the horizon to witness the event, which is safe to observe without special equipment and represents the mechanics of the solar system in action.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, a London-born Italian teenager who died of leukemia at age 15, has been officially canonized as the first millennial saint by the Catholic Church. Known for his passion for technology, Acutis created websites to document miracles and spread Catholic teachings, earning him the nickname "God's influencer." The Vatican fast-tracked his path to sainthood, attributing two miracles to him after his death, in a move seen as an effort to connect with and inspire younger generations of Catholics. His preserved body in Assisi, Italy, has become a major pilgrimage site, and a shrine has also been established at the London church where he was baptized.</p>

          <p>The South Korean government has successfully concluded negotiations with the United States to secure the release of its citizens who were detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai battery facility in Georgia. US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) arrested 475 people, over 300 of whom were South Korean nationals, for allegedly working illegally. The raid and the subsequent release of video showing shackled Asian workers caused concern in Seoul, with officials worrying it could chill business activities and strain relations at a time of sensitive trade talks. A chartered plane is being arranged to bring the detainees home, and officials are working to improve the visa system to prevent future incidents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The US Open has evolved beyond a traditional tennis tournament into a major cultural and commercial event, often compared to festivals like Coachella. The experience for many attendees is now defined by high-priced novelty items like the $23 Honey Deuce cocktail, influencer marketing, and celebrity sightings, which are meticulously managed by the USTA to generate social media engagement. This shift emphasizes consumption and being "seen" at the event, with the actual tennis sometimes feeling secondary to the spectacle of branding and social status. While this "festival economy" has driven record attendance, it raises questions about the tournament's traditional identity and the increasing cost for the average fan.</p>

          <p>Inspired by Ukraine's successful use of flooding to bog down Russian tanks near Kyiv, some European countries on NATO's eastern flank are exploring a similar "nature-based" defense strategy. Poland and Finland are considering restoring bogs, marshes, and peatlands along their borders with Russia to create impassable terrain for heavy armored vehicles. This innovative approach serves a dual purpose, as rewetting these landscapes also helps combat climate change by sequestering carbon and promoting biodiversity. While the strategy presents challenges, such as land ownership and economic impact, it reflects a growing intersection between environmental policy and modern military defense planning.</p>

          <p>Daniel Andreas San Diego, a prime suspect in a series of 2003 bombings in California and the first American-born person on the FBI's most wanted terrorist list, is facing an extradition hearing in London. After evading capture for 21 years, he was discovered living under an alias in a cottage in north Wales. The FBI believes he has links to animal rights extremist groups and was responsible for planting two bombs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Former FBI agents involved in the original case recall "missed opportunities" to arrest him before he vanished after a high-speed chase, leaving behind a car containing a suspected "bomb-making factory."</p>

Sanders hailed Mamdani's grassroots campaign as a "test case for democracy" and criticized mainstream Democratic leaders for not fully supporting the progressive candidate.

          <p>The USC Trojans football team delivered a dominant offensive performance, defeating Georgia Southern 59-20 in a game that served as a reunion with their former coach, Clay Helton. Quarterback Jayden Maiava was highly efficient, throwing for 412 yards and four touchdowns before sitting out the fourth quarter. The offense accumulated a total of 755 yards, the most for the program in two decades, with a balanced attack that also saw the run game rack up over 300 yards. While the defense showed some vulnerabilities by allowing several big plays, the offense's overwhelming firepower ensured a comfortable victory for the second consecutive week.</p>
