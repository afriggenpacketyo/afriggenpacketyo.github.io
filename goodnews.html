The Teal Wand offers a more convenient self-screening method for cervical cancer, aiming to increase screening rates. The device uses a swab to collect a vaginal sample, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV testing. A U.S.-based study showed at-home screening was equally effective and preferred by women. The device will be available by prescription through a telehealth service for women 25-65 years old who are at average risk.</p>
