        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two new clinical trials in India are challenging the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. The research found that consuming mangoes in moderation, as a replacement for carbohydrates like bread, may actually improve blood sugar control and other metabolic health markers. One study showed mangoes produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, while another linked mango consumption to improvements in fasting glucose and insulin resistance.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into the first hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane over the weekend. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is located over the Atlantic and is not forecast to directly impact the United States mainland. However, forecasters are urging Caribbean islands, particularly the northern Leewards, to monitor its progress due to the potential for heavy rain and life-threatening surf conditions as it passes nearby.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series win features an altered version of an iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant. Instead of his Lakers jersey, the mural shows him in a No. 24 Dodgers jersey, a creative choice by the artist and restaurant owner who commissioned the piece. While intended as a tribute to a Los Angeles icon within a Dodgers-themed artwork, the alteration has generated mixed reactions and online discussion among sports fans.</p>

          <h2>Fashion Retailer Topshop Plans High Street Return with Standalone Stores</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 19:05:44 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Topshop, the once-dominant British fashion brand, is planning a major comeback with the reintroduction of physical standalone stores on the High Street. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was sold to online retailer Asos, but is now aiming to recapture its former glory, starting with a catwalk show at London Fashion Week. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is strong, its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and re-establishing its 'cool' factor in a competitive market.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant resurgence after a multi-year slowdown caused by inflation and high interest rates. Recent successful debuts by companies like Figma, Circle, and Bullish, which saw their stock prices soar on the first day of trading, have signaled that the IPO window is open again. This renewed investor confidence is clearing a backlog of high-valued startups, though some analysts caution that the market could be overheating, drawing comparisons to the dot-com era.

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting an electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by keeping the base model simple and allowing for extensive customization. The company's strategy is to lower manufacturing costs on a spare, two-seat vehicle and then sell over 100 different accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's price point may become less competitive against other vehicles under $30,000.</p>
