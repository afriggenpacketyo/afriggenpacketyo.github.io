          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials have reportedly established a framework for a deal concerning the ownership of TikTok, according to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. President Trump indicated an agreement was reached that would "save" the popular app, with a final call between him and Chinese President Xi Jinping scheduled to finalize the terms. The deal follows a U.S. law that mandated TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, either divest its U.S. operations or face a ban, a measure Trump had previously delayed enforcing. The proposed solution aims to resolve national security concerns while allowing the app to continue operating for its millions of American users.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board of directors is proposing a new, massive compensation package for CEO Elon Musk, potentially worth around $900 billion, to incentivize his continued focus on the company. The plan is contingent on Musk leading Tesla to an unprecedented $8.5 trillion valuation and meeting other operational goals. This proposal comes as Musk's attention is divided among his many other companies and political activities. The board argues that Musk's leadership is essential to Tesla's high valuation, while Musk himself has expressed a desire to increase his ownership stake to around 25% to remain committed.</p>

          <p>The UK government has confirmed it will introduce the long-awaited "Hillsborough Law," which will include a legal "duty of candour" compelling public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. The legislation is designed to prevent cover-ups and provide legal aid for victims, learning lessons from the 1989 Hillsborough football stadium disaster and other tragedies like the Grenfell Tower fire. Campaigners, including families of the 97 victims who died at Hillsborough, welcomed the news, expressing hope that it will prevent others from enduring similar prolonged struggles for justice. The bill is set to be introduced to Parliament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly announced "Hillsborough Law" is the culmination of a nearly decade-long campaign by families and survivors of the 1989 stadium disaster, which claimed 97 lives. The law aims to address two key injustices exposed during the long fight for truth: the lack of a legal duty for public bodies to cooperate transparently with inquiries and the imbalance in legal funding between victims and state institutions. Drafted by barristers who represented the families, the bill seeks to create a "duty of candour" and ensure parity of legal funding. The legislation is seen as a vital legacy for the victims.</p>

          <h2>Amazon Introduces AI-Voiced Audio Summaries of Product Reviews and Descriptions</h2>

          <p>Amazon is rolling out a new feature called "Hear the Highlights," which uses artificial intelligence to generate short audio summaries of product information. The AI model scripts the summaries by pulling data from product catalogs, customer reviews, and other web sources, aiming to make shopping easier for customers. While this could help shoppers navigate thousands of reviews, it also raises questions about whether AI can capture the nuance and specific insights found in individual human experiences. Critics worry that by blending marketing language with user feedback, the feature could dilute the authenticity that has made customer reviews a valuable resource.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud provider CoreWeave jumped nearly 8% after the company revealed a significant long-term purchase agreement with Nvidia, valued at a minimum of $6.3 billion. Under the deal, Nvidia is obligated to buy any of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032. CoreWeave, which went public in March and is backed by Nvidia, is a major customer for Nvidia's GPUs, renting them out to its own clients. The agreement underscores the strong relationship between the two companies and the immense demand for AI computing infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has proposed that U.S. companies should move away from the standard practice of reporting earnings every quarter and instead adopt a semiannual schedule. In a social media post, he argued that this change would save money and allow corporate managers to focus on long-term strategy rather than short-term profits. This is not the first time the idea has been raised; during his first term, Trump asked the SEC to study the issue. While some business leaders have criticized quarterly guidance, supporters of the current system argue it provides crucial transparency and timely information for investors.</p>

This change is expected to redirect investment flows from larger markets, including Indonesia and Mexico, towards smaller nations such as Thailand, Poland, and Brazil.

          <p>Tesla's stock gained over 3% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed a rare open-market purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares. This significant insider acquisition is being interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker. The purchase comes as Tesla's stock has rallied significantly from an April low, turning positive for the year despite a sales slump and brand challenges linked to Musk's political activities. Analysts see the move as Musk "doubling down" on his vision for Tesla as an AI and robotics company. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's stock surged more than 4% on Monday, pushing it past the milestone. This significant rally was partly fueled by a recent antitrust ruling that imposed lighter-than-feared penalties on the company. Despite facing increased competition in the AI space and regulatory challenges, Alphabet's shares have risen more than 30% this year, reflecting strong investor confidence in its market position and future prospects.

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of home equity, many are looking for the best ways to tap into this financial resource. For those seeking to borrow around $50,000, several options exist, each with distinct advantages. A home equity loan offers the predictability of a fixed rate and stable monthly payments. A home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides flexibility, allowing homeowners to draw funds as needed. A cash-out refinance might secure a lower interest rate but resets the mortgage term, while a reverse mortgage offers an option for seniors without monthly repayments. (not investment advice)</p>
