          <p>Former Secretary of State Antony Blinken was reportedly asked to leave Georgica Beach in East Hampton, New York, due to closures enforced by Hurricane Erin's dangerous conditions. Photos showed Blinken and a friend packing up after a lifeguard and patrol vehicle approached them. East Hampton beaches had been closed for several days, with authorities citing strong rip currents, storm surge, and debris. This incident adds to previous scrutiny over Blinken's leisure activities during significant global events, such as his Hamptons vacation before the Taliban's takeover of Kabul.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is moving north-northeast. The National Hurricane Center reports maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, with tropical-storm-force winds extending up to 60 miles from its center. Forecasters predict Fernand will strengthen slightly before weakening by Tuesday, remaining over open waters and posing no immediate threat to land. This follows Hurricane Erin, which also formed in a similar area and reached Category 5 strength, causing hazardous conditions along the East Coast.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new £200m attacking lineup, featuring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is facing "teething problems" with a struggle to score goals from open play. After two Premier League games, their only goal has been an own goal, leading to a 1-1 draw with Fulham and an opening 1-0 defeat by Arsenal. Manager Ruben Amorim acknowledges the team is still adapting to a new style and new players, but insists chances are being created. The team's inability to convert opportunities and a missed penalty by Bruno Fernandes highlight the challenges in integrating the expensive new talent.</p>

Although the grand prize went unclaimed, several tickets won significant smaller prizes, including three matching all five white balls. The next drawing is scheduled for Monday evening, with odds of winning the top prize standing at 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's recent rally, attributing it to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal of impending interest rate cuts, driven by a dramatic deceleration in hiring. He notes the market's previous confusion and the "foolish" miscalculation by negatively biased hedge funds regarding tariffs and layoffs. Cramer highlights a bullish narrative for housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs), advising investors to consider underperformers in these sectors. He also discusses the non-monolithic nature of Big Tech and the ongoing Intel saga, warning of a seasonally challenging September. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest manager Nuno Espirito Santo has dismissed "absurd" speculation that he will quit, despite admitting his relationship with owner Evangelos Marinakis has "changed." However, he could not guarantee his future beyond the transfer window, citing ongoing discussions about transfers with Marinakis and global head of football Edu. Nuno's unhappiness stems from the club's summer transfer activity, as he seeks a new goalkeeper and two full-backs despite significant new attacking signings. While fans support Nuno, experts suggest he is unlikely to win a dispute with the owner, leading to uncertainty about his tenure.</p>

          <p>Law enforcement agents have removed over 2,300 illegal marijuana plants and 2,000 pounds of trash from a 13-acre grow site in California's Sequoia National Park. The operation also uncovered a semi-automatic pistol and a gallon of a banned toxic insecticide, Methamidophos. This site had been previously raided, but rehabilitation was delayed due to hazardous chemicals. Illegal grows pose significant environmental threats, including water diversion, pesticide contamination, and habitat destruction. Authorities emphasize that well-organized drug-trafficking organizations have been operating large-scale cultivation operations in the national parks for nearly two decades.</p>
