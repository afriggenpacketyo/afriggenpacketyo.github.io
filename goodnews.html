          <p>The Bank of Korea has maintained its policy interest rate at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, citing the need to monitor rising housing prices in Seoul and growing household debt. While acknowledging stable inflation and modest economic improvement, the central bank expressed caution. It also upgraded its GDP growth forecast for 2025 to 0.9% and its inflation forecast to 2%, expecting a modest recovery in domestic demand. This decision comes after recent trade agreements with the U.S. that are expected to influence South Korea's export-driven economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded mixed as investors reacted to the Bank of Korea's decision to hold its key interest rate at 2.5%. South Korea's Kospi saw modest gains, while Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed slightly; however, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index declined. Investor attention is also on Indian markets, which face new U.S. tariffs, and on Asian chip stocks following Nvidia's strong earnings report. In Australia, Qantas shares reached a record high after beating earnings estimates, while rare earths producer Lynas announced a major share sale. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A controversial temporary immigration facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed "Alligator Alcatraz," is expected to have zero detainees within a few days, according to a state official. The announcement follows a federal judge's ruling to effectively wind down operations at the center, denying a request from the Trump administration and Florida officials to keep it open. Officials had argued the facility was necessary due to overcrowding at other centers, but the judge was not swayed, noting it was always intended to be temporary. The decision marks a significant development in the legal battles surrounding the state's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>The winning numbers have been announced for Wednesday's Powerball drawing, which featured an estimated jackpot of $850 million, the sixth-largest in the game's history. The selected numbers were 9, 12, 22, 41, and 61, with a Powerball of 25. The cash value for a single winner is estimated at $383.7 million before taxes. The jackpot grew to its massive size after no winning tickets were sold for the previous drawing, continuing a winless streak that began in late May. Lottery officials noted that ticket sales have doubled in the past week as excitement over the large prize has grown.</p>

This move signals growing confidence in the sector and highlights the increasing influence of Chinese capital in Southeast Asia's financial markets. The planned REIT's assets are expected to include industrial and logistics properties in Singapore recently acquired by the consortium.</p>

          <h2>Fact-Check Debunks Unfounded Rumor of President Trump's Imminent Death</h2>

          <p>A viral social media claim suggesting President Donald Trump has only six to eight months to live due to congestive heart failure and kidney disease is unfounded. The rumor originated from a TikTok video by a user who is a physical therapist, not a medical doctor, and was based on visual observations of Trump's appearance. The White House had previously addressed speculation about swelling and bruising in July 2025, attributing the symptoms to a benign condition called chronic venous insufficiency. A memorandum from the Physician to the President at that time affirmed Trump remained in "excellent health," with no signs of heart failure or renal impairment.</p>

          <h2>All NATO Members Now Meet 2% Defense Spending Target, But New 3.5% Goal Remains Distant</h2>

          <p>A new NATO report confirms that all 32 member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment across the alliance, particularly since Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also reveals that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious target of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the importance of converting these funds into tangible military capabilities.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia Surpasses Earnings Expectations but Stock Dips on Data Center Revenue Miss</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, driven by continued high demand for its artificial intelligence chips. The company also issued a strong sales forecast, projecting revenue growth to remain above 50% for the upcoming quarter. Despite the positive results, Nvidia's stock declined in after-hours trading because its data center revenue, while up 56% year-over-year, fell slightly short of analyst estimates for the second consecutive quarter. The report confirms the company's central role in the global AI infrastructure boom, with expectations of trillions in spending by the end of the decade. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. The position, which has been vacant since she took office, is meant to help film and television productions navigate city bureaucracy. The delay had frustrated industry advocates who see the role as crucial for keeping production jobs in L.A., especially as the city faces stiff competition from other locations offering tax incentives and cheaper labor. The appointment fulfills a key campaign promise to the city's signature industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated there is a "real possibility" of bringing the company's advanced Blackwell AI processor to the Chinese market. Speaking after a strong earnings report, Huang urged the U.S. government to allow American tech companies to compete in China's rapidly growing AI sector, which he estimates could be a $50 billion opportunity this year. This follows a recent deal where Nvidia secured export licenses for its current-generation H20 chip in exchange for a percentage of sales revenue going to the U.S. government, signaling a potential path forward for navigating complex geopolitical and trade restrictions.

          <h2>UK Government Expands Free Childcare Program for Working Parents in England</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 19:45:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is expanding its funded childcare program, offering working parents in England 30 hours a week for children aged nine months to three years starting in September. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged eligible parents to apply for the final phase of the expansion. The program aims to alleviate the high cost of childcare, which averages over £12,000 annually for a full-time nursery spot for a child under two. However, concerns persist about whether there are enough staff and available places to meet the increased demand, and some parents report being priced out by top-up fees for extras not covered by government funding.</p>
