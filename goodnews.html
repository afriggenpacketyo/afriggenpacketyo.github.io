          <p>The Supreme Court has extended its block on the Trump administration's attempts to deport Venezuelan migrants detained in Texas under the Alien Enemies Act of 1798. This order maintains a previous directive issued by the court, preventing the government from removing the migrants while their challenge to the deportations is pursued. The emergency injunction was sought by lawyers representing the Venezuelan migrants, who argued they faced 'imminent' risk of removal under the invoked act. The Supreme Court's decision ensures the migrants will not be deported while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

          <p>Joakim Medin, a Swedish journalist, has been released from jail in Turkey after being imprisoned for 'insulting' Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Medin, who works for Dagens ETC, was arrested upon arrival in Istanbul while covering protests sparked by the arrest of Istanbul's mayor. He received an 11-month suspended sentence for insulting the president and faced additional terrorism charges, which he refuted. The Swedish Prime Minister thanked the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European colleagues for their intensive work on the issue, securing Medin's release and return to Sweden.</p>

          <p>A House amendment to the Republican budget package proposing the sale or transfer of approximately 500,000 acres of public land in Nevada and Utah has faced unexpected opposition from within the party. Representative Ryan Zinke of Montana, former Interior Secretary, voiced strong disapproval, threatening the budget bill's future. The amendment reflects Interior Secretary Doug Burgum's view of public lands as assets to address the affordable housing crisis, a notion criticized for its shortsightedness. This stance contrasts with the broader historical value of public lands as shared resources for conservation and recreation.</p>

          <p>As the US considers lifting sanctions on Syria, Lebanon anticipates both potential risks and opportunities, with President Joseph Aoun closely monitoring the developments. The lifting of sanctions could allow Syria to re-enter international markets, attract foreign investment, and regain diplomatic support. Lebanon hopes this move will facilitate the return of Syrian refugees and boost regional trade, but some analysts worry that Lebanon may struggle to keep pace with Syria's progress. Potential projects like oil pipelines and fiber optic lines could positively impact Lebanon's economy.</p>
