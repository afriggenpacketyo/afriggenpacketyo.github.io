          <p>Nissan CEO Ivan Espinosa stated that the company's primary focus is to address its current struggles through major restructuring efforts, despite facing declining sales, the shift to electric vehicles, and intense global competition, especially from Chinese manufacturers. Espinosa emphasized confidence in the company's plan to recover, even with the added pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum. The plan includes slashing 11,000 jobs and closing seven plants, anticipating a 3% drop in sales volumes this fiscal year. The company's previous talks with Honda regarding a potential merger, which could have created the world's third-largest automaker, ended in February. The optimism score reflects the CEO's confidence despite significant challenges. </p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration reports that approximately 91% of cases related to the Social Security Fairness Act have been processed, leading to increased benefits and retroactive payments for nearly 3 million individuals. The Social Security Fairness Act, enacted in January, eliminated the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and the Government Pension Offset (GPO), which previously reduced benefits for those receiving income from public pensions without Social Security payroll taxes. The agency attributes the faster processing to automation and aims to update all affected beneficiary records by early November, exceeding initial estimates. Commissioner Frank Bisignano has pledged to complete the adjustments promptly. The increased payments for pensioners are a positive development. </p>

          <p>Insilico Medicine, a biotechnology firm, announced positive results from clinical trials of its new drug for lung disease, rentosertib, which was designed using artificial intelligence (AI). The company is currently pursuing a public listing in Hong Kong. The phase 2A clinical trial results, published in Nature Medicine, indicated that rentosertib was generally safe and potentially effective for treating idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). While some patients experienced liver toxicity when taking rentosertib with another IPF drug, the study demonstrated the transformative potential of AI in drug discovery and development, according to Insilico's founder and CEO Alex Zhavoronkov. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has achieved a new milestone in quantum-based secure direct communications, tripling the distance of a multi-user network to approximately 300km. The researchers at Shanghai Jiao Tong University reported that their optical fiber network, while currently limited in transmission rate, is theoretically scalable, demonstrating the feasibility of this type of quantum network. The quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network uses multiple lasers to send paired photons between users, with added noise to conceal the signals. The scientists emphasize the need for further research to realize a large-scale quantum communication network with thousands of users over long distances. </p>

The piece emphasizes the importance of communication and setting boundaries within these relationships, suggesting that partners should discuss their expectations and navigate conflicts together. Ultimately, the article suggests maintaining a cordial relationship with in-laws for the benefit of one's spouse and children, provided mutual respect is present. </p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced a ¬£15 billion investment in transport projects across the Midlands, the North, and the West Country, marking a shift from stringent Treasury rules that have historically favored London and the South-East. The investment will focus on tram, train, and bus projects, including significant funding for Greater Manchester, the West Midlands, and West Yorkshire. The announcement signifies Reeves' move away from the Treasury's Green Book rules, which have been criticized for creating regional disparities. Shadow Chancellor Mel Stride criticized Labour's transport promises, while Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Daisy Cooper urged the Chancellor to deliver on these commitments. </p>

          <p>French cognac businesses are optimistic that recent discussions between China and France could lead to the removal of tariffs imposed by Beijing. These tariffs were introduced in retaliation for the European Union's duties on Chinese electric vehicles. Guilhem Grosperrin, director of the Grosperrin family brand, noted that discussions between Chinese and French officials are progressing positively, with the Chinese government showing a willingness to listen. The tariffs, implemented last October, have caused some Chinese clients to delay orders, pending the outcome of negotiations. </p>
