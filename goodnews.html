          <p>In his first broadcast interview since being released from ICE custody, Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil spoke with ABC News about his detention and his commitment to advocating for Palestinian human rights. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained for over three months and still faces the threat of deportation under the Trump administration. He stated that no threat would deter him from speaking out against injustice and that his detention has actually advanced the cause of Palestinian liberation. Khalil also addressed allegations of antisemitism within the Palestinian movement, asserting that there is no place for any form of racism. His release followed a judge's order, which the Department of Homeland Security criticized, and Khalil remains concerned about his safety and the possibility of future detention, but is committed to continuing his advocacy. </p>

The Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service responded to the blaze, which caused part of Hotspur House to collapse and forced the cancellation of trains through Manchester Oxford Road station. Embers from the fire reached 1 Cambridge Street, prompting the evacuation, but the fire is no longer being treated as a major incident. The fire service urged the public to stay away from the area and residents were advised to keep doors and windows closed due to smoke.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, most Trump voters interviewed by ABC News supported the president's actions, viewing them as decisive leadership to protect American interests and prevent Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. While some Republicans, like Marjorie Taylor Greene, criticized the strikes as a betrayal of the "America First" agenda, others believed the actions aligned with protecting U.S. military and strategic interests. Some voters expressed disappointment, fearing escalation, but overall, Trump's supporters trusted his judgment, citing his access to national security intelligence. A Washington Post poll indicated that 46% of Trump voters supported the airstrikes, while 26% opposed them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran retaliated by launching missiles at a U.S. base in Qatar, but all missiles were reportedly intercepted without causing casualties or damage. President Trump stated that Iran's response was "very weak" and suggested that both sides should pursue peace, hinting at a possible ceasefire. Trump's actions are seen as a high-risk maneuver that could yield positive outcomes if further escalation is avoided and negotiations become possible. This situation echoes a similar dynamic in 2020 when Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani, but ultimately chose not to escalate after Iran's retaliatory missile strikes.</p>

          <p>US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to change prior authorization practices. This agreement aims to streamline the process where private health insurers require patients to seek permission before receiving medical treatment. While Oz called the agreement a good start, he noted that 85% of Americans have experienced delays or denials of care due to prior authorization. Kennedy called the agreement momentous and said it would help make the health system work to make the country healthy again, but some remain skeptical of insurers' willingness to abide by the agreement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. military strikes in Iran have raised concerns about potential disruptions to the global oil supply and subsequent increases in energy prices. While initial market reactions saw a surge followed by a decline in crude prices, experts believe Iran is unlikely to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical waterway for oil transport. However, ongoing tensions could still disrupt the energy market, potentially leading to higher gas prices for American consumers. The closure of the Strait of Hormuz, though unlikely, could send oil prices soaring, impacting economies worldwide, and the potential for Israeli strikes on Iranian oil facilities also remains a concern (not investment advice).</p>

Trump noted that most of the missiles were intercepted and that no Americans were harmed, expressing hope that the situation would lead to regional peace.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities, legal experts are debating whether President Trump had the authority to order the attacks without congressional approval. Article I of the Constitution grants Congress the power to declare war, while Article II designates the president as commander-in-chief. Some experts argue that Article II gives the president authority to use military force in certain circumstances, including preventing nuclear proliferation. Others contend that Trump should have consulted Congress first, as there was no sudden attack to repel. Presidents have historically used their authority to order military actions without congressional approval, leading to ongoing debate about the balance of power.</p>

          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' had the studio's worst opening weekend ever, grossing $21 million in the U.S. and Canada. This marks the lowest opening for a Pixar film and underscores the challenges faced by original animated movies in attracting audiences post-pandemic. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled against competition from other family-friendly releases, and analysts suggest marketing may have been a factor. Disney remains optimistic that 'Elio' will find its audience throughout the summer, similar to the success of 'Elemental,' and is committed to creating original animated content alongside sequels and franchises.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to use its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it due to rising Middle East tensions. Despite China's dependence on Middle Eastern oil, its approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing self-interest rather than direct military intervention. The analyst pointed to China's agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels as an example of this approach. China's focus remains on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways, even though about 16% of its seaborne crude comes from Iran.</p>
