          <p>After a fatal shooting at a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints chapel in Michigan, a Utah church member named David Butler launched a crowdfunding effort for the gunman's family. The suspect, Thomas Jacob Sanford, was killed by police, leaving his wife and a chronically ill son in dire financial straits. Inspired by religious principles of loving one's enemies and caring for the vulnerable, Butler's GiveSendGo campaign swiftly garnered over $300,000 from more than 7,600 donors, many from his own faith. Despite receiving backlash for supporting the perpetrator's family, Butler maintains that they are also victims facing significant economic hardship, highlighting a unique act of empathy amidst tragedy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Secretary of State Shirley Weber have cautioned that mail-in ballots dropped on November 4th might not be counted due to potential U.S. Postal Service processing delays. This affects voters living more than 50 miles from six key mail facilities, as ballots must bear a postmark from Election Day or earlier to be valid. This warning prompts a crucial change for California's widespread vote-by-mail system, emphasizing the need for earlier submissions. Concurrently, Governor Gavin Newsom enacted two bills to bolster election integrity: one prohibits offering financial inducements for voting, while the other proposes a ballot measure to repeal the state's ban on public campaign financing, aiming to protect democratic processes.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown publicly aired his frustrations on social media regarding his perceived underutilization in the team's offense, despite their undefeated 4-0 record. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce openly criticized Brown's decision to express discontent online during a winning streak, questioning the timing and method. However, Travis's brother and former Eagles lineman, Jason Kelce, defended Brown's right to feel frustrated about his role, though he acknowledged that tweeting might not be the most effective approach. Brown subsequently accepted responsibility for his emotional outburst, clarifying that his post was not aimed at any specific individual within the Eagles organization, with his coach reaffirming his dedication.</p>

          <p>Dr. Oscar Duke offers expert advice on identifying and managing common autumn illnesses like colds, flu, and Covid-19, noting that symptoms often overlap. Colds typically manifest gradually with nasal and throat discomfort, whereas the flu presents more acutely with body aches and fever. Covid-19, particularly with new variants, can uniquely cause a loss of smell or taste, a severe sore throat, or diarrhea, prompting a recommendation for rest and medical consultation if symptoms persist or worsen. The article also provides practical self-care strategies, including pain relief, hydration, and Vitamin D supplementation, while clarifying the limited evidence for Vitamin C's efficacy against colds and the impact of cold weather.</p>

          <p>Yunnan, China's leading coffee-producing region, has achieved remarkable success in its export market, with coffee and related products reaching US$1.1 billion in outbound shipments during the first eight months of 2025. The province now exports to over 30 countries, including Germany and Vietnam, capitalizing on robust global demand. A 50-year high in benchmark coffee futures has propelled Yunnan's raw bean prices by over 65%, significantly benefiting local growers through increased volumes and margins. This export surge is also catalyzing industrial modernization, as factories upgrade equipment and technology to satisfy evolving international consumer preferences and stringent quality requirements, solidifying Yunnan's position in the global coffee trade.</p>

European golfers like Rory McIlroy, whose wife reportedly endured physical harassment, and Matt Fitzpatrick, publicly expressed their offense at Rea's perceived minimization of the issue. The article highlights that PGA of America CEO Derek Sprague had already offered personal apologies to the McIlroys, underscoring the organization's eventual acknowledgment of unacceptable fan behavior.</p>

USA Rare Earth is currently advancing a mine project in Sierra Blanca, Texas, and a magnet production facility in Stillwater, Oklahoma. Humpton voiced approval for the administration's broader investment approach in the sector, indicating that her company is proactively sharing its strategic plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese investors are seeing significant returns on their US$21 billion in gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as the precious metal experiences a robust global price rally. Financial institutions like Julius Baer and Lombard Odier project gold prices could ascend to US$3,900-US$4,000 per ounce within the next year, with JPMorgan offering an even more optimistic forecast. This year's nearly 50% surge in gold prices is driven by its perceived value as a portfolio diversifier, strong central bank acquisitions, a weakening dollar, and growing investor anxieties regarding geopolitical instability and increasing government debt levels. The 13 gold ETFs on Chinese exchanges have collectively yielded a 42% return this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During the U.S. government shutdown, Republican figures, including Vice President JD Vance and President Trump, have asserted that Democrats are demanding free healthcare for undocumented migrants. However, this BBC Verify article fact-checks these claims, reporting that Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer explicitly refutes them. Democrats are advocating for the extension of Affordable Care Act subsidies and the reversal of Medicaid cuts, which primarily impact lawfully present immigrants and low-income citizens, not undocumented individuals. Federal law currently prohibits taxpayer-funded medical coverage for undocumented immigrants, with emergency Medicaid being the only exception. The article clarifies that Democratic proposals aim to restore healthcare access for lawfully present immigrants, without extending it to undocumented populations.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has consented to align its U.S. drug prices with those in other developed nations and join the TrumpRx platform, representing a notable, though largely symbolic, achievement for President Trump. This agreement culminates years of Trump's persistent efforts to reduce prescription drug costs, despite Pfizer's prior resistance. While new drugs will be priced at parity, discounts for existing medications are mainly for Medicaid beneficiaries, and TrumpRx requires direct consumer payment, raising questions about its overall impact on affordability. The article highlights Trump's effective use of tariff threats as a negotiating tool, signifying a shift in the pharmaceutical industry's position and his more assertive approach in his second term.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>College rankings, now an entrenched aspect of higher education, originated as a contentious "shocking experiment," exemplified by Edwin Embree's informal 1934 list that sparked significant controversy. Earlier attempts, such as Kendric Babcock's 1911 study, were suppressed due to political fallout and institutional resistance. This article chronicles the transformation from these infrequent, often subjective evaluations to the influential, data-centric U.S. News & World Report rankings, which debuted in 1983. It elucidates how the burgeoning demand for higher education as a consumer product and intensified competition for elite university admissions propelled the popularity of these metrics, fundamentally reshaping public perception and institutional strategies within American higher education.</p>
