          <p>President Trump is intensifying efforts to end the war in Ukraine, stating it is a top priority after his administration helped broker a ceasefire in Gaza. Ahead of a meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Trump has shifted his tone, increasingly blaming Russia for the conflict's continuation and considering new sanctions to pressure Vladimir Putin. The administration is reportedly considering selling long-range Tomahawk missiles to Kyiv as leverage to bring Russia to the negotiating table. This marks a notable change from Trump's earlier stance and reflects a gradual warming of relations with President Zelenskyy.</p>

          <p>Amid record-high credit card debt and rising interest rates in the U.S., more consumers are facing lawsuits from creditors. While being sued can be alarming, hiring a lawyer is not always necessary. For straightforward cases where the debt is valid, individuals can respond to the lawsuit themselves to avoid a default judgment, which could lead to wage garnishment. Alternatives to court include negotiating a settlement or payment plan directly with the creditor, seeking assistance from a credit counseling agency, or, in cases of overwhelming debt, filing for bankruptcy to halt legal action through an automatic stay.

          <p>The European Court of Justice (CJEU) issued two key rulings related to air travel, generally siding with the airlines. In one case, the court determined that a lightning strike can be considered an "extraordinary circumstance," potentially exempting an airline from compensating passengers for long delays, provided the airline took all reasonable safety measures. In a separate case, the court ruled that a pet transported in an aircraft's hold is legally considered "baggage," not a "passenger." This limits the airline's liability for non-material damages for a lost pet to the standard compensation for lost luggage.</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive race, a Formula 1 event has been declared a "heat hazard," this time for the United States Grand Prix in Austin, Texas. Forecasted temperatures exceeding 31°C (88°F) triggered the FIA's safety protocol, which is designed to protect drivers from potentially dangerous conditions. This designation, new for the current season, allows drivers the option to use special cooling vests in their cars to mitigate the effects of the heat. While some drivers find the vests beneficial for maintaining performance, others consider them uncomfortable, highlighting a debate within the sport over the new safety measure.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While high-yield savings accounts remain a valuable tool for savers, there are several costly mistakes to avoid as the interest rate environment evolves. Experts advise savers to choose online banks, which typically offer higher rates than traditional brick-and-mortar branches due to lower overhead costs. It is also recommended to consider splitting funds with a Certificate of Deposit (CD) to lock in current high rates, as savings account rates are variable and may fall with future Fed rate cuts. Despite recent rate reductions, these accounts still offer significantly better returns than traditional savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following reports of lead in products like cinnamon and protein powders, health experts are advising consumers on how to minimize exposure to the toxic metal. While lead occurs naturally in the environment, added amounts in unregulated products like supplements can pose health risks over time, particularly for children. The CDC warns that lead can damage the brain and nervous system. To reduce risk, experts recommend prioritizing whole foods over processed supplements and looking for trusted third-party certifications, such as the USP label, on products to ensure they have been tested for safe levels of contaminants.</p>

          <p>The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, has announced a "defense readiness roadmap" that includes making a bloc-wide anti-drone defense system operational within two years. This "drone wall" is a response to the increasing use of unmanned aerial vehicles in modern warfare and repeated airspace encroachments by Russia. The plan, part of a broader effort to fortify the EU's eastern borders and enhance defense capabilities, calls for closer integration of national armies and defense industries. The initiative reflects a strategic shift for the EU, which has traditionally played a minor role in collective defense compared to NATO.</p>

          <p>While gold often dominates precious metals discussions, silver is emerging as a noteworthy investment, with its price reaching near-record highs this year. Silver offers a more affordable entry point than gold and provides similar portfolio protections, such as acting as a hedge against inflation and economic instability. The price of silver has increased by over 80% in the past year, presenting an opportunity for investors to potentially see significant returns. Financial advisors suggest that now could be an opportune time to invest before its value potentially climbs higher, while still adhering to portfolio diversification principles.

In Zimbabwe, which has a high HIV prevalence but a strong public health infrastructure, the rollout will initially target high-risk groups. While the development brings great hope, concerns remain about the drug's cost and accessibility, though partnerships are expected to reduce its price significantly.</p>
