          <p>President Trump announced a "planned partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, projecting it will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy. This endorsement comes after the Biden administration blocked Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel on national security grounds. The United Steelworkers union remains opposed to the deal, expressing concerns about the potential impact on American jobs and domestic steel-making capacity. Shares of U.S. Steel jumped following the news, indicating investor optimism about the arrangement.</p>

          <p>The UK government has delayed the publication of its child poverty strategy, initially due in the spring, with a spokesperson stating the strategy will be published later this year to ensure fully-funded measures address the root causes of child poverty. The Child Poverty Taskforce, co-chaired by Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall and Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson, is considering various measures, including whether to scrap the two-child benefit cap. While some criticize the delay, others suggest it allows for a more substantial and effective strategy to protect children from hunger and hardship. The delay has sparked debate about the government's commitment to tackling child poverty and the potential impact of policy changes.</p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled his upcoming tour dates after being diagnosed with normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting his hearing, vision, and balance. The 76-year-old singer was advised by his doctor to refrain from performing while undergoing physical therapy. NPH occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, disrupting brain-related functions, and is more likely to occur in older people. Fans who purchased tickets will receive automatic refunds, and Joel looks forward to returning to the stage when his health improves.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, granting a temporary restraining order after Harvard sued the administration. The lawsuit alleges the administration's move was retaliatory and violated the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The Trump administration claimed Harvard failed to comply with requests for information on student visa holders and perpetuated an unsafe campus environment hostile to Jewish students. Harvard President Alan Garber called the order a critical step to protect the rights of international students and scholars.</p>
