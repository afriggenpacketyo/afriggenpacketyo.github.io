          <p>Childhood vaccinations have saved an estimated 154 million lives over the past 50 years, since the World Health Organization launched its Essential Programme on Immunization. However, a study published in The Lancet reveals that progress in boosting vaccination rates has stalled or reversed in many places since 2010. Challenges include conflict, supply chain issues, and vaccine misinformation. Despite these challenges, India has been successful in reducing the number of zero-dose children, and efforts are underway to address disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>The prospect of lab-grown meat being served in restaurants is generating debate, with some touting it as an environmentally friendly solution to growing meat demand, while others question its true environmental benefits. Lab-grown meat is biologically real meat grown from cow cells, and its advocates claim it can reduce carbon emissions and land use. Critics argue that the environmental benefits have been oversold, and more effort should be expended on reducing meat consumption. The UK's Food and Agriculture Organisation says meat production has increased fivefold since the 1960s.</p>
