          <p>Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit has announced he is ending his 18-month pursuit of an NFL career to return to professional rugby. The 24-year-old, who was on the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad, stated it was the right time to come home and focus on what he does best. Before his departure for the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, Rees-Zammit was a prominent star for the Welsh national team. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for Wales rugby.</p>

          <p>Nintendo reported a surge in its fiscal first-quarter performance, with revenue more than doubling to $3.8 billion, significantly beating market expectations. The growth was primarily fueled by the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console, which has sold 5.82 million units since its release in June. Despite the strong sales, the company has maintained its conservative full-year forecast, citing potential uncertainty from factors like U.S. tariffs on imports. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, Germany has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the northern Atlantic region, where numbers have grown to approximately 1,600 animals across 209 packs. This positive development, reported to the European Commission, means the species is no longer considered at risk in this area. The new status could pave the way for the government to allow controlled hunting to manage the population and protect livestock, a move that remains a topic of debate.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new policy that will restrict its primary civil service internship program to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. This initiative, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to increase working-class representation in Whitehall and ensure the government better reflects the country it serves. Successful interns will be prioritized for the Fast Stream graduate program, though the move has drawn criticism from the opposition as a form of "leftist social engineering."</p>

          <p>In an innovative effort to combat poaching, scientists in South Africa have launched the Rhisotope Project, which involves injecting rhino horns with harmless radioactive isotopes. This material makes the horns easily detectable by radiation scanners at international borders and airports, aiming to disrupt trafficking supply chains and deter poachers. Led by the University of the Witwatersrand, the project offers a new, non-lethal strategy to protect the country's critically endangered rhino population from the illegal horn trade.</p>
