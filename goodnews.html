          <p>A history buff's metal detecting hobby led to the rediscovery of a lost medieval monastery in Derome, Sweden. G√∂ran Bengtsson noticed a peculiar rectangle symbol labeled "Klosterkullen" (monastery hill) on an 18th-century map. Archaeologists confirmed the site using ground-penetrating radar, revealing the walls of monastery ruins. The find, dating back to the late 1100s, may be the original location of √Ös Abbey, later moved in the 13th century, and the discovery has surprised experts.</p>

The study highlights that mothers, in particular, face decreased life satisfaction, influenced by factors such as single parenthood, young age, and low education.
