          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index surged to a new record high, driven by gains in technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. The Fed's move, described as a 'risk management cut,' was widely expected and came with indications of further cuts through 2027. While Japanese markets rallied, other Asia-Pacific markets showed mixed results, with Hong Kong and mainland China experiencing slight losses. The Bank of Japan is currently holding its own policy meeting, where it is largely expected to maintain its current interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

Attendees included Apple CEO Tim Cook, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and media mogul Rupert Murdoch, alongside prominent UK and US politicians. The elaborate event, designed as a display of diplomatic hospitality, saw the President seated between King Charles and the Princess of Wales. The menu and musical selections, including some of President Trump's favorites, were part of the meticulously planned affair in the historic St George's Hall.</p>

          <p>This opinion article highlights the story of a Chinese student who chose to pursue a culinary program over a traditional academic path, framing it as a positive sign of individuality in a society focused on intense exam-based competition. The author argues that it is encouraging to see more young people in China confidently following their dreams, especially given the current economic climate. The piece suggests that Chinese society is becoming more supportive of unconventional career choices. It contrasts this with past stories of university graduates taking on manual jobs, which were often portrayed as novelties or signs of failure.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called 'AI Fluency,' which will require all undergraduate students, starting with the class of 2029, to study artificial intelligence. The program mandates that all freshmen take a course in generative AI and participate in workshops focused on real-world applications of the technology. The university aims to ensure its graduates are proficient in both their chosen major and AI, giving them a competitive edge in a job market that has seen a dramatic increase in demand for AI skills. The initiative seeks to teach students to use AI effectively as a tool for brainstorming and organization without replacing critical thinking.</p>

          <h2>Tropical Storm Gabrielle Forms in the Atlantic, Becoming Seventh Named Storm of the Season</h2>

          <p>The seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, Tropical Storm Gabrielle, has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean. Currently, the storm is tracking northwest over open waters and does not pose an immediate threat to land. However, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict it could intensify into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend as it moves north of the Caribbean. While its path remains uncertain, models suggest the system could approach Bermuda next week, though the 2025 hurricane season has so far been quieter than initially predicted.</p>

          <h2>Wild Chimpanzees Consume Low Levels of Alcohol Daily from Fermented Fruit, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 19:56:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire regularly consume fruit with a low alcohol content from natural fermentation. Scientists measured the alcohol in fruits favored by the primates, such as figs and plums, and calculated that the average chimpanzee consumes the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day. This steady, low-dose exposure does not appear to intoxicate the animals. The findings lend support to the 'drunken monkey' hypothesis, which suggests that the human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the diets of our fruit-eating primate ancestors.</p>

          <p>A UK Education Select Committee report is urging the government not to scrap the current system of Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) for children with special educational needs. These legally binding documents outline the support a child is entitled to, and the committee recommends keeping them as a crucial accountability measure for parents. The report also calls for new national minimum standards for special needs support in all schools and increased teacher training. The recommendations come as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been criticized as financially unsustainable.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a dramatic 3-2 victory over Atletico Madrid in their Champions League opener, thanks to a 93rd-minute header from Virgil van Dijk. The win continued Liverpool's trend this season of securing victories with late goals, having previously surrendered a 2-0 lead in the match. The game also marked the debut of Liverpool's £125m record signing, Alexander Isak, who showed promising signs before being substituted after 58 minutes. While the result was a celebration for manager Arne Slot on his birthday, the team's pattern of conceding leads remains a point of concern.</p>

The visit featured extensive British pageantry, which the president appeared to delight in.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee is widely expected to hold its key interest rate at 4% when it meets on Thursday. This follows a cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to a two-year low. Analysts believe that with UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut at this time. The decision contrasts with the U.S. Federal Reserve's recent choice to lower its rates, highlighting the different economic pressures faced by the two countries. (not investment advice)</p>
