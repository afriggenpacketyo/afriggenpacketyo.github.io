          <h2>Palantir Stock Plummets Amid International Growth Concerns Despite Earnings Beat</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir shares experienced a significant drop of 12% despite the company exceeding revenue expectations and raising its full-year revenue guidance. Analysts expressed concern over a modest full-year revenue guidance increase, a sequential margin decline, and a year-over-year decline in international commercial revenue. While Palantir reported adjusted earnings of 13 cents per share on $884 million in revenues, a 39% increase from the previous year, the company's high software multiple makes it vulnerable as revenue growth slows. CEO Alex Karp remains optimistic, citing the company's 20 years of investment and a cultural shift in the U.S. as driving factors.</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has been elected as the new German Chancellor after a second round of voting in the Bundestag. Opposition factions, including the Greens and the Left Party, agreed to a shortened deadline for the second vote, ensuring a swift formation of a new government. Despite their agreement on the timeline, the Greens maintained their opposition to Merz, emphasizing that a government must have a majority of its own. Mainstream German parties continue to uphold a 'firewall' against cooperating with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p>

          <p>Friedrich Merz has been elected as Germany's next leader after two rounds of voting in Parliament, marking a pivotal moment for the nation's economy, security, and role in Europe. Merz's inability to secure enough votes on the first ballot raised questions about his ability to navigate domestic and international crises. Supporters describe him as an agile politician capable of addressing public concerns about growth, defense, and immigration. However, critics point to his struggles with long-term planning and past reversals on spending and migration, leaving him vulnerable to setbacks and alienating conservative voters.</p>

          <p>The UK and India have reached a trade agreement after three years of negotiations, aimed at facilitating exports for UK firms and reducing taxes on Indian exports. The deal, described as a 'landmark' by Prime Minister Starmer, is projected to boost trade by ¬£25.5 billion annually by 2040, and does not include any changes to immigration policy. Key benefits for UK consumers include lower tariffs on clothing, footwear, and food from India, while UK exports such as gin, whisky, and medical devices will see reduced levies. Indian Prime Minister Modi hailed the deal as an 'ambitious and mutually beneficial' milestone that will promote trade, investment, and job creation.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar experienced a pullback after a notable surge that led to multi-decade gains, driven by speculation about pressure from Washington to strengthen the local currency. Despite the recent weakness, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% against the U.S. dollar this year. Experts attribute the currency's volatility to exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging their U.S. dollar debt holdings. While officials deny exchange rates were part of U.S. trade negotiations, analysts remain skeptical and suggest that currency realignment may be underway.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the shingles vaccine may offer benefits beyond preventing the viral infection, potentially lowering the risk of heart disease. The research indicates that individuals who received the vaccine experienced a 23% reduction in cardiovascular events, such as stroke and heart failure, for up to eight years. The protective effect was particularly pronounced in men, people under 60, and those with unhealthy lifestyle habits. While the study primarily focused on a live zoster vaccine, experts believe that the newer, non-live vaccine may also offer similar cardiovascular benefits.</p>

          <p>Palantir shares experienced a decline despite the company reporting earnings that met expectations and boosting its full-year revenue guidance. The artificial intelligence software company's commercial revenues grew 71% year over year, while government segment sales jumped 45%. CEO Alex Karp attributed the growth to increased adoption of its tools in the U.S. defense sector and a surge in demand for large language models. While U.S. revenues increased significantly, the company's shares fell due to concerns about its ability to continue its overall growth at the current pace.</p>
