          <p>The Tall Ships Races, one of Europe's largest free family events, has commenced in Aberdeen, Scotland, expecting to draw hundreds of thousands of visitors. The four-day festival features nearly 50 vessels from around the world, including international crews from as far as Peru and Oman. Despite a Met Office weather warning for heavy rain, the event began with musical performances and is intended to foster international friendship and sailing training for young people. This marks Aberdeen's third time hosting the historic maritime event, which continues to be a significant tourist attraction for the city.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The market for high-protein snacks is booming, but nutrition experts caution that marketing claims can be misleading. Many products labeled as "high-protein" also contain significant amounts of sugar and processed ingredients, undermining their health benefits. To assess a snack's true protein value, experts suggest a simple calculation: multiply the grams of protein by four and divide by the total calories to see the percentage of calories from protein, with 30% or more being a good benchmark. They also recommend prioritizing whole-food snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, and cottage cheese over highly processed alternatives.</p>

          <h2>Nescafé Shifts Strategy to Attract Younger, Cold-Coffee-Drinking Consumers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Coffee giant Nescafé is strategically targeting Gen Z by focusing on the rapidly growing cold coffee market, which now accounts for a third of out-of-home coffee consumption. The Nestlé-owned brand is moving beyond its traditional hot morning coffee to offer products for all-day, cold consumption, such as its new Espresso Concentrate. This shift is part of a broader strategy by Nestlé to refocus on core, high-growth categories like coffee. The company also sees an opportunity to position coffee as a sophisticated, non-alcoholic alternative for younger consumers who are reportedly drinking less alcohol.</p>

          <p>To combat impulsive and emotionally driven spending, financial therapists suggest asking a series of critical questions before making a purchase. Consumers should assess if the purchase fits their budget, if it's an attempt to fill an emotional need, or if it's driven by a desire to impress others. Experts recommend creating a dedicated budget for non-essential items and checking in with one's emotional state using the HALT acronym (Hungry, Angry, Lonely, Tired). By being more intentional and doing proper research, individuals can make more mindful financial decisions and avoid purchases they might later regret.</p>

          <p>British MMA fighter Dakota Ditcheva, the PFL flyweight world champion, has expressed frustration over the difficulty in finding challengers following her dominant 2024 season. After a string of decisive victories, including three first-round stoppages, the 26-year-old has faced an eight-month wait for her next fight due to a lack of available opponents in the promotion. Ditcheva is now set to face American Sumiko Inaba at a historic PFL event in Cape Town, South Africa. Despite the frustrating delay, she believes the time off has built anticipation for her return to the cage.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated heavyweight title rematch, boxing experts are divided on whether Daniel Dubois can avenge his 2023 loss to Oleksandr Usyk. While many, including Eddie Hearn, believe Usyk's superior skill and recent form will lead to another victory, others feel Dubois's newfound confidence and power could produce an upset. Some analysts suggest Usyk may be nearing the end of his career and could be vulnerable, while others maintain he is still the world's top heavyweight. The fight at Wembley Stadium will determine if Dubois can become Britain's first undisputed heavyweight champion since 1999.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more affordable method for CAR-T cell therapy, a highly personalized treatment for blood cancers and other serious diseases. The new technique produces the specialized anticancer cells directly inside the patient's body using gene therapy tools, bypassing the complex and expensive conventional process. The team has successfully used this innovative in-vivo method to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This breakthrough could make the promising but costly immunotherapy, which has also shown potential for treating asthma and autoimmune diseases, more accessible to patients worldwide.</p>

Their release was secured in a deal that also freed ten Americans held by Venezuelan authorities.
