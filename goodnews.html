          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash the majority of recently imposed tariffs on each other's imports, a move resulting from high-level trade discussions held in Switzerland. Both nations have also temporarily suspended some reciprocal duties for a 90-day period. Under this agreement, the U.S. has reduced tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China has lowered its tariffs on American products from 125% to 10%. While some tariffs remain, this development signals a potential de-escalation in the trade war between the world's two largest economies, with further negotiations planned to refine the future trade relationship. This article also notes that China has agreed to lift export controls on rare-earth minerals.</p>

          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a rise of over 2% in volatile trading after the company announced a 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) share buyback program. The company's operating income for the last three months of the financial year exceeded analyst estimates, although it was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, distributing over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. Despite these positive developments, Sony's outlook for the current financial year was tempered by concerns over the impact of U.S. tariffs, though the article also notes that Sony clarified that the estimated tariff impact did not reflect the trade deal made between the U.S. and China on May 12.</p>

          <p>Family offices, which provide personalized wealth management services to the ultra-rich, are experiencing rapid growth but struggling to find qualified money managers. This shortage is attributed to trust issues, the informal structure of family offices, and competition from other financial institutions. Family offices often prioritize trust over qualifications, making hiring decisions difficult, and they seek candidates who can combine multiple roles, which is a rare find. Some families are willing to pay a premium for trusted individuals, but young employees are often reluctant to work in family offices due to a lack of corporate structure and career progression opportunities.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of killing their parents in 1989, have been resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, a decision that could lead to their release after more than three decades behind bars. Judge Michael V. Jesic cited the brothers' rehabilitation efforts inside prison and letters of support from corrections officials as factors influencing his decision. While Judge Jesic emphasized that the decision to release them ultimately lies with the governor and state parole board, the brothers are now immediately eligible for parole, and they are scheduled to appear before the board on June 13 as part of Governor Newsom's consideration of clemency.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced a decrease in April, marking the first month-to-month drop since October 2024, with the average price for a dozen Grade A eggs declining to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. However, despite this decline, retail egg prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu wiping out flocks of egg-laying hens. While experts anticipate further price drops in May and June due to decreased consumer demand after Easter and fewer bird flu outbreaks, the uncertainty surrounding the virus's progression could cause prices to rise again. The U.S. government is investing in biosecurity measures and increasing egg imports to address the issue.</p>

The chimpanzees dab these plants on their wounds or chew them up and apply the chewed material to the open injury, sometimes even tending to the wounds of other animals they aren't related to. This research builds on previous discoveries that chimps seek out and eat certain plants to self-medicate, and it adds to the growing body of evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild. The researchers studied footage of a very young, female chimpanzee chewing plant material and applying it to an injury on its mother's body.</p>

A poll indicated that a significant percentage of Ph.D. and postdoctoral students in the United States were considering leaving the country due to these policies.

          <p>President Trump received a warm and opulent welcome from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, reflecting the strong diplomatic and business alliances between the royal and presidential families. The president's visit included a tour of the Royal Court, a speech at the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, and a tour of Diriyah, a historic town being developed as a tourism destination. The Saudis invoked the 1945 meeting between King Abdulaziz Al Saud and President Franklin D. Roosevelt, highlighting the long-standing diplomatic relationship between the two nations. The article notes that the setting and events reflected Mr. Trump's tastes and desires, with gilded decor and a performance of Lee Greenwood's "God Bless the U.S.A."</p>
