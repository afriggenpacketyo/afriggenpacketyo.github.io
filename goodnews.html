The Oakley Meta HSTN features Oakley's PRIZM Lens technology for enhanced vision in varying light conditions, along with improved battery life and camera capabilities compared to the Ray-Ban Meta glasses.

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners are considering home equity loans and HELOCs, but it's crucial to calculate repayment costs due to foreclosure risks. Currently, rates for both are similar, but HELOCs have variable rates that can change, unlike fixed-rate home equity loans. The article provides calculations based on different scenarios, including rate increases and decreases, to help borrowers make informed decisions. Borrowers should compare offers carefully to ensure borrowing success, and remember that both options can be refinanced in the future (not investment advice).</p>

The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill was approved by a majority of 314 to 291, following months of deliberation and scrutiny. The bill allows terminally ill people over 18, who meet specific criteria such as a life expectancy of six months or less, to end their lives with medical assistance.

          <p>A study analyzing 1.7 billion words online found that Americans swear more frequently than other English-speaking groups. Linguists assessed websites, blogs, and other sources, discovering that Americans use curse words 0.036% of the time. The study suggests that anonymity online may contribute to this trend, as cultural norms regarding swearing differ across various social situations. The British ranked second in the study, with Australians coming in third.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated that the central bank could consider cutting interest rates as early as July, as he doesn't anticipate tariffs significantly boosting inflation. Waller believes easing should begin to avoid a potential slowdown in the labor market. He suggested moving cautiously but starting the process, as the data has been fine during the six-month pause. These comments led to gains in stock market futures, but it remains unclear whether Waller's position will garner broad support within the Federal Open Market Committee (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>In light of a recent incident involving a suspect impersonating a police officer, many Americans are questioning their legal rights when law enforcement knocks on their door. According to the Fourth Amendment, police need legal authority to enter a home, and individuals are not obligated to answer the door or let them in without a warrant. Texas law outlines exceptions for warrantless searches, including exigent circumstances like protecting life or preventing evidence destruction. If police knock without a warrant, remaining calm and polite while asserting the right to remain silent is advisable.</p>
