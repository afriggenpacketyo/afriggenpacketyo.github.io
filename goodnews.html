Attendees, including EU officials and MEPs showing solidarity, risked fines and potential prison sentences for organizers. Participants expressed their desire for a diverse and tolerant country, marching for fundamental rights and the freedom to love in the face of mounting pressure from the nationalist conservative government.</p>

          <p>Americans may see relief at the pump this summer, as petroleum analysts predict the lowest gas prices in years. Experts suggest the national average could fall below $3 per gallon by September, making it the most affordable summer for fuel since 2021. This downward trend is attributed to factors like the de-escalation of conflict in the Middle East, increased production from refineries, and a typical softening of consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. Despite a recent spike, the overall forecast points toward a sustained, slow decline in prices throughout the season. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Supreme Court Ruling Ends Use of Nationwide Injunctions by Federal Courts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-28 08:03:10 EDT</div>

Casa*, a case concerning an executive order on birthright citizenship. Writing for the majority, Justice Amy Coney Barrett argued that such broad injunctions, which halt a policy for everyone in the country, have no historical basis in judicial authority. This analysis explains that while the decision is a major shift in judicial practice, other legal tools like class actions and complete relief for plaintiffs may still allow for similarly wide-reaching outcomes.</p>
