          <p>Nissan is recalling more than 480,000 vehicles across the U.S. and Canada due to a manufacturing defect that could lead to sudden engine failure. The recall affects several popular models, including the Altima, Rogue, and Infiniti QX50, equipped with specific turbo engines where bearing failures can occur. Drivers may notice abnormal engine noise or see warning lights as preliminary signs of the issue. Dealers will inspect the engines for metal debris and will repair or replace them free of charge to resolve the safety risk.</p>

          <h2>New Spending Bill Introduces Four Temporary Tax Breaks Set to Expire in 2028</h2>

          <p>President Trump's newly passed spending bill includes several temporary tax breaks that are scheduled to expire at the end of his term in 2028. Among these are new federal income tax deductions for tips earned by service workers and for overtime pay, both of which are capped and phase out at higher incomes. The bill also allows a deduction for interest on new auto loans and establishes "Trump accounts," a new savings vehicle for children with a one-time government deposit. These provisions offer short-term relief but add to the long-term fiscal uncertainty of the legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Indian cricket captain Shubman Gill scored a monumental 269 runs, leaving England in a precarious position on day two of the second Test at Edgbaston. Gill's performance, the highest score by an Indian batter in England, propelled his team to a total of 587. In response, England's top order collapsed, slumping to 77-3 by the close of play as India's bowlers took control. With a massive first-innings lead, India is in a commanding position to level the series, while England faces an extremely difficult task to salvage the match.</p>

          <p>The United States economy added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding economists' predictions and demonstrating the labor market's continued resilience despite broader economic uncertainty. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, its lowest level since February, with significant job growth seen in the government and health care sectors. The strong report suggests the Federal Reserve may delay interest rate cuts as it monitors the economic impact of new tariffs. The numbers indicate a solid footing for the job market, though economists still anticipate a slowdown later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Average mortgage rates have fallen for the fifth consecutive week, reaching 6.67% for a 30-year fixed loan, providing a glimmer of hope for prospective homebuyers. This downward trend comes amid market expectations that the Federal Reserve may cut its benchmark interest rate later this year, potentially in September. Experts advise current buyers to prepare by checking their credit, researching real estate agents, and securing mortgage pre-approval to be competitive. The sustained drop could signal a more favorable borrowing environment in the coming months for the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Review: 'Nobu' Documentary Focuses More on Brand Than Culinary Experience</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new documentary titled "Nobu" chronicles the life and career of celebrated sushi master Nobu Matsuhisa, but the film often feels more like a commercial for his global brand than an intimate profile. The review notes that while the documentary covers his humble beginnings, family life, and early struggles, it excels when showing his meticulous pursuit of quality and the high-stakes world of his restaurant empire. However, the film is criticized for lacking a deeper exploration of the communal dining experience and the specifics of Matsuhisa's culinary genius, which made his restaurants a phenomenon.</p>
