          <h2>President Trump Signals U.S. Tariffs on Chinese Goods Are 'Not Sustainable' Ahead of New Trade Talks</h2>

          <p>President Donald Trump has described the cumulative U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods as 'not sustainable,' even while defending the decision to impose them as a necessary response to Chinese trade practices. This statement comes as U.S. and Chinese officials prepare for a new round of trade negotiations, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent expected to meet with Vice Premier He Lifeng. The talks aim to de-escalate the ongoing trade conflict, which has seen both nations impose retaliatory measures, including recent Chinese export controls on rare-earth elements.

          <p>A study in North America indicates that the Galleri blood test can successfully detect more than 50 different types of cancer, potentially revolutionizing early diagnosis. The trial, involving 25,000 adults, found that the test identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with cancer later confirmed in 62% of those positive cases. Crucially, more than half of the cancers were found at an early stage, and three-quarters were types that currently have no routine screening program. The test, which detects fragments of cancerous DNA in the blood, is now undergoing a large-scale trial with the NHS in England.</p>

          <p>A 31-year-old woman from Newport, Wales, discovered she had a large, cancerous tumor on her kidney after a seemingly minor accident during a holiday weekend. Charlotte Morjaria sought medical attention for what she believed was a broken rib after being playfully picked up during a game, but a CT scan revealed the hidden tumor. Doctors diagnosed her with a rare form of kidney cancer that had produced only subtle symptoms, which she had attributed to other causes. Following surgery to remove her kidney, she is now cancer-free but requires lifelong monitoring, crediting the holiday mishap with saving her life.</p>

          <p>A man in England discovered his family's hidden history after finding a suitcase belonging to his late father, who he had known as an Anglican Englishman. The case revealed his father was born Peter Eisner, a member of a wealthy Jewish family in pre-war Germany whose vast industrial fortune, worth billions today, was stolen under Nazi rule. The documents led to a decade-long investigation, uncovering a story of dispossession, flight, and the murder of relatives in the Holocaust. The journey has resulted in the successful restitution of some stolen artwork, reconnecting the family with its lost heritage.</p>
