          <p>Pupils in Edinburgh were cut off from revision resources due to an attempted cyber attack on the council's education department. Staff identified a suspicious meeting invitation as a spear-phishing attempt, leading to the precautionary reset of all student passwords. While the council assures that no data was compromised, the incident disrupted students preparing for upcoming exams. Priority support is being given to students currently sitting exams, and alternative arrangements have been made for accessing revision materials.</p>

          <p>Lee Zeldin, the first Jewish administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, affixed a mezuza to his office door, prompting praise from some Jewish leaders. However, Jewish environmental activists criticized Zeldin's role in weakening environmental regulations, citing the Jewish value of repairing the world (tikkun olam). Zeldin defended his actions, stating his policies are based on law, obligations, and science, not religious interpretations. The event sparked a debate about the intersection of faith and environmental policymaking, with some defending Zeldin's actions and others questioning the appropriateness of a public display of religiosity by a political figure.</p>

          <p>A stage adaptation of Yann Martel's "Life of Pi" is reviewed as a marvelously inventive and profound theatrical experience, succeeding through magical simplicity rather than technological thrills. The story revolves around Pi Patel, a 17-year-old boy who survives at sea after a shipwreck, accompanied by animals from his father's zoo. The staging transitions dreamlike between the hospital where Pi recounts his story and his childhood in India, using scenic design, video animation, and puppetry to create a captivating world. The play explores themes of belief, overcoming tragedy, and the power of imagination.</p>

          <p>President Trump's new trade pact with the U.K. is being viewed with skepticism by some experts, who suggest that it signals the continuation of high tariffs. While the deal offers some concessions, a 10% tariff remains in place on U.K. imports, which is higher than the pre-Trump effective tariff rate. Economists warn that even with new trade deals, the average tariff rate will remain high, potentially leading to higher costs for businesses and consumers. Uncertainty over the level and duration of tariffs continues to pose significant risks to businesses.</p>
