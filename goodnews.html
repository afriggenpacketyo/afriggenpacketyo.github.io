          <p>Negotiating teams from the U.S. and China concluded two days of trade talks in Switzerland, noting "substantial progress" amid ongoing tensions. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng indicated the creation of a new consultation mechanism involving senior officials. While both sides acknowledged remaining friction, they described the atmosphere as collegial and constructive. Investors are likely to react positively to the news, though businesses await more detailed information to make informed decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A direct comparison of weight-loss drugs Mounjaro and Wegovy reveals Mounjaro to be more effective, with a 20% weight reduction compared to Wegovy's 14% after 72 weeks. The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals. Mounjaro flips two appetite switches in the brain, while Wegovy flips only one, leading to the difference in effectiveness. Researchers suggest both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may benefit those needing to lose the most weight.</p>

          <p>A 14th-century Buddhist statue, stolen in October 2012 and taken to South Korea, was returned to a Japanese temple on Monday. The statue, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea to representatives of the Japanese temple. The artifact is designated as a cultural asset by the prefecture. South Korean authorities arrested the thieves, but Buseoksa Temple filed a lawsuit claiming the statue had been plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago. In 2023, South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership, and return procedures were completed in January.</p>

A digital bridge circumvents spinal cord injuries, sending signals wirelessly from the brain to intact parts of the spinal cord. This technology, developed by NeuroRestore, aims to restore not only walking but also bowel and bladder control, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation. Early clinical trials also show promise in helping people with Parkinson's Disease regain mobility.</p>
