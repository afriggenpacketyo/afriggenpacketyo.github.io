          <p>Police in Budapest have decided against pursuing legal action against individuals who participated in the city's prohibited Pride parade in late June. The decision alleviates fears that participants could face fines and organizers, including Budapest's liberal mayor Gergely Karacsony, could face prison time. Despite a government ban under Prime Minister Viktor Orban's anti-LGBTQ+ agenda, the event drew a record crowd of over 200,000 people. The mayor had declared the parade an official municipal event to circumvent the state-level prohibition.</p>

          <p>Former New York Knicks player Derrick Rose has shared insights into Tom Thibodeau's mindset following his dismissal as the team's head coach. Rose, who has a long history playing under Thibodeau, mentioned that he spoke with his former coach and found him to be in good spirits. He noted that while the firing was surprising, Thibodeau is set to receive a substantial $30 million buyout. The Knicks, who made the playoffs in four of Thibodeau's five seasons, have since hired Mike Brown as their new head coach.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The ruling freezes a provision within the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targeted organizations primarily involved in family planning and reproductive health that also provide abortions. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the law was an unconstitutional attempt to single out the organization. The group warned that losing federal funding would force the closure of health centers, particularly in underserved areas, and disrupt access to non-abortion services.</p>

          <p>King Charles III is taking a central role in reinforcing the UK's relationship with France during President Emmanuel Macron's state visit, the first by an EU leader since Brexit. The visit, filled with royal pageantry, is seen as a crucial "soft power" opportunity to reset ties that were strained by Brexit and to address shared challenges like migration and support for Ukraine. Commentators note that the King, a fluent French speaker and experienced diplomat, is more than a figurehead in these efforts. The trip aims to reaffirm the strategic partnership between the two nuclear powers at a time of geopolitical uncertainty.</p>

          <p>While the global market for luxury goods is experiencing a slump, sales in Singapore are projected to grow by 7 percent this year, reaching nearly $11 billion. This growth positions the island nation as a standout market in Southeast Asia, outpacing regional hubs like China and South Korea. The boom is attributed to Singapore's stability, which has attracted a strong base of wealthy residents, with the country seeing a 64 percent increase in millionaires over the last decade. As a result, luxury brands are increasingly using Singapore as a key market for new store openings and product launches. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries, suggesting the figures are likely not final. He argued that the administration's tariff numbers often serve as a starting point for negotiations with nations that need access to U.S. markets. Cramer noted the administration's history of postponing or reducing tariffs, suggesting the ultimate goal may be to increase U.S. exports rather than to implement the steep duties as announced. He cautioned against major selling, believing the market has already factored in the mercurial nature of these trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats have introduced an amendment to the UK's Football Governance Bill that would require at least 10 Premier League games per season to be broadcast on free-to-air television. The proposal also includes making the League Cup Final and the major English Football League play-off finals freely available to the public. The party argues that the "jewel in the crown of British football" has been locked behind expensive paywalls for too long, citing the high cost of subscription packages for fans. The government's Sports Minister has previously expressed reluctance to have the new football regulator intervene in commercial broadcast deals.</p>

          <p>Guizhou, historically one of China's poorest provinces, is aiming to play a key role in the country's national economic strategy amidst ongoing trade tensions. Provincial leaders are leveraging the "strategic hinterland strategy," a concept introduced in late 2023 as part of the nation's 2026-2030 development plan. The goal is to utilize the province's comparative advantages to serve the broader national interest, effectively turning inland regions into secure and vital economic zones. This initiative is part of a larger effort to reshape China's industrial and economic landscape in response to external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to ban employers from using non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) to silence victims of workplace sexual misconduct, harassment, or discrimination. An amendment to the Employment Rights Bill will render any such confidentiality clauses void, allowing workers to speak out about their experiences. The move follows years of campaigning by activists like Zelda Perkins, who broke her NDA to speak out against Harvey Weinstein. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated it was time to "stamp this practice out," bringing the UK in line with other countries that have enacted similar protections for workers.</p>
