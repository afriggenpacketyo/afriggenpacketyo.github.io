          <p>SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has declared his company is "all in" on OpenAI, viewing it as a cornerstone for his vision of creating "artificial superintelligence" (ASI). Son revealed he had wanted to be OpenAI's primary backer before Microsoft, expressing a belief that the AI firm will eventually become the world's most valuable company. Despite potential friction between OpenAI and Microsoft, Son plans to deepen SoftBank's relationship with the AI leader. This commitment is part of a broader strategy to position SoftBank, alongside its chip company Arm, at the forefront of the ASI era within the next decade.</p>

          <p>Twelve years after the 2013 British and Irish Lions tour of Australia, former Wales winger George North reflects on one of its most iconic moments. North famously lifted his opponent, Israel Folau, onto his shoulders during a powerful run in the second Test, a moment that has become part of Lions folklore. Now 33 and playing in France, North recalls the 2013 tour as the best rugby he ever played, an experience that elevated his career. He fondly remembers the unique honor and responsibility of wearing the Lions jersey and the special connection he shares with fans over that memorable series.</p>

This comes alongside a new pledge for member nations to more than double defense spending to 5% of their GDP by 2035, a move strongly advocated by U.S. President Donald Trump. These initiatives are set to create significant opportunities for defense and space companies, particularly in areas like communication, surveillance, and intelligence.

While they champion the ecological benefits of beavers, such as flood mitigation and water purification, the National Farmers Union has condemned the illegal releases as irresponsible.

Professor Jin Keyu of HKUST argued that China will not become a rich country until it becomes a major consumer nation, warning that its current production-heavy model could create trade friction globally. The experts suggested that for sustainable and harmonious growth, China must boost internal demand.
