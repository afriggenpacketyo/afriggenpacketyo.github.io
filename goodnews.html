          <p>A video from a roller-skating rink in China's Hunan province captures a chaotic scene where a single woman's fall triggered a massive pile-up involving numerous other skaters. The footage shows the initial skater losing her balance, leading to a domino effect as others behind her are unable to stop in time. The incident resulted in a large group of people entangled on the floor of the rink. The brief article does not provide details on whether any serious injuries occurred as a result of the mass collision.</p>

          <p>A recent series of diplomatic meetings hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping has highlighted Beijing's foreign policy focus on promoting a multipolar world order and strengthening economic cooperation. In nearly all discussions with foreign leaders, Xi emphasized the importance of upholding multilateralism and the United Nations-centered international system. These remarks are seen as veiled criticisms of the United States and its unilateral actions, such as tariff disputes. This stance was formally adopted in the Tianjin Declaration, reinforcing China's effort to position itself as a champion for an alternative to a US-dominated global framework.</p>

          <p>This feature explores the dilemma faced by owners of aging vehicles, using the author's 20-year-old Chrysler minivan as a case study. As cars last longer but eventually become unreliable and costly to repair, owners must decide the best course of action. Options range from selling for a low price, donating to a charity that could repair it for a family in need, or sending it to an environmentally certified salvage yard. The article details the recycling process, where vehicles are demanufactured, with fluids, valuable parts, and metals salvaged for reuse, offering a form of automotive afterlife that keeps materials out of landfills.</p>

          <p>The renowned bookstore "Booked Up," founded by the late author Larry McMurtry in his hometown of Archer City, Texas, has been reborn as the Larry McMurtry Literary Center. After McMurtry's death in 2021, the store closed, but it has now reopened with the goal of preserving his vast book collection and creating a destination for writers and literary tourists. The center aims to perpetuate the legacy of the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of "Lonesome Dove," who sought to transform the small town into a major book hub. Local merchants are hopeful the center's revival will bring back the global visitors the original bookstore once attracted.</p>

          <p>A new labor market analysis reveals that job postings requiring at least one AI skill offer salaries that are, on average, 28% higher than those without, translating to an annual premium of nearly $18,000. The study found that this demand is not limited to the tech sector; since 2022, non-tech roles mentioning generative AI skills have increased by 800%, with marketing and public relations being the second-largest sector seeking such talent. Even general proficiency with tools like ChatGPT or Microsoft Copilot is becoming a valuable differentiator, indicating that AI literacy is increasingly essential across a wide range of industries and career levels.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 04:21:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Nasdaq stock exchange has proposed new listing rules that would make it more difficult for small Chinese companies to go public in the U.S., responding to a wave of microcap IPOs that have raised concerns. Under the proposed changes, companies operating primarily in China would need to raise at least $25 million in their IPO. The exchange noted that these smaller listings pose greater risks to U.S. investors due to compliance issues and the difficulty of taking legal action against potential market manipulation. The move is seen as a way to instill more confidence in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A patient safety initiative known as "Martha's Rule" will be rolled out to all acute hospitals across England, allowing patients and their families to request an urgent second opinion from a critical care team if they fear their concerns are being ignored. The rule was established following a campaign by the parents of Martha Mills, a 13-year-old who died from sepsis after her family's warnings were dismissed. A pilot program at 143 hospitals has already seen nearly 5,000 calls, leading to hundreds of potentially life-saving interventions. Martha's mother welcomed the expansion, highlighting its role in fostering a more equal doctor-patient relationship.</p>
