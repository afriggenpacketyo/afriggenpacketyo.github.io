        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is expanding duty-free access for products from 53 African nations, a move seen as a significant diplomatic and economic victory. This policy contrasts sharply with recent U.S. actions, which include imposing higher tariffs, cutting foreign aid, and implementing restrictive visa measures for several African countries. Observers note that these developments are leading African nations to increasingly view China as a more reliable and beneficial international partner. The U.S. assumption that its humanitarian aid would guarantee goodwill is proving to be outdated in the face of these strategic shifts.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for its first commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor, the CFR-1000. This gigawatt-level reactor represents a move towards more fuel-efficient and sustainable nuclear power. The project, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to be operational after 2030. This development places China alongside other major nuclear powers like the U.S. and Russia, who are also actively developing advanced reactor technologies to meet future energy demands.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 win against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who had a run-scoring walk and a two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak with a double and a sacrifice fly. After a slump where the team averaged only three runs per game, this victory marked the seventh time in ten games they have scored five or more runs. The improved hitting provided solid backing for the pitching staff, which delivered a strong performance.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent from the United States, capitalizing on university funding cuts and stricter visa policies under the Trump administration. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates who are unable to complete their studies in the US. This influx of brainpower is expected to fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector and enhance its use of artificial intelligence in financial markets. This trend highlights a significant shift in the global competition for elite financial and technical expertise. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Inter Miami Owner Criticizes MLS for Suspending Lionel Messi</h2>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi and teammate Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension is a direct result of both players skipping the MLS All-Star game, for which they were selected. Mas called the punishment "draconian," stating the players don't understand why missing an exhibition match warrants a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's importance to the league but stated they had to enforce a long-standing policy, though he added the rule will be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>A salon owner in Leicester is preparing for a key intellectual property hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the salon 'nkd', is fighting to re-register her business's trademark, which L'Oréal opposes. The French firm argues that 'nkd' is too similar to its 'Naked' line of products by Urban Decay and would cause consumer confusion. After spending over £30,000 in legal fees and facing significant delays, Dowdeswell says she feels ready to continue her fight against the corporate giant.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a thriving population of certain insects, including butterflies, ladybirds, and wasps. The warm, dry conditions caused a boom in aphids, which in turn provided an abundant food source for their predators like ladybirds. Butterfly Conservation reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous species, a stark contrast to the record low numbers of the previous year. However, experts caution that the lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to drying wetland habitats.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, argued that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents illegally thwarted federal enforcement efforts. However, Judge Lindsay Jenkins ruled that the policies do not improperly regulate ICE operations and are protected by the Tenth Amendment. Chicago's mayor and the Illinois governor praised the ruling, stating that it affirms the city's right to focus its law enforcement resources on local needs.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the history and impact of the Hollywood blacklist, which began in 1947 with the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were jailed and blacklisted for refusing to answer the committee's questions. It showcases how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals like Ronald Reagan to name names, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The exhibit raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy.</p>

          <p>A feature article examines Donald Trump's unique relationship with golf, portraying it as a business venture, a networking tool, and a fiercely competitive pursuit, rather than just a leisurely pastime. The article notes that for Trump, who owns numerous courses worldwide, golf has served as a way to forge connections with politicians and foreign leaders, often in private settings away from media scrutiny. While his passion for the game is clear, his conduct on the course, including claims of cheating, is also discussed. The piece suggests that for those interacting with him, a tee time is often a transactional opportunity.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists is working to rescue the bighorn sheep population in Texas, which has been decimated by disease over the last five years. The disease spread from non-native animals brought into the region. In a major conservation effort, biologists captured and airlifted dozens of healthy sheep from the state's last disease-free herd to a new, isolated mountain range. A recent follow-up visit confirmed the mission's success, as the relocated herd has survived and is now growing with the birth of new lambs, offering hope for the species' future in the state.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent article explores whether people need to be strict about common health targets, such as drinking eight glasses of water or taking 10,000 steps a day. Experts suggest there is often wriggle room; for instance, the body's thirst mechanism is a reliable guide for hydration for most healthy individuals. However, when it comes to sleep, specialists are firm on the need for seven to nine hours for long-term health, citing risks of obesity, diabetes, and lower mortality. The consensus is that while benchmarks are useful guides, a balanced and consistent approach to overall health is more important than rigidly hitting every number.</p>
