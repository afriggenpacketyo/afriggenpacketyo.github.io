          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed performance as investors processed key economic news, including the Bank of Korea's decision to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second meeting in a row. South Korea's Kospi edged up, while the Kosdaq saw a slight dip, and the won strengthened against the dollar. Japan's Nikkei 225 also climbed, contrasting with declines in Hong Kong and mainland China. Corporate developments included Australian miner Lynas Rare Earths' plan for a discounted share sale and Qantas's shares soaring on strong earnings. Additionally, new U.S. tariffs on Indian exports impacted the Nifty 50, and Nvidia's robust earnings report kept Asian chip stocks in the spotlight, despite some data center revenue falling short.

          <p>South Korea's central bank maintained its policy rate at 2.5% for a second consecutive meeting, prioritizing the monitoring of housing prices and household debt in Seoul, which had seen earlier spikes. Despite this caution, the Bank of Korea upgraded its 2025 inflation forecast to 2% and its GDP growth forecast to 0.9%, citing a modest recovery in domestic demand and favorable export movements, though acknowledging potential impacts from U.S. tariffs. This monetary stability decision follows recent high-level trade agreements between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and U.S. President Donald Trump, which included substantial investment pledges from South Korean companies in the U.S. and a reduction in reciprocal tariffs for key South Korean exports.

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered his first ace-like pitching performance since resuming two-way duties, completing five full innings of one-run ball for the Dodgers in their 5-1 sweep of the Cincinnati Reds. Ohtani, who had previously struggled to go deep into games post-Tommy John surgery, employed a new, unpredictable strategy, utilizing a career-high number of curveballs and splitters to keep the Reds off-balance. This pivotal outing saw him record nine strikeouts and secure his first pitching win of the season, demonstrating the ability to navigate an opposing lineup multiple times. His performance is crucial for the Dodgers as they eye his potential role in a deep postseason rotation.</p>

          <p>USC has extended an amended, multi-year offer to Notre Dame, aiming to preserve their century-old football rivalry beyond the current season, according to USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen. The Trojans were initially hesitant to commit long-term due to College Football Playoff uncertainties and Big Ten travel demands, but Notre Dame's strong preference for a lasting agreement prompted the new proposal. The primary sticking point remains the game's date, with USC seeking to move it earlier in the season to better manage its conference schedule, while Notre Dame has less incentive to change the lucrative matchup. Negotiations are ongoing, with both sides expressing hope for a swift resolution.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has escalated to an estimated $850 million, marking it as the game's sixth-largest prize in history, with the winning numbers drawn as 9, 12, 22, 41, 61, and Powerball 25. The estimated cash value for a single winner opting for a lump sum is $383.7 million, prior to taxes. No winning tickets were reported for the preceding $750 million grand prize, which has significantly boosted ticket sales and public participation. With odds of winning the top prize at 1 in 292.2 million, the allure of such a substantial payout continues to capture national attention, with drawings held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense received a significant boost in a civil trial where a security guard alleges the rapper assaulted her in 2018. Testifying again, Cardi B denied touching, scratching, or spitting on the plaintiff, Emani Ellis, suggesting Ellis is seeking a $24 million payout. Crucially, the obstetrician and his receptionist, Tierra Malcolm, testified in Cardi B's favor, stating they did not see the rapper hit Ellis and that Malcolm herself was injured by Ellis. This testimony contradicts the security guard's claims of being cursed at, body-shamed, and scratched, potentially undermining the plaintiff's case as the defense concluded its presentation.</p>

          <p>Zhou Xiaochuan, former governor of China's central bank, has urged a cautious approach amid the global surge in stablecoin interest, advocating for a "multidimensional assessment" of their true utility and potential systemic risks. He warned against the "excessive use for asset speculation," which could trigger fraud and financial instability, noting that some industry players might leverage hype for quick valuations rather than sustainable business models. With the U.S. and Hong Kong developing regulatory frameworks, Zhou's comments underscore Beijing's vigilance regarding the potential for stablecoins to accumulate systemic risks detrimental to a healthy financial system.

          <p>A new NATO report confirms that all member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demands from U.S. President Donald Trump. Previously lagging nations like Spain, Italy, and Belgium have now reached this threshold. However, only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the new, higher target of 3.5% of GDP agreed upon in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitment must translate into actual military capability for effective deterrence.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, projecting over 50% sales growth for the current quarter, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure. The stock, which has surged significantly, dipped in extended trading as its data center revenue fell slightly short of estimates for the second consecutive period. Despite this, the data center business remains central to the global AI buildout, with the company expecting trillions in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Nvidia's growth is largely fueled by its GPU chips and networking parts, with Blackwell chip sales rising, and the company announced an additional $60 billion in share repurchases.
