          <p>Bitcoin briefly reached a new all-time high of over $124,000, while Ether came close to its own record before both cryptocurrencies experienced a downturn. The initial surge was fueled by a cooler-than-expected consumer inflation report, which raised hopes for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut. However, a subsequent report showing unexpectedly high wholesale inflation caused both digital assets and stock futures to fall. Analysts suggest the market is moving beyond speculative mania toward a phase of institutional adoption and validation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is expected to intensify into the Atlantic season's first hurricane and could reach major Category 3 strength by the weekend. While it is projected to pass north of Puerto Rico, bringing rain and rough surf, it is not currently forecast to make a direct landfall on the U.S. mainland. The storm's path is predicted to keep it over the ocean between Bermuda and the East Coast. However, it will generate a high risk of rip currents along the U.S. East Coast next week.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how certificates of deposit (CDs) can help savers protect their money's buying power against inflation, as top accounts currently offer high returns. It notes that while national average CD yields are modest, online banks often provide significantly higher rates due to lower overhead costs. Currently, short-term CDs, such as those with 6-month or 1-year terms, are offering the most competitive interest rates. The piece suggests strategies like laddering CDs to take advantage of the current inverted yield curve. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 12-year-old Glasgow pupil, Rebecca Young, has been named one of Time magazine's "Girls of the Year" for her invention designed to help homeless individuals. She created a solar-powered blanket that charges during the day and provides warmth at night. The idea, developed at a school engineering club, was turned into a working prototype by the firm Thales, with dozens now in use. For her achievement, Young was featured on a digital cover of Time and immortalized as a Lego mini-figure.</p>

          <p>China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, has stated that both nations are prepared to advance beyond stabilizing relations toward more productive economic cooperation. Speaking at a trade expo, he highlighted the potential for closer alignment in sectors like mining and manufacturing through technology sharing and joint exploration. The comments signal a significant thaw in relations after a period of tension that saw Beijing impose a series of trade curbs on Australian goods. These restrictions were lifted late last year, paving the way for renewed partnership.</p>

          <p>General Motors has unveiled the Cadillac Elevated Velocity, a concept car designed to showcase the future of the brand's all-electric luxury crossover lineup. The vehicle features a lifted design, 24-inch wheels, and multiple driving modes, including an autonomous "elevate mode" that transforms the interior into a recovery space. While concept cars are not intended for sale, they are used to gauge consumer interest and signal a brand's design direction. This follows GM's broader, though recently softened, goal of transitioning to an all-electric portfolio.</p>

          <p>Sky Sports is reportedly in the final stages of negotiating a new six-year contract to exclusively broadcast the US Open golf championship in the UK. The deal would see Sky fend off competition from streaming giant Netflix, which made a credible offer as it expands its presence in live sports. Securing the rights would solidify Sky's position as the primary home of televised golf in the UK, as it already holds rights for all other majors and major tours. This development reflects the increasing competition for premium sports content between traditional broadcasters and streaming services.</p>
