        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cartier owner Richemont reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter sales, driven by strong performance in its Jewellery Maisons division, which includes Cartier and Van Cleef & Arpels. The Swiss luxury group's revenue rose 7% year-on-year, exceeding analysts' forecasts. While the specialist watchmakers segment experienced declines, overall sales rose annually across all regions except Asia Pacific (ex. Japan). Richemont's chairman noted that ongoing global uncertainties would require agility and discipline, while BofA Global Research pointed to gold prices, U.S. tariffs, and foreign exchange fluctuations as key headwinds.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York indicates that some humanities majors are outperforming STEM fields in terms of employment prospects. Majors like nutrition, art history, and philosophy have lower unemployment rates compared to computer science and computer engineering. The shift reflects a rising demand for creative thinking and soft skills, especially with the increasing role of artificial intelligence. While STEM fields still offer high earning potential, the healthcare sector continues to show strong demand, with nursing majors experiencing very low unemployment.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential monthly payouts from a $50,000 annuity and its worth in retirement. A $50,000 annuity can provide monthly income ranging from $285 to $425, depending on age, gender, and contract details. While it may not cover all expenses, it can supplement other income sources and provide peace of mind with its predictability. The article advises understanding the terms and considering broader financial goals before committing, highlighting that annuities offer consistent income, but lack flexibility.

          <p>Canada's iconic Hudson Bay brand will survive after its intellectual property is sold to competitor Canadian Tire. The move comes after the Hudson Bay Company liquidated all its stores due to a shifting retail landscape and U.S. tariffs. The sale ensures the brand, which is over 350 years old and known for its striped wool blankets, will continue to exist even without physical stores. Demand for Hudson's Bay products surged as the company closed down, sparking hope for a comeback.</p>

          <p>Mike Novogratz described the nearly four-year and $25 million process of taking Galaxy Digital public in the United States as "unfair, infuriating," detailing challenges with the SEC and high auditing costs. Despite the difficulties, Novogratz rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq, marking the company's first trade on U.S. public markets. He expects auditing fees to drop significantly now that Galaxy is listed on the Nasdaq. The ordeal, Novogratz said, has strengthened the company, which was primarily funded through investment gains and trading.</p>
