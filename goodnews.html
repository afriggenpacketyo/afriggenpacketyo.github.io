          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attendance at the G7 summit in Canada offers a chance to mend strained ties between the two nations, after recent tensions over the killing of a Sikh activist. Relations deteriorated following Canada's accusations of Indian government involvement in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, allegations which India dismissed. Despite ongoing disagreements and unsolved investigations, there are hopes for improved relations due to strong trade, people-to-people ties, and a new Canadian prime minister, Mark Carney, who extended the invitation. Both countries are focusing on mutual interests such as economic cooperation and shared priorities, and the visit presents an opportunity for Modi to address global issues with world leaders.

          <p>The High Court dismissed a legal challenge against the government's policy of adding VAT to private school fees, a policy introduced on January 1st across the UK.

The government defended the policy, stating it would raise ¬£1.8 billion a year by 2029/30 to improve standards in the state sector. The court found that while the legislation interferes with some human rights, the government was entitled to balance the interests of those affected against the revenue raised for public services.
