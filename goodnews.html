          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has achieved a significant milestone by directly imaging a potential exoplanet for the first time since its 2021 launch. The celestial body, named TWA 7b, is described as a gas giant with a mass comparable to Saturn, orbiting a young star. Scientists utilized high-contrast imaging and a coronagraph to suppress the star's glare, revealing the faint planet. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly supports the conclusion that it is a newly discovered planet, marking a key advancement in our ability to observe worlds beyond our solar system.</p>

          <p>The upset primary win by Zohran Mamdani, a self-described Democratic Socialist, has intensified the ongoing debate within the Democratic Party over its future direction. Mamdani, 33, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, by campaigning on a progressive platform that included free child care and rent freezes, highlighting a generational and ideological shift. His victory has drawn both praise from progressive leaders and concern from moderate Democrats, who worry his platform is too extreme. The outcome in New York raises questions about whether this progressive, youth-driven approach is a viable national strategy for the party or an exception.</p>

          <p>New York City Mayor Eric Adams has officially launched his reelection campaign, framing the race as a choice between his "blue collar" record and the "empty promises" of his progressive rival, Zohran Mamdani. Speaking from City Hall, Adams highlighted his administration's achievements in reducing crime, creating jobs, and expanding housing. He contrasted his own background with that of Mamdani, whom he characterized as an inexperienced lawmaker from a privileged background. Adams, who is now running as an independent, aims to convince voters that his practical approach is more effective than his opponent's socialist-inspired policies.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is approaching a record high, demonstrating a remarkable recovery from a sharp decline in April that was triggered by tariff announcements. Analysts attribute the market's rebound to several factors, including easing concerns about trade disputes as negotiations have entered a quieter phase. Strong performance in the technology sector, led by giants like Nvidia, has also been a primary driver of the upward trend. Furthermore, investor optimism has been bolstered by the Federal Reserve's signals that it may implement interest rate cuts later in the year, suggesting a more accommodative monetary policy ahead.

          <p>The British government is reportedly set to announce a significant climbdown on its proposed welfare bill following pressure from over 100 rebel Labour MPs. According to sources, the deal will protect existing claimants of the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and the health element of Universal Credit from planned cuts. Instead, the reforms will only apply to future claimants, and a ¬£1 billion support plan will be fast-tracked. This marks a major U-turn for the government, which faced a potential defeat in the House of Commons without the concessions, and it is the third such reversal in a month.</p>

President Trump had made the initial, more definitive comments during an event promoting a separate government spending bill.

          <p>A California state appeals court has dismissed the remaining criminal charges against Diana Teran, a former top advisor to ex-L.A. County District Attorney George Gasc√≥n. Teran was accused of improperly downloading and using confidential police discipline records, but her defense argued the documents were public court records used for a legitimate purpose. The court ruled that her actions were not criminal, as the information was publicly available. The decision is a significant rebuke to the California Attorney General's office, which brought the politically charged prosecution that was a focal point in the recent district attorney election.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with an average credit card debt of around $8,000, debt forgiveness programs can seem like an appealing solution. However, this article advises taking several key steps before applying. Borrowers should first determine if they truly need such a program, as it can take years to complete and will damage their credit score. It is also crucial to explore all alternatives, such as debt management plans or consolidation loans, which may be more suitable. Finally, if forgiveness is the right path, individuals should carefully shop around for a legitimate and cost-effective servicer rather than rushing into the first available option.
