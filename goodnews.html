          <p>Maryland leaders have expressed their views on the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia to the U.S. to face federal charges after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador. Abrego Garcia, who illegally entered the U.S. in 2011, was deported in March but his case gained attention due to concerns about due process. Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Glenn Ivey, who advocated for his return, emphasized that the issue is about constitutional rights and ensuring due process for everyone in the United States. Abrego Garcia is accused of conspiracy to transport aliens and unlawfully transporting undocumented people, and his attorneys have denied allegations of gang ties.</p>

          <p>Arrests for illegal work in the UK have doubled in the past year, with immigration officers arresting over 6,400 people during raids at businesses. The government is focusing on employers who exploit undocumented migrants, subjecting them to poor conditions and low wages. Immigration Enforcement Director Eddy Montgomery stated that many migrants are deceived by smuggling gangs and face inhumane working conditions. The government is cracking down on illegal migration, with nearly 30,000 people returned over the past year, and tightening work visa regulations to address the issue.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved a $2.8 billion settlement that will allow U.S. colleges to pay athletes millions of dollars, marking a significant shift in college sports. The settlement, stemming from a lawsuit filed by Grant House, enables schools to share up to $20.5 million annually with athletes and provides $2.7 billion to former players who were previously barred from revenue sharing. This move professionalizes college athletics, impacting recruitment and potentially leading to program adjustments, while also raising concerns about roster limits and the future of Olympic sports. NCAA President Charlie Baker noted that the agreement opens a pathway to stabilize college sports.</p>

          <p>A federal judge approved the House v. NCAA settlement, ushering in a new era where colleges can directly pay athletes, capped initially at $20.5 million per school. The settlement also includes $2.75 billion for former athletes who were previously prohibited from earning money, and the NCAA President Charlie Baker called the change positive and overdue. This agreement arose from lawsuits challenging the tradition of amateurism, as top-level athletic departments generate substantial revenue from various sources. The settlement introduces a system for direct payments, roster limits, and a third-party clearinghouse to review licensing agreements, with potential legal challenges expected.</p>

          <p>A phone call between Chinese President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump has provided a potential respite for Asian countries caught between the two powers. The conversation, described as "very positive" by Trump, may ease the pressure on these nations to choose between prioritizing trade with China and navigating U.S. policies. Lee Seong-hyon, a senior fellow with the George H.W.
