          <p>The U.S. military is escalating its development of next-generation air combat capabilities by conducting advanced integration tests between crewed fighter jets and semi-autonomous drones. In a recent exercise, pilots in an F-16 and an F-15 each controlled two XQ-58A Valkyrie drones, testing the effectiveness of this "loyal wingman" concept in a training environment. This initiative is part of a broader strategy to maintain air supremacy, particularly in its technological race with China. The tests focus on real-time coordination and aim to leverage uncrewed platforms to augment the capabilities of traditional fighter aircraft in complex combat scenarios.</p>

          <p>The grounds of the South Carolina State Capitol will soon feature a monument honoring Robert Smalls, making it the first statue of a Black person to be erected at the site. Smalls was a formerly enslaved man who became a Civil War hero after commandeering a Confederate ship and delivering it to the Union, later serving as a U.S. Congressman. His statue will join those of several white historical figures, many of whom have connections to the Confederacy and the Jim Crow era. The move represents a significant step in diversifying the historical narratives represented in the state's public spaces.</p>

AI dating assistants like Rizz and Keepler help users craft compelling messages, suggest conversation topics, and even provide advice on how to handle being "ghosted." These tools aim to boost confidence and help users stand out in a crowded digital dating scene. While some users find the technology helpful for initiating conversations, the trend raises questions about authenticity and the risk of over-reliance on AI as a substitute for genuine human connection.</p>

          <p>American sprinter Noah Lyles secured a significant victory in the men's 200m at the Diamond League meet in Monaco, defeating his rival and reigning Olympic champion Letsile Tebogo of Botswana. Lyles, who had been dealing with health issues and had not competed in a 200m race for nearly a year, impressively won with a time of 19.88 seconds. The race was a notable comeback for Lyles, who finished third behind Tebogo at last year's Olympics. The win demonstrates that Lyles remains a top contender in the event ahead of future competitions.</p>

          <p>American tennis player Amanda Anisimova has reached her first Grand Slam final at Wimbledon, marking a remarkable comeback to the sport. Anisimova, once a teenage prodigy, took an indefinite break from tennis in 2023 to address burnout and mental health struggles, a step she said was necessary for her well-being. During her time away, she lived a more normal life and was warned she might never return to the top of the sport. Her journey to the final, which included a semifinal victory over the world's top-ranked player, is a testament to her resilience and the importance of prioritizing mental health.</p>

          <p>The price of Bitcoin has soared to a new record high, briefly surpassing $118,000, driven by a massive influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, Bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single day of inflows for the year, totaling $1.18 billion. This rally was also fueled by significant short liquidations and broader market optimism about a potentially more dovish Federal Reserve policy in the future. The sustained institutional buying and favorable macro-environmental expectations continue to propel the leading cryptocurrency to unprecedented price levels. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Hampshire judge has denied TikTok's motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state, which alleges the company uses manipulative and addictive design features that exploit children and teens. The state's attorney general argues that TikTok is intentionally designed to maximize engagement among young users to increase their exposure to ads and e-commerce. The judge ruled the state's claims were specific enough to proceed, focusing on the app's allegedly dangerous features rather than its user-generated content. This case is one of several recent legal challenges by states targeting the design and safety policies of major tech platforms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions on journalists covering protests. The ruling comes in response to a lawsuit by press rights organizations, which argued that LAPD officers have deliberately targeted and injured reporters during recent demonstrations against the administration's immigration policies. The judge cited clear evidence of officers targeting identifiable members of the press who posed no threat. The order forbids police from assaulting or obstructing journalists and requires them to allow media access to protest areas.</p>
