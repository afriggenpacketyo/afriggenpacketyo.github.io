          <p>The Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry is considering the nomination of Michael Boren to lead the U.S. Forest Service, despite his history of conflicts with the agency. Boren, an investment consultant and ranch owner, has had disputes with the Forest Service regarding building a cabin, diverting a stream, and mining claims within the Sawtooth National Forest. During the hearing, Boren addressed these disputes, acknowledging some disagreements but emphasizing his commitment to making forest management more resilient and healthy. If confirmed, Boren would be responsible for day-to-day operations at the U.S. Forest Service, managing approximately 200 million acres of public land.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Asia-Pacific leaders are increasingly employing triangular diplomacy, a strategy reminiscent of Cold War realpolitik, to balance and maneuver between major powers. This approach involves leveraging trade, investment, and technology to build influence and reduce dependency without fully committing to any single side. While triangular diplomacy offers agility and tactical scope, it also carries the risk of entanglements that could escalate instability. The article draws parallels to Henry Kissinger's use of triangular diplomacy in the 1970s to bolster America's power by exploiting the Sino-Soviet rivalry.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve Board has announced the lifting of the $1.95 trillion asset cap imposed on Wells Fargo since February 2018, a punishment for past misdeeds. This restriction had prevented the bank from growing key business lines for years, but the removal now allows Wells Fargo to increase deposits, expand loan activity, and grow its dealmaking division. CEO Charlie Scharf and his team have worked to improve risk and controls, leading to the clearing of 14 consent orders. While other elements of the 2018 order remain in place, the removal of the asset cap is a significant milestone for the bank and its shareholders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 4-year-old girl from Bakersfield with a rare medical condition has been granted humanitarian protection from deportation, allowing her to continue receiving lifesaving treatment in the United States. The girl, identified as S.G.V., and her parents, who are from Mexico, had their legal protections rescinded by the Trump administration, leaving them vulnerable to deportation. Dozens of lawmakers advocated on her behalf, citing her doctor's warning that she could die within days of losing medical care.

          <p>The Trump administration has backed off its effort to collect data on food stamp recipients in response to a federal lawsuit. The Agriculture Department stated that it would refrain, for now, from demanding that states turn over the personal information of people receiving assistance. This decision marks a reversal of the administration's previous stance on data collection and comes amid concerns about privacy and potential misuse of information. The lawsuit challenged the legality of the data collection effort and argued that it would disproportionately harm vulnerable populations.</p>
