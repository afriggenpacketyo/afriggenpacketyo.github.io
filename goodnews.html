          <p>Hurricane Iona has formed in the central Pacific, becoming the first of the season in that region. Currently a Category 1 storm, it is expected to strengthen to Category 2 before gradually weakening later in the week. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are confident that the storm will remain well south of the Hawaiian Islands, posing no immediate threat to land as it moves westward. The eastern Pacific has already experienced several named storms this season.</p>

          <p>China's aviation regulator is surveying its airlines about their future needs for Boeing jets, signaling a potential boost in orders if US-China trade relations improve. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) specifically inquired about overdue Boeing orders and future fleet plans. This development coincides with a meeting between the CAAC director and a Boeing senior vice-president, where they discussed expanding cooperation. Industry insiders suggest that Boeing could be a primary beneficiary of any warming in diplomatic and trade ties between the two nations.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Court judge has rejected a lawsuit filed by investment fund Azoria Capital that sought to force the Federal Reserve to open its interest rate-setting meetings to the public. The judge ruled that the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) is not subject to the "Sunshine Act" that requires open meetings for government agencies. During the hearing, the judge questioned if the lawsuit, filed by a firm whose CEO is a Trump ally, was a publicity stunt. The decision upholds the FOMC's long-standing practice of conducting its policy meetings in private.</p>

CEA Industries plans to raise $500 million through a private placement to fund the crypto acquisition. The move reflects a growing trend of companies looking to alternative assets to boost shareholder value, signaling increasing speculative behavior in the current bullish market.

This massive energy purchase is a key component of the broader trade pact, which also imposes a 15% tariff on most EU exports to the U.S. The development is seen as a significant boost for the American energy sector.

An internal memo revealed that of the 1.89 billion data requests in June, only 13% were directly initiated by customers for transactions. The bank argues it bears the rising costs of infrastructure and fraud associated with these API calls and is preparing to charge fees for this access. Plaid defended the practice, stating the data pulls are standard for providing critical services like fraud alerts to consumers who have granted permission.</p>

While lower rates historically boost gold prices, the metal has recently surged due to inflation and geopolitical concerns, trading near $3,332 per ounce. Analysts suggest that while a rate cut is not expected this week, comments from the Fed, future inflation data, and global tensions could still influence prices. Given the current stability, some experts suggest it may be a strategic time for investors to consider adding gold to their portfolios. (not investment advice)</p>

The order blocks a provision in a recent bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by ending its Medicaid payments for one year. In her ruling, Judge Indira Talwani stated that restricting access to care at Planned Parenthood would likely lead to adverse health consequences, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. The ruling provides a significant, albeit temporary, victory for the reproductive health organization amid numerous political and legal battles.</p>
