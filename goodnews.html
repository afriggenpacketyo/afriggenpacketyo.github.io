          <p>Rithy Panh's historical drama, "Meeting With Pol Pot," explores the Khmer Rouge regime through the experiences of Western journalists invited to witness their proclaimed agrarian utopia. The film follows French reporter Lise, modeled after Elizabeth Becker, and her colleagues as they navigate a carefully constructed facade. As Lise questions the regime's pretense, the situation becomes increasingly tense, revealing the cruel realities hidden beneath the surface. Panh uses clay figurines and archival footage to maintain intimacy between rendering and reality, highlighting the value and dangers of journalism in confronting and exposing facades.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court sided with civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state. Republicans, including President Trump, supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. The ruling is expected to be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, potentially testing the conservative court's stance on religion and government.</p>
