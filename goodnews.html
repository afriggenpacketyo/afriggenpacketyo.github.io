          <p>An NYU professor and CEO suggests a powerful question for job interviews to uncover a company's authentic values. By asking, "What kind of person should not work at this company?", candidates can elicit unrehearsed and revealing answers that cut through corporate platitudes about culture. The article argues this method helps individuals, most of whom are unclear on their own core values, find a workplace that genuinely aligns with their principles. This approach is best used late in the interview process to ensure a good rapport has been established.</p>

          <p>Ford announced that its vehicle sales surged by 14.2% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, far exceeding the industry's projected 1.4% increase. The growth was driven by strong sales of its F-Series trucks, which had their best second quarter since 2019, and a notable rise in hybrid vehicle purchases. While overall "electrified" vehicle sales, including hybrids, were up, sales of pure electric vehicles (EVs) saw a significant 31.4% decline during the same period.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a significant spike in U.S. inflation, with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists suggest several reasons for this, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using logistical loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, experts caution that these are likely short-term buffers and that price increases could still materialize in the latter half of the year as these strategies become unsustainable and higher import costs work through the supply chain.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core" while examining the broader trend of kink and BDSM becoming a mainstream literary genre. It notes a shift from a taboo subject to an established category with its own nonfiction aisle dedicated to demystifying the practices. The review praises Newell's novel for its ambitious and psychologically perceptive exploration of a San Francisco stripper's life, arguing that such fiction effectively captures the complex emotions and intellect behind kink. The piece contrasts this with nonfiction's tendency to focus on a "respectability kink" by normalizing transgressive behaviors.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Marks & Spencer, Stuart Machin, announced that the retailer's online shopping services should be fully operational within four weeks following a major cyber-attack. The attack in April disrupted M&S systems, halting online orders and impacting in-store stock levels, with an estimated profit hit of ¬£300 million. While online ordering has partially resumed, key services like "click and collect" remain offline. The company's next focus will be restoring its main Castle Donington distribution center, with hopes of putting the majority of the disruption behind them by August.</p>
