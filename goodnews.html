          <p>Standard Chartered reported first-quarter profits surpassing expectations, driven by robust growth in wealth management and global markets. The bank's profit before taxation rose to $2.103 billion, up from $1.91 billion in the same period last year. CEO Bill Winters highlighted the double-digit income growth in Wealth Solutions, Global Markets, and Global Banking as key factors. While the earnings do not fully reflect the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, the bank remains confident in its ability to improve returns through cost-saving initiatives and strategic growth areas.

          <p>Marine biologists with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) are surveying fish populations in Douglas Lake, Tennessee, for the first time since Hurricane Helene caused debris to cover waterways seven months ago. The data collected will help determine the hurricane's impact on the sport fish population by comparing findings to previous surveys. Scientists are examining fish for defects, measuring and weighing them to assess the overall health and stability of the aquatic ecosystem, which is vital to the region's tourism industry.

          <p>Detailed plans for a large military parade on Donald Trump's birthday have emerged, potentially involving thousands of soldiers, hundreds of tanks, and helicopters. The event, proposed to mark the US Army's 250th anniversary, would feature army bands, parachute jumps, historical vehicles, a concert, and fireworks. However, the plans have raised concerns about potential damage to Washington DC's roads and the high costs associated with moving military vehicles and accommodating personnel. Washington DC's mayor has warned that tanks rolling through the streets would not be good.</p>

          <p>Japan's average unemployment rate in fiscal 2024 fell to 2.5 percent, marking the first improvement in two years amid a labor shortage, according to government data. The number of unemployed people decreased, while the number of those with jobs grew to the highest level since 1953. The job availability ratio, however, decreased slightly but remained above 1.00, indicating a tight labor market. Despite the dip in job openings data, economists suggest the labor shortage is likely to persist, with certain sectors experiencing job growth while others see declines.</p>

          <p>Apple announced that iPhones sold in the US will no longer be sourced from China, as the tech giant tries to mitigate the impact of Donald Trump's tariffs. Most iPhones will now be sourced from India, with iPads coming from Vietnam, to prevent dramatic price rises for American consumers. CEO Tim Cook estimates tariffs will add ¬£677m in costs during the current quarter, assuming Trump's policies remain unchanged. The company's reliance on Chinese factories made it particularly vulnerable to the impact of the trade war.</p>
