          <p>Swedish fintech firm Klarna saw its shares rise by 15% during its New York Stock Exchange debut, closing at $45.82 after pricing its IPO above the anticipated range. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, raised $1.37 billion, valuing it at approximately $17.3 billion. This successful listing signals strong investor appetite for new tech offerings and will test Wall Street's confidence as Klarna expands into banking services amidst potential regulatory scrutiny in markets like the U.K.</p>

          <p>A recent Morgan Stanley report reveals a significant shift in sentiment, with over 90% of surveyed U.S. investors expressing a willingness to increase their exposure to Chinese stocks, the highest level since 2021. This renewed interest extends beyond U.S.-listed equities to the onshore A-share market, driven by China's leadership in sectors like robotics and biotech, as well as efforts to stabilize its economy. While the bank notes that the capital reallocation is just beginning, it suggests a potential reversal of the multi-year retreat from Chinese markets by American funds. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's People's Liberation Army Rocket Force has banned 74 bid evaluation experts and 116 suppliers from its procurement projects following an extensive corruption investigation. The disciplinary action, announced on a military procurement network, is part of a broader anti-corruption campaign within the military's equipment sector that intensified after the 2023 downfall of former defence minister Li Shangfu. The Rocket Force is a critical branch of the PLA, responsible for managing China's strategic nuclear missile arsenal, making integrity in its supply chain a high-priority issue for the state.</p>

Mookie Betts led the offense with a four-for-five performance, including a grand slam, while pitcher Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings with 11 strikeouts. However, the victory was tempered by an injury concern, as catcher Will Smith was a late scratch from the lineup due to swelling in his hand, delaying the team's goal of fielding a fully healthy roster as the season's end approaches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Everton has undergone a significant revival, moving from a relegation battle to fifth place in the Premier League, driven by a record-breaking summer of recruitment. The club's net spending of £97 million on nine new players is its highest ever for a summer window, a stark contrast to previous years of financial constraint due to profit and sustainability rules. This transformation has been enabled by a takeover from the Friedkin Group, which stabilized the club's finances, and a new transfer strategy focused on strategic signings to build a competitive squad.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has stated that the league requires clear evidence of wrongdoing before it would discipline the Los Angeles Clippers or owner Steve Ballmer over allegations of salary cap circumvention. The investigation centers on claims that a $28 million endorsement deal for star Kawhi Leonard from a firm called Aspiration was orchestrated by the team to provide improper compensation. Silver emphasized that the burden of proof is on the league and that he would be reluctant to act based on a "mere appearance of impropriety," ensuring a fair and thorough process.</p>

          <p>Amid a sector-wide slump, high-end luxury brands such as Louis Vuitton and Prada are diversifying their product lines with more accessible items like cosmetics and bag charms. Louis Vuitton recently launched a beauty collection featuring $160 lipsticks, aiming to attract a broader, younger consumer base without diluting the exclusivity of its core products. This strategy, sometimes called "treatonomics," allows aspirational shoppers to engage with the brand at a lower price point, a tactic previously used during periods of economic softness to maintain relevance and build long-term customer loyalty.</p>

This spike was linked to a report that OpenAI is entering a massive $300 billion cloud-computing deal with Oracle, a company with which SoftBank has a high-profile technology partnership, sparking investor enthusiasm for related stocks.

This push, part of the country's 14th five-year plan, aims to bolster energy security and reduce reliance on imports for critical resources like lithium, copper, and uranium. The discoveries, which include 10 large oilfields and 19 major gas fields, are crucial for supporting China's economic development and its dominance in new technology supply chains amid rising geopolitical tensions.</p>

In recent months, Prince Harry has expressed a desire to mend the relationship, and the meeting's quiet arrangement, without leaks from either side, suggests a mutual effort to handle the situation discreetly. However, a full family reconciliation remains distant, as no meeting with Prince William occurred.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by real estate company Redfin claims that San Francisco's housing costs have returned to a "normal" level, defined as the mortgage payment-to-income ratio seen in July 2018. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with significant wage increases for tech workers, bringing the affordability metric back to its pre-pandemic equilibrium. However, the report clarifies that this does not mean the city is affordable, as San Francisco's 2018 "normal" still required a much higher percentage of income for housing than most other U.S. cities.</p>

          <p>NASA's Perseverance rover has collected rock samples from a dried river channel on Mars that contain what scientists are calling potential signs of ancient microscopic life. The samples, from a clay-rich formation, contain organic carbon along with iron phosphate and iron sulfide compounds, which on Earth are byproducts of microbial activity. While researchers stress that non-biological processes could also explain these features, they represent the most compelling candidate so far in the search for extraterrestrial life. Conclusive analysis will require returning the samples to Earth for study in advanced laboratories.</p>

          <p>China has opened the Changtai Yangtze River Bridge, now the world's longest cable-stayed bridge, connecting the cities of Changzhou and Taizhou in Jiangsu province. The 10.3-kilometer structure is a major engineering feat, as it is the first to carry an expressway, a local road, and an intercity railway on the same deck. Its innovative asymmetrical design, with a high-speed railway on one side and a road on the other, overcomes significant weight distribution challenges. The bridge will dramatically reduce travel time between the two cities from over an hour to just 20 minutes.</p>
