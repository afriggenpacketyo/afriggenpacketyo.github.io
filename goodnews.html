          <p>Tesla's board of directors is seeking shareholder approval for a new compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk that could be valued at up to $1 trillion over the next decade. The proposed package would award Musk approximately 423 million shares if the company achieves ambitious milestones, including reaching a market capitalization of $8.5 trillion. Operational targets are also tied to the award, such as delivering 20 million vehicles and producing one million humanoid robots. This move comes after a Delaware judge voided Musk's previous $56 billion pay package following a legal challenge from investors.</p>

          <p>The influential Bauhaus art and design school is celebrating the 100th anniversary of its move to Dessau, Germany, under the shadow of criticism from the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. The AfD has accused the modernist movement of promoting "globalist uniformity," echoing historical condemnations from the Nazi party, which shut down the school in 1933. Despite this political pressure, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation is proceeding with its centennial program, focusing on the evolution of materials in architecture and design. The foundation's director expressed concern over the AfD's cultural attacks but noted significant public support for the institution.</p>

          <p>Ferrari driver Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time during the first practice session for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, leading his teammate Charles Leclerc for a one-two finish. Despite facing a five-place grid penalty for the upcoming race, Hamilton was 0.169 seconds quicker than Leclerc. The session was briefly interrupted by a red flag after a driver went off track and spread gravel on the circuit. Several drivers, including championship contender Lando Norris and Mercedes' George Russell, who experienced a power loss, encountered issues during the practice run, setting the stage for an eventful race weekend.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Argues for Diplomatic Resolution to Ukraine War Through the UN</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 08:30:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article reflects on the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and the founding of the United Nations, drawing parallels to the current war in Ukraine. The author argues that the core principles of the UN Charter, such as maintaining international peace and respecting sovereign equality, must be the foundation for resolving the conflict. The piece posits that geopolitical complexities should not overshadow these fundamental tenets and that a lasting peace must be achieved through diplomatic channels within the UN framework, rather than being decided solely on the battlefield. It serves as a call for a return to international law and collaborative security.</p>

          <p>An internal NFL document from the 2024 season reveals a significant disparity in ticket revenue among its 32 teams, with the San Francisco 49ers leading the league. The 49ers generated $176.5 million in net ticket receipts, substantially more than the second-place Dallas Cowboys and well above the league average. At the other end of the spectrum, the Tennessee Titans ranked last with $81.2 million. The report also details how teams contribute 34% of their ticket revenue to a shared pool, which is then redistributed to support league operations and provide funding for stadium construction and renovations across the NFL.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is undertaking a major renovation initiative for approximately 1,000 of its U.S. locations, with a focus on creating more welcoming and inclusive spaces for all customers. The redesigns will feature changes such as increased seating, warmer decor with dark wood paneling, and less harsh lighting to accommodate customers with light sensitivity. This effort is part of a broader strategy under CEO Brian Niccol to restore the cafes' reputation as a "third place" for community gathering, reversing previous trends of removing seats and outlets. The company aims to make its stores more comfortable for longer stays to help drive a recovery in sales.</p>

          <p>A total lunar eclipse is expected on September 7, 2025, offering viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia the chance to see the moon turn a reddish-orange hue. This phenomenon, often called a "Blood Moon," occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and the moon, casting a shadow that covers the lunar surface. The red color is caused by sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere, which scatters blue light while allowing red and orange light to pass through. Unlike a solar eclipse, a lunar eclipse is safe to view with the naked eye and can last for a significant duration.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation signed by President Donald Trump has increased the cap on the federal deduction for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 for the 2025 tax year. This change provides potential relief for taxpayers in high-tax states who were previously limited to a $10,000 deduction under the 2017 tax law. However, the benefit is subject to phaseouts for higher earners, with the deduction limit decreasing for those with a modified adjusted gross income above $500,000. Tax experts suggest strategies such as prepaying property taxes or state income taxes to help eligible filers maximize the newly raised deduction. (not investment advice)</p>

The day before, a judge ruled against breaking up the company despite finding it held an illegal monopoly in internet search, a decision that added $230 billion to Alphabet's market value. When prompted by Trump to discuss the outcome, Pichai responded, "I'm glad it's over," and expressed eagerness to collaborate on the administration's AI initiatives.

          <p>Germany's new environment minister, Carsten Schneider, has emphasized that the government remains committed to its climate protection goals, including achieving climate neutrality by 2045. Despite his limited prior experience in environmental policy, Schneider is taking a pragmatic approach, aiming to work quietly and collaboratively with industries like Daimler Truck to navigate the costly transition away from fossil fuels. His stance comes amid pushback from some conservative members of the coalition government who have expressed skepticism about the feasibility of the targets and prioritized economic revival. Schneider insists that climate action remains a top priority for the administration.</p>
