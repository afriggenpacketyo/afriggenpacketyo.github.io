          <h2>Ryanair Boosts Staff Bonus for Identifying Oversized Cabin Bags</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 12:27:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ryanair CEO Michael O'Leary announced an increase in the bonus for staff who identify passengers with oversized cabin bags, raising it from €1.50 to €2.50 per bag starting in November. O'Leary defended the policy, stating it aims to deter a small minority of passengers from violating bag size limits and ensure faster boarding and fewer flight delays across its European network. Despite an upcoming EU rule change increasing standard carry-on dimensions, the airline maintains strict adherence to its size and weight policies, charging up to £75 for non-compliant bags. O'Leary emphasized that 99.9% of its 200 million passengers comply, and the measure is not intended to "catch people out" but to enforce rules, thereby improving overall operational efficiency and passenger experience.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch reported a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth in Q2, with sales falling 5%, yet achieved overall growth of 7% due to the exceptional performance of its Hollister brand, which surged by 19%. This strong showing allowed the company to narrowly surpass Wall Street's top and bottom-line expectations and raise its full-year revenue outlook to 5-7% growth. However, the retailer also tightened its earnings outlook, now anticipating a substantial $90 million net tariff cost, nearly double previous estimates, impacting its operating margin. CEO Fran Horowitz expressed confidence in the Abercrombie brand's return to growth by year-end, driven by new categories and strategic partnerships like the NFL, aiming to sustain relevance and sales in a competitive market.

          <p>Cracker Barrel Old Country Store's shares rose significantly, recovering previous losses, after the company announced it would abandon its recently introduced logo and revert to its traditional design. The decision followed widespread criticism from social media users and even President Donald Trump, who publicly urged the company to "go back to the old logo, admit a mistake." The proposed redesign, which removed the iconic "Uncle Herschel" character and "Old Country Store" phrase, was widely panned as "generic" and "soulless," with a YouGov poll indicating 76% of Americans preferred the old one. The company stated it listened to customer feedback, reaffirming its commitment to its core values and country hospitality, leading to a positive market reaction. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Claiming Social Security benefits at age 62, the earliest eligibility age, comes with significant and permanent financial risks, despite its appeal for early retirement or immediate income. This decision results in a permanent reduction of monthly benefits, approximately 70% of the full retirement age amount, which also diminishes future cost-of-living adjustments. Furthermore, it means foregoing delayed retirement credits, which could increase benefits by 8% annually until age 70, and can also reduce potential survivor benefits for a spouse. The article suggests strategies like tapping retirement savings, considering annuities, or working part-time to delay claiming and maximize benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia is expected to report robust fiscal second-quarter earnings, with analysts projecting $1.01 adjusted EPS and $46.02 billion in revenue, representing 53% year-over-year growth. This explosive surge is primarily fueled by insatiable demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) in the generative artificial intelligence era, with its data center business accounting for approximately 88% of total sales. Key questions for analysts include the sales performance of its current-generation Blackwell chips and the volatile state of its China business, especially after the Trump administration's shifting stance on export licenses for slowed-down H20 chips and China's recent signal for technology companies to prioritize homegrown alternatives.

Swift's custom engagement ring is an old mine brilliant cut in a yellow gold bezel setting, designed by Kindred Lubeck. Their relationship began after Kelce's public attempt to meet Swift with a friendship bracelet, a gesture Swift described as reminiscent of a 1980s John Hughes movie, leading to their highly publicized romance.</p>

This decision comes as Scottie Scheffler, Xander Schauffelf, JJ Spaun, Harris English, Russell Henley, and Bryson DeChambeau had already qualified for the US team.

The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance to a decline of 5-6% and revised its adjusted earnings per share outlook upwards. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed slower sales to economic pressures on lower- and middle-income customers but highlighted ongoing efforts to revitalize the brand, including reintroducing petite sections, expanding jewelry, and overhauling discount strategies to appeal to value-driven shoppers. While acknowledging the imperative to return to growth, Bender noted improving sales trends throughout the quarter, with July's comparable sales aligning with the previous year, indicating progress despite leadership turmoil.

Beard cautions against cherry-picking historical analogies, emphasizing that while Rome offers lessons, direct comparisons are often flawed due to vast differences in societal structures, knowledge, and economic understanding. The discussion highlights how modern fascism thrives on identifying enemies and cultural flashpoints, using the recent Cracker Barrel logo controversy as an example. Both argue that understanding history accurately, alongside upholding liberty and equality, is crucial for confronting modern challenges, with humor serving as a potent short-term tool against absurdity.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered a bizarre armored dinosaur, *Spicomellus afer*, in Morocco, dating back 165 million years. This "punk rocker" of its time, as described by Professor Richard Butler, is the oldest known ankylosaur and features unique meter-long spikes fused directly onto its bone, a characteristic unseen in any other animal, living or extinct. This discovery challenges existing theories on ankylosaur evolution, suggesting these dinosaurs might have initially developed elaborate armor for display during the Jurassic period, later co-opting it for defense against large predators in the Cretaceous. Researchers estimate the four-meter-long, one-meter-high creature weighed around two tonnes, with its unique features prompting a rethinking of armored dinosaur development.</p>
