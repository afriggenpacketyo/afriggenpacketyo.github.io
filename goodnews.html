          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan was discharged from a Tokyo hospital after undergoing a heart condition examination. The 91-year-old was admitted following an earlier health checkup that indicated signs of myocardial ischemia. He previously received treatment for heart failure in 2022. Akihito abdicated from the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, marking the first abdication by a Japanese monarch in approximately 200 years.

          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island off China's southern coast, is positioning itself to attract Chinese shoppers amidst the intensifying trade war with the United States. With plans to launch its own separate customs regime, Hainan aims to avoid applying retaliatory tariffs on American imports. The hope is that offering cheaper iPhones and U.S. cosmetics will boost tourism to the island's duty-free stores, which have faced challenges due to sluggish domestic consumption and the recovery of overseas travel.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese leader William Lai Ching-te marked the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, sparking controversy and accusations of distorting history. Critics argue that Lai's speech sidestepped Japan's wartime atrocities and minimized the role of the Republic of China in the Allied victory. In his address, Lai emphasized the importance of democratic countries uniting against modern authoritarian threats, without directly naming Moscow or Beijing. The move is interpreted as a symbolic stand against Beijing's growing military pressure.</p>

          <p>President Trump agreed to lift 25 percent tariffs on steel imported from Britain to the United States, a move that provided relief to the struggling British steel industry. The tariffs, which had been in place since March, had added costs and complexities to an industry already facing weak demand and high energy costs. While the decision was welcomed by British steelmakers, uncertainties remain regarding tariffs on products processed in the European Union and the overall impact of the Trump administration's trade policies. The article also highlights the challenges facing the British steel industry, including government intervention to save a major steel mill.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods have prompted a surge in Chinese companies relocating manufacturing operations to Vietnam. The article details how Chinese businesses are seeking alternative locations to avoid the high tariffs, with Vietnam emerging as a primary destination due to its shared border and large workforce. While this shift provides a short-term fix for Chinese companies, challenges remain for Vietnam in managing the influx and navigating trade relations with the United States. E-commerce platforms are also facilitating the relocation process, and some Chinese companies are exploring ways to circumvent trade rules.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies have agreed to pay Hawaii $700 million to settle a lawsuit concerning the efficacy and safety of the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement follows a court ruling that ordered Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi subsidiaries to pay $916 million, though neither company admitted wrongdoing. The state argued that the companies failed to update labels despite knowing that a significant portion of patients might have a diminished response to the drug. Hawaii's Governor hailed the settlement as a major victory for the state.</p>

The judge cited "very substantial" claims that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated when her student visa was revoked. Ozturk was detained following the Trump administration's revocation of her visa in March, allegedly due to an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas.

          <p>Japanese figure skating prodigy Taiga Nishino has seen his stock rise sharply after mastering two quadruple jumps at just 15. A high school student from this spring, the youngster has drawn comparisons to junior champion Rio Nakata from judges and coaches inside Japan. Nishino landed a quad toe loop for the first time in a competition, albeit slightly under-rotating. He has grown nearly 10 centimeters over the past year to stand just over 160 cm, according to coach Misao Sato, and the rapid growth forced him to quickly progress to bigger boots and blades.</p>
