          <p>Rand Laycock, a 70-year-old music conductor with Parkinson's disease, has found relief through deep brain stimulation (DBS), a treatment involving an implanted device that delivers electrical currents to the brain. After experiencing worsening tremors and involuntary movements, Laycock underwent DBS therapy, initially with traditional settings and later progressing to adaptive DBS (aDBS). The aDBS fine-tunes the stimulation in real time, reducing the risk of tremors during performances. Laycock's symptoms are now minimal, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family.</p>
