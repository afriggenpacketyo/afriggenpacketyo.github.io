          <p>The average 30-year mortgage rate in the United States has remained stable at 6.76%, close to its highest levels this year, according to Freddie Mac. This rate is influenced by factors such as global demand for Treasury bonds, Federal Reserve policies, and investor expectations regarding the economy and inflation. Elevated mortgage rates and rising home prices continue to pose affordability challenges for potential homebuyers, leading to a lackluster start to the spring home-buying season. The article highlights the volatility in mortgage rates, reflecting fluctuations in the 10-year Treasury yield, which lenders use as a benchmark for pricing home loans. The optimism score is set at 60, reflecting the stability of the rate, but the challenges remain for buyers.</p>
