          <p>In the New York City Democratic mayoral primary, Andrew Cuomo conceded to Zohran Mamdani after initial results showed Mamdani leading with 44% of the vote. Cuomo acknowledged Mamdani's effective campaign, particularly among young voters, but hinted at a potential independent run in November. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, focused on a progressive platform centered around economic issues, including rent freezes and fare elimination for buses. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate securing over 50% of the vote, with final results expected in mid-July.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly dismissed over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC sacked Lattouf for reasons including her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, after she shared a Human Rights Watch post accusing Israel of war crimes. The ABC has since apologized for how it handled the matter, saying it had "let down our staff and audiences." Lattouf was awarded damages, and her dismissal had triggered public outrage and raised questions over the broadcaster's independence and support for culturally diverse staff.</p>

          <p>Steve Witkoff, Special Envoy to the Middle East, asserted that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding, emphasizing that "no one's shooting at each other." He dismissed the notion that Iran could resume its nuclear enrichment program within months as "not even conceivable." Witkoff condemned the leak of an initial intelligence assessment suggesting that U.S. strikes only set back Iran's nuclear program by a few months, labeling it "treasonous." This assessment contrasts with President Trump's claim that the strikes "completely destroyed" Iran's nuclear program.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom and Democratic lawmakers reached a tentative agreement on a $321 billion state budget, contingent on the Legislature passing a housing reform proposal. The deal addresses a $12 billion budget deficit through borrowing, reserves, and funding shifts, reflecting resistance to Newsom's proposed cuts. A key component involves overhauling environmental regulations to accelerate housing construction, with Newsom pushing for exemptions to the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The budget also includes changes to Medi-Cal funding and preserves funding for film and television tax credits, while anticipating future financial challenges and potential federal funding losses.</p>

          <p>The UK's Climate Change Committee (CCC) reports increased adoption of electric cars and heat pumps, but emphasizes the need for further growth. The CCC urges the government to ensure households benefit from cleaner technologies through lower bills. While greenhouse gas emissions within the UK have fallen by over half since 1990, transport and buildings remain significant emitters. The CCC also highlighted the need to make electricity cheaper, as high costs hinder the adoption of electric cars and heat pumps.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge blocked the Trump administration from withholding funds previously awarded to 14 states for electric vehicle charger infrastructure. The judge granted a partial injunction, ruling that the states' lawsuit would likely succeed, and found that the Trump administration violated the law when it withheld the funding. The ruling comes after the Trump administration ordered states not to spend $5 billion in funds allocated under the Biden administration's national electric vehicle infrastructure (Nevi) program. During his campaign, Donald Trump voiced opposition to electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who oversaw the hush-money case against President Donald Trump, won Tuesday's Democratic primary in his bid for a second term. Bragg defeated Patrick Timmins and will face Republican Maud Maron in the November general election. His tenure had a rocky start after issuing a memo telling staffers not to prosecute some types of cases, but his campaign emphasized efforts to fight gun violence and prosecute hate crimes. The office is currently involved in several high-profile cases, including the retrial of Harvey Weinstein.</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart is set to play the "legends" slot at Glastonbury, though he expressed a preference for a different name than "tea time slot." He has persuaded organizers to extend his set to an hour-and-a-half. He recounted his previous Glastonbury performance in 2002, and recalled a memorable New Year's Eve concert in Brazil where he was violently ill before taking the stage. He discussed his musical influences, the origins of his signature hairstyle, and the band's antics in the past.</p>

          <p>Some stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into how other stars are born. Chinese astronomers have used this cosmic dance to find that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. The study, based on data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope, found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than older ones, causing gas clouds to break into smaller fragments. The study offers a new way to study how the galaxy has changed over time.</p>
