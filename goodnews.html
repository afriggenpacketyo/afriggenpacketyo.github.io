          <p>Mark Zuckerberg, frustrated with Meta's position in the AI race, is reportedly investing $14 billion in Scale AI and attempting to recruit CEO Alexandr Wang to lead a new AI research lab. Meta aims to leverage Wang's expertise in AI's technical aspects and business development, hoping to improve the execution of Meta's AI ambitions after the lukewarm reception of the Llama AI models. This strategic move mirrors other tech giants' approaches of acquiring AI talent through substantial investments rather than outright acquisitions, possibly to avoid antitrust concerns given Meta's ongoing trial with the FTC. The partnership aims to strengthen Meta's AI capabilities by incorporating Scale AI's data-labelling and training intelligence. </p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased propaganda loudspeaker broadcasts along the border with North Korea as part of President Lee Jae Myung's efforts to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts, which had resumed in June of the previous year under former President Yoon Suk Yeol in response to North Korea's actions, have been halted to restore trust in inter-Korean relations and achieve peace. This decision follows recent appeals from South Korea's Unification Ministry for activists to cease distributing anti-North Korea leaflets, citing heightened tensions and risks to residents in border areas. This action is intended to reduce military confrontation and open the door for rebuilding mutual trust. </p>

          <p>Mortgage application volume increased by 12.5% last week, reaching the highest level in over a month, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association's seasonally adjusted index. The rise is attributed to a post-Memorial Day rebound, with both refinance and purchase applications increasing significantly. Despite the increase, overall volume remains low historically, with the average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages at 6.93%. Increased housing supply and slightly easing home prices may be contributing to the increased demand, as homebuyers take advantage of more available listings in certain markets. </p>

          <p>The article explores the cultural emphasis on romantic relationships over friendships and argues for the equal importance of platonic bonds. It highlights how society often prioritizes marriage and romantic love, sometimes at the expense of friendships, leading to systemic disadvantages for platonic relationships. Historically, friendships were deeply valued, but shifting cultural norms have led to a hierarchy of connection where romantic partners are expected to fulfill all emotional needs. The article suggests reimagining free time and support systems to include friends, fostering a more balanced and fulfilling life with both love and friendship. </p>

          <p>The article explores the idea of "recession pop," a term referring to upbeat pop music from the time of the Great Recession, and questions whether music can predict economic downturns. It features an interview with Charlie Harding, cohost of Switched on Pop, who argues that music does not necessarily reflect larger economic trends. Harding explains that recession pop is a made-up genre and that music of all kinds, both upbeat and downbeat, existed during the Great Recession. The article suggests that the current interest in recession pop may be more related to millennials aging out of being cool than to actual economic indicators. </p>

          <h2>Nature Reclaims Ukraine's Kakhovka Dam Landscape</h2>

          <p>Two years after the Kakhovka Dam's destruction, the landscape is undergoing a natural transformation, with lush vegetation and wildlife returning to the exposed basin. The Dnipro River has formed vast floodplains similar to those that existed before the dam was built, creating a new ecosystem. Ecologists have identified a wide variety of birds, snakes, and mammals in the area, along with diverse plant species. However, the future of this ecosystem is uncertain, as Ukraine is considering whether to rebuild the Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant, which could destroy the newly formed landscape. </p>
