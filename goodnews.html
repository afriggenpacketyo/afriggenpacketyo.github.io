          <p>Australia achieved a remarkable victory in the Rugby Championship opener, overcoming a 22-0 deficit to defeat world champions South Africa 38-22 in Johannesburg. This win marks the Wallabies' first victory at Ellis Park since 1963, breaking a long-standing drought at the formidable venue. After the Springboks dominated the first 20 minutes with three tries, Australia rallied powerfully, with captain Harry Wilson leading the charge and scoring two tries himself. The stunning turnaround was completed with a superb solo try from Tom Wright, sealing one of Australia's most memorable Test match wins.</p>

This commendation comes even as the Alaska summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin concluded without a formal ceasefire agreement. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support for Ukraine. Following the summit, Zelensky is scheduled to travel to Washington D.C. to meet with Trump for further discussions on a potential peace framework.</p>

          <p>The fashion brand Topshop is planning a major comeback to the British High Street, with its leadership confirming the future opening of new standalone stores. This revival follows the 2020 collapse of its parent company, Arcadia, which resulted in the closure of all physical locations. To mark its return, Topshop hosted its first catwalk show in seven years in London, signaling a renewed effort to reclaim its former status as a fashion trendsetter. Industry experts note the brand faces the challenge of attracting a new generation of shoppers while leveraging the nostalgia of its millennial and Gen-Z customer base.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached several record highs this week, driven by investor speculation regarding the Federal Reserve's future interest rate decisions. Positive momentum was fueled by a July consumer price index report showing inflation had cooled more than expected, increasing the likelihood of a rate cut in September. However, gains were tempered later in the week by a producer price index that indicated a higher-than-anticipated rise in wholesale inflation, showing continued uncertainty in the market.

This move from their current residence at Adelaide Cottage is seen as an opportunity for a "fresh start" following a challenging period that included the Princess's cancer diagnosis. A royal source indicated the relocation allows the family to leave behind some unhappy memories and establish a long-term family home. The move is being funded privately, and the couple will pay market rent for the property.</p>

          <p>A startup in Phoenix, Arizona, is repurposing old shipping containers to create shelters for the city's unhoused population, addressing the affordable housing crisis with a sustainable approach. Developed by architect Brian Stark and his company Steel + Spark, the "X-WING" shelters are constructed from four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The units, which can be built in just one week, offer a rapid and cost-effective solution to provide private, secure housing for individuals working to get back on their feet.</p>

          <p>Jamaican sprinter Kishane Thompson defeated American Noah Lyles in their first 100-meter showdown since the Paris Olympics, winning at the Silesia Diamond League meet. Thompson clocked a time of 9.87 seconds, matching the meet record, while Lyles finished second at 9.90 seconds. The race was a highly anticipated rematch after Lyles narrowly beat Thompson for the Olympic gold medal by just five-thousandths of a second a year ago. Thompson's victory establishes him as a strong contender for the upcoming world championships in Tokyo, though he downplayed the specific rivalry with Lyles.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his climbing lines, leaving him stranded. After he was reported missing, a search operation was launched, and a dive team eventually located him using a drone. He was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter and treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>An academician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to accelerate its development of space-based solar power technology to strengthen its position in both the new energy sector and the ongoing space race. The technology involves orbiting facilities that collect solar energy and transmit it to Earth via microwaves, offering a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime. The scientist, Ge Changchun, noted that China's current research efforts are fragmented and lag behind the United States, calling for a more coordinated, top-down national strategy to advance the complex project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent discussions on parenting advocate for a "Lighthouse Parent" approach as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive parenting. This model encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence for their children, offering safety and clarity without controlling every aspect of their lives. Proponents argue that while the instinct to solve every problem for a child is strong, it can be detrimental to their development and exhausting for the parent. By standing back and illuminating the way only when needed, parents can foster more confident and resilient children.</p>

          <p>Police in Devon and Cornwall, UK, have seized a £180,000 deposit that controversial influencer Andrew Tate paid for a special-edition Aston Martin supercar in 2021. A court heard that the funds were determined to be the proceeds of tax evasion and money laundering, and the forfeiture order was not opposed by Tate or his brother. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million of the brothers' funds confiscated by the same police force in December 2024 for failure to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. The seized money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support programs.</p>
