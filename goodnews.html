The election saw a significant swing towards Labor across the country, tempering the trend of voters abandoning the major parties. This victory marks a remarkable turnaround for Albanese, who faced low approval ratings earlier in the year, and positions him as the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.</p>
