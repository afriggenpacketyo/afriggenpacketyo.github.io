          <p>Christian singer Brandon Lake was inspired by Jelly Roll's decision to throw his phone in a river to set better boundaries in his own life, including getting a new phone number to focus on his inner circle. Lake, who collaborated with Jelly Roll on his new album "King of Hearts," realized he needed to prioritize the right people around him as his success grew. He also discussed his past mental health struggles, including panic attacks, and how he learned to seek help and find therapeutic activities like working on his farm.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba has ruled out dissolving the lower house of parliament for the time being, according to a lawmaker. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. The Prime Minister's ruling bloc does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives, and a passed no-confidence motion would require the Prime Minister to dissolve the chamber or the Cabinet to resign. The decision comes amid concerns over U.S. tariffs and rising tensions in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>A gold-plated iron knife and armor fragments, believed to have been made with advanced 5th-century techniques, have been confirmed as originating from Japan's largest ancient keyhole-shaped tomb mound. The Daisen Kofun in Osaka Prefecture, traditionally held as Emperor Nintoku's mausoleum, remains a subject of academic debate regarding the actual occupant. The artifacts, acquired by Kokugakuin University from an art dealer, were previously held by a collector who participated in a survey of the tomb in 1872. The discovery sheds light on the advanced craftsmanship of the period.</p>

          <p>Japan's policy of making high school tuition virtually free, even at private institutions, is raising concerns about a potential exodus from public schools. Experts warn that this policy could exacerbate inequalities and undermine the role of public schools as safety nets for diverse students. Critics argue that the government has not provided adequate support for struggling public schools, which face shrinking enrollment and budget shortfalls. The policy, implemented as part of a political deal, aims to ease households' financial burdens but may have unintended consequences for the education system.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have achieved controlled nuclear reactions between hydrogen and lithium in a compact device, creating a portable neutron gun. The device uses a novel electromagnetic technique to produce a high-energy neutron beam, with potential applications in science, industry, and defense. Unlike previous designs requiring massive accelerators, this portable gun generates 10 billion fast neutrons per second, each packing 3 million electron volts of energy. The development represents a significant advancement in neutron generation technology.</p>

The acquisition will make Nippon Steel the world's fourth-largest steelmaker, increasing its global capacity and allowing it to expand into overseas markets.
