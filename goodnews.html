          <p>Amazon is leveraging artificial intelligence to transform its online grocery business and improve profitability in a traditionally low-margin sector. The company plans to use AI to streamline logistics, enhance the shopping experience, and make deliveries more efficient. Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy expressed optimism about the grocery business's potential for significant growth and stated that it is already a large sector for the company, accounting for one in three units sold in the U.S. By integrating AI across its logistics network and using it for demand forecasting, Amazon aims to reduce costs and speed up delivery times, solidifying its position as a major player in the online grocery market (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>NATO is seeking to increase defense spending from 2% to 5% of each member nation's GDP by 2035, though some countries are hesitant to meet the higher target. The U.S.' commitment to the alliance is also in focus, after years of U.S. President Donald Trump's frustration at allies not contributing adequately to defense. Despite internal disagreements, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to reassure allies that Washington will not abandon the bloc. Some member states, like Spain and Italy, have expressed skepticism about the new target, while others, such as Poland and Estonia, already exceed the 2% threshold.</p>

          <p>Relationships with in-laws can be complex, ranging from friendly to strained, as they are not chosen family but become inextricably linked through marriage. Cultural expectations and traditions influence these relationships, with stereotypes often portraying mothers-in-law as meddling figures. Uncertainty about relational and family-level dynamics can lead to conflict, especially when grandchildren are involved. Maintaining a cordial relationship with in-laws is often worthwhile for the sake of one's partner or children, provided mutual respect is maintained.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, high-yield savings accounts are becoming increasingly attractive for those seeking to maximize their savings.

While rates are expected to continue falling, high-yield savings accounts remain a secure place to store cash for shorter-term goals.

          <p>Curvy couches, initially popular during the Art Deco era and again in the 1950s, are experiencing a resurgence in interior design. These sofas can soften the angularity of spaces and add femininity, creating a more custom and interesting look. They can also be practical in open-plan spaces, breaking up large rooms and acting as both seating and separation. When selecting a curvy couch, it's important to consider size, comfort, and how it will complement other furniture in the room.</p>

          <p>UC Berkeley law professors Erwin Chemerinsky and Claudia Polsky have successfully challenged the Trump administration's cuts to research funding, securing a preliminary injunction to restore millions of dollars in UC grants. A federal judge ruled that the government engaged in "quintessential viewpoint discrimination" when it rescinded funding to researchers studying topics such as racial equity and health risks to racial minorities. The case has been approved as a class-action suit, potentially opening it to UC researchers statewide who saw their funding discontinued after Trump's inauguration.</p>
