        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Millions of Facebook users who filed claims in a $725 million class-action privacy settlement are beginning to receive their payments. The lawsuit stemmed from allegations that the social media giant improperly shared user data with third parties, most notably in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. Approved claimants are being notified via email, with average payments estimated to be around $29, though the final amount depends on how long the user maintained an active account during the specified 15-year period. Meta, Facebook's parent company, has denied any wrongdoing as part of the settlement agreement.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Social Security trust fund projected to be depleted within a decade, discussions around reform are intensifying, particularly concerning raising the retirement age. However, this approach disproportionately affects lower-income individuals, who have a shorter life expectancy than their wealthier counterparts, effectively resulting in a larger percentage cut to their lifetime benefits. A proposed solution suggests a tiered system where the retirement age is raised only for the top 40 percent of earners, preserving benefits for most retirees while addressing the program's long-term solvency in a more equitable manner.

These errors include failing to understand the underlying assets of an ETF, chasing past performance of trendy or thematic funds, and engaging in overly frequent trading that can erode long-term returns. Experts emphasize that investment choices should align with an individual's personal financial goals, risk tolerance, and long-term strategy rather than short-term market hype.

          <p>In a personal essay, a writer recounts a brief but intense connection with a man he initially felt was out of his league, an 'Instagay' who embodied a standard of attractiveness he didn't see in himself. The relationship's eventual fizzling forces him to confront his own insecurities and the reasons for his infatuation. He ultimately questions whether he truly loved the man or simply craved the external validation that being chosen by him would provide, leading to a poignant reflection on the difference between genuine affection and self-loathing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers are considering bill SB 53, which would require developers of powerful 'frontier' AI models to produce public reports on how they mitigate potential catastrophic risks. The bill defines such risks as events causing over 50 casualties or $1 billion in damages, such as AI-enabled bioweapons or critical infrastructure cyberattacks. While proponents see it as a necessary, light-touch approach to ensure accountability before a disaster occurs, some industry groups argue it would stifle innovation with burdensome compliance costs. The legislation highlights the growing debate over how to regulate fast-moving AI technology.</p>

          <p>The widespread use of GLP-1 weight-loss drugs like Ozempic is creating a noticeable shift in the apparel market, with clothing resellers reporting a surplus of larger sizes being sold by customers. This 'Ozempic effect' has reversed historical inventory patterns, where larger sizes were once in high demand and are now more common. While major retailers have not officially commented, some industry insiders note a trend toward offering fewer extended sizes in physical stores. The development raises questions about the future of the plus-size clothing market, which advocates argue remains underserved.</p>
