        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the efforts of the Northern Jaguar Project to conserve jaguars in Sonora, Mexico, by compensating ranchers for allowing motion cameras on their land and photographing wild cats, including jaguars, pumas, ocelots, and bobcats. This initiative, called Viviendo con Felinos, provides ranchers with financial incentives to protect these animals, effectively expanding the protected area for jaguars and their prey. The program has also fostered a cultural shift among ranchers, encouraging them to preserve the natural food chain and coexist with predators. This conservation model offers hope for the potential return of jaguars to the American Southwest, depending on maintaining openings in the border wall. Optimism is further fueled by the stable population of jaguars in the reserve and the increasing number of individuals passing through the region.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Spanish government is demanding the removal of nearly 66,000 Airbnb listings that violate tourist accommodation regulations, responding to increasing protests against over-tourism. This clampdown follows a Madrid court ruling that Airbnb must remove almost 5,000 properties cited by the Ministry of Social Rights, Consumer Affairs and the 2030 Agenda. The identified properties either lack a license number, provide an incorrect number, or fail to specify the owner's legal status. This action reflects growing concerns over spiraling rental costs and the deprivation of accommodation for local residents, as tourist apartments are seen as a major contributor to the housing problem.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump cautioned House Republicans against altering Medicaid during a closed-door meeting, urging them to pass a tax bill. His blunt message was directed at a faction of Republicans seeking cuts to the Medicaid program and the addition of work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that such work requirements would create a bureaucratic burden, requiring extensive verification of employment status for millions of people. Medicaid, jointly funded by the federal government and states, provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated his commitment to remain as CEO of Tesla for the next five years, addressing speculation about his future role within the company. This announcement comes at a time when Tesla faces significant consumer and stock price pressures, partly due to Musk's involvement with President Trump's administration. The statement follows reports suggesting that Tesla's board members had considered searching for a new CEO, which the company's chair, Robyn Denholm, has firmly denied. Musk's dedication aims to reassure investors and stakeholders about the stability of Tesla's leadership.</p>

          <p>The FDA has outlined stricter approval standards for future COVID-19 vaccine boosters, differentiating requirements based on risk. For high-risk individuals, such as adults 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions, immunogenicity data will suffice for approval. However, for healthy individuals between 6 months and 64 years old, the FDA will require stronger evidence from randomized, controlled trials showing actual clinical outcomes. This new guidance, influenced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., reflects a balance between regulatory flexibility and rigorous scientific standards.</p>
