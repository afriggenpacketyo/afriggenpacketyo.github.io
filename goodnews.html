          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called on government officials to enhance their ability to anticipate challenges and effectively implement policies amidst a turbulent global environment. He emphasized the difficulty of promoting Chinese modernization and high-quality development due to the complex external situation. Li's remarks come as China faces increasing tensions with the West over trade and technology issues, including ongoing negotiations with the United States and preparations for a trade summit with the European Union. Despite these challenges, both American and Chinese officials have agreed to a framework aimed at de-escalating disputes over rare earths and strategic technologies. The premier is emphasizing the need for preparedness and adaptability in the face of external pressures.</p>

          <p>China is entering the race to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to major advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University's CHIPX has announced the production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, which use light for information transmission. While Europe and the US are already established in this field, China's pilot production line is showing gains in technical performance, overcoming limitations in high-speed optical links. TFLN's unique properties, including its ultra-fast electro-optic effect and low power consumption, are expected to drive significant progress in the field, positioning China as a major player in future technologies.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased broadcasting anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border as part of efforts to ease tensions between the two nations. President Lee Jae-myung ordered the move to restore trust in inter-Korean relations and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts were resumed in June of the previous year in response to North Korea's trash-laden balloons sent to the South. The decision is seen as a proactive step to reduce military tensions and alleviate the burden for South Koreans residing in border areas, though prospects for an early resumption of dialogue between the rival Koreas remain uncertain.</p>
