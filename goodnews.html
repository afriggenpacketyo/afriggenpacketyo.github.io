          <p>A new exhibit at the National Museum of Ireland is showcasing 1,300-year-old manuscripts from the Abbey Library of St. Gall, featuring surprising doodles and notes from medieval monks. Scribed in the margins in Old Irish, these personal annotations offer a rare glimpse into the monks' daily lives, including complaints about hangovers, cold weather, and poor-quality ink. The scribbles, found in a 6th-century grammar book, provide a humorous and humanizing perspective on monastic life, with one monk even expressing anxiety about a potential Viking raid.</p>

          <p>UK Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch is conducting a significant reshuffle of her shadow cabinet, with former leadership rival Sir James Cleverly expected to return to a prominent front-bench role. The move comes eight months into her leadership, a period during which the party has struggled in opinion polls, often placing third or fourth. A party source indicated the changes are intended to advance the party's policy renewal and underscore unity under its new leadership. The reshuffle is seen as an attempt to reinvigorate the opposition's challenge to the current Labour government.</p>

          <p>A father is being praised as a hero after saving his four-year-old child from a mountain lion attack in Washington's Olympic National Park. The child was bitten by the cougar while on a popular trail with family but was successfully rescued by the father's quick intervention. The child was airlifted to a trauma center and has since been released in satisfactory condition. Park rangers located and killed the mountain lion, which was fitted with a tracking collar, and stated there is no current threat to the public. Witnesses at the scene credited the father's actions with saving the child's life.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca has announced plans to invest $50 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and research and development capabilities by 2030. This major commitment includes a new multi-billion dollar facility in Virginia, which will become the company's largest single manufacturing investment globally. The move follows similar announcements from other pharma firms and comes as the industry faces potential U.S. trade tariffs and pressure from the Trump administration to reshore manufacturing. The investment is expected to create tens of thousands of jobs and support AstraZeneca's goal of reaching $80 billion in annual revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The small Norwegian village of Ulefoss sits atop the Fen complex, the largest known deposit of rare earth elements in Europe, creating a potential solution for the EU's dependency on China for these critical materials. A company named Rare Earths Norway (REN) is planning an "invisible mine" that would tunnel into the deposit from a distance to minimize disruption to the village above. While the project promises economic benefits and strategic importance for Europe, some residents have expressed concerns about potential environmental impacts and geological instability. The company is working to address these issues to avoid local opposition.</p>

          <p>Italy, considered a dark horse, has reached its first Euro semi-final in 28 years and is set to face defending champions England. The Italian team's success is credited to the leadership of captain Cristiana Girelli and the tactical flexibility of coach Andrea Soncin, who has effectively adapted formations to exploit opponent weaknesses. Experts suggest Italy could punish England by targeting wide areas, a potential vulnerability for the Lionesses, using skilled wing-backs and the strong connection between forwards Girelli and Sofia Cantore. This match represents a significant moment for Italian women's football, which has recently seen increased professionalization.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced substantial changes to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, following a highly critical report from the public inquiry's chair. Cabinet Office minister Nick Thomas-Symonds stated the changes aim to restore trust among victims who were infected with HIV or hepatitis from contaminated NHS blood products. A key change ensures that if an affected family member dies before their claim is settled, the payment can now be passed on through their estate. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some issues remain subject to further consultation.</p>
