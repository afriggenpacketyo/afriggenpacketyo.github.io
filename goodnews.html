        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former senior economic planner in China has suggested lowering the country's annual GDP growth target for the next five years to around 4%. This adjustment considers the potential for a prolonged rivalry with the United States and the necessity to address structural problems within China. The planner, Xu Lin, emphasized that a 4% GDP growth would be favorable if it leads to expanded employment and controlled debt ratios. This proposal contrasts with market estimates of around 4.5% annual growth from 2026-30.</p>
