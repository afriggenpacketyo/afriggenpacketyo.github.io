        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in UK rail policy. The initial nationalized service ran from Woking to Surbiton, though engineering work necessitated a bus replacement to London Waterloo. While the government avoids promising fare reductions, they emphasize service improvements and infrastructure investment. Concerns persist among unions regarding the outsourcing of security and cleaning, while the Conservatives urge Labour to fulfill their commitments. GBR will not officially exist until MPs vote to create it, which looks set to be in the autumn though it won't be up and running for some time afterwards.</p>

However, the economy is now more vulnerable, with higher interest rates, climbing personal-debt levels, and slowing job growth.
