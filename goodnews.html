          <h2>New Gene Therapy Injection Shows Promise in Reversing Congenital Hearing Loss</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:49:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A breakthrough gene therapy has shown remarkable results in reversing a form of congenital deafness, with a single injection improving hearing in all 10 participants of a clinical trial. The therapy works by delivering a healthy copy of the OTOF gene to the inner ear, which is crucial for transmitting sound signals to the brain. Researchers observed rapid and considerable hearing improvements within a month, and one seven-year-old participant regained almost full hearing. The treatment was found to be safe, offering hope for future therapies targeting other genetic causes of deafness.</p>

          <h2>Singapore Gains Popularity Among Chinese Students as US Appeal Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 23:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore is becoming an increasingly attractive destination for Chinese students seeking overseas education, as the appeal of the United States wanes due to safety concerns and cultural adjustment difficulties. Many Chinese students, who once saw the U.S. as their top choice for higher education, are now shifting their focus to Singaporean universities. The city-state's cultural similarities, safe environment, and strong academic reputation are key draws. Industry insiders predict this trend will lead to a short-term increase in applications from Chinese students to Singapore's educational institutions, altering international student mobility patterns.</p>

          <h2>TSA Begins Phasing Out Requirement for Passengers to Remove Shoes at Security</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:43:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is ending its long-standing policy requiring passengers in general security lines to remove their shoes, a change being phased in at major U.S. airports. An internal memo indicated the new rule began Sunday, with the goal of a nationwide rollout soon. This marks a significant shift from the policy implemented in 2006 after the attempted "shoe bomber" incident. Passengers who trigger screening alarms will still need to remove their footwear for additional checks, but the change aims to speed up the security process for most travelers.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs has upwardly revised its return forecasts for the S&P 500 index, citing expectations for earlier and more significant Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. The bank now projects a 12-month gain of 11%, targeting an index level of 6,900, up from previous estimates. This optimistic outlook is also supported by the strong fundamental performance of major large-cap stocks and investors' apparent willingness to overlook short-term earnings weaknesses. The firm's analysts noted that the impact of tariffs has been less severe than initially anticipated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles Moves to Permanently Curb 'Renoviction' Practices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 22:29:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles City Council is advancing a permanent ordinance to protect tenants from "renovictions," where landlords evict residents under the guise of substantial remodels to charge higher rents. The new amendment would only permit such evictions if a government agency issues an order to vacate due to safety or code violations. The city is also developing rules that would require landlords to provide and pay for comparable temporary housing for displaced tenants during legitimate renovations. This move aims to close a loophole in renter protection laws and ensure renovations are not used as a pretext for unjust evictions.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost its economy and tourism sector, China has significantly expanded its visa-free entry policy, now allowing citizens from 74 countries to visit for up to 30 days without a visa. This unprecedented move has led to a noticeable increase in foreign visitors, with travel companies reporting a surge in bookings, particularly from European countries included in the new policy. The government hopes the relaxed regulations will help revive the tourism industry, which has been slow to recover since the end of COVID-19 restrictions. The policy aims to make travel to China easier and more appealing for a global audience.</p>

          <p>Caltech is severing ties with e-learning company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged a jointly offered cybersecurity boot camp was misleading. The lawsuit claimed the program, which cost students up to $14,000, was part of Caltech "in name only," with minimal connection to the university's faculty or standards. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students and agreed to greater transparency. The case highlights growing scrutiny over partnerships between prestigious universities and third-party online program managers, which have faced complaints about quality and unfulfilled promises.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has abandoned its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The agency is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, which has eliminated the need for mass layoffs. The initial plan, part of a broader push to reduce the federal workforce, could have cut over 80,000 jobs. Critics argue the high attrition rate is due to a toxic work environment and will negatively impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been named to his 11th career All-Star team, this time as a special "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The 37-year-old, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery, expressed surprise and gratitude for the honor, calling it "weird but cool." While his performance this season might not typically warrant a selection, the pick recognizes his future Hall of Fame career accomplishments. Kershaw joins the ranks of other legends like Albert Pujols and Miguel Cabrera who have received this special recognition in recent years.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not prosecute participants of the city's recent Pride parade, even though the event was officially prohibited by the government. The decision comes after Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, declared the march an official municipal event, arguing it was therefore exempt from the ban. Authorities stated that participants likely believed the event was legal due to these comments and the city's involvement. This development occurs amid a broader crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights by Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which had passed a law enabling the ban on Pride marches.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that would deny funding to groups providing abortion services. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the provision unconstitutionally targets the organization and would devastate its ability to provide non-abortion healthcare services to millions of patients. The judge's order will remain in effect for 14 days, ensuring Medicaid funding continues while the case proceeds.</p>
