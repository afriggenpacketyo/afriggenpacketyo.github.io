          <p>The U.S. automotive industry is navigating a period of significant uncertainty marked by tariffs, inflation, and geopolitical tensions. Despite initial bearish forecasts, the sector has demonstrated unexpected resilience, with sales and production holding up better than anticipated by analysts. Automakers like Ford and GM face a balancing act, offsetting tariff costs with deregulation benefits, though concerns remain about subprime auto lending and potential consumer spending slowdowns. The industry's outlook is cautiously optimistic as it confronts these complex economic and political challenges.</p>

          <p>A CNBC market analyst expressed a positive outlook for the stock market, citing the 10-year Treasury yield's stability as a favorable sign for equities. The article highlights an optimistic view on Boeing, which received approval to increase its 737 MAX production, a key factor for its cash flow recovery. Starbucks is also recommended as a "buy," with the analyst projecting a strong 2026 based on the company's turnaround strategy, new product initiatives, and the significant value of its China business. The analysis suggests both companies are positioned for future growth despite broader market uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>

          <p>China's leadership is formulating its next five-year economic plan amid significant structural challenges, balancing state investment in high-tech industries against the urgent need to boost domestic consumption. Faced with geopolitical pressure from the U.S., particularly in the semiconductor sector, Beijing is prioritizing technological sovereignty and manufacturing prowess. However, this focus on industrial policy leaves fewer resources to stimulate household spending, which remains low compared to Western economies. Analysts suggest that while some measures to support consumers are likely, the primary goal remains strengthening China's resilience and global competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Cleveland-Cliffs surged after the steelmaker announced it is investigating the commercial viability of mining rare earth minerals at two of its sites in Michigan and Minnesota. This move aligns with the U.S. government's strategy to establish a domestic supply chain for critical minerals and reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the market. CEO Lourenco Goncalves stated the company's intent to be part of the solution for American mineral independence. The announcement was met with strong investor enthusiasm amid speculation of potential government support for such domestic projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a prolonged search, the Scottish Premiership club Rangers has appointed former Sheffield Wednesday manager Danny Rohl as its new head coach on a two-and-a-half-year contract. The 36-year-old German takes over following the dismissal of Russell Martin, with the club currently sitting sixth in the league. Rohl acknowledged the team's difficult start to the season but emphasized that there is no time to waste in pursuing results. The appointment follows unsuccessful talks with other candidates, and the club's leadership expressed confidence in Rohl's ability to restore success at Ibrox.</p>

          <p>Kevin Hassett, a top White House economic advisor, stated on Monday that he believes the ongoing federal government shutdown is "likely to end sometime this week." He suggested that if a resolution is not reached, the Trump administration might consider "stronger measures" to compel Democrats to negotiate. The shutdown persists due to a stalemate in the Senate, where Democrats are demanding that any funding bill include extensions for Affordable Care Act subsidies. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for a short-term resolution to reopen the government before negotiating other policy issues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An executive coach and human behavior professor outlines five practical strategies for effectively working with a controlling manager while conserving personal energy. The advice includes submitting rough drafts to invite early input, reinforcing the boss's authority with specific phrasing, and proactively oversharing information to satisfy their need for oversight. Other techniques involve preempting criticism by asking for initial thoughts and using the "yes, and..." method to validate their feedback while still asserting one's own ideas. The goal is to navigate the challenging dynamic by understanding and managing the boss's need for control.</p>

          <p>Electric vehicles (EVs) generally lose their value more quickly than their internal combustion engine counterparts, often depreciating by 13% more over a five-year period. This rapid depreciation is attributed to several factors, including generous government and manufacturer incentives that lower the initial cost, as well as the fast pace of technological advancement in battery range and features. However, this trend may be changing as a wider variety of more affordable EV models enter the market. The influx of used EVs and a broader mix of price points could help stabilize their resale values in the future.</p>
