          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached a significant agreement aimed at resetting their relationship following the UK's departure from the bloc in 2020. The deal covers various areas, including security, energy, trade, travel, and fisheries, and is seen as a new chapter in their post-Brexit relations. This agreement seeks to reduce red tape for businesses, extend fishing rights for EU trawlers in UK waters until 2038, and allow British holidaymakers to use more eGates in EU airports. While some issues, like youth mobility, remain to be fully resolved, the agreement is praised by both sides as a positive outcome amid shifting global dynamics.</p>

O‚ÄôConnor, backed by significant financial support and the legacy of his late father, criticizes Gainey's management and focuses on fiscal stability.

          <p>The UK and the EU are pursuing a reset of their relationship, aiming for cooperation levels not seen since Brexit, with new agreements on fisheries, trade, and security. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting EU leaders in London for a summit focused on deepening ties and cutting red tape to boost the British economy. Agreements include extending EU fishermen's access to British waters in exchange for easing customs checks on food imports and a new defense and security pact. These efforts are driven by common challenges such as the war in Ukraine and shifts in US policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Keir Starmer is betting that the public has moved past the major debates surrounding Brexit and is primarily interested in pragmatic solutions to reduce friction with the EU. The new UK-EU deal aims to improve relations without revisiting fundamental questions like membership in the single market or customs union. While Conservatives and Reform UK criticize the deal as a "surrender," the Liberal Democrats urge greater ambition. The success of Starmer's strategy depends on whether the public truly desires minimal friction with the EU, potentially establishing him as a post-Brexit prime minister.</p>

This regulatory move seeks to protect shoppers from debt traps while providing the sector with the certainty needed for investment and job creation.

          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that the bill for a typical household will fall by ¬£129 annually, a decrease of nearly 7%. While this decrease offers some relief, energy bills remain significantly higher than previous levels, raising concerns about affordability for many households.

          <p>The NJ Transit strike has ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a deal, but train service will not immediately resume. The strike, which halted trains across New Jersey for four days, will officially come to an end on Tuesday, May 20. The agreement comes as relief to hundreds of thousands of riders who rely on the system that brings commuters to New York City and Philadelphia. A contingency plan will remain in place until service is fully restored.</p>
