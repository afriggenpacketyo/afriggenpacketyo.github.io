          <p>Amazon Web Services is enhancing its Graviton4 chip with improved network bandwidth, aiming to provide a cost-effective alternative to Nvidia's GPUs for AI training. AWS has invested significantly in Anthropic, allocating $8 billion to support the startup's AI supercomputer, Project Rainier. The objective is to lower AI training expenses, presenting a competitive solution against Nvidia's high-priced graphics processing units. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model is currently operating on Trainium2 GPUs, and Project Rainier is powered by a substantial number of these chips. This strategic move signifies AWS's commitment to challenging Nvidia's stronghold in the AI infrastructure domain.</p>

          <p>The Senate has passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing a regulatory framework for stablecoins, with a 68-30 vote after overcoming initial Democratic resistance. The bill requires members of Congress and Executive Branch officials to disclose stablecoin holdings over $5,000, offers stronger bankruptcy protections for bank depositors, and directs the Treasury to monitor suspicious transactions. Concerns about President Trump's family's crypto ventures and Binance initially stalled the bill, leading to strengthened provisions against corruption. Despite some Democratic opposition, the bill's supporters argue it provides much-needed regulatory clarity for the digital asset space. (not investment advice)</p>

The race, planned to take place in Times Square, would have settled a debate over who is faster. Lyles, a world champion in the 100 and 200 meters, and Hill, a former high school track star, had engaged in playful banter leading up to the event.

          <p>Amazon CEO Andy Jassy anticipates a future where AI agents, or robots, will replace human employees in the company's offices, as stated in a memo released by Amazon. Jassy expects a reduction in the corporate workforce within a few years due to the increasing reliance on generative AI tools. Amazon is heavily investing in AI, with approximately 1,000 generative AI services and applications in development. The company aims to shift human workers towards more creative roles, while AI agents handle tedious tasks; however, some employees have expressed concerns about the intensified work environment and the increasing pace driven by AI integration.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer explained that he quickly picked up papers dropped by U.S. President Donald Trump at the G7 Summit to avoid potential intervention from the White House security team. The incident occurred during a discussion about a newly signed UK-US trade deal, where President Trump brandished a folder, causing the papers to spill. Starmer noted the importance of the trade deal for Jaguar Land Rover workers and its supply chain. The agreement removes tariffs on the aerospace sector and reduces levies on cars exported from the UK to the US, though negotiations on steel import charges are ongoing.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion, marking the most significant change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, introduced by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a majority of 242 votes. Women who terminate their pregnancies outside legal guidelines will no longer face police investigations, although penalties remain for those assisting women in such terminations. The new law will not change the provision of abortion services within healthcare settings or the requirement for two doctors' approval.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob, has been overturned after nearly two decades in prison, due to new evidence and re-examination of the original case. Working with the Loyola Project for the Innocent, new testing revealed inconsistencies in blood evidence and foreign DNA on key items. Initially convicted based on blood spatter in the bedroom and a syringe with her fingerprint and Bob's blood, Dorotik maintained her innocence throughout. The prosecution eventually conceded that the DNA evidence was significantly different from what was presented at trial, leading to the overturning of her conviction.</p>

After years of appeals, new evidence and re-examination of the case revealed that not every spot believed to be blood was tested, and some stains turned out not to be blood at all. In 2020, her conviction was overturned due to the new DNA evidence and issues with how the Sheriff's Crime Lab handled evidence.</p>
