          <h2>Indiana Fever Coach Suggests Caitlin Clark Offered to Cover Fine for Arguing with Officials</h2>

          <p>Indiana Fever head coach Stephanie White received a technical foul and a fine for yelling at officials during a recent game, and she has suggested that star player Caitlin Clark offered to pay for it. The incident occurred during a win against the Las Vegas Aces, a game Clark missed due to a groin injury. This event is part of a broader narrative of the team adopting a more rebellious and confident identity in Clark's second year. The article also notes other instances of the team's defiant attitude, including celebrations after their Commissioner's Cup win.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu was eliminated from Wimbledon in the third round but showed significant progress in a hard-fought match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka. Despite losing 7-6, 6-4, Raducanu went toe-to-toe with the three-time major champion, demonstrating a level of play that suggests she is closing the gap with the sport's elite. A tearful Raducanu expressed disappointment but also drew confidence from her performance, noting she felt much closer to the top players than before. Sabalenka praised Raducanu's effort, predicting the former US Open champion would soon return to the top 10.</p>

          <p>An article from the BBC explores whether crying at work is still viewed as a sign of weakness or if modern workplaces are becoming more accepting of emotional expression. It discusses how emotional intelligence is increasingly seen as a strength and that showing vulnerability can be powerful, even for senior leaders. However, some experts caution that a bias against showing emotion still exists in certain environments and could potentially affect career advancement. The piece includes anecdotes from various professionals, both men and women, highlighting a range of experiences and concluding that context and company culture are key factors.</p>

          <p>New research highlights the significant role of zooplankton in combating global warming through their unique life cycle in the Southern Ocean. These tiny creatures gorge on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the surface, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to hibernate, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. This process, known as the seasonal vertical migration pump, is estimated to sequester 65 million tonnes of carbon annually, equivalent to the emissions of about 55 million cars. The study underscores the importance of these "unsung heroes" in regulating the climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

          <p>Hamas has reportedly given a "positive response" to the latest U.S.-backed proposal for a ceasefire and hostage release deal in Gaza, stating it is ready to enter negotiations. However, a senior Palestinian official indicated that Hamas has requested key amendments, including a U.S. guarantee that hostilities will not resume if talks for a permanent end to the war fail. The proposal is believed to involve a 60-day ceasefire, the staggered release of Israeli hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners, and an increase in humanitarian aid. As the response was delivered, Israeli military operations continued across the Gaza Strip.</p>
