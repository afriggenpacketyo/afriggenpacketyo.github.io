          <p>Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown University researcher and Indian national, was released from an immigration detention center in Texas after a federal judge ruled the government lacked evidence to support his detention. Suri, who was never charged with a crime, had been detained for two months following his arrest by masked federal agents, who claimed he spread Hamas propaganda and promoted antisemitism on social media, claims his lawyers deny. Judge Patricia Giles stated the government failed to demonstrate Suri posed a threat to U.S. interests and ordered his immediate release. Suri will return home to Virginia while his legal challenge against deportation continues, marking the latest instance of scholars targeted by the Trump administration being freed from detention.</p>

          <p>Erik and Lyle Menendez have been resentenced to 50 years to life in prison, making them eligible for parole after serving over three decades for the 1989 killings of their parents. The brothers claim they acted in self-defense after years of alleged physical, sexual assault, and emotional abuse. Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman opposed the resentencing, while the brothers' attorney, Mark Geragos, praised the decision as a victory for justice and redemption. The California Board of Parole Hearings will conduct separate hearings in June to determine if the brothers should receive clemency, with Governor Gavin Newsom making the final decision.</p>

          <p>Democratic Rep. Shri Thanedar of Michigan withdrew his attempt to force a House vote on impeaching President Trump after facing opposition from his own party. Thanedar, who filed seven articles of impeachment against Mr. Trump in April, decided to add to his articles and seek broader support. Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin explained that consensus and strategy are necessary for impeachment, while Democratic caucus chair Rep. Pete Aguilar called the move impractical due to Republican control of Congress. Thanedar defended his action as supported by the public, while House Speaker Mike Johnson labeled it an "embarrassing political stunt."</p>

Moore, who was 40 during filming, said she wasn't prepared for the focus on her age and appearance, and ultimately decided to do the film after her daughters convinced her.</p>
