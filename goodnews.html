          <p>Chinese manufacturers are facing overcapacity issues due to weak domestic demand, leading to steep discounts on exports. This production overdrive is causing concern in Asia, as cheap Chinese imports could squeeze local industries. However, economists suggest that this influx of low-cost goods could ease inflationary pressures in other economies. This could lead to central banks in Asia decoupling from the Federal Reserve and implementing further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate and literary figure, is remembered for his contributions to literature and his opposition to Nazi rule, 150 years after his birth. Mann's works, including "Buddenbrooks" and "The Magic Mountain," explored themes of social change and political turmoil. As an exile from Germany, Mann used his writing and radio broadcasts to speak out against authoritarianism and the Holocaust. His legacy remains as a voice for democracy and a symbol of resistance against fascism.</p>

          <p>India's central bank unexpectedly cut its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest level since August 2022. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softened inflation and slower growth as reasons for the move. The decision followed better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. While the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate, it also shifted its monetary policy stance to "neutral" due to limited room for further easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new PwC report challenges common misconceptions about AI's impact on jobs and wages, finding that AI actually makes workers "more valuable, not less." The report analyzed over 800 million job ads and thousands of company financial reports, revealing that productivity and wages are growing in AI-exposed occupations. The study suggests that AI is creating jobs and enriching automatable tasks, ultimately making people more valuable. The report also suggests that softening job growth in AI-exposed occupations could be beneficial in countries with declining working-age populations.</p>
