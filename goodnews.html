          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk surged after its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, received accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat a serious liver disease known as MASH. This approval marks a significant expansion for the GLP-1 class of drugs beyond weight loss and diabetes, positioning Wegovy as the first authorized treatment for this condition affecting millions of U.S. adults. The company's stock also rose following an announcement to reduce the cash price of its related drug, Ozempic, increasing accessibility for patients.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The opening weekend of the Premier League season has revealed notable tactical shifts and challenges for top clubs. Arne Slot's Liverpool displayed potent attacking football but appeared highly vulnerable to counter-attacks, a significant departure from their defensive solidity last season. Meanwhile, Arsenal's new focus on direct, fast-paced attacks proved less effective against Manchester United, suggesting the team is still balancing its traditional possession-based style with a more transitional approach. These early games highlight how new personnel and strategic adjustments are already shaping the competitive landscape of the league.</p>

          <p>Mallory Contois, a VP of growth at the online learning startup Maven, attributes much of her career success to the practice of sending one "scary email" per week. She argues that sending ambitious cold emails to potential employers, mentors, or collaborators is a low-risk, high-reward strategy for professional growth. Contois, who landed her current role through such an email, advises keeping messages short, making the request easy to fulfill, and not being afraid to show genuine passion.

The rebranding includes dropping the iconic NBC peacock logo and establishing an independent newsgathering operation, signaling a new chapter for the channel.

Brown, who served for 18 years before a narrow loss in November, cited his opposition to President Trump's policies on tariffs and healthcare as motivation for his return to politics. His candidacy is expected to make the race in the increasingly Republican-leaning state more competitive, with the Cook Political Report shifting its rating from "likely Republican" to "lean Republican" following the announcement.</p>

          <p>China is closely observing the diplomatic maneuvers surrounding the war in Ukraine, particularly the recent meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin. Beijing, a key Russian ally, has called for a peaceful solution while analyzing Trump's negotiating tactics, which appear to prioritize a deal over specific terms, potentially involving territorial concessions from Ukraine. Analysts suggest that Trump's transactional approach is viewed favorably by China, which prefers to set aside political differences in international dealings, though his unpredictability also warrants caution.</p>

          <p>China's market for public cloud services supporting artificial intelligence grew by 55% in 2024, reaching a value of $2.7 billion, driven by massive demand for AI training and applications.

The rapid expansion is attributed to the shift from traditional AI applications to the development of large language models and agentic AI, which has significantly increased the need for robust cloud infrastructure and services.

          <p>China's electric vehicle (EV) sector is now leading a major push for overseas investment, a significant shift for a previously domestic-focused industry. A report by Rhodium Group indicates that in 2024, for the first time, Chinese EV companies invested more abroad than at home, as they seek to escape intense domestic competition and overcapacity. With local EV and battery factories operating at less than 50% capacity, this global expansion strategy reflects Beijing's ambition to build an offshore economic presence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The genre of disability memoirs is evolving, moving beyond inspirational tales of overcoming adversity or straightforward activist calls to action.

These works present disabled experience as a subject worthy of deep literary analysis, focusing on the gradations and contradictions of identity rather than providing simple, palatable stories for mainstream audiences.</p>

This partnership aims to commercialize new, smaller nuclear technology by having the private companies bear the financial risk of construction, while the TVA provides a stable revenue stream through a power purchase agreement.</p>
