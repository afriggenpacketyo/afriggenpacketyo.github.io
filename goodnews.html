          <p>The Trump administration has postponed any new tariff increases on Mexican imports for 90 days, maintaining the current 25% rate on goods like cars and a 50% rate on metals. This extension followed what President Trump described as a successful call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, aimed at providing time to negotiate a formal trade agreement. The U.S. seeks to address issues like cross-border crime and trade barriers, while Mexico has reportedly agreed to terminate its non-tariff barriers as part of the ongoing discussions.

          <p>The UK government has unveiled draft proposals to penalize large companies that consistently fail to pay their smaller suppliers on time, a practice blamed for the failure of thousands of businesses annually. Under the plan, the small business commissioner would gain the authority to fine firms with over 250 employees if they fail to pay a quarter of their invoices on time. The proposal also aims to cap invoice payment terms at a maximum of 60 days to improve cash flow for small businesses.</p>

          <h2>South Park's Latest Episode Uses Trump as a Vehicle to Satirize Parent Company Paramount</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent season premiere of "South Park" has drawn attention for its sharp satire, which uses former President Trump not as the primary target, but as a Trojan horse to critique its parent company, Paramount. The episode cleverly weaves in references to Paramount's recent settlement with Trump and the cancellation of "The Late Show With Stephen Colbert," framing them as issues of corporate capitulation. By using a provocative, AI-generated portrayal of Trump, the show's creators attracted widespread attention to the underlying industry drama, making a pointed commentary on corporate allegiances.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study suggests that the potato lineage originated from an ancient hybridization event between a tomato ancestor and a different nightshade plant from the Etuberosum group. This improbable union, occurring 8-9 million years ago, created a hybrid that possessed a novel trait neither parent had: the ability to form tubers. This evolutionary innovation allowed the proto-potato to thrive in colder, drier climates, colonize new environments, and diversify into over 100 species, including the modern cultivated potato, fundamentally changing our understanding of its origins.</p>
