          <p>A protracted slump in crude prices has ramped up the pressure on Big Oil's commitment to allocate cash to shareholders. Western energy supermajors have long sought to return cash to investors through buyback programs and dividends to keep their shareholders happy. Some analysts, however, are less convinced about Big Oil's pledge to return ever-higher shareholder returns, citing already stretched balance sheets and a sharp drop in crude prices. Recent market volatility has left the energy majors with "few economically attractive options" that allow for reinvestment while maintaining a competitive capital returns framework.
