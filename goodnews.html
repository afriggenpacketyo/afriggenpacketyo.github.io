          <p>This article is a digest of several news items. A U.S. Navy officer was indicted for his wife's murder in Japan, though Japanese authorities await official notification. Donald Trump hinted at resuming country-specific tariff rates. A historic Japanese sake brewery is offering courses for foreign sommeliers. A Chinese startup showcased applications of a race-winning humanoid robot, and a Bank of Japan board member suggested delaying interest rate hikes due to U.S. tariff risks.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" faced a setback in the House of Representatives as Republicans failed to advance the tax breaks and spending cuts package. Disagreements among Republicans include the extent of budget cuts, with some demanding steeper reductions to avoid increasing America's public debt. Contentious items include cuts to Medicaid, with some lawmakers arguing against any reductions to healthcare for lower-income constituents. Another point of contention is the proposed tripling of a local tax deduction, which some lawmakers from high-tax states find insufficient.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-16 20:10:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of a UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key negotiating points. The EU seeks a "youth mobility scheme" allowing citizens aged 18-30 to stay up to four years, but concerns exist about its impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another sticking point, with the EU pushing for an extension of current arrangements, while UK fishing groups want changes. Brexit has impacted both youth movement and fishing, with fewer EU students coming to the UK and challenges for UK fish exports to the EU.</p>

          <p>Tesla has changed its corporate bylaws to require shareholders to hold at least 3% of the company's stock to sue for breach of fiduciary duties, taking advantage of a Texas state law. This move follows Tesla's shift of incorporation from Delaware to Texas after a court ruling against Elon Musk's compensation package. Experts note this change creates a significant barrier for shareholders seeking legal action against Tesla insiders. The move comes as Tesla appeals the decision to rescind Musk's 2018 CEO compensation package.</p>

The judge rejected Wright and Chappell's challenges against extradition, and the case now goes to the home secretary. This would be the first time Japan has successfully received fugitives from the UK, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries.</p>

Marine biologist Dr Patrick Collins said that it's not unusual to find smooth-hounds in cities, and that this shark was probably just having its lunch, feeding on crabs in the river. The shark was observed swimming in the area for about 30 minutes before moving upstream and out of sight.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to lift all sanctions on Syria took senior officials at the Treasury Department by surprise. The announcement lacked specifics, leading to confusion and discussions within Treasury to determine the scope and pace of the rollback. The move came after months of lobbying from Syria's transitional government, which blamed sanctions for its economic struggles. Secretary of State Marco Rubio indicated relief may come in the form of waivers, allowing foreign partners to provide aid without facing penalties.</p>

          <p>President Trump has been actively engaged in foreign policy this week, brokering deals and lifting sanctions. The president's efforts include brokering peace deals, lifting sanctions on Syria, and engaging in trade negotiations. This week's flurry of activity reveals Trump's aim to prioritize trade over war and to project an image of American leadership on the world stage. However, some diplomats are skeptical of the substance behind the show, pointing to inconsistencies and potential negative consequences.</p>

          <p>Tyrrell Hatton is expected to be fined after a foul-mouthed outburst during his second round at the US PGA Championship. Hatton's outburst occurred after his drive found a water hazard. Jhonattan Vegas leads the tournament, which would be a surprise as he has no major top-10 finishes. Rory McIlroy made the cut despite a bogey-bogey finish, and Scottie Scheffler is also in contention. The article also notes other notable performances and exits from the tournament.</p>
