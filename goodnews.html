          <h2>Ether Price Nears Record High Following Powell's Rate Cut Signals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 13:00:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency Ether experienced a significant surge, nearing its record high, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's address at Jackson Hole, where he hinted at potential interest rate cuts. Powell's remarks, suggesting that a shift in policy stance might be warranted due to evolving economic risks, triggered a dovish market reaction, surprising many traders. This led to approximately $120 million in Ether short liquidations within an hour, further propelling the coin's price upward as traders scrambled to cover positions. Companies focused on accumulating Ether, which had been hit hard earlier, saw their shares rebound, reflecting a broader market optimism for rate-sensitive assets and a potential easing of monetary policy.</p>

          <p>Canada announced it would remove billions of dollars in retaliatory tariffs on US goods, a significant step following a recent phone call between Prime Minister Mark Carney and President Donald Trump. While key tariffs on autos, steel, and aluminum will persist, the decision, effective September 1, is intended to re-establish free trade for the vast majority of products exchanged between the two countries. The White House, deeming the move "long overdue," expressed a desire to continue discussions on trade and national security. This development unfolds ahead of a scheduled review for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, indicating a complex and evolving trade relationship.</p>

          <p>Florida State Senator Joe Gruters, a long-standing ally of President Trump and former chairman of the Florida Republican Party, has been unanimously elected as the new head of the Republican National Committee (RNC). Gruters steps into this leadership role, replacing Michael Whatley, who is pursuing a U.S. Senate bid, further highlighting the increasing influence of Florida Republicans within the national party and the broader administration. The RNC, currently well-funded with over $84 million, faces the challenge of expanding its majorities in the upcoming midterm elections. Gruters emphasized the importance of this mission, despite recent polls indicating that some of Trump's domestic policy agenda, such as the "One Big Beautiful Bill" extending tax cuts and boosting immigration enforcement, is unpopular with voters.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell delivered a "definitively dovish" speech at Jackson Hole, strongly signaling that interest rate cuts are on the horizon, with a high probability for September. While acknowledging the upside risks to inflation from tariffs, Powell's primary concern shifted to the increasingly precarious employment picture, stating that a policy adjustment may be warranted. This spurred significant market confidence, with the odds of a September cut surging to 91%. Economically sensitive cyclical stocks, especially in consumer discretionary, real estate, industrials, and materials sectors, experienced substantial rallies, even outperforming tech, as investors positioned for increased economic activity driven by lower borrowing costs.

Despite a valiant half-century from Phoenix captain Ellyse Perry, their pursuit was undermined by Shabnim Ismail's early wickets and an inability to forge substantial partnerships. This win provides a much-needed boost for Welsh Fire after a challenging start to their tournament campaign, highlighting their improved performance.</p>

          <p>Certificates of Deposit (CDs) continue to be a reliable and secure option for savers, offering guaranteed returns and principal protection, particularly with current interest rates hovering around the 4% range. A $10,000 deposit can yield substantial interest over time, with earnings varying based on the term chosen. For instance, a 3-month CD at 4.30% APY could earn approximately $107.50, whereas a 5-year CD at 4.20% APY might generate around $2,100. The decision on term length requires balancing immediate liquidity needs with the desire for higher long-term yields. Experts suggest that acting promptly to secure competitive rates may be beneficial, as future interest rate movements could see them decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have successfully recovered an array of 2,000-year-old artifacts, including ancient statues and Roman coins, from a sunken city located in Abu Qir Bay off the coast of Egypt. This significant discovery is believed to be an extension of Canopus, a prominent ancient city that flourished during the Ptolemaic dynasty and Roman Empire before being submerged by earthquakes and rising sea levels. The findings encompass limestone buildings, royal figures, sphinxes, and a merchant ship, providing invaluable insights into historical life and trade. While celebrating this rich underwater heritage, the article also draws a sobering parallel to modern Alexandria, which faces a similar threat from climate change and rising sea levels, with projections indicating a third of the city could be underwater by 2050.</p>

          <p>The 2025 summer box office surpassed last year's performance, projected to hit at least $3.75 billion, a 2% increase, with films like "Lilo & Stitch" and "Superman" leading the charge. Despite this, it fell short of the $4 billion pre-pandemic standard, primarily due to lingering effects of past production strikes and the absence of a singular, dominant blockbuster. Industry analysts, while noting solid second-quarter attendance, foresee a significant slowdown in ticket sales throughout August and October. Expectations are now heavily reliant on major late-November releases, including "Wicked: For Good" and "Zootopia 2," to stimulate a strong fourth quarter and reinvigorate the market.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell substantially increased expectations for a US interest rate cut in September during his address at Jackson Hole, a move that President Trump has consistently demanded. Powell suggested that the inflationary effects of Trump's tariffs might be temporary and underscored rising downside risks to employment, indicating that the current restrictive policy stance could require adjustment. Although he stopped short of a definitive promise, his dovish tone propelled US share prices significantly higher, with the S&P 500 index gaining around 1.5%. However, some economists, like Diane Swonk, caution that the Fed still harbors concerns about potential price increases, suggesting more nuance than the market's initial enthusiastic reaction.

          <p>Extreme summer heat is disproportionately impacting marginalized communities, particularly people of color and low-income residents, a stark inequality traced back to historical discriminatory housing policies like redlining. Environmental justice advocates emphasize that these vulnerable areas often lack sufficient green spaces, which are vital for mitigating high temperatures. Solutions involve expanding urban tree canopies, creating more parks, and implementing green rooftops, as seen in successful initiatives in Phoenix and New York City. Furthermore, data-driven strategies, such as redesigning bus stops with shade in Houston and Austin, are proving effective in reducing heat exposure. These efforts underscore the urgent need for inclusive climate planning to safeguard the well-being of all populations.</p>

Now an executive chef and co-owner of a Japanese-German restaurant, Bobby embodies the anxieties of a generation confronting evolving social norms and non-traditional career paths. The series skillfully uses Bobby and his father, Hank, as foils, illustrating generational clashes while preserving Bobby's inherently sweet and open-minded character. Pamela Adlon's voice acting subtly matures Bobby's distinctive vocal fry into a grown man's rasp, allowing him to confront new experiences and subtly echo his father's principled stance on issues like ethical nonmonogamy, bringing the show full circle with believable character growth.</p>

This perspective suggests that prioritizing American national interest over moral preening could lead to a lasting peace accord, saving countless lives and stabilizing Europe's eastern flank, despite the inherent difficulties of territorial compromise and establishing effective enforcement.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's recent indications of potential interest rate cuts signal positive news for homeowners hoping to refinance high-rate mortgages. Experts anticipate that if the Fed implements cuts, possibly as early as September, mortgage rates, which closely follow 10-year Treasury yields, will likely decrease. This reduction in borrowing costs could significantly benefit both prospective homebuyers seeking better loan terms and current homeowners looking to refinance or even sell. To capitalize on these opportunities, homeowners are advised to proactively prepare by checking credit reports, maintaining strong credit scores, estimating home equity, and gathering necessary financial documents to act quickly when favorable rates emerge.

Newsom's office has used this platform to mock figures like Kristi Noem and Ted Cruz, and to criticize Trump's policies, including the Texas redistricting plan. The governor defends his approach, asserting that if his social media behavior offends critics, they should direct similar scrutiny towards the original source.</p>
