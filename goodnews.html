          <p>Japan's Prime Minister has refrained from explicitly stating whether Japan supports U.S. attacks on Iran. This cautious approach suggests a nuanced diplomatic stance amid escalating tensions in the Middle East. The Prime Minister's reticence could be interpreted as a desire to maintain neutrality or to avoid endorsing military actions before fully assessing the situation. The focus remains on de-escalation and promoting peaceful resolutions in the region, reflecting Japan's commitment to stability.</p>

          <p>As artificial intelligence usage grows rapidly, concerns about harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements, are increasing. Researchers emphasize the need for regulations and thorough testing of AI models. Red teaming, involving experts testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is suggested as a valuable evaluation method. Standardized 'AI flaw' reports and incentives are recommended to improve understanding and management of risks posed by AI tools. Combining user-centered practices with governance and policy is crucial for assessing AI risks effectively.</p>

          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German citizenship has significantly increased, doubling in 2024. This trend is driven by factors such as Germany's citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship, as well as political repression and economic challenges in Turkey. Many Turks seek German citizenship for career opportunities, political participation, and visa-free travel. While integrated into German society, many still maintain strong cultural ties to Turkey and consider it their home, highlighting the complexities of identity and belonging for migrants.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The non-invasive test, called "miSignal," can assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer simultaneously. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, in urine samples. A survey using the test kits led to the detection and successful treatment of a tumor in the lungs of a woman who had not undergone lung cancer testing in several years.</p>

The study, led by Professor Li Lei, redefines the understanding of metabolic phases in yeast, reorganizing it into four distinct yet interconnected phases. These phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. The research provides new insights into the complex processes governing cell life cycles.</p>
