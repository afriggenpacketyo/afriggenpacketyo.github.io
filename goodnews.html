          <p>A 440-foot cargo ship ran aground in Norway, narrowly missing a cabin as its owner slept, with reports suggesting the helmsman was also asleep at the time of the incident. The NCL Salten sailed onto shore near Johan Helberg's cabin, causing damage to a heating pipe. None of the 16 crew members were injured, and Norwegian police have launched an investigation. The shipping company stated that the same ship had run aground twice before.</p>
