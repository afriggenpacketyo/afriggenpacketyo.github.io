          <h2>Federal Courts Face Scrutiny Over Venue Shopping for Nationwide Injunctions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 23:12:30 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CBS News analysis reveals that lawyers are increasingly engaging in venue shopping, seeking out federal jurisdictions with judges sympathetic to their views on divisive political issues, with conservatives often filing challenges to the Biden administration in small Texas courts. The Supreme Court is now considering whether a single federal judge should be able to dictate policy for the entire country through nationwide injunctions. Experts argue that while forum shopping is inevitable, judge shopping is problematic because litigants know exactly which judge they will get, potentially undermining the impartiality of the court system. The Judicial Conference has recommended a random case-assignment policy to limit the practice.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's economy contracted by 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp fall in exports, according to preliminary government data. The GDP data was worse than expected, with exports falling 0.6% quarter-on-quarter, influenced by uncertainties stemming from U.S. trade policies. Despite the contraction, domestic demand showed a "bright spot," growing by 0.6%, and the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current stance on interest rates, anticipating a "reasonable deal with the U.S." to mitigate the tariff impact. The Bank of Japan also warned of downside risks to the economy from U.S. trade policy, but seems set to continue raising its policy rate.</p>

          <p>China is experiencing the world's fastest rise in dementia cases, with projections estimating up to 115 million cases by 2050, according to research published in PLOS One. The number of dementia patients in China rose from about 4 million in 1990 to 17 million by 2021, and is expected to continue increasing due to the country's rapidly aging population. Researchers analyzed data from the Global Burden of Disease database and found that dementia incidence, prevalence, and mortality rates have doubled globally between 1990 and 2021, but tripled in China during the same period.</p>

The company is seeking certification from the US Federal Aviation Administration, hoping to have the air taxis ready for commercial use by the time of the Games.

          <p>Northern California's commercial crab season is under threat due to migrating humpback whales becoming entangled in crab fishing ropes, leading to injuries and deaths. To mitigate this, some fishermen are using high-tech systems involving remote-controlled pop-up devices to retrieve crab cages, reducing the amount of rope needed. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife has shortened the crab season to protect whales, and is sponsoring experiments with the pop-up technology. While some fishermen are critical of the new technology due to tradition and cost, others have found it effective in preventing whale entanglements.</p>

          <p>A military parade planned to mark the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with President Trump's birthday, is estimated to cost between $25 million and $45 million. The parade, set to take place in Washington, D.C., is expected to include over 100 vehicles and thousands of soldiers, with the White House stating that the cost will be shared by the Department of the Army and the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission. The plans have drawn criticism from Democrats, who view the event as a wasteful display of ego.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Decision to Lift Syria Sanctions Surprises Treasury Staff</h2>

          <p>President Trump's announcement to lift all sanctions on Syria took Treasury Department officials by surprise, creating confusion about the specific measures and timeline for the rollback. The decision followed months of lobbying by Syria's transitional government, which argued that sanctions were hindering reconstruction and economic recovery. While some work had been underway at Treasury for incremental sanctions relief, the sweeping nature of Trump's announcement prompted discussions to determine the extent and pace of the changes.</p>

          <p>Ben Roberts-Smith, Australia's most-decorated living soldier, has lost an appeal against a defamation judgment that found he committed war crimes, marking the first time a court has assessed claims of war crimes by Australian forces. The civil trial stemmed from news articles alleging that Roberts-Smith murdered four unarmed Afghans, claims he maintains his innocence. The Federal Court upheld the original verdict, with Roberts-Smith, who left the defence force in 2013, maintaining his innocence.</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are set to debate an assisted dying bill for the first time since significant changes were made, including removing the need for a High Court judge to sign off on each request. The bill, which would allow some terminally ill adults to choose to end their own lives, has undergone six months of intense scrutiny by a parliamentary committee. The government has also quietly made changes to its impact assessment on assisted dying, admitting errors in calculating how many people could take up the service if it becomes law.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is considering limiting the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions against unconstitutional government actions, with oral arguments focusing on President Trump's executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship. The case hinges on whether federal courts can block presidential actions for the entire country, a power that has been used to challenge policies of both Democratic and Republican administrations. The debate centers on balancing the executive branch's duties with the need to check potentially unconstitutional actions, with concerns raised about creating inconsistent laws across different federal districts.</p>
