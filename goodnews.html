        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, annual growth in UK employees' average earnings slowed to 4.7% in the three months to August, down from 4.8% previously. The national unemployment rate saw a slight increase to 4.8%, primarily driven by younger people. While private sector earnings growth was at a four-year low, it remained ahead of inflation, and economists suggest this indicates a steadying labor market with easing cost pressures. The data will likely influence the upcoming state pension increase under the triple lock policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of LG Electronics India soared over 45% on their first day of trading, resulting in the subsidiary's market capitalization briefly surpassing that of its South Korean parent company. The successful debut followed an initial public offering that was the most heavily subscribed in India since 2008, attracting bids worth nearly $50 billion. The IPO, priced at the top of its range, raised $1.3 billion for the parent company, which sold a portion of its existing shares. This strong performance highlights the continued strength and depth of India's capital markets, which remain among the world's busiest for IPOs this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 16-year-old from Inverclyde, Scotland, is advocating for mandatory CPR training in all Scottish schools after losing both of his parents to heart conditions. The teenager, Cameron McGerr, believes that knowing CPR could have potentially saved his father, who suffered a cardiac arrest earlier this year. He has already successfully persuaded his own school to introduce the training and has now taken his "Pulse of Life" campaign to the Scottish Parliament. His personal and moving testimony has garnered support, and he is now scheduled to meet with the Education Secretary to discuss a nationwide rollout of the life-saving skill.</p>

          <p>Tuesday's British newspaper front pages were dominated by the news of a ceasefire in Gaza and the accompanying release of hostages held for over two years. Headlines such as "Freed from hell" and "Two years of torment over" captured the emotional relief of the moment, with many papers featuring powerful images of hostages reuniting with their families. The coverage also highlighted Donald Trump's role in the deal, with some outlets framing it as a major diplomatic achievement while others cautioned that lasting peace remains uncertain. The collective media reaction underscores the profound impact of the event on both Israelis and Palestinians.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has intensified his call for the implementation of a targeted national screening program for prostate cancer in the UK. Acting as an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak argues that a focused program is affordable, deliverable, and would save many lives. The proposed plan would prioritize men at higher risk, such as those with a family history and Black men, using a combination of MRI scans and PSA tests. His advocacy comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the potential for over-treatment.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Peking University have successfully used artificial intelligence to restore a complete version of "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess," a renowned 4th-century Chinese calligraphy work by Wang Xianzhi. Only about a quarter of the original masterpiece had survived over the centuries. By analyzing the style of the remaining 250 characters, the research team's AI model was able to replicate the calligrapher's distinct form and generate the missing text, resulting in a full scroll of 919 characters. The project is being hailed as a significant example of how AI can be fused with cultural preservation to give ancient art new life.</p>

          <p>In an effort to increase the number of blood donors, particularly among young people, the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) is partnering with NHS Blood and Transplant. As part of the new initiative, individuals applying for a driving licence will receive an email with a link encouraging them to register as a blood donor. Officials hope this will reach millions of potential new donors annually, addressing the fact that over half of current regular donors are over 45. The campaign aims to replicate the success of a similar long-standing program that has successfully encouraged organ donor registration through the DVLA.</p>

Despite stranding numerous runners and a costly baserunning error, the Dodgers secured the win through key performances from their highly-paid stars, including a go-ahead home run by Freddie Freeman and a dominant pitching performance by Blake Snell. The article contrasts the Dodgers' ability to purchase top-tier talent with the Brewers' smaller-market approach. The win demonstrates how a team's financial might can be a decisive factor in overcoming mistakes and winning crucial postseason games.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers won the opening game of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers 2-1, largely thanks to a masterful performance by pitcher Blake Snell. Snell pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out ten batters. The victory came despite a chaotic and confusing fourth-inning play where a potential grand slam was nullified by a bizarre double play due to baserunning unawareness. A sixth-inning solo home run by Freddie Freeman provided the decisive run, and the Dodgers' bullpen held on in a tense ninth inning to secure the crucial series-opening win.</p>

          <p>A former RAF navigator and lawyer who lost much of her ability to speak after a traumatic brain injury has found a new way to communicate by learning British Sign Language (BSL). The woman, Tina, sustained the injury in a fall in 2018 that left her in a coma for six weeks. She says learning BSL has helped her relax and find words when speaking is difficult. Her journey was featured in a BBC series where deaf actress Rose Ayling-Ellis taught BSL to older residents at her retirement village, showing how sign language can benefit people beyond the deaf community, including those with communication challenges.</p>

The dialogue occurred even as new retaliatory measures, such as port fees and sanctions, have been implemented by both sides. The talks suggest that channels for communication remain open, though significant friction persists over issues like U.S. investigations into Chinese industries and China's export controls on rare earths.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 2.9% year-on-year in the third quarter, surpassing economists' forecasts of 1.9%, though this was a slowdown from the previous quarter's 4.5% expansion. The growth was tempered by a flattening manufacturing sector and softer performance in construction. In response to the data, the Monetary Authority of Singapore maintained its current policy settings but warned that GDP growth is expected to moderate to a near-trend pace in 2026. The central bank projects that core inflation will ease in the short term before gradually rising, expecting it to average around 0.5% for 2025. (not investment advice)</p>
