          <p>China is allowing Indian pilgrims to visit Tibet again after a five-year suspension due to COVID-19 and border tensions, a move some hope will ease strained relations between the two countries. The pilgrimages, involving treks to Mount Kailash and Lake Mansarovar, are significant to Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Bon followers. This year, over 5,500 people applied, with 750 selected to travel between June and August. Yang Yabo from the Tibet Academy of Social Sciences suggests these pilgrimages have historically helped stabilize China-India relations during crises, providing a positive step towards improved diplomacy in the region.</p>

          <p>Shares of Pop Mart, the Chinese toy company known for its Labubu dolls, experienced a decline after Morgan Stanley removed the stock from its China and Hong Kong focus list. The stock had previously seen significant gains this year, driven by the popularity of its "blind box" concept, but analysts suggested that the market may have already factored in Pop Mart's exponential growth. Despite the removal from the focus list, Morgan Stanley had previously raised its price target on the toy company, anticipating continued long-term growth. Pop Mart has been rapidly expanding overseas, establishing online sales platforms and physical stores in various countries.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, maintained its benchmark lending rates, holding the 1-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. This decision follows recent monetary easing measures and a trade deal with the U.S., which has alleviated some growth concerns. The trade truce between the U.S. and China has provided Beijing with more flexibility to support its currency and address economic challenges. Analysts suggest that Chinese authorities may adopt a more restrained approach to interest rate cuts, exploring alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>
