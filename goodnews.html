        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Urban heat islands are metropolitan areas that become significantly hotter than surrounding rural areas, a phenomenon caused by the concentration of heat-absorbing materials like concrete and asphalt. This effect can raise temperatures by up to 15 degrees Celsius, intensifying heatwaves for the more than half of the world's population living in cities. The article explains that factors like tall buildings trapping heat and pollution creating a greenhouse layer contribute to the problem. Solutions include increasing green spaces, installing reflective "cool roofs," and using permeable pavements to mitigate the heat.</p>

          <p>As boating accidents rise, a safety expert has issued warnings and life-saving tips for boaters, particularly ahead of the busy July Fourth holiday. Captain Geoff Fahringer, a career law enforcement officer and U.S. Coast Guard captain, identified operator inexperience as a primary cause of accidents, citing dangerous practices like overloading boats and not using life jackets. According to 2023 Coast Guard data, 75 percent of fatal boating accident victims drowned, with most not wearing a life jacket. The article stresses the importance of training, safety checklists, and carrying a VHF radio for emergencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have combined genetic data and archeological evidence to trace the origins of Uralic-speaking peoples, solving a long-standing linguistic and historical mystery. The study, published in Nature, analyzed ancient genomes to map the migration of these populations from Siberia across Eurasia between 11,000 and 4,000 years ago. This research provides a 'genetic tracer,' showing how groups spread west to the Baltic region and east into Asia, bringing with them the Uralic language family and technological advancements. The findings connect the roughly 25 million modern Uralic speakers to their ancestral roots.</p>

Researchers are exploring theories about why the inhabitants of this particular fort had such large feet, questioning if they came from a specific region.

The author contends that Kershaw's longevity, superior numbers in key statistical categories like wins and strikeouts, and his role as the cornerstone of the modern Dodgers era outweigh his postseason struggles.

          <p>Astronomers have officially confirmed the discovery of a third interstellar object, designated 3I/Atlas, currently speeding through our Solar System. The object, classified as a comet, is believed to be the largest such visitor yet detected, estimated at 10-20 kilometers wide, and poses no threat to Earth. It was first spotted by the ATLAS survey in Chile, with its trajectory traced back through past telescope data. This discovery offers scientists a rare opportunity to study material from outside our Solar System as the object makes its closest approach to the Sun in October.</p>

          <p>Armenia is looking to elevate its relationship with China to a strategic partnership as it continues to diversify its foreign policy beyond its traditional alliance with Russia. In an interview, Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan stated that both nations are ready to deepen relations without limitations. This diplomatic push follows Armenia's frustration with Russia's inaction during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh war and its subsequent withdrawal from the Moscow-led military alliance. Unlike its Caucasus neighbors Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia has not yet established a formal strategic partnership with Beijing.</p>
