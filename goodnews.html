          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 14:06:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees may use a specific type of reverse mortgage, known as a HECM for Purchase loan, to buy a new primary residence without incurring monthly payments. This financial tool allows seniors to leverage their home equity, combining a significant down payment from their own funds with the loan to cover the remaining cost. Eligibility requirements include being at least 62 years old, completing HUD-approved counseling, and being able to cover ongoing property expenses like taxes and insurance. While this option offers financial flexibility, it is best suited for those planning to remain in the new home long-term.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collection of thirty paintings by the beloved television artist Bob Ross will be auctioned to raise money for public television stations struggling with federal funding cuts. The proceeds are intended to help smaller, rural stations afford licensing fees for popular programming, ensuring continued access for their communities. Ross, who hosted "The Joy of Painting," was a public television icon, and organizers stated the auction honors his legacy of making art accessible to everyone. The collection, featuring works created during his show, is estimated to be worth over $850,000.</p>

          <p>Two organizers of the 2022 "Freedom Convoy" protests in Canada, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, have been given 18-month conditional sentences, sparing them additional time in prison. The two were found guilty of mischief for their roles in the weeks-long blockade of Ottawa that protested COVID-19 mandates and the government. Their sentences include 12 months of home confinement followed by six months under a curfew, plus community service. The protests, which paralyzed the nation's capital, ended after the government invoked the Emergencies Act for the first time in Canadian history.</p>

Delgado will be the primary voice in Draper's team as he prepares for the upcoming season after an arm injury limited his play. This move is part of a strategic team restructuring for Draper, who aims to build on his recent successes, including winning his first Masters 1000 title. James Trotman, Draper's coach for the past four years, will remain with the team in a reduced capacity.</p>

          <p>During a meeting at the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump described ongoing trade talks with Canada as "complicated" but expressed confidence that Canada would ultimately be "very happy" with the outcome. He highlighted the competitive nature of their economic relationship, particularly in the automotive and steel industries. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney conveyed optimism about reaching a fair agreement, emphasizing the deep economic ties between the two nations. The discussions come as Canada remains the only G7 country without a finalized trade deal with the Trump administration this year.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy installation in Northeast Philadelphia, home to over 1,000 civilian and military personnel, plays a crucial role in supporting the nation's naval aircraft fleet. Many employees, like Richard Flanagan, are locals with deep family ties to the base, expressing immense pride in contributing to national security from their hometown. Staff Sgt. Genelle Marte, another Philadelphia native, returned to the base after serving worldwide and is excited for the city to host the upcoming 250th birthday celebrations for the U.S. Navy and Marines.

          <p>Orlando International Airport (MCO) is actively preparing for the integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, often referred to as 'flying cars' or air taxis. This advanced air mobility aims to transport passengers over short distances, offering an alternative to congested roadways like I-4. Airport officials are working with the FAA, which is currently certifying the aircraft, and have identified potential 'vertiport' locations for takeoff and landing. If regulatory approvals proceed as planned, Orlando could become one of the first U.S. airports to launch this futuristic mode of travel.</p>

          <p>In his "Dear James" advice column, James Parker responds to a reader, an atheist, who feels weary and ungracious for being irritated by common religious phrases like "God has a plan." The reader questions why believers often assume a shared faith, while nonbelievers are expected to be more accommodating. Parker, who identifies as a believer, acknowledges the irritating nature of such platitudes but suggests viewing them with generosity. He advises that these phrases are often just how people try to make sense of things and recommends not being annoyed, as everyone's beliefs are ultimately tested.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has outlined a compensation plan for millions of drivers affected by the mis-selling of car finance, proposing an average payout of around £700 per agreement. The scheme addresses unfair discretionary commission arrangements, which incentivized dealers to charge higher interest rates on 14 million agreements between 2007 and 2024. Lenders could face a total compensation bill of £8.2 billion under the proposal. The FCA stated the plan aims to provide fair compensation to customers who were overcharged, though the proposed average payout is lower than some previous estimates.</p>
