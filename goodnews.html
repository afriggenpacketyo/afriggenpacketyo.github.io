        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Xpeng's Hong Kong shares are expected to continue their nearly 80% rally this year, driven by new model releases and a move toward profitability. The Chinese electric-vehicle maker's shares surged after upbeat earnings and a strong revenue forecast for the second quarter. First-quarter revenue more than doubled, fueled by robust sales, narrowing the net loss and improving the gross margin. Analysts predict Xpeng will break even in the fourth quarter of 2025, with a strong product cycle driving sales, maintaining a buy rating on the stock with a target price significantly higher than its current trading value.</p>

          <p>The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, after an all-night session and negotiations, with a 215-214 vote. The bill, addressing tax, defense, and energy priorities, now moves to the Senate, where opposition is expected. The legislation includes changes to Medicaid work requirements and renewable energy tax credits, aiming to satisfy various factions within the Republican party. Democrats opposed the package, criticizing it as a "reckless, regressive and reprehensible GOP tax scam," while House Speaker Mike Johnson touted the bill as a victory that "gets Americans back to winning again."</p>

          <p>ASML's new High NA chipmaking machine, costing over $400 million, is transforming microchip manufacturing. The machine, larger than a double-decker bus, is assembled in the Netherlands and shipped in multiple parts to customers like Intel, TSMC, and Samsung. High NA is the latest generation of ASML's EUV machines, essential for manufacturing advanced microchips used by companies like Nvidia and Apple. The technology improves chip performance, speed, and yield, reducing costs and enabling the production of more devices per wafer, and ASML has reduced the power needed per wafer exposure by more than 60% since 2018.</p>

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has added to the narrative of Bitcoin as a hedge against fiat instability. Positive regulatory developments and support from U.S. President Donald Trump have also contributed to the market's optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House passed a provision to raise the federal deduction cap for state and local taxes (SALT) to $40,000 as part of President Trump's tax package. This change, up from the current $10,000 limit, would primarily benefit filers in high-tax states like New York, New Jersey, and California. The SALT cap phases out over $500,000 and increases annually by 1% from 2026 through 2033. However, reduced itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket could offset some of the benefits, and the proposal still faces challenges in the Senate.

This decline was attributed to fewer people coming to work and study following Conservative government changes and the departure of those who arrived on study visas after the pandemic. There was also a large drop in dependents accompanying visa holders. The Home Office reported a decrease in asylum seekers housed in hotels, although the number remains higher than when Labour took power.</p>
