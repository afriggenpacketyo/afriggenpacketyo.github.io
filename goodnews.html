          <p>Tesla experienced a sales rebound in Australia in May, reaching its highest level in nearly 12 months, driven by strong Model Y sales. Australian sales of the Model Y soared 122.5% year over year, while sales of the company's Model 3 dropped significantly. Total deliveries in Australia were up just 9.3% year over year but surged over 675% from April when the company sold only 500 EVs. Despite this, Tesla's overall sales in Australia remain down 48.2% year-to-date compared to last year, indicating ongoing global headwinds for the company.</p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated in Cologne as experts defused three unexploded World War II bombs. The operation, one of the largest in the city's history, involved closing off a significant portion of the city center. The evacuated area included the old city, hotels, care homes, and the railway station in Deutz. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city's heavy bombing during World War II, including the British Royal Air Force's first "thousand-bomber raid" in 1942.</p>

          <p>Fran Kirby has retired from her England career due to a series of injuries and illnesses that have plagued her career. Kirby's talent has never been questioned, and she will go down as one of England's greatest servants. Knee and ankle issues began in 2017, then two years later she needed treatment for pericarditis. Her fitness concerns played a part in Wiegman's decision not to take her to Switzerland, and Kirby knew that was her last opportunity to play in another major tournament.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy's performance in the Dodgers' win over the Mets was a mix of highs and lows, marked by both offensive prowess and defensive errors. He hit two home runs, including a game-tying shot in the ninth inning, but also committed a costly error at third base. Muncy's recent offensive surge has been compensating for his defensive struggles, as he's batting .314 with eight home runs in his last 22 games. Freddie Freeman ultimately secured the win with a walk-off double in the 10th inning.</p>

          <p>The UK has been granted an exemption from the increased 50% tariffs on US steel and aluminum imports, but the White House has warned that this is conditional. The exemption depends on the ratification of the May trade pact between the two countries. Donald Trump's executive order states that the secretary may adjust the tariff rates if the UK does not comply with the economic prosperity deal. The UK steel industry has responded cautiously, welcoming the reprieve but expressing concerns about uncertainty over final tariff rates.</p>

The trend has led to an influx of skilled individuals into China's science and technology sectors, boosting the country's research and development capabilities.</p>
