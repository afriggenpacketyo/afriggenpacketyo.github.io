          <p>The Group of Seven (G7) leaders have launched an action plan aimed at mitigating risks associated with critical mineral supply chains, which are often excessively dependent on China. This plan involves increased cooperation among G7 nations and with other aligned countries to safeguard economic security against market manipulation. The strategy includes monitoring for shortages, coordinating responses to market disruptions, and promoting diversification and domestic production of essential minerals, with a roadmap for standards-based markets expected by year-end. The G7 also emphasized the importance of stable relations with China, while urging the country to avoid market distortions and overcapacity.</p>

Matthew Tkachuk declared the Panthers a dynasty, highlighting their consistent presence in the finals and their improved health compared to their previous loss in 2023.

The Panthers' core players, bolstered by trade deadline acquisitions, proved to be a formidable force throughout the playoffs, leading the team to their second consecutive Stanley Cup title.

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on passport applications. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals applying for new passports, renewals, or changes to name or sex designation can choose their identified gender. The ruling expands on a previous decision and counters President Trump's policy that reversed a Biden administration directive allowing self-selection of gender and an "X" designation. The ACLU, representing transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs, argued the policy was discriminatory, leading to the judge's finding that the administration failed to justify the policy's rationale.</p>

A new study mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, revealing that some creatures will find new habitats in biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, static species like sea pens and the ocean quahog clam may struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The analysis aims to guide government efforts to protect species in Marine Protected Areas as their habitats shift.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have clarified that singer Nezza is welcome back at Dodger Stadium after she sang the national anthem in Spanish, despite initial requests for her to sing it in English. Nezza's performance occurred on the same day as protests against President Trump's immigration policies, and she stated that she wanted to represent her community. While Nezza initially believed she was banned after receiving a call discouraging her from future performances, the Dodgers have reaffirmed that she is not banned. The team spokesperson confirmed she is welcome back at the stadium.</p>
