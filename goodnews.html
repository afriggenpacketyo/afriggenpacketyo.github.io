          <p>Pfizer has raised its adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and strong business performance throughout the year. The pharmaceutical company's second-quarter earnings and revenue significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to the revised outlook. The new forecast accounts for potential impacts from President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. Pfizer's net income saw a substantial increase compared to the same period last year, reflecting a robust financial position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent primary victory of New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has sparked a significant increase in interest among young progressives to run for political office. Run for Something, an organization that supports younger candidates, reported its largest-ever organic surge in sign-ups following Mamdani's win. Aspiring candidates cite his campaign's focus on issues like cost of living and housing, as well as his authentic, voter-first approach, as a source of inspiration. This phenomenon, dubbed the "Mamdani effect," suggests a growing desire for a different style of politics centered on community needs rather than traditional party structures.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has released over $5 billion in federal education funds after a four-week freeze sparked significant backlash from educators and lawmakers across the political spectrum. The funding, which supports programs for teacher training, after-school activities, and English-learners, was initially withheld for a review into alleged misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda." However, pressure from both rural and urban school districts, along with Republican and Democratic officials, led to the reversal. The episode highlights the political challenges of cutting popular education programs, even in areas that strongly support the president.</p>

          <p>State-owned oil giant Saudi Aramco reported a drop in second-quarter revenues, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and refined chemical products. Despite the profit decline, the company's adjusted net income of $24.5 billion surpassed analyst forecasts. CEO Amin Nasser expressed strong optimism for the second half of the year, projecting that oil demand will increase by over two million barrels per day. The company is maintaining its capital expenditure guidance and focusing on cost efficiency and a significant expansion of its gas production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's prolonged property market downturn may be approaching its end, according to analysts who point to a resumption of credit flow to developers and a decrease in the inventory of unsold homes. Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast, now predicting a smaller decline in new home sales for the year than previously anticipated. The market has seen rapid consolidation, with state-owned developers increasing their market share, a factor that HSBC suggests has helped stabilize the sector. These positive indicators suggest the crisis may be less severe than the "lost decade" some investors had feared. (not investment advice)</p>

Attorney General Rob Bonta stated that for every dollar spent, the state has protected $33,600 in federal funding that the administration attempted to block. These funds are designated for essential services like education, healthcare, and disaster recovery. Bonta and Governor Gavin Newsom framed the lawsuits as a necessary defense of both California's funding and its core values of inclusivity and equity against ideological attacks from the federal government.</p>

Ramsey, who is Emmy-nominated for the role, describes how stepping into the lead required extensive stunt training and a deeper exploration of their character, Ellie. A key part of Ellie's evolution was her burgeoning relationship with Dina and the protective instincts it fostered. As the first out nonbinary actor to receive multiple Emmy nominations, Ramsey hopes their visibility helps other gender-nonconforming people feel seen.</p>

          <p>South Korea has started removing the loudspeakers used to broadcast anti-Pyongyang propaganda across the demilitarized zone, a significant step in the new liberal government's efforts to ease tensions. The broadcasts, which include everything from K-pop music to weather reports, have been a source of friction for decades and were suspended in June. President Lee Jae Myung's administration has framed reconciliation as an economic benefit, aiming to reduce the geopolitical risk associated with the Korean peninsula. However, with relations at a low point, it is uncertain if this gesture alone will lead to a diplomatic breakthrough.</p>

The Dutch government is contributing €500 million for the acquisition of Patriot missile parts and other defense systems to support Ukraine's frontline efforts. This new scheme, called the Prioritized Ukraine Requirements List (PURL), was announced last month by President Trump and NATO's Secretary-General. It allows NATO allies to fund the procurement of U.S. defense equipment, which is then transferred to Ukraine, ensuring continued military support while distributing the financial burden among partners.</p>
