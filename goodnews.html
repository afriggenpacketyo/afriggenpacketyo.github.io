          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union have reached an agreement to reset their relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. The agreement was reached during a summit in London hosted by U.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The discussions covered contentious issues such as youth mobility schemes and fishing rights. The deal includes reciprocal access to fishing waters, energy cooperation, and a security and defense partnership, signaling a new era of collaboration between the two entities, particularly in the face of global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Contrary to stereotypes, many Gen Z professionals are leading the return-to-office trend, driven by a desire to climb the corporate ladder and learn from experienced colleagues. A recent study by JLL found that young workers are in the office more often than other generations. These young professionals view the office as a launchpad for their careers, seeking in-person interaction to develop corporate norms and build relationships.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Domestic energy prices in the UK are forecast to decrease in July, marking the first drop in regulator Ofgem's price cap in a year. Analysts at Cornwall Insight predict that a typical household's annual energy bill will fall by ¬£129, a decrease of nearly 7%. This reduction would bring the typical annual bill for a dual-fuel customer paying by direct debit to ¬£1,720, down from the current level of ¬£1,849. The price cap is based on the cost per unit of energy, so total bills will still vary based on consumption.</p>
