          <p>Chinese researchers have developed LICOMK++, a high-resolution ocean simulation system, despite US semiconductor export controls. This system, dubbed an ocean "microscope," allows scientists to analyze ocean dynamics and climate patterns with unprecedented precision. It enhances predictions for extreme weather events and aids in disaster response strategies and coastal resilience planning. The innovation highlights China's determination to achieve technological self-reliance and contribute to global climate research, as climate-related economic losses increase worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is holding midterm elections, viewed as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte. The elections will decide over 18,000 jobs, including seats in the House of Representatives, and will influence the impeachment trial of Duterte. The feuding between Marcos and Duterte escalated after Duterte was impeached for alleged "high crimes" and her father, former president Rodrigo Duterte, was arrested by the ICC. Security has been tightened due to the history of violence during Philippine elections.</p>

          <p>President Trump plans to sign an executive order directing the U.S. to pay the same price for some drugs as other nations, reviving a previously unsuccessful effort. The order aims to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctor's offices to the lowest price paid by other countries. The proposal is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues that it would stifle innovation. The administration intends to target certain drugs covered by Medicare Part B, with the goal of providing relief to older Americans.</p>
