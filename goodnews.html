        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester United is exploring a last-minute deal for Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez, ahead of the transfer deadline. The club has been seeking to resolve its goalkeeping situation and was also in talks with Royal Antwerp for the younger Senne Lammens. However, Martinez's extensive Premier League and international experience presents a more seasoned option compared to Lammens. The potential move comes after United's head coach acknowledged the current difficulties of the goalkeeping position at the club.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide surge in popularity, fueled by social media trends highlighting its health benefits and a post-pandemic tourism boom, has turned matcha into a high-demand commodity. This has led to significant price increases and supply shortages, even in Japan, its country of origin. Japanese tea producers are struggling to keep up, as cultivating the specific tea leaves for matcha is labor-intensive, and aging farming communities face production bottlenecks. Consequently, retailers are rationing supplies, and major companies like Ito En are raising prices to manage soaring raw material costs. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has issued a warning to parents about the critical importance of school attendance at the start of the new term. New data reveals that over half of the students who missed school during the first week of the 2024 academic year became "persistently absent," a rate far higher than for those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, it remains below pre-COVID levels, prompting the government to launch initiatives like attendance and behaviour hubs. Officials stress that consistent attendance is vital for children's future life chances.</p>

          <p>In a notable collaboration, Beijing-based CAS Space successfully launched two small satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup from Tijuana. The mission, which placed two "femtosatellites" weighing less than 100 grams each into orbit, marks a significant entry for China into the North American commercial launch market. ThumbSat aims to demonstrate that small satellites can be meaningful and plans to establish low-cost receiving stations across Mexico for educational and amateur use. CAS Space highlighted the launch as a step forward in expanding China's international space cooperation, balancing cost and reliability.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Toni Morrison's Insights on Fascism Highlight Black History as a Model for Resistance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article reflects on Toni Morrison's 1995 speech at Howard University, where she described the creeping steps of fascism and linked it to America's history of racism. The author argues that Morrison's genealogical approach, tracing fascism's roots in American slavery rather than just making political analogies to European history, provides a crucial lens for understanding current political threats. The article posits that Black history offers a powerful model for combating authoritarianism through persistent belief in democratic ideals, diverse forms of resistance, and unwavering faith. It concludes that these historical struggles provide a blueprint for defending democracy today.</p>

          <p>The Democratic Party is currently facing historically low public approval ratings, with many voters perceiving the party as "weak." However, some strategists see reasons for optimism, pointing to a growing lead in polls for the upcoming congressional elections and the unpopularity of President Trump. Potential presidential candidates are actively competing to be the strongest voice against the current administration. While the party remains divided on strategy and messaging, there is a consensus on the need to reconnect with working-class voters and focus on economic issues like affordability to regain political momentum.</p>

          <p>As the UK experiences hotter summers, more Britons are turning to air conditioning, sparking a debate about its environmental impact and running costs. Sales of portable AC units have risen significantly, but concerns persist over the high electricity consumption and the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), potent greenhouse gases. Experts advise opting for energy-efficient models and proper disposal to mitigate environmental harm. While AC can improve comfort and productivity, its affordability remains a barrier, prompting calls for government schemes to include more efficient cooling and heating solutions like air-to-air heat pumps.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a pivotal meeting, pledging to enhance their relationship and prevent their long-standing border dispute from defining their ties. This marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years and signals a significant thaw after deadly border clashes in 2020; as a tangible step, direct flights are set to resume. The rapprochement is strategically timed, as both nations are facing significant trade tariffs from the United States, creating a shared incentive to bolster economic cooperation and present a unified front within the Global South.</p>

          <p>England and Chelsea defender Millie Bright has described her decision to withdraw from the Euro 2025 squad as the best she has ever made for her well-being. After a demanding season where she helped Chelsea secure a domestic treble, the 32-year-old felt she was on the verge of a mental and physical breakdown. Bright realized she could not give 100% and prioritized her own health over playing in the tournament, a choice she is proud of. Following knee surgery and counseling over the summer, she now feels mentally and physically rejuvenated ahead of the new Women's Super League season.</p>

          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists with the USDA are using drones to haze gray wolves and prevent them from attacking livestock in Northern California and Oregon. The drones are equipped with thermal cameras and loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," clips from the film "Marriage Story," and live human voices to scare the predators away. This nonlethal method aims to reduce wolf-rancher conflicts as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West. While the long-term effectiveness is still being studied, initial results show the novel tactic can successfully interrupt wolf hunts.</p>

The protests reflect the challenges unions face in protecting members from what they see as anti-labor policies. Events are planned in various locations, including Culver City, Torrance, Wilmington, and Elysian Park, where demonstrators will call for more equitable labor laws.</p>
