The FAA is expected to suspend airline operations to accommodate military aircraft flyovers and a fireworks show. Passengers scheduled to fly on the evening of June 14 are advised to check their flight status directly with their airline. The parade, costing between $25 million and $45 million, will feature over 100 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and thousands of soldiers. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-05 17:30:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has banned six water companies from paying bonuses to senior executives due to failure to meet environmental and consumer standards. The measures apply to firms that are not financially resilient or have been convicted of criminal offenses, with the ban backdated to April 2024. Regulator Ofwat can force firms to claw back bonuses or face enforcement action. The move follows growing public concern about sewage spills and rising bills, with Environment Secretary Steve Reed stating bonuses should only be given for good performance.
