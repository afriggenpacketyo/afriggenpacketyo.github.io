          <p>Despite China's efforts to present itself as an economic alternative to the United States, key U.S. allies are resisting Beijing's trade-focused "charm offensive." The opinion article argues that this resistance is not temporary but is rooted in deep, long-standing security, intelligence, and cultural ties with Washington. While trade with China is substantial, foundational security partnerships with the U.S. remain the overriding priority for these nations. Consequently, their diplomatic actions focus on urging restraint rather than aligning with any potential China-led confrontation against American interests.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is currently moving northeast over the open ocean. As of Sunday morning, the storm had maximum sustained winds of 40 mph and posed no immediate threat to land. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center predict Fernand will strengthen over the weekend, potentially reaching hurricane status by Monday before weakening. The storm's path is expected to keep it well to the east of Bermuda, avoiding any direct impact on populated areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump has appointed Airbnb co-founder Joe Gebbia to lead the newly established U.S. National Design Studio, an agency tasked with improving the design and usability of government websites. The studio, which will operate for three years, is seen as a successor to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), previously headed by Elon Musk. Gebbia stated his goal is to make online government services more "beautiful" and user-friendly, comparing his vision to the Apple App Store. Gebbia, who recently shifted his political alignment, previously worked on digitizing the federal retirement system under DOGE.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rhode Island has passed a landmark law making it the first U.S. state to require employers to provide reasonable accommodations for employees experiencing menopause symptoms. The new legislation includes provisions for temperature control, flexible breaks, and access to private spaces for symptom management. The article contrasts this policy, developed with input from affected women and HR leaders, with recent federal health policy decisions made without patient representation, such as an FDA panel on antidepressants in pregnancy. The author argues that effective policy requires meaningful consultation with the communities it impacts.</p>

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have become residents of New York City's Central Park, drawing the attention of local photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. Their presence is part of a broader trend of coyotes adapting to and thriving in urban environments across the United States over the past century. Researchers estimate there are about 20 coyotes in New York City, having migrated from surrounding areas. While some people fear them, scientists and advocates emphasize that the animals are not a danger to humans if given space and not fed.</p>

          <p>A new cultural archetype, the "performative male," has gained traction among Gen Z on TikTok and has even inspired public impression contests. The term describes a man who curates an alternative, intellectual, and "soft" aesthetic—such as reading feminist literature and listening to indie female artists—often to appeal to progressive women. The trend humorously questions the authenticity of these men, linking them to previous suspicious archetypes like the "wife guy." The article explores whether this behavior is a genuine expression of modern masculinity or a calculated performance to gain social and romantic advantages.</p>

          <p>A first-time Tesla owner shared an honest review of his vehicle's costs after one year, noting that his savings on fuel were less than expected at just $334. However, he emphasized that the most significant financial benefit came from reduced maintenance costs, having spent only $600 on tire replacements compared to thousands on his previous car. The owner concluded that the longer he drives the electric vehicle, the more he will save on repairs, a sentiment echoed by other EV owners. Widespread adoption of EVs is also beneficial for the environment by eliminating tailpipe emissions. (not investment advice)</p>

McCarthy highlights that states like California, Florida, and Texas are setting records in renewable energy capacity, and 84% of corporations are upholding their carbon reduction commitments because it makes economic sense.</p>

          <p>Tennis offers a unique combination of physical and cognitive benefits that make it an ideal lifetime sport. It provides a full-body, aerobic workout that improves muscle strength, cardiovascular health, and bone density, with studies suggesting it can add nearly a decade to one's life expectancy. The sport's complexity—requiring rapid assessment of trajectory, speed, and spin while coordinating complex movements—enhances cognitive functions like reaction time and decision-making. As a relatively safe and accessible sport, tennis provides a fun and engaging way to maintain both brain and body health throughout life.</p>

The author shares her personal experience of reading to her newborn, transitioning from Romantic poetry to simple board books, and discovering the joy in watching his comprehension grow. Reading aloud is presented not just as a tool for a child's development, but as a way for a parent to learn how to "read" their own child. It becomes a shared act of making sense of the world together, creating a unique and lasting bond.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article proposes that the most effective use of artificial intelligence in the near future is for collaboration with human experts, rather than attempting premature full automation. Using examples from radiology and aviation, it illustrates how AI designed solely for automation can undermine human expertise and lead to poor outcomes when it inevitably fails. Instead, AI should be built as a collaborative tool to augment human skills by handling vast data while leaving context, ethics, and final judgment to people. This approach leverages the complementary strengths of both humans and machines for better results.</p>

          <p>A new book by an anthropologist and an artist proposes a novel approach to climate change: treating excess atmospheric carbon like the nation's gold reserves. The idea involves creating community-based "carbon banks" that would accept organic waste, convert it into a stable form like biochar, and sequester it. In exchange, depositors would receive a local digital currency, creating a grassroots economy based on carbon removal. The authors argue that just as society rendered gold priceless by taking it out of circulation, we could create a new value system around sequestering carbon.</p>
