          <p>Former teen idol Shaun Cassidy recently described his late father, actor Jack Cassidy, as a "phony" who was more focused on his public persona than on being a parent. In an interview, Cassidy explained that he and his brothers saw through their father's fabricated, theatrical accent and showmanship, which created a complicated family dynamic. Despite the pain of an absent father who was also resentful of his success, Cassidy acknowledges the positive gifts he received from him. He also reflected on growing up largely unsupervised in Hollywood alongside other celebrity children, fostering a sense of mutual support and survival.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the first Black woman to be hired as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Breaking barriers in the 1960s, she became a trusted and unflappable voice in Bay Area journalism, covering pivotal events like the Harvey Milk assassination and the AIDS crisis for stations like KPIX and KQED. Despite facing overt racism and sexism, Davis remained dedicated to her craft, earning eight regional Emmy Awards and mentoring a generation of journalists. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a trailblazer who opened doors for women and people of color in media.</p>

This asset class, which has seen significant growth, was historically available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new fund provides indirect exposure through publicly traded business development companies (BDCs), offering a liquid alternative without the typical high fees and lockup periods of traditional private credit. The strategy is designed to provide retail investors with a new source for potential income streams from this expanding market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United has appointed Nuno Espirito Santo as their new head coach on a three-year contract, just hours after sacking Graham Potter. Potter was dismissed after only eight months, with the club positioned 19th in the Premier League table following a poor start to the season. Nuno, who was recently let go by Nottingham Forest despite leading them to a high league finish last season, is seen as a manager who can bring stability and a competitive edge. His appointment marks a shift in managerial style for the club, with some commentators noting his approach is more akin to former manager David Moyes.</p>

          <p>Lieutenant Colonel George Hardy, one of the last surviving original Tuskegee Airmen, has passed away at the age of 100. As the youngest Red Tail fighter pilot, he flew 21 combat missions over Europe during World War II, later serving in both the Korean and Vietnam Wars. The Tuskegee Airmen were the first Black military pilots in the U.S. armed forces, breaking racial barriers while demonstrating exceptional skill and courage.

          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran, has found a more fulfilling and affordable lifestyle after relocating to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He lives comfortably on approximately $4,000 a month, sourced from VA disability, the GI Bill, and part-time work, which he says affords him a middle-class or higher standard of living there. Ryan contrasts the high-pressure, survival-mode existence he felt in America with the calm and safety of Vietnam, where lower costs allow him to focus on personal happiness and goals. Despite minor challenges like noise pollution, he has no plans to leave, valuing the ability to pursue his passions rather than constantly chasing financial stability.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), asserting that the timing is ideal for such a move. This comes after CCO, prompted by a previous activist campaign from Legion Partners, divested its European and Latin American businesses to become a U.S. pure-play company. Despite these strategic changes, CCO's stock has underperformed its peers, and Anson argues that a sale is the best path forward for shareholders. The company's transformation into a more focused U.S. entity, combined with private equity's strong appetite for the industry, makes it an attractive acquisition target for potential buyers.

The company claims its process can reduce construction costs by up to 20% and cut delivery times in half compared to traditional on-site building methods. Originally focused on creating attainable housing for workers in expensive mountain towns, Fading West has expanded its mission, recently producing 82 homes in just two months for FEMA to house residents displaced by the Maui wildfires. By treating home construction as a manufacturing process, the company aims to disrupt the traditional building industry and make home ownership more accessible.</p>

          <p>Navigating an interracial relationship successfully requires open and intentional communication about racial and cultural differences. Experts suggest couples should proactively discuss their unique backgrounds to understand how race and power dynamics might affect their relationship, rather than ignoring these aspects. A second key conversation involves consciously co-creating a new, blended family culture that respects and celebrates traditions from both partners. Couples must also learn to compromise on cultural or spiritual practices and, finally, develop a plan to support each other when facing biases from family or the community, ensuring they present a united front.</p>

          <p>Effectively managing workplace conflicts is crucial for professional success, and communication experts suggest memorizing key phrases can help navigate awkward situations. To initiate a difficult conversation, phrases like "I'm seeking clarity" can reduce defensiveness and foster a collaborative problem-solving atmosphere. When approached with a problem, asking "What does success look like?" helps to understand the other person's goals before offering solutions. During a disagreement, leading with empathy by saying "It makes sense that you feel that way" or paraphrasing their main point can validate their perspective, de-escalate tension, and maintain a respectful tone.</p>

Troller served as an interpreter during the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp, an experience that profoundly shaped his life. He later settled in Paris and became renowned for his work with German television, where his unconventional and sensitive interview show, "Personenbeschreibung," featured luminaries like Marlon Brando and Woody Allen. Troller viewed his journalistic work as a form of "self-healing," allowing him to process the trauma of the Holocaust and the loss of 19 relatives.</p>

          <p>Dating app founders, including Bumble's Whitney Wolfe Herd, are increasingly turning to AI, promising a more emotionally intelligent matchmaking experience to combat user burnout. The goal is to use AI to match people based on deeper values and goals, rather than superficial profiles, acting like a "personal shopper" for romance. However, this vision faces a significant challenge, as decades of research show that romantic compatibility remains largely unpredictable and mysterious. Past experiments have shown that simply telling people they are compatible has a greater effect than their actual compatibility scores, suggesting that the human element of chemistry cannot yet be replicated by an algorithm.</p>

          <p>A six-year-old Miami girl named Imani Dell was diagnosed with a fast-growing brain tumor after her aunt observed that her eyes were crossed. Her mother, initially thinking it was due to tablet use, rushed her to the hospital when Imani began seeing double. A CT scan revealed a golf-ball sized medulloblastoma, a type of cancerous tumor common in children, which had caused fluid buildup in her brain. After successful surgery to remove the mass, Imani endured 30 rounds of radiation and nine cycles of chemotherapy over the past year and has now finished her treatment and returned to school.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is testing a new cockpit alert system, called Surface Alert (SURF-A), designed to give pilots more time to react and prevent dangerous runway collisions. The technology was demonstrated by recreating recent near-disasters, showing how automated warnings like "Traffic on runway!" can avert accidents. This development comes in response to a rise in serious runway incursions at U.S. airports, which prompted safety experts to call for more advanced cockpit technology. The new system uses GPS data to provide alerts seconds earlier than existing systems, which could be critical in preventing collisions during takeoff and landing.</p>

          <p>The principle of free speech, which protects even offensive and hateful expression, is a cornerstone of American democracy that remains highly relevant today. This idea was famously tested in 1977 when the ACLU defended the right of a neo-Nazi group to march in Skokie, Illinois, a community with many Holocaust survivors. The ACLU lawyer, David Goldberger, argued that the real client was the First Amendment itself, because if speech can be denied for being offensive, officials gain the power to silence any expression they dislike. While acknowledging the real pain such speech can cause, the piece concludes that the principle is a unifying concept in divided times.</p>

          <p>The recent standoff between ABC and its major affiliate groups, Nexstar and Sinclair, over Jimmy Kimmel's show demonstrated the enduring power of broadcast networks. After successfully pressuring ABC to suspend Kimmel, the affiliates overplayed their hand by refusing to air his return, effectively starting a game of chicken they were bound to lose. The boycott was more costly for the local stations, which lost viewers and ad revenue, than for ABC's parent company Disney, whose viewers could find the show on streaming platforms. The affiliates' quick reversal underscored that despite their consolidated power, they remain dependent on networks for valuable content like live sports.</p>
