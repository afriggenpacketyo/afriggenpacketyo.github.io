          <p>Golf influencer Paige Spiranac humorously updated her "case study" about her golf game, suggesting she plays worse when wearing more clothes. She posted on social media that her theory was confirmed after a poor performance while wearing a button-down shirt and black pants. Spiranac, known for her large social media following, has previously joked about her performance being inversely related to the amount of clothing she wears on the course.

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran provided "early notice" about missile strikes targeting the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, downplaying the severity of Iran's response to U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. He thanked Iran for the warning, which allowed for the avoidance of casualties, and announced a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Iran. Diplomatic sources indicated that the counterattack was expected and calibrated, with U.S. and Qatari officials preparing in advance, echoing Iran's advance notice during the 2020 strikes on a U.S. military base in Iraq.</p>

          <p>A Louisiana NPR station, Red River Radio, is facing potential federal funding cuts that could severely impact its ability to serve rural communities. The station, which provides vital news and emergency information to areas with limited access to other media sources, relies on government funding for about 15% of its budget. Supporters of the station argue that these cuts could have life-threatening consequences, especially during hurricane season, when residents depend on public radio for critical updates. Opponents claim the cuts are necessary to reduce taxpayer funding for media outlets they deem politically biased.</p>

          <p>An RBN Energy executive, Rusty Braziel, expressed doubt that Iran will close the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil shipping passage, despite recent tensions. Braziel argued that closing the strait would harm Iran's own interests, as it exports 1.7 million barrels of oil per day through the passage. He noted that the market seems to agree, as oil prices dropped despite concerns following U.S. attacks on Iranian nuclear sites. Braziel also cautioned that U.S. restrictions on ethane trade to China are negatively impacting the trustworthiness of U.S. energy exporters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr and Dr Mehmet Oz announced a voluntary agreement with insurance companies to change prior authorization practices. This agreement aims to address the common issue where private health insurers require patients to ask for permission before they can receive medical treatment. The pledge seeks to standardize the prior authorization approval process, deliver decisions faster, reduce the number of procedures and drugs subject to prior authorization, honor existing approvals when patients switch insurers, and build a public dashboard of industry performance. While officials are hopeful, skepticism remains regarding insurers' commitment to the agreement.</p>
