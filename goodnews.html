          <p>Counting has begun in the Republic of Ireland's presidential election to choose a successor for President Michael D. Higgins. The main contenders are independent politician Catherine Connolly, supported by several left-wing parties, and Fine Gael's Heather Humphreys. A third candidate, Jim Gavin, remains on the ballot despite withdrawing, with votes for him being transferred. Early indications suggest a potentially low voter turnout, and the final result is expected to be announced later in the evening from Dublin Castle.</p>

          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina has revealed he decided to back AI voice startup ElevenLabs after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski in 2022, long before the company achieved its multi-billion dollar valuation. Reina, who now works for the company, specializes in pre-seed investments, focusing on industries overlooked by others and founders with deep technical expertise. He was impressed by Staniszewski's vision to solve the problem of robotic-sounding AI voices, a key issue that had limited the technology's adoption. ElevenLabs has since grown significantly and is now planning a global expansion and a potential IPO.</p>

          <p>As he began a five-day tour of Asia, President Donald Trump stated he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un for the first time since 2019. The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is scheduled to attend the APEC summit and hold crucial trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The primary goal of the meeting with Xi is to de-escalate the ongoing trade war between the two economic superpowers. While US officials have downplayed the likelihood of a meeting with Kim, Trump's remarks have fueled speculation about a potential diplomatic development on the Korean peninsula.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a decisive 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in Game 1 of the World Series, fueled by a massive nine-run sixth inning. A key moment in the rally was a grand slam by pinch-hitter Addison Barger, the first of its kind in World Series history. The Dodgers initially took a 2-0 lead, but a two-run homer from Daulton Varsho tied the game before Toronto's explosive sixth inning put the contest out of reach. A late two-run home run from Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani was not enough to mount a comeback, giving the Blue Jays an early lead in the series.</p>

          <p>The ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, will focus on critical regional security issues, including the ongoing civil war in Myanmar and border tensions between Thailand and Cambodia. US President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, a deal brokered with US and Chinese involvement. However, resolving the conflict in Myanmar remains a significant challenge for the bloc, as its diplomatic efforts have so far been ineffective. The summit also serves as a backdrop for high-stakes US-China relations, with Timor-Leste set to be welcomed as ASEAN's 11th member.</p>

          <p>In a significant development just before the start of early voting, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race. Jeffries' backing provides a major boost to the progressive frontrunner's campaign, which has focused on the city's affordability crisis. The endorsement comes as Mamdani's opponent, former Governor Andrew Cuomo, secured the support of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams. The race has become a focal point of the Democratic Party's internal dynamics, with Mamdani also receiving endorsements from prominent figures like Senator Bernie Sanders and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.</p>
