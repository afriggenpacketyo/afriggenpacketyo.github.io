        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's Premier League clubs have set a new transfer spending record, with the total outlay for the summer window surpassing an unprecedented £3 billion. This figure, driven by major deals like Alexander Isak's £125 million move to Liverpool, dwarfs the spending of other top European leagues combined. The massive expenditure highlights the Premier League's immense financial power, with even newly promoted clubs like Sunderland spending heavily to compete. This trend is leading analysts to suggest other major European leagues are becoming 'feeder leagues' to England's top flight.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has concluded its most expensive transfer window ever, spending approximately £415 million on new players, a stark contrast to previous, more conservative approaches. This record outlay was fueled by accumulated funds, strong commercial growth, and a desire to build upon last season's title success under new manager Arne Slot. Key acquisitions included Florian Wirtz for £100 million and a British record £125 million for striker Alexander Isak, a move necessitated in part by the tragic death of forward Diogo Jota, which cast a shadow over the club's ambitious summer.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), which includes China, Russia, and India, has formally decided to establish a new development bank. This financial institution aims to serve its ten Eurasian member countries by providing an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial system. Analysts suggest the bank will help insulate member economies from risks associated with the dollar while accelerating funding for crucial infrastructure projects. The move is seen as a logical step to strengthen economic cooperation and financial sovereignty among the participating nations.</p>

          <p>Actress Chloë Grace Moretz and her longtime girlfriend, model and photographer Kate Harrison, were married over Labor Day weekend. The couple, who have been together since 2018, held a private ceremony where both brides wore custom gowns by Louis Vuitton. Moretz, who publicly came out last year, opted for a non-traditional baby blue dress, while Harrison wore a white gown. The wedding celebration was designed to be personal, featuring activities loved by the couple, such as fishing, horseback riding, and poker.</p>

          <h2>Ancient Skull Found in Greece Dated to 286,000 Years, Reshaping Human Evolution Theories</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study using advanced dating techniques has determined that the Petralona cranium, a significant human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, is at least 286,000 years old. This new, reliable minimum age places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of debate over its timeline. The findings suggest its owner, likely a member of the Homo heidelbergensis species, coexisted with early Neanderthals, adding complexity to Europe's evolutionary history. This research underscores that human evolution was not a linear progression but a complex story of overlapping and diverse populations.</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis to be visible across much of the UK due to heightened solar activity. A recent coronal mass ejection from the sun is expected to allow the Northern Lights to be seen farther south than is typical. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution, areas in the Midlands and northern regions of the UK may be treated to a rare display. The best viewing opportunities are predicted for Monday and Tuesday nights.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records at the US Open, but questions remain about his physical durability through the grueling two-week tournament. Despite playing himself into good form, Djokovic has been visibly hampered by various physical issues in nearly every match, from his neck and shoulder to his lower back. While his skill and serving remain spectacular, his ability to withstand the strain of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents is a growing concern. His next challenge against Taylor Fritz will be a significant test of his body's resilience.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for an initial fee of £18.1 million. The 23-year-old has signed a five-year contract with the club, which is seeking to address inconsistencies in its goalkeeping department. Lammens, who has yet to earn a senior cap for Belgium, is considered one of the country's top goalkeeping talents and is known for his excellent shot-stopping abilities. His arrival comes after United's current goalkeepers, Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana, have failed to consistently impress since joining in 2023.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will validate President Trump's authority to impose widespread tariffs under the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act. An appeals court recently ruled the tariffs illegal, but the administration is appealing, arguing the influx of fentanyl constitutes a national emergency justifying the measures. Bessent stated that if the appeal fails, the administration has a backup plan, potentially invoking the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 to continue its trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

Johnson's performance is praised as the only possible casting for the man-mountain athlete, and he effectively portrays Kerr's vulnerability. While the film is considered a solid drama, particularly for UFC fans, some critics note that it doesn't fully explore its emotional themes or elevate co-star Emily Blunt's role.</p>
