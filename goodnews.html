          <p>Oracle's stock is experiencing its best week since 2001, driven by a strong earnings report and positive outlook for its cloud computing business. The company has found a niche in helping clients operate artificial intelligence models. CEO Safra Catz anticipates sales for the new fiscal year to exceed $67 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations. Oracle's chairman, Larry Ellison, noted that demand is outpacing supply due to the methodical pace of data center construction, with capital expenditures expected to reach $25 billion in fiscal year 2026. Oracle's client list includes major players like Meta, OpenAI, and Elon Musk's xAI.</p>

          <p>Emma Raducanu was defeated by Zheng Qinwen in the quarter-finals at Queen's Club, despite showing early promise on the grass court. Zheng's powerful groundstrokes and serve proved challenging for Raducanu, who took a medical timeout for her back during the match. Raducanu initially gained a lead in the second set but Zheng quickly recovered, winning four consecutive games to secure the victory. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance indicates potential for success on grass, though she still needs to bridge the gap to challenge top-tier players.</p>

          <p>Amazon is restructuring its health-care business into six new units to streamline operations and address fragmented patient experiences, following several senior executive departures. The reorganization aims to accelerate innovation and simplify the company's approach to the multitrillion-dollar U.S. health-care market. While Amazon has made significant investments in health care, including the acquisition of One Medical and the launch of Amazon Pharmacy, it has also faced setbacks, such as the closure of Amazon Care. The new structure focuses on clinical care delivery, operations, strategic growth, technology, compliance, and pharmacy services.</p>

          <p>Homeowners considering borrowing against their equity can choose between a home equity loan and a home equity line of credit (HELOC). Currently, the monthly payments for a $100,000 loan are nearly identical for both options, but HELOC rates are variable and could become cheaper if interest rates decrease. HELOCs offer flexibility with revolving credit and interest-only payments during the draw period, while home equity loans provide a lump sum with immediate repayment obligations. Borrowers should carefully assess their financial needs and consider both short- and long-term costs before making a decision. (not investment advice)</p>
