          <p>Researchers in China have significantly improved the stability and lifespan of perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs).  This breakthrough addresses a major obstacle to commercial adoption, potentially leading to highly energy-efficient and brighter displays.  The team's PeLEDs achieved a brightness exceeding current commercial standards, with a projected lifespan of over 20 years at typical operating brightness. This innovation could revolutionize electronic devices and lighting.</p>
