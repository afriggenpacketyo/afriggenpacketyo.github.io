          <p>A bipartisan bill proposes awarding the Congressional Gold Medal to Ed Dwight, recognizing his trailblazing life as the first Black astronaut candidate and, at 91, the oldest person to travel to space. The article details his journey, from being selected by President Kennedy's administration in 1961 to resigning after facing prejudice following the president's assassination. Forced to reinvent himself, Dwight became a successful entrepreneur and a renowned sculptor, creating over 130 memorials dedicated to Black history. His story is presented as one of profound resilience and a commitment to inspiring his community and making the world a better place for everyone.</p>

During the meeting, which was more cordial than their previous encounter, Trump stated the U.S. would provide Ukraine with "very good protection" but remained vague on specifics. He also indicated he would call Russian President Vladimir Putin following the talks and appeared to walk back his previous demand for an immediate ceasefire as a precondition for a deal, suggesting a peace agreement could be worked on while fighting continues.</p>

This development follows a recent surge in the company's stock after it signed major 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, solidifying its pivot towards supporting advanced artificial intelligence infrastructure and significantly boosting its contracted revenue.

          <p>A new study published in JAMA Network Open reveals that over-the-counter birth control pills are effectively reaching their intended users, particularly those facing barriers to healthcare. Researchers found that nearly a third of people who obtained the OTC pill had previously used no contraceptive method at all, while 41% switched from a less-effective method. The study highlights that users of the OTC pill, Opill, were more likely to be uninsured, younger, and living in rural areas compared to those with prescriptions. The primary reasons for choosing the OTC option were convenience and not needing a doctor's appointment.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford participated in practice for the first time since the beginning of training camp, having been sidelined with a back issue. The 37-year-old veteran was a full participant, taking part in both individual and team drills with the first-team offense. Despite his return to the field, head coach Sean McVay provided no definitive updates on his long-term status, stating the team will take his recovery one day at a time. The Rams are scheduled to open their season against the Houston Texans on September 7th, making Stafford's health a key concern.</p>

          <h2>Article Explains Benefits of Reinvesting Stock Dividends for Compounding Returns</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advocates for using dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs) as a simple and effective strategy to enhance investment returns through compound interest. Instead of receiving cash dividends, a DRIP automatically uses the funds to purchase more shares of the same stock, including fractional shares. The author argues that for long-term investors not reliant on dividend income, this passive approach ensures money is consistently put to work, citing an S&P 500 ETF as an example where reinvesting dividends significantly boosted total returns over a decade compared to just price appreciation.

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated that the group has agreed to the latest ceasefire and hostage release proposal from Egyptian and Qatari mediators. The deal is reportedly based on a two-stage framework that would involve an initial 60-day truce, during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages. The plan also includes negotiations for a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has recently stated he would only accept a deal that releases all hostages at once, while his cabinet is expected to approve plans to occupy Gaza City.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has settled its defamation lawsuit against the conservative media outlet Newsmax for $67 million over false claims made about the 2020 presidential election. The settlement, which will be paid in three installments, averts a trial that was scheduled for this fall. Dominion had sued Newsmax for $1.6 billion, alleging the network broadcasted devastating lies about its voting machines. This follows Dominion's larger $787.5 million settlement with Fox News and a separate $40 million settlement Newsmax paid to another voting machine company, Smartmatic, for similar falsehoods.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously imagines a specialized police unit in Washington D.C. dedicated to preventing 'sandwich-based crime.' The piece is written as a script, where veteran detectives lament the end of their 25-year streak without a sandwich crime after a DOJ worker throws a Subway sandwich at a federal agent. The detectives explain their community-focused, non-authoritarian methods of de-escalation, contrasting them with the overly aggressive federal response. The absurd premise is used as a commentary on modern policing tactics, priorities, and disproportionate displays of force.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss the Optimal Age for Taking Out a Reverse Mortgage</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 13:01:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial experts suggest that the best age to take out a reverse mortgage depends heavily on an individual's health, financial needs, and long-term goals. While homeowners can qualify at age 62, waiting until their late 60s or early 70s often allows them to access more of their home's equity. A reverse mortgage can provide crucial income for retirees on a fixed budget by eliminating mortgage payments and providing cash flow. However, experts caution that it reduces the home's equity, potentially leaving less for heirs, and the loan becomes due if the homeowner moves out permanently, making it ideal for those committed to aging in place.</p>

          <p>State health officials have officially declared an end to the measles outbreak in Texas that began in late January and resulted in 762 confirmed cases. The declaration comes after 42 days—twice the disease's maximum incubation period—have passed without a new reported case in affected counties. The outbreak, centered in West Texas, primarily affected children, and tragically, two unvaccinated children died. While the state-specific outbreak is over, the Texas Department of State Health Services continues to urge vigilance among healthcare providers, as ongoing outbreaks elsewhere in the U.S. could lead to new cases.</p>

The discount will be available through various platforms, including the company's direct-to-consumer pharmacy and partnerships with savings companies like GoodRx.
