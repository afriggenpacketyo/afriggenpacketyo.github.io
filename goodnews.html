          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 21:59:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports saw a smaller-than-expected contraction in August, falling 0.1% year-on-year, a softer decline than July's 2.6% drop, primarily due to a rebound in shipments to Asia. Despite this, overall growth remained negative for the fourth consecutive month, influenced by U.S. tariffs and an earlier front-loading of exports. This article notes that while exports to Western Europe also jumped, shipments to the U.S. continued to plunge, particularly in autos. Economists anticipate the Bank of Japan to hold rates steady, with future export volumes potentially shrinking due to slower external demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong should seek to co-host China’s proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Beijing's preference for Shanghai. While Shanghai boasts established AI infrastructure, Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" framework and independent judiciary could offer international credibility, reassuring Western skeptics amidst US-China tech tensions. Hosting such a center would position the city at the heart of China’s AI diplomacy and influence global AI standards.

          <p>New data reveals that one in four driving tests in Great Britain are now taken in automatic cars, a significant increase driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales. The AA attributes this trend to growing confidence in electric vehicles (EVs), which typically lack manual gearboxes. While automatic licenses restrict drivers to non-manual cars, instructors note automatics simplify the test and enhance road safety. This article highlights a notable shift in driving habits and its implications for the automotive industry's future.</p>
