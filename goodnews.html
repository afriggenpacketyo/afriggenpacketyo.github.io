          <p>Decades after leaving high school to serve in the Vietnam War, several veterans in Muscatine, Iowa, received their high school diplomas. Dennis Snyder, who volunteered for the Navy before his junior year, was among those honored. He obtained his GED, but always desired a diploma from Muscatine High School. Snyder and fellow veteran Richard Hill joined the Muscatine High class of 2025, receiving enthusiastic support from the graduating students. The recognition came through Operation Recognition, an Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs program that has enabled over 100 veterans to graduate, and Snyder shared the honor with fallen high school friends who never returned from the war. </p>

          <p>A urine-based cancer risk screening kit developed by Japanese startup Craif Inc. is showing promise in detecting cancer early using non-invasive methods. The "miSignal" test kit can assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer simultaneously. A survey using the test kits detected a lung tumor in a woman and precancerous cells in the colon and pancreas of six others. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology. </p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast using mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, each reflecting a unique metabolic state. The phases mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint, known as xiang sheng xiang ke in traditional Chinese medicine. This model aligns with the "four symbols" theory, emphasizing balance between yin and yang for health and harmony. </p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband, Bob, in 2001 was overturned after she spent two decades fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, prompted by Loyola Project for the Innocent, revealed inconsistencies and foreign DNA. The prosecution conceded that the new DNA evidence cast doubt on the verdict, and the judge overturned the conviction. Despite this, the DA's office initially sought to retry her, but later dismissed the charges, and Dorotik is now working to rebuild her life and advocate for other incarcerated women. </p>
