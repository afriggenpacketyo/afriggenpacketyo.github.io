        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new plans for food businesses in England to partner with officials to encourage healthier consumer choices and combat rising obesity rates. Rather than imposing specific targets, the voluntary initiative will see major retailers and manufacturers report on their sales of healthy food to increase accountability. Potential strategies include offering promotions on nutritious items, adjusting loyalty point systems, or changing store layouts to make healthy options more accessible. The policy is part of a broader national health strategy aimed at reducing pressure on the NHS and creating the "healthiest generation of children ever."</p>

          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" during competitions to simulate the unfamiliar and challenging conditions of an Olympic Games environment. The initiative aims to build resilience and teamwork by having swimmers, including Paris silver medalist Tomoyuki Matsushita, face logistical hurdles and close living quarters without it affecting their performance. Officials hope the experience will better prepare younger athletes and foster a stronger team spirit ahead of upcoming world championships.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future skin cancer cases. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, charities and dermatologists hope that early education will empower the next generation to protect their skin and reverse the trend of increasing cancer rates.</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of the series' 24-year career as a cornerstone of the nation's space program. The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has a 98% success rate and has been instrumental in deploying satellites and probes. It is now being replaced by the more cost-competitive H3 rocket, as Japan aims to strengthen its position in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights and a clear message to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was reportedly fueled by the government's attempt to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law that equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, celebrated the event's success, stating it was a peaceful show of defiance against a "hateful power." The march highlighted the ongoing cultural and political clash between Hungary's populist government and advocates for LGBTQ+ rights and civil liberties.</p>

The price hike will raise tickets to $27 for adults and $22 for children.
