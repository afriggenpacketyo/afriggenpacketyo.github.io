          <p>A mechanic in Minnesota discovered a wallet under the hood of a 2015 Ford Edge he was repairing. The wallet belonged to a retired Ford assembly plant worker in Michigan who had lost it 11 years earlier while working on the vehicle's electrical systems. After finding the owner through Facebook, the mechanic mailed the wallet back, which still contained $15 in cash and $250 in Cabela's gift cards that the company confirmed are still valid. The well-traveled wallet was returned to its owner after the car had accumulated over 150,000 miles.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Researchers Propose 'Scissor Wing' Design for Hypersonic Drone Carrier</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 22:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have developed a conceptual design for a hypersonic drone carrier featuring a revolutionary single, rotating "scissor wing." This design aims to overcome the traditional conflict between low-speed lift and high-speed drag by adjusting the wing's angle based on speed. At low speeds, the wing is perpendicular to the fuselage for maximum lift, pivots to 45 degrees at transonic speeds to reduce drag, and aligns parallel to the fuselage at Mach 5, turning the entire aircraft into an efficient "waverider." This innovative approach could solve a long-standing aerodynamic challenge that even NASA has explored.</p>

          <p>Mike Conner, a former software CEO, has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. After purchasing the abandoned property for £555,000 in 2017, he undertook a massive project to make it habitable, which included installing running water and electricity for the first time in years. The historic fort, once a hotel known for its parties, is now equipped with 40 beds and a nightclub. Having hosted his own festival on the island, Conner has now placed the unique property back on the market for £3 million.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With food prices rising, parents in the UK are using creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week school summer holidays. Some parents recommend meticulous planning, such as buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items in advance to freeze for later use. Other tactics include organizing the fridge to use items with the nearest expiration dates first, batch cooking meals like bolognese to save time and money, and portioning out snacks into daily bags to prevent them from being eaten all at once. Local food pantries that provide surplus food for a small fee have also become a vital resource for many families.</p>

          <p>Hollywood Forever Cemetery, the final resting place for many film legends, has introduced a new architectural feature: the five-story Gower Mausoleum. This vertical structure was designed to address the high demand for space in the iconic cemetery, offering permanent housing for approximately 13,000 people. The modern design emphasizes natural light and offers views of Los Angeles, aiming to provide a peaceful and comforting environment for visiting families. By also hosting cultural events like movie nights and festivals, the cemetery is redefining its role as a space for both the deceased and the living community.</p>

          <p>A group of students in the UK, ahead of receiving their GCSE exam results, opened time capsule letters they wrote to their future selves four years ago. The letters, penned in March 2021 as they returned to school after a major COVID-19 lockdown, captured their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future. The exercise, organized by their teacher, served as a poignant reflection on their disrupted secondary school education, which included remote learning and social bubbles. The students reflected on their personal growth and the perseverance their year group showed in adapting to the unprecedented challenges.</p>

          <p>Twenty-year-old British heavyweight boxer Moses Itauma delivered a statement victory, stopping veteran Dillian Whyte in the first round of their headline fight. Itauma sent Whyte to the canvas with a powerful right hook, and the referee waved off the contest just 119 seconds into the bout. This impressive win extends Itauma's undefeated professional record to 13-0, with 11 of those victories coming by knockout. The performance strengthens his position as a major rising star in the heavyweight division and a potential future title contender, while raising questions about the 37-year-old Whyte's future in the sport.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, moving beyond Westernized dishes to offer authentic, diverse regional cuisines from areas like Hunan, Sichuan, and Xinjiang. These brands, having achieved success in China's competitive domestic market, are using Singapore as a launchpad for global expansion, testing their concepts on the city-state's diverse population. By providing immersive dining experiences and showcasing the sophistication of Chinese gastronomy, they are challenging old stereotypes and potentially serving as a form of soft power. This culinary wave may help soften China's global image at a time of geopolitical tension.</p>

          <p>Sunderland started their return to the Premier League with a decisive 3-0 victory over West Ham, marking their first win in the month of August in the top flight since 2010.

Goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor secured the win at a jubilant Stadium of Light. The result provides an optimistic start for a club that has spent the last eight years in the lower divisions of English football.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the standard iPhone design. Samsung's wider range of products at various price points also contributes to its gains. Apple is expected to respond with a slimmer iPhone model and potentially its own foldable device by 2026.
