          <p>Cerys Vaughan, a teenage amateur footballer, was previously banned by the Football Association for questioning the gender of a transgender woman opponent during a match. Vaughan raised concerns with the referee about fairness and safety after learning the player was transgender, leading to a charge of improper conduct. An FA appeal board later found the initial hearing 'unfair,' quashed the ruling, and ordered a new process, which was dropped after the complainant withdrew. Vaughan is now seeking an apology from the FA, stating the case has negatively impacted her life, while the FA confirms the case's closure without further details.</p>

          <p>Mexico has filed a lawsuit against Google after it changed the label for the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America on its maps platform, following a U.S. presidential order. President Sheinbaum argues that this change affects Mexico and Cuba's continental shelves, not just the U.S. portion. Google's policy is to follow local official names, which in Mexico is the Gulf of Mexico. The lawsuit follows the passing of the Gulf of America Act by House Republicans, aiming to codify the name change.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is set to introduce new measures to reduce UK net migration, which stood at 728,000 last year. The plans include requiring employers to invest in UK skills before hiring overseas workers, with a focus on the IT and telecommunications sectors. Visa restrictions are likely for nationalities with high rates of overstaying and asylum claims, and migrants may face longer waits for permanent residency. Tougher English language requirements and stricter rules for recruiting international care workers are also expected.</p>

While discussions about the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) continue, Mandelson clarifies that abolishing the DST was not part of the trade deal. He also notes a positive relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, emphasizing their ability to defend their national interests and maintain trust.</p>
