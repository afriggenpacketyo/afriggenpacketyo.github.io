          <p>Polish and allied planes were briefly scrambled in Polish airspace early Monday as Russia targeted Ukraine with aerial strikes.

The Polish military launched available forces and resources, including fighter pairs, and heightened the readiness of ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems. The military stated that the launches were preventative and that no violation of Polish airspace was observed. After approximately three hours, the threat of Russian strikes diminished, and the warplanes returned to normal activity.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on destructive bottom trawling, a fishing method that drags large nets along the seafloor, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK offshore protected areas. This announcement comes as the UN Ocean Conference begins in France, amid warnings about the damage caused by bottom trawling to marine life and the seabed. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the delicate seabed they rely upon. Pressure is also building for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect 30% of the ocean.</p>
