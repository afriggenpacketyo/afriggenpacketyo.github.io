          <p>A federal judge has halted the Trump administration's effort to expand fast-track deportations, known as expedited removal, across the U.S., citing significant due process concerns for migrants. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb pauses a January directive that extended expedited removal beyond border areas and recent arrivals to anywhere in the country for those who arrived within the past two years. This decision is a major setback for the administration's mass deportation efforts, which had relied on this expansion to arrest asylum-seekers at courthouses. Cobb's opinion stated that the government must afford due process to a large group of people not previously subject to expedited removal, finding current procedures fall short.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie, the final British singles player, was eliminated from the US Open after losing to 24-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic in the fourth round. Djokovic, despite battling a lower back injury that required medical time-outs in the early sets, secured a 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 victory in a contest lasting almost three hours. This marks Norrie's seventh consecutive defeat to the 38-year-old Serb, who is now aiming for a standalone record 25th major title. Djokovic, playing his first tournament since Wimbledon, joked that his team wants him to "suffer on the court" to spend more minutes there.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean—have established a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean, completing their 9,000-mile journey in 140 days. Battling violent tropical storms, which forced lengthy detours and saw Lachlan swept overboard before being rescued, they overcame significant challenges. The Scots beat the previous record of 162 days and arrived in Cairns, Australia, looking forward to pizza and a decent night's sleep. The brothers have so far raised over £700,000 of a £1 million target for clean water projects in Madagascar, driven by their primary motivation for fundraising.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile scenic section of Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains during the 2022 and 2023 winters triggered slope failures and collapsed pavement, further exacerbated by the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, erosion control, and drainage systems. The reopening provides increased access to popular hiking trails and is expected to reduce overcrowding, though the U.S. Forest Service has announced heightened fire danger warnings for the area.</p>

LAPD spokesperson Jennifer Forkish confirmed the unintentional discharge and stated that Internal Affairs investigators are handling the matter, with no serious injuries reported. City Hall East is connected to the main City Hall building and includes the offices of the city attorney and city controller.</p>

          <p>Chinese equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, reaching a 10-year high, driven by a potent combination of China's US$22 trillion in household savings and renewed interest from global investors. Analysts at GAM Investments, managing US$15.8 billion, anticipate further growth, citing domestic investors shifting from low-yield fixed-income products and Beijing's focus on technological innovation in areas like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics. This resurgence follows years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus, with Morgan Stanley noting two consecutive months of inflows in June and July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, ruling that plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the actions were unlawful. The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld a lower court's decision, stating that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension because the governing statute does not permit it. This decision provides a potential path for those who have already lost or are about to lose their status, despite DHS condemning the ruling as obstruction from "unelected activist" judges.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B's testimony in a Los Angeles civil trial, where she is accused of assaulting a security guard in 2018, has gone viral due to her animated responses and lawyers' questions about her wigs and nails. Cardi B, four months pregnant at the time of the alleged incident, denied physically attacking Emani Ellis, claiming a verbal altercation ensued after Ellis filmed her and revealed her pregnancy. The security guard alleges the rapper cut her cheek with a 3-inch fingernail. The trial, marked by humorous exchanges and discussions about celebrity scrutiny, is expected to conclude next week.</p>

          <p>An innovative program is pairing anxious teenagers with toddlers from local nurseries to boost school attendance and engagement, addressing the issue of school avoidance which has almost doubled since the pandemic. Siena, 13, who previously struggled with anxiety and school absence, credits the program with teaching her communication and confidence, leading to more than double her attendance. The charity Power2, running the scheme in London and Manchester, suggests that giving disengaged teens responsibility for younger children positively impacts their learning. Participants like Miller, 12, report improved focus and calmness, fostering healthy relationships and self-esteem through consistent interaction.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study from Stanford Medicine, published in JAMA Network Open, indicates that young children aged 3 to 5 diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently prescribed medication too quickly, often before behavioral interventions are fully explored. The study, which examined nearly 10,000 health records, found that about 68% received medication before age seven, with 42% prescribed drugs within 30 days of diagnosis. Researchers and clinical psychologists emphasize starting with behavioral intervention due to potential side effects like irritability and a high likelihood of treatment failure with early medication. The study highlights the need for further investigation into early medication appropriateness.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon is exploring ways to accelerate the reinstatement process for former service members discharged for refusing the COVID-19 vaccine, with officials weighing granting honorable discharges to those whose departures were solely due to vaccine refusal. While hundreds have applied, fewer than two dozen have been reinstated, causing frustration among veterans. This potential policy change follows President Trump's executive order to reinstate these troops, calling the mandate an "unfair, overbroad, and completely unnecessary burden." Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth is expected to address the issue soon, with the department prioritizing cases and offering incentives like back pay and duty station preferences.</p>

          <p>Following their engagement announcement, speculation is swirling about the potential details of Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce's wedding, anticipated to be a major cultural event. Experts suggest the planning will be intentional and private, with Swift likely incorporating "Easter eggs" for fans and focusing on a location with personal meaning, possibly in Kansas City where they met and got engaged. Confidentiality will be paramount, involving NDAs for vendors and keeping details in-house. Discussions also include Swift's choice of wedding gown, expected to reflect her romantic and refined red-carpet style, possibly from an international designer, and whether she will opt for multiple gowns.</p>

          <p>Traditional coffee chains like Costa are reportedly struggling to retain younger consumers, who are increasingly drawn to alternative beverages like iced strawberry matcha offered by newer chains like Blank Street Coffee. Costa's owner, Coca-Cola, is reportedly considering selling the chain for less than half its 2019 purchase price. Analysts attribute this shift to changing consumer trends, a preference for healthier options, and the rising cost of living, which makes unique, affordable treats more appealing. Newer chains leverage social media appeal and distinct offerings, while established brands are urged to reimagine their services to compete with both high-end and budget options.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry is set to visit the UK in two weeks, sparking speculation about a potential reconciliation with King Charles III after years of deep family division. The King will be in the UK, making a meeting possible, unlike Harry's last visit in April. Recent developments, including a "secret peace summit" between Harry's team and the King's communication secretary, suggest a softening of tensions and a willingness for things to be different. Harry previously expressed a desire for reconciliation, acknowledging his father's health and stating "life is precious," though trust remains a significant hurdle. Both sides are maintaining public silence on the matter.</p>
