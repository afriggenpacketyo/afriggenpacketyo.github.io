          <p>Max Verstappen secured the fastest time in Friday practice at the Mexico City Grand Prix, but expressed dissatisfaction with his Red Bull car's pace during race simulations. Meanwhile, McLaren drivers Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri encountered difficulties, with Norris admitting the team was "a little bit behind" and grappling with balance issues. While Verstappen's single-lap pace was strong, he emphasized the importance of race pace, a concern for his team. The struggles for McLaren, who had been performing strongly in recent races, suggest they have significant work to do before qualifying and the main event.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) increased at an annual rate of 3% in September, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, with tariffs identified as a contributing factor to rising prices. This report was released as an exception during the ongoing government shutdown, due to its importance for Social Security adjustments. Economists note that while inflation is inching higher, the job market is simultaneously slowing, creating a dilemma for the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Analysts predict the Fed is still likely to implement a quarter-point rate cut at its upcoming meeting, prioritizing labor market risks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>UK Drivers Face Dilemma: Manual vs. Automatic Driving Lessons Amidst EV Shift</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-24 19:07:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article explores the growing trend of UK drivers opting for automatic driving lessons, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars and the rise of electric vehicles. New drivers face a dilemma: an automatic license restricts them to automatics, while manual offers broader flexibility. Challenges include a scarcity of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs, despite a common misconception that the automatic test is easier. The article notes a lingering "stigma" around automatic-only licenses but suggests this will diminish as EVs become the norm, influencing future driving choices.</p>
