          <p>Macy's reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to jump more than 10% in pre-market trading. The department store raised its full-year guidance, citing positive sales trends driven by store renovations and strong performance in key categories like denim and women's apparel. CEO Tony Spring noted that despite the impact of tariffs, the company is well-positioned to gain market share due to a resilient consumer and healthy inventory levels. The positive results mark a notable turnaround from the previous quarter when the company had slashed its outlook amid economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alphabet's shares climbed 7% following a U.S. District Court ruling that spared Google from the most severe penalties in a major antitrust case. The Department of Justice had proposed breaking up the company, including divesting its Chrome browser, but the judge's decision rejected this measure. While Google was found to have an illegal monopoly in internet search, it can continue its lucrative arrangement to be the default search engine on Apple devices, though exclusive contracts are now barred. Analysts view the ruling as a significant victory for Google, removing a major overhang on the stock and reinforcing the durability of its core search business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prosecutors have withdrawn a theft charge against a man who was accused of stealing flowers from a public tribute to the late musician Ozzy Osbourne in Birmingham. The court was informed that a security guard had given the man, Parviz Jafari, permission to take the flowers, leading the Crown Prosecution Service to conclude there was no realistic prospect of a conviction. The case arose after thousands of fans left tributes following Osbourne's death in July. The brief hearing at Birmingham Magistrates' Court concluded with the judge informing Mr. Jafari that he was free to go.</p>

          <p>Four-time major champion Naomi Osaka has demonstrated a significant return to form, reaching her first Grand Slam quarter-final since 2021 at the US Open. After a period of apathy and a disappointing Wimbledon exit, Osaka's resurgence is attributed to a recent coaching change and a renewed focus on enjoying the game. Her improved confidence and clean, powerful ball-striking have been evident in her impressive wins, including a victory over third seed Coco Gauff. Analysts note that her current performance is reminiscent of the level she displayed when she previously won two titles at the tournament in New York.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 09:11:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reportedly advocating for a merger of all six of the country's steel companies into a single entity to address the sector's financial instability. With four of the companies already receiving government financial support, ministers believe consolidation is the best path to long-term sustainability, preferring a joint private buyer over nationalization. The plan requires the agreement of the current owners, including the Chinese owners of British Steel, with whom the Business Secretary is set to negotiate. This move comes as the government has recently taken control of Liberty Steel's UK wing and nationalized Sheffield Forgemasters in 2021.</p>

          <p>Global real estate investment manager BGO is successfully using advanced data science and artificial intelligence to identify high-potential, undervalued commercial properties in unconventional markets. By creating a model that backtests 20 years of its own deals, the firm focuses on local market fundamentals rather than broader national trends to predict performance. This data-driven approach led to a highly profitable industrial development in Las Vegas, a location that traditional research models had deemed mediocre. The strategy highlights a shift in real estate investment, where AI-enhanced analysis of granular data can uncover opportunities missed by conventional methods.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The depiction of children in art has transformed significantly throughout history, reflecting societal shifts in values, class structure, and the very concept of childhood. In early modern Europe, portraits of royal children were often used as tools for marriage politics, presenting them as idealized assets. As the bourgeoisie rose, they emulated this practice, while depictions of peasant children evolved from ridicule to symbols of piety. The modern, unburdened concept of childhood only emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, a change captured in art and later democratized by photography, which allowed for more spontaneous and personal portrayals.</p>
