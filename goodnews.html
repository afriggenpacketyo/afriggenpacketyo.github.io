          <p>President Trump met with conservative House members to garner support for the budget package, which contains his second-term agenda. House Speaker Mike Johnson aims to hold a vote on the bill, which includes concessions to fiscal hawks and blue-state Republicans, either Wednesday night or Thursday morning. The legislation faces opposition from both conservative members seeking steeper spending cuts and blue-state Republicans concerned about the state and local tax deduction. The bill is estimated to add trillions to the deficit over the next decade, further complicating its path to passage.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Co. has filed a lawsuit against multiple Southern California law firms and attorneys, alleging a widespread fraud scheme involving California's Lemon Law.

Ulbrich, in his second stint with Atlanta, said he was never concerned about his job security and is still deciding on the appropriate discipline for his son.

The incident reportedly left "some sections of the warship's bottom crushed." Kim has ordered the ship to be repaired ahead of a major meeting of the ruling Workers' Party Central Committee in late June.

          <p>Southern California experienced a heat wave this week, with temperatures reaching the low 90s.
