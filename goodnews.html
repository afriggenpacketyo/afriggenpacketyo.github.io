          <h2>Study Suggests 7,000 Daily Steps Can Significantly Reduce Health Risks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:08:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A comprehensive study published in The Lancet Public Health indicates that walking 7,000 steps per day is linked to a reduced risk of major health issues like dementia, heart disease, and cancer. This finding presents a more attainable goal for many people compared to the widely promoted but less evidence-based 10,000-step benchmark. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults, finding that even modest increases in daily steps provide significant health benefits compared to being sedentary. The study suggests this simple metric could be a practical addition to public health guidelines to encourage daily physical activity.</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Outfitters Becomes Latest Meme Stock, Surging on Sydney Sweeney Campaign</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 09:07:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged by 18%, positioning it as the latest company to be swept up in a meme stock rally. The surge is attributed to high short interest and a new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney, which has drawn attention from retail traders on platforms like Reddit's Wall Street Bets. This phenomenon, where investors coordinate to drive up the price of heavily shorted stocks, has recently affected other brands like GoPro and Krispy Kreme. The rally offers a temporary reprieve for American Eagle's stock, which had fallen significantly year-to-date. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Central Bank has decided to hold its key interest rates steady, citing significant economic uncertainty, particularly from potential U.S. trade tariffs. This decision to pause follows four consecutive rate cuts earlier in the year aimed at bringing inflation down towards the 2% target. With the inflation goal now met, officials are adopting a cautious stance as they monitor the geopolitical landscape, especially the ongoing trade negotiations between the EU and the U.S. Analysts expect the ECB will likely wait for updated economic forecasts in September before making any further policy moves.

          <p>The European Union and China have agreed to a new "export supply mechanism" designed to resolve issues related to Beijing's restrictions on rare earth exports. The agreement, announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after a summit in Beijing, aims to create a system for quickly addressing supply chain bottlenecks. This development is a direct response to China's imposition of licensing requirements on critical raw materials, which had disrupted some European industries. The mechanism is seen as a practical step toward repairing trust and ensuring a more reliable supply of these essential materials for Europe.</p>

          <p>A rescue effort is in progress to free three miners trapped underground following a mine collapse at the Red Chris copper and gold mine in northern British Columbia. According to the mine operator, Newmont Corp, the workers were able to move to a designated refuge station after an initial ground collapse. This refuge area is reportedly supplied with enough food, water, and ventilation to sustain them for an extended period. A subsequent collapse has blocked their exit, and communication has been limited, prompting a full stand-down of operations at the mine while the rescue is conducted.</p>

          <p>Despite initial market shocks, investors appear to have grown comfortable with U.S. trade tariffs for now, with the S&P 500 recovering and reaching new highs. However, investment strategists warn that significant volatility is likely to continue, as the threat of broad tariffs remains and headlines can easily sway market sentiment. Analysts believe the market has priced in mid-teen tariff rates, but uncertainty persists over who will ultimately bear the cost—consumers, corporations, or international suppliers. While underlying economic fundamentals appear encouraging, the unpredictable nature of trade policy remains a major risk. (not investment advice)</p>
