          <p>In a significant diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, ending decades of conflict. The U.S.-brokered deal establishes a major transit corridor, to be named the 'Trump Route,' linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan through Armenian territory. Both nations' leaders credited President Trump for facilitating the breakthrough, which was hailed by international figures as a major step toward regional stability. The agreement also signifies a shift in geopolitical influence, diminishing Russia's long-standing role as a mediator in the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's latest model, GPT-5, has been met with mixed reviews in China, a key market in the global artificial intelligence race. While OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touted it as the company's smartest and most useful model yet, some Chinese tech experts have expressed disappointment, describing it as lacking revolutionary breakthroughs. The new system integrates a 'thinking' function designed to switch between standard and deep modes based on query complexity. This lukewarm reception highlights the heightened competition and high expectations within China's rapidly advancing domestic AI industry.</p>

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic project aimed at connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. A new state-owned enterprise has been established to oversee the railway, which will create a 2,000km (1,240-mile) artery by linking the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan. This railway is part of a larger plan to establish a 5,000km plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035. The project's scope also includes diversified operations like real estate development, tourism, and international contracting, signaling its broad economic and strategic importance.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travelers can avoid unexpectedly high cell phone bills abroad by employing several strategies, as one reporter learned after incurring nearly $50 in extra charges over five days in Paris. Experts suggest that the best approach depends on individual usage needs. For frequent travelers with basic data needs, switching to a carrier like T-Mobile, which includes international roaming in some plans, may be cost-effective. For heavier data users, purchasing a digital eSIM from providers like Airalo or GigSky is often a cheaper alternative to daily roaming packages. Additionally, maximizing the use of free Wi-Fi and pre-downloading maps and documents can significantly reduce data consumption.</p>

          <p>Astronomy enthusiasts may be disappointed as the annual Perseids meteor shower, peaking around August 12th and 13th, will be less visible this year. A full moon is expected to coincide with the peak, its brightness likely washing out all but the most brilliant meteors. The Perseids originate from debris left by the Swift-Tuttle comet and are known for their bright fireballs and long wakes. While viewing conditions are not ideal, NASA suggests that some meteors may still be visible in the predawn hours for patient observers in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece explores the broader implications of a recent incident where Los Angeles officials removed crosswalks painted by community volunteers. The city's swift removal, citing liability and procedural concerns, is presented as a symptom of a larger problem of 'state incapacity,' where bloated bureaucracy prevents the effective delivery of public goods. The author points to the city's failures in transit, homelessness, and traffic safety as evidence of this systemic issue. The article praises the 'vigilante' painters for their DIY approach, arguing that such citizen action is a necessary response to a government that is too slow and inefficient to meet basic community needs.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues for Confirmation of Ninth Circuit Nominee Eric Tung</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece advocates for the swift confirmation of Eric Tung to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The author, a former colleague, praises Tung's exceptional credentials, including his education at Yale and the University of Chicago Law School, and clerkships for Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Antonin Scalia. The article criticizes Democratic senators for what it calls partisan attacks during Tung's confirmation hearing, focusing on the author's social media posts rather than the nominee's qualifications. It concludes that Tung is a brilliant, fair-minded constitutionalist whose confirmation would strengthen the judiciary.</p>

          <h2>Nutrition Experts Favor Oatmeal Over Smoothies for Sustained Morning Energy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-09 06:02:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When choosing between oatmeal and smoothies for a breakfast that provides lasting energy, nutrition experts give a slight edge to oatmeal. While both can be healthy, oatmeal's solid form and complex carbohydrates lead to slower digestion, promoting a greater feeling of fullness. Its beta-glucan fiber also supports heart health and metabolism. Smoothies offer a quick, customizable option but are digested more rapidly; however, their nutritional value can be enhanced by adding protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Ultimately, a balanced breakfast combining protein, fiber, and healthy fats is key, regardless of the form it takes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant de-escalatory move, North Korea has started to dismantle some of its propaganda loudspeakers along the border with South Korea. This action follows South Korea's decision in June to halt its own cross-border broadcasts, which included K-pop music and news reports. The reciprocal step is one of the first signs of easing tensions under the new administration of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who has prioritized reopening dialogue with Pyongyang. These loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of heightened animosity between the two technically-at-war nations.</p>

          <p>The Italian government has approved the revival of a long-stalled project to construct the Strait of Messina Bridge, which would connect Sicily to the mainland. The proposed 2-mile single-span suspension bridge, estimated to cost €13.5 billion, is slated to begin construction in 2026 and finish by 2032. Proponents believe it will bring economic prosperity to southern Italy, creating over 100,000 jobs. However, the project faces significant challenges, including its location in a seismically active zone, strong winds, and opposition from local residents who argue the funds could be better used on existing infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To ensure you're a houseguest who gets invited back, etiquette expert Elaine Swann advises respecting your host's space, even with close friends or family. Key tips include giving ample notice, keeping visits to a manageable length like four days, and communicating plans to avoid awkwardness. When a host says to 'make yourself at home,' it means you can be self-sufficient for basic needs but should still be tidy and mindful. It is also important to be self-reliant for transportation and to show appreciation with a thoughtful gift by the end of your stay.</p>

          <p>Europe is experiencing a significant increase in tourism from China, with a 13 percent year-on-year rise recorded in the first half of 2025. This trend is expected to continue, as a recent report from the European Travel Commission found that 72 percent of Chinese tourists are willing to travel long-haul to the continent. This figure is notably higher than the interest shown from other strong markets like the U.S. and Japan. The influx of Chinese visitors provides a welcome boost to Europe's tourism sector as it enjoys the peak summer season.</p>

          <p>Jim Lovell, the American astronaut who famously commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and guided its crew safely back to Earth, has passed away at the age of 97. Lovell is celebrated for his calm leadership after an explosion crippled the spacecraft, turning a potential tragedy into what NASA called its 'finest hour.' He was the first person to fly to the Moon twice, on Apollo 8 and Apollo 13, though he never had the chance to land. His life was immortalized in the 1995 film 'Apollo 13,' where he was portrayed by Tom Hanks.</p>
