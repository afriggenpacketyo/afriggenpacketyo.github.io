          <h2>Study Suggests Switching to Slower-Growing Chicken Breeds Could Prevent Suffering for Pennies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 13:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new paper in the journal Nature Food argues that the extreme suffering of factory-farmed chickens can be significantly reduced at a minimal cost. Researchers found that modern chickens, bred for rapid growth, endure hundreds of hours of disabling or hurtful pain in their short lives. By switching to slower-growing breeds, a key tenet of the Better Chicken Commitment, producers could prevent an hour of intense pain for as little as half a cent. While this change may slightly increase production costs and environmental footprint, advocates argue the immense animal welfare benefits are substantial.</p>

          <p>In Long Beach, Minnesota, a town with a population of just over 300, a unique community space combines a tiny chapel and a vibrant public garden. The Morning Glory Gardens were established in the 1960s to beautify a swampy area by Lake Minnewaska and are now maintained by over 30 volunteers. A small, 16-seat chapel was later moved to the site, where it now hosts several weddings each year. The intertwined attractions serve as a peaceful retreat for residents and visitors, providing a place for reflection and community pride in the small town.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-18 12:58:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, which has lowered conventional mortgage rates, retirees considering reverse mortgages should understand key differences. Unlike traditional mortgages, reverse mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond Fed policy, including lender margins and investor appetite, making it crucial to shop around. The choice between a fixed or adjustable-rate product also impacts how borrowers are affected by rate changes. A significant benefit of lower rates is that they can increase the total amount of home equity a retiree is able to borrow. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing strain on household budgets, property taxes have increased by over 27% since 2019, with many homeowners reporting their bills are higher than expected. Data from the Tax Foundation shows significant variation across the country, with New Jersey homeowners paying the highest median annual bill at $9,163, while Alabama's is the lowest at $786. States without income tax, like Texas and New Hampshire, often rely more heavily on property taxes to fund local services. Experts advise prospective homebuyers to research a property's tax history and budget for potential increases to avoid financial surprises.</p>

The celebration, which marks the transition from childhood to womanhood, often involves elaborate planning for dresses, church services, and large family gatherings. The shop's owner, Lorena Rodriguez, notes that preparations can begin more than a year in advance.

          <p>The student wing of Jamaat-e-Islami, Bangladesh's largest Islamist party, has achieved decisive victories in student council elections at two major universities. This success is seen as a significant political development following the 2024 ouster of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, whose government had banned the party. With national elections scheduled for 2026, these results are being interpreted as a litmus test of public sentiment, particularly among the youth. A recent survey suggests that nearly 22% of voters under 35 now support Jamaat-e-Islami, indicating a potential political shift in the country.</p>

The ruling came after an attempt to expel over 70 minors over Labor Day weekend was halted by an emergency lawsuit. The administration had claimed it was reuniting the children with their families at their request, but Judge Timothy Kelly found no evidence that any parents had sought their children's return. The decision upholds legal protections for unaccompanied minors who enter the U.S.</p>

          <p>For the first time in South America, scientists have discovered prehistoric insects, including beetles, flies, and wasps, preserved in 112-million-year-old amber. Found in a sandstone quarry in Ecuador, the specimens date back to a time when flowering plants were beginning to diversify. This finding is significant because nearly all other amber deposits from this era have been found in the Northern Hemisphere. Researchers believe these "little windows into the past" will help them better understand the ancient ecosystems of the supercontinent Gondwana and the evolving relationship between plants and insects.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A detailed analysis examining fighter pay in boxing and MMA reveals significant structural differences, challenging claims of parity from UFC CEO Dana White. While top-tier boxers earn purses that far exceed those of the highest-paid UFC stars, the UFC distributes its compensation more evenly, resulting in higher pay for its undercard and journeyman fighters. Data from athletic commissions and lawsuits shows that major boxing promoters allocate a much higher percentage of event revenue to fighters (around 60-70%) compared to the UFC's share (around 16-20%). This results in a system where boxing's biggest names earn vastly more, while the UFC provides a more stable, albeit lower-ceiling, career path.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the wisdom of 17th-century philosopher Baruch Spinoza, who faced intense public condemnation, or "cancellation," for his ideas yet maintained his equanimity. Spinoza argued against being a "prey to his emotions," proposing that rational understanding and consciousness provide power over feelings of fear and anger. His approach, now known as metacognition, involves observing one's emotions from a distance to regulate them. By pausing before reacting and understanding the source of emotional turmoil, individuals can avoid being controlled by primitive fears and respond to criticism with dignity and reason.</p>
