          <h2>TSMC Reports Record Second-Quarter Profit Driven by Robust AI Chip Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 02:26:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a nearly 61% year-on-year surge in its second-quarter profit, significantly surpassing analyst estimates, primarily due to strong demand for artificial intelligence chips. The world's largest contract chip manufacturer saw its net income reach a record high, with advanced chips (7-nanometer or smaller) accounting for 74% of its total wafer revenue. This growth is expected to be sustainable as the AI boom continues to expand across industries. However, the company faces potential headwinds from U.S. trade policies, including threatened tariffs and export controls, despite recent government assurances allowing some product shipments to China.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union's executive arm has proposed a €2 trillion budget framework for the seven-year period starting in 2028, allocating a substantial increase in defense funding. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that €131 billion would be dedicated to defense and space investment, a fivefold increase from current spending, reflecting Europe's "era of rearmament." While 35% of the budget targets climate and biodiversity, the plan also streamlines financial programs, triples migration management funding, and includes €100 billion for Ukraine. The proposal requires unanimous approval from member states, with some, like the Netherlands, already deeming it "too high." (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) is significantly stepping up its efforts to combat corruption within the science and technology sector, specifically targeting widespread research funding fraud. CCDI party chief Li Xi underscored the necessity of guiding scientific development "in the right direction" by scrutinizing areas like research project evaluation and fund management. The anti-corruption body is committed to "resolutely crack down on corruption that abuses project management authority to accept bribes, or colludes to embezzle research funds." Furthermore, the CCDI plans to introduce new regulations to close loopholes and enhance governance, while also employing advanced digital systems, big data analysis, and artificial intelligence to more effectively detect and expose complex corrupt practices.</p>

Stepping into the number 10 jersey in the absence of injured regular starter Noah Lolesio, Lynagh will earn his fourth cap. Coach Joe Schmidt has also confirmed Champion de Crespigny's debut on the flank and Harry Wilson's captaincy from number eight, with Joseph-Aukuso Suaalii forming a new midfield partnership.

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has expressed his ambition to sell more advanced chips to China beyond the current H20 generation, following the recent reversal of a ban on the H20 AI chip. Huang emphasized that technology continuously evolves, suggesting that permitted sales to China should also advance over time. Nvidia has been navigating U.S.-China trade tensions, developing compliant semiconductors like the H20 after facing export restrictions. Huang believes the Chinese AI market could be worth $50 billion in the next few years, arguing it would be a "tremendous loss" for American firms not to participate, and that U.S. policies should consider unintended consequences.

          <p>Emirates Flight EK382, originating from Dubai, was unexpectedly diverted to Kaohsiung International Airport in Taiwan after its crew encountered significant difficulties and was ultimately unable to successfully land in Hong Kong. Flight data indicates that the Boeing 777-31H(ER) aircraft performed at least two unsuccessful landing attempts and circled the Hong Kong area before the decision was made to divert. Both the crew and passengers subsequently stayed overnight in Kaohsiung before completing their journey back to Hong Kong the following day. Aviation observers and media outlets suggest that challenging weather conditions, particularly sustained winds of approximately 12 knots, were a likely contributing factor to the landing difficulties experienced by the article.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has followed in the footsteps of his late mother, Princess Diana, by visiting Angola to support landmine clearance efforts. As patron of the Halo Trust, the charity Diana famously backed in 1997, the Duke of Sussex walked through a minefield, emphasizing that "Children should never have to live in fear of playing outside or walking to school." Despite 120,000 landmines cleared since the civil war, an estimated 1,000 minefields remain, posing a daily threat and causing injuries to 60,000 people since 2008. Harry's visit aims to draw global attention to the ongoing danger and encourage renewed support for humanitarian demining.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's six-day visit to China has notably prioritized a series of trade and investment deals, effectively overshadowing the contentious dispute surrounding the future of Darwin Port. Analysts interpret this emphasis as a strategic effort by Beijing to cultivate common ground amidst ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The agreements encompass potential expanded market access for Australian farm produce and coal, collaboration in financial digitalization, and investments in greenfield projects. While Chinese Premier Li Qiang did raise concerns about Australian scrutiny of Chinese investments, the highly sensitive Darwin Port issue was reportedly set aside, signaling a mutual desire to prioritize economic cooperation and stabilize bilateral relations.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula has been canceled after a 7.3 magnitude earthquake initially prompted a warning. The quake struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, triggering evacuations to higher ground in towns like Seward. Despite multiple aftershocks, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that large, widespread waves were not expected due to the earthquake's shallow depth. The U.S. Coast Guard in Kodiak also stood down its evacuation response. While the quake was felt across the Alaska Peninsula, there was no danger to Anchorage, and authorities emphasized that only small sea level changes were anticipated in affected channels.</p>
