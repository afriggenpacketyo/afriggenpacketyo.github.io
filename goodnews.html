          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the government cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by the Trump administration. The ruling focuses on Secretary of State Marco Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. Judge Farbiarz stated that detaining Khalil for this reason is likely unconstitutional and that his career and speech are being harmed. The ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation for other reasons, such as alleged omissions on his green card application. Critics argue that the Trump administration is punishing students for First Amendment-protected speech. </p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the Trump administration might extend the 90-day tariff pause beyond July 9 for trading partners engaged in "good faith" trade negotiations. Bessent mentioned the U.S. is working towards deals with its 18 top trading partners and is likely to extend the pause for those negotiating constructively. This contrasts with previous indications that an agreement's "terms" were needed before extending the pause. Bessent's remarks suggest a potential shift in the administration's approach, possibly showing more flexibility as the deadline approaches. The full details of the U.S.-China deal, announced earlier on Wednesday, remain unclear. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumers are experiencing relief as egg prices fell to $4.55 in May, an 11% decrease from $5.12 in April, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This drop is attributed to the receding effects of the avian flu outbreak and a seasonal decrease in egg demand during the summer. While prices have decreased for two consecutive months, they remain higher compared to the previous year. Experts note that the containment of avian flu has significantly contributed to the price reduction, although the outbreak is not entirely resolved. Despite the recent decline, egg prices are still substantially higher than they were 12 months prior. </p>

          <p>The International Organisation for Mediation, launched in Hong Kong, aims to supplement Article 33 of the UN Charter amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Recent peace talks in Istanbul have not yielded significant progress, and neither side appears capable of achieving victory on the battlefield. While US-led efforts to push for a ceasefire have failed, Ukrainian President Zelensky has expressed openness to direct negotiations with Putin. Despite the challenges, China could potentially play a role in facilitating peace, given the limitations of NATO and the unacceptability of deploying US troops in a peacekeeping role. The success of any peace initiative hinges on addressing the thorniest issues and fostering a willingness to negotiate among all parties. </p>

          <p>President Trump has seemingly reversed course on restricting visas for Chinese students, stating that he has reached an agreement with China regarding students attending U.S. colleges and universities. This announcement comes after U.S. officials previously indicated they would "aggressively" revoke visas for Chinese students and increase vetting procedures. The decision has sparked uncertainty among universities, which rely on tuition fees from international students and view them as integral to their academic operations. While some see this shift as a negotiation tactic, others view it as potentially damaging to the higher education system. Experts suggest that having Chinese students in the U.S. is beneficial for promoting American values and fostering international understanding. </p>
