          <h2>Zuckerberg Bets Big on AI, Eyes Scale AI Founder for Meta Leadership</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 19:58:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly investing heavily in AI, with Meta nearing a $14 billion stake in Scale AI and aiming to recruit its CEO, Alexandr Wang, to bolster Meta's AI capabilities. Zuckerberg is frustrated with Meta's current standing in AI, especially after the underwhelming launch of the company's latest Llama AI models, and hopes Wang can improve Meta's execution in this area. By taking a stake in Scale AI instead of acquiring it outright, Meta is avoiding antitrust concerns, while gaining access to Wang's expertise and potentially insights into competitors like OpenAI. The move signals a significant shift in Meta's AI strategy, prioritizing product-oriented efforts to enhance its Llama family of AI models and compete more effectively in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. This may be a positive move for Meta as they try to improve their AI.</p>

          <p>Sting, the musician, has voiced strong criticism of successive governments for neglecting the North East of England, citing discouraging statistics for child poverty in the area. He is donating an undisclosed amount to the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead, aiming to give back to the culture that shaped him. Sting emphasized the historical contribution of the North East to national life, both industrial and cultural, and expressed disappointment in the empty promises of 'levelling up'. The government has responded by saying they are investing ¬£140m in the seven most deprived towns in the North East as part of a wider ¬£1.5bn investment across the country. This is a good move for the North East.</p>

          <p>The Smithsonian Institution has affirmed its independence after President Trump announced the firing of National Portrait Gallery head Kim Sajet, citing concerns about bias. The institution emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary with oversight from the Board of Regents, which includes Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts. The Smithsonian also addressed concerns about biased content, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content and report back on progress. Trump signed an executive order placing Vance in charge of supervising efforts to remove "improper ideology" from the institution. The Smithsonian wants to remain unbiased.</p>

          <p>A global race is underway to supplant China's dominance in rare earth elements, with Brazil and the U.S. emerging as key players. China's imposition of rare earth export restrictions has amplified concerns about supply chain vulnerabilities, prompting Washington and its allies to build an industrial chain outside of China. Companies like USA Rare Earth are developing magnet-making plants and separation technology to serve eager American clients. The trade in critical minerals is expected to be a key topic in discussions between U.S. and Chinese officials, highlighting the strategic importance of diversifying rare earth sources. The world is diversifying its rare earth sources.</p>

          <p>General Motors (GM) plans to invest $4 billion in three U.S. assembly plants, shifting production of Mexican-produced vehicles to the United States. The announcement comes amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs implemented by the Trump administration on imported vehicles and auto parts. GM will add assembly of the Chevrolet Blazer and Chevrolet Equinox to U.S. plants, converting an idled plant in Michigan to produce gas-powered SUVs and trucks. The investment is expected to create jobs and boost domestic manufacturing, aligning with Trump's policies on trade and automotive tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
