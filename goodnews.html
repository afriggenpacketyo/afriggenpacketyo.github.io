          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:58:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A two-person non-profit in Connecticut is working to restore the health of the Long Island Sound's overfished oyster beds by returning used oyster shells to the water. The organization, Collective Oyster Recycling and Restoration, collects shells from over 50 local restaurants. These old shells provide the ideal surface for new baby oysters to grow, which in turn helps filter water, prevent erosion, and provide a habitat for hundreds of other species. In just two years, the effort has successfully returned over 700,000 pounds of shells to the sound.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has released a vast collection of previously sealed federal records concerning the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The files detail the FBI's investigation, including surveillance and the pursuit of convicted assassin James Earl Ray. The release occurred despite opposition from some of King's family members, who urged the public to view the documents in the context of the FBI's historical campaign to discredit the civil rights leader. They also reiterated their belief that King's death was the result of a broader conspiracy involving government agencies.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has highlighted a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase, which he calls "PARC"—that he believes will continue to perform well, driven by strong interest from retail investors. He noted that these companies are part of a "two-track market," separate from the S&P 500, where a handful of trendy names are relentlessly pushed higher. While suggesting there is money to be made in these names, Cramer also advised investors to exercise discipline and take profits after significant gains, as some of the buying is based on irrational belief.

          <h2>Earth's Faster Rotation Prompts Scientists to Consider Unprecedented "Negative Leap Second"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 19:01:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have observed that Earth is currently spinning faster, causing days to be marginally shorter and raising the possibility of an unprecedented timekeeping adjustment. This acceleration, caused by factors like changes in the planet's liquid core and atmosphere, could eventually require the removal of a second from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to keep it aligned with astronomical time. Such a "negative leap second" has never been implemented and raises concerns for critical computer and telecommunication systems that rely on precise time. Interestingly, climate change-induced ice melt has slightly counteracted this trend by slowing the planet's rotation.</p>

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy, with flights featuring assigned seats set to begin on January 27, 2026. The change marks a significant shift for the carrier, which for decades allowed passengers to choose their own seats upon boarding. The new system will allow customers to select different fare bundles and seat options, including extra legroom seats, and will be accompanied by an overhaul of the boarding process. This move follows the airline's recent decision to end its "bags fly free" policy, signaling a major evolution in its business model.</p>

          <p>A long line of fans and customers gathered outside the new Tesla Diner in Hollywood, anticipating its public opening. The futuristic, saucer-shaped restaurant, a project Elon Musk first mentioned in 2018, features superchargers for electric vehicles and two drive-in movie screens. Despite social media buzz suggesting a Monday opening, the diner remained closed to the public as of the afternoon, though it had held a private event over the weekend. Musk has stated that if the retro-futuristic concept is successful, Tesla plans to establish similar diners in major cities worldwide.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. Marines who were deployed to Los Angeles last month amid protests against federal immigration sweeps. The deployment was met with strong objections from state and local leaders, including Mayor Karen Bass, who called it an "inappropriate misuse of our troops." A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the marines were being redeployed as stability had returned to the city. The withdrawal follows the recall of 2,000 National Guard troops from the city a week prior.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, signaling a strategic recalibration of its foreign policy. Under the new rule, Chinese citizens who hold valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business. This policy change comes as Argentina's President Javier Milei seeks to balance relationships with both the U.S. and China, particularly amid delayed trade negotiations with Washington. The move is seen as an overture to Beijing at a time of growing geopolitical competition between the two superpowers.</p>

          <p>WNBA players used their All-Star Game platform to publicly demand better pay, wearing warm-up shirts that read "Pay us what you owe us." The demonstration comes as players and the league are negotiating a new collective bargaining agreement, with a key sticking point being the revenue-sharing model. Players currently receive about 9.3% of league revenue, a figure they argue is unfair given the WNBA's rapid growth in viewership, merchandise sales, and media deals. They are pushing for a model more similar to the NBA's, where revenue is split roughly 50/50 between players and owners.</p>
