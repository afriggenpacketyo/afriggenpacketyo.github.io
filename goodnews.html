          <h2>NYT: Xi Jinping's Military Purge Raises Doubts About Taiwan Invasion Readiness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-06 01:00:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to this New York Times article, President Xi Jinping's ongoing purge of top military officials in China raises concerns about the competence and reliability of his commanders, potentially weakening his appetite for war with Taiwan. Over the past two years, several high-ranking officers, including leaders of the Rocket Force, have been removed from their positions. While the reasons for these dismissals are unclear, the turmoil suggests that Xi may not have a firm grip on the army, which could delay or deter a potential invasion of Taiwan. The article emphasizes that hardware and logistics alone do not ensure victory, and the lack of battlefield experience among Chinese officers is a significant challenge.</p>

Merz has selected a cabinet with some unconventional choices, including tapping individuals from the private sector for key ministerial roles.
