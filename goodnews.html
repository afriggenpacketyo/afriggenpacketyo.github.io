          <p>China is experiencing a shift towards a technocratic meritocracy, with a growing number of high-ranking officials holding PhDs and possessing technical backgrounds. A recent study indicates that nearly half of the youngest cohort of bureau-level officials have doctoral degrees, many from elite institutions like Tsinghua University. This pivot towards competence over ideology is seen as a philosophical shift rooted in Chinese tradition, where scholar-officials were historically revered. These technocrats are expected to play a significant role in China's competition with the United States, bringing stability and expertise to government roles amid economic uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's vision for a company town called Starbase, near SpaceX's rocket facility in South Texas, is nearing reality after a vote overwhelmingly favored its incorporation. Most of the 283 eligible voters are believed to be SpaceX employees, and the move aims to facilitate the growth of Starbase as a community. However, critics worry about Musk's increasing control over the area, including potential authority to close a popular beach and state park for launches. Companion bills in the state Legislature seek to shift that authority from the county to the new town's mayor and city council.</p>

His election victory came after Trump's imposition of tariffs and suggestions that Canada join the USA, leading to a surge in support for the Liberal Party.
