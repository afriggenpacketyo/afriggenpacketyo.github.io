          <h2>Trump Suggests Potential Tariff Reduction Amid Trade Discussions with China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:29:54 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump has indicated a possible decrease in tariffs on Chinese goods as trade officials from both the U.S. and China prepare for talks in Switzerland, signaling a potential de-escalation in the ongoing trade war. Trump mentioned the tariffs, which had reached as high as 145%, would be reduced, expressing optimism for a "very friendly meeting." China also conveyed confidence in resolving trade issues. While this marks a positive initial step, analysts caution that systemic frictions persist and negotiations are expected to be lengthy, with any initial tariff cuts likely to be minor.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Rise Despite U.S. Tariffs, Fueled by Southeast Asian Demand</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:22:32 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, propelled by increased shipments to Southeast Asian nations, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to recently implemented tariffs. This rise surpassed expectations, contrasting with a drop in imports. While exports to the U.S. plummeted, exports to ASEAN countries significantly increased. Experts suggest that this overall export growth might be attributed to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts. The Chinese government is actively supporting exporters by encouraging sales in the domestic market, potentially leading to deflation.</p>

          <h2>Uncertainty Surrounds European Wind Energy Industry Amidst U.S. Policy Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:01:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European wind energy industry faces uncertainty as the Trump administration's policies in the U.S. cause project disruptions, prompting industry executives to reassess their approach. A halt to the Empire Wind project off Long Island has sent shockwaves through the sector. While Europe is expected to compensate for the U.S. pullback, challenges remain, including rising prices and regulatory hurdles. Orsted, for example, canceled a major wind facility in Britain due to increased costs and uncertainty. Despite these risks, offshore wind has been successful in Northern Europe, but future growth is contingent on navigating a complex economic and political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with the U.K., aiming to reduce tariffs and benefit both countries. While details are still being finalized, the deal includes increased U.S. access to the U.K. market, particularly for agricultural products. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports remains in place, with exceptions for the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually. Prime Minister Starmer praised the agreement as a boost to trade and job creation. The deal includes revenue generation for the U.S. and a significant Boeing plane purchase by a British airline.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, defying US President Trump's tariff increases, potentially strengthening China's position in upcoming trade talks with the US in Switzerland. The figure exceeded market expectations, following a 12.4% rise in March. Experts attribute this resilience to transshipment through other countries and pre-tariff trade contracts. However, they anticipate a gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months, hoping for a swift resolution to the trade negotiations.</p>

          <p>Developed nations are seeking to diversify their tungsten sources after China restricted exports, causing panic in industries reliant on the metal.

The element is used in various applications, including cutting tools, ammunition, and clean energy technologies. China dominated global tungsten ore mining in the past year.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's trade pact with the UK is being scrutinized for its limited scope and potential failure to significantly roll back tariffs or win major concessions. While both sides hail the deal as a breakthrough, the 10% import tax on most UK goods remains intact. Experts suggest the changes are marginal, with limited substantive benefits for the US. The announcement has drawn criticism from American carmakers, who note that the plans make UK-made cars less expensive to import. The deal offers Trump a political victory with little to show behind it.</p>
