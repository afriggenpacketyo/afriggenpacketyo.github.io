        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk has publicly stated that he regrets some of his social media posts targeting President Donald Trump, acknowledging that they "went too far" after a public fallout stemming from Musk's criticism of Trump's tax bill. This comes after Trump indicated he was open to reconciliation, noting disappointment but no hard feelings regarding the situation. Musk had previously called Trump's tax bill a "disgusting abomination" and urged Americans to oppose it, claiming it would cause a recession; he also made unsubstantiated claims about Trump's involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. Trump responded by criticizing Musk and threatening to cancel government contracts with SpaceX, Musk's space technology company.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer prices in the U.S. rose by 0.1% in May, which was less than expected, with the annual inflation rate at 2.4%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics; this suggests that President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly impacted inflation. The core CPI, excluding food and energy, also increased by 0.1%, with energy prices declining by 1% and vehicle prices also showing decreases. Vice President JD Vance echoed Trump's call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, arguing that the lack of inflation pressures indicates "monetary malpractice." Despite the benign inflation readings, economists remain cautious, suggesting that the full impact of tariffs may not be reflected in CPI data for several months. (not investment advice)</p>

This statement followed a Bureau of Labor Statistics report indicating that tariffs have not yet exerted substantial upward pressure on inflation. Vance's comments align with Trump's urging of Chair Jerome Powell and the Federal Open Market Committee to ease monetary policy, with Trump seeking a full percentage point cut from the current target level for the fed funds rate.

The Zenobia, once one of the most elegant hotels in the Middle East, stands battered and bullet-ridden, a reminder of the city's past glory as a key stop on the Silk Road. Palmyra changed hands twice during the Syrian civil war, and while Syria is recovering, the future of the hotel remains uncertain, but locals are hopeful for the return of tourists. The Zenobia Hotel was a place where Agatha Christie stayed with her archaeologist husband a century ago.</p>

Murphy also emphasizes the need for Democrats to address the concerns of young men and engage in risk-taking to save democracy, while warning about the authoritarian ambitions and corruption of President Trump.

          <h2>Investors Shift from US Stocks to Europe and Emerging Markets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-11 08:57:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Global investors are moving money out of U.S. stocks and into European and emerging markets assets due to concerns about U.S. fiscal policy, rising debt, and potential recession from trade tariffs. Equity mutual funds and ETFs in the U.S. experienced outflows of $24.7 billion in May, while European funds attracted $21 billion, reaching a four-year high in inflows. Emerging market equity ETFs saw inflows of $3.6 billion, driven by the dollar's weakness and selloff in U.S. Treasury bonds. European markets have outperformed U.S. peers due to lower interest rates and optimism over Germany's stimulus plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Inflation Holds Steady as Trump's Tariffs Await Full Impact</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Inflation remained relatively stable last month, with consumer prices up 2.4% from a year ago, as President Trump's tariffs have not yet significantly affected prices for American shoppers. Consumer prices rose just 0.1% between April and May, with falling gasoline prices offsetting the rising cost of rent and groceries. Forecasters anticipate the cost of tariffs will become more evident in the coming months, and Federal Reserve governor Adriana Kugler warned that Trump's tariffs could reverse progress made on inflation. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady, despite persistent urging by the president.</p>
