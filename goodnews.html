          <p>This article discusses how Jewish organizers are increasingly confronting the Trump administration's policies, particularly those framed as combating antisemitism. Many Jewish individuals and groups are pushing back against the exploitation of antisemitism charges to justify repressive policies they say do not represent their Jewish values. They are protesting, writing letters, and lobbying legislators to denounce what they see as the systematic exclusion of Jewish perspectives critical of Israel. These organizers are also rallying around detained students and condemning the use of antisemitism to advance a right-wing political agenda.</p>

          <p>This article discusses how a Neuralink brain implant has enabled Brad G. Smith, an ALS patient, to communicate using only his thoughts. The implant, connected to Smith's motor cortex, translates his neural signals into cursor movements on a computer screen. Smith can now interact with his family, play games, and communicate more efficiently than before, using AI to assist with writing responses. Smith's experience highlights the potential of brain-computer interfaces to restore communication for individuals with severe speech impairments, while also raising ethical questions about privacy and autonomy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings to determine if inmates were wrongly denied parole due to faulty drug tests. Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July of the previous year. If inmates were denied parole because of the faulty tests, they could be owed a new hearing before the parole board. The review aims to determine if sufficient evidence exists to support incarceration without the positive drug screening, addressing concerns that the faulty tests may have unfairly affected parole decisions.</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are challenging proposed regulations to implement a state law aimed at reducing plastic waste, arguing that the draft rules undermine the law's intent. The lawmakers express concerns that the regulations could approve polluting recycling technologies and provide overly broad exemptions for products under the purview of the USDA and FDA. They argue that the new regulations could lead to higher costs for California households and jurisdictions. The agency says they are informal draft regulations, which means they can be changed and that they never intended to go outside of the statute.</p>

The ¬£2 billion upgrade project, designed to boost the region and cut journey times, has been described as one of the UK's most expensive and complex road projects. The 28-mile improvement is expected to bring prosperity to one of the UK's most deprived areas, although some critics have questioned the length of time it took and the cost. The project, initially drawn up in 1990, faced numerous challenges, including overspends, delays, and a global pandemic.</p>
