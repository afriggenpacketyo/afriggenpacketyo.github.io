          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been meticulously renovated into a luxury party destination and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and invested significantly over five years to overcome immense logistical challenges, such as establishing running water and electricity. The historic 100-man fort is now equipped with 40 beds and a nightclub, transformed from a ruin into a unique, off-grid private venue. Conner hopes the next owner will utilize its potential to boost local tourism and create jobs.</p>

          <p>Jonathan Bush, cousin of former President George W. Bush, is signaling a potential run for governor of Maine in 2026, aiming to revive the Bush family's political influence. Through his nonprofit, he has outlined a policy vision focused on economic growth, school reform, and addressing the state's housing crisis, criticizing what he calls Maine's "learned helplessness." With Democratic Governor Janet Mills term-limited, the race is open, though the state currently leans Democratic. Bush is positioning himself as an entrepreneur with deep family roots in Maine, seeking to appeal to the state's moderate and independent voters.</p>

          <p>As school holidays increase financial pressure on families, parents are sharing resourceful methods to manage rising food costs. Techniques include meticulously planning meals, buying reduced-price "yellow sticker" items to freeze for later, and utilizing local food pantries that provide surplus food at a low cost. Some parents also organize their refrigerators and cupboards to minimize waste and ration snacks to make supplies last longer. These strategies highlight the creativity and resilience of families navigating the high cost of living, especially when children who normally receive subsidized school meals are at home.</p>

The modern building, which can house approximately 13,000 remains, offers crypts with stunning views of the city and is designed with marble and natural light to create a peaceful environment. This innovative approach aligns with the cemetery's evolution into a cultural hub that hosts movie nights and festivals for the living. The mausoleum provides a permanent, accessible resting place for families within the iconic Hollywood setting.</p>

Reading their own words four years later, the students reflected on their personal growth and the perseverance required to navigate their secondary school years amidst unprecedented disruption.

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is preparing to travel to Washington D.C. for a meeting with President Donald Trump on Monday.

Putin described his meeting with Trump as "timely and quite useful," stating that a resolution must address the "root causes" of the conflict. Zelenskyy's visit is seen as a critical next step in negotiations, though his last trip to the White House was notably contentious.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining significant ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share from shipments surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is largely attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors that appeal to consumers. While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's ability to offer a wider range of devices at various price points is reigniting the intense competition between the two tech giants.
