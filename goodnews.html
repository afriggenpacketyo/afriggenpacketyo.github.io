          <p>This Kyodo News digest summarizes several key international and domestic events. The Trump administration has requested Japan to increase its defense spending to 3.5% of GDP, potentially disrupting planned high-level meetings. Japan has dispatched two SDF planes to Djibouti for possible evacuation of Japanese nationals from the Middle East due to the escalating conflict between Israel and Iran. Prime Minister Modi is considering visiting Japan in August to finalize a bullet train deal. Chinese coast guard ships have been observed near the Senkaku Islands for a record-tying 215th consecutive day. A Japanese-Peruvian fusion restaurant in Lima has been named the world's best. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As a heatwave approaches, experts say that US sunscreens are less effective than those available in other countries, particularly in protecting against UVA rays. This is largely due to regulatory differences, as the FDA has not approved a new UV-filter for sunscreen in over 20 years. Countries like France, South Korea, and Japan have approved a wider range of UV-filtering ingredients, allowing for more advanced sunscreens. While the FDA states that US sunscreens are safe and effective when used properly, experts recommend looking for mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide for the safest products. </p>

The women are depicted against a backdrop symbolizing the infested waters where they contracted the disease. The project aims to break taboos and highlight the impact of FGS on women's sexual and reproductive health. </p>

          <p>Amazon sellers are struggling with rising return rates and returns fraud, leading to financial losses and some businesses exiting the platform. Easy returns for shoppers have created risks and expenses for small businesses, with some customers receiving used or damaged products. Amazon has started charging sellers for items exceeding certain return rate thresholds, which may lead to rising prices. Some sellers are implementing measures like installing surveillance cameras to track returns and combat fraud, while others are outsourcing returns to specialized companies. The issue highlights the need for better accountability and fraud prevention on Amazon's platform. </p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court found that the mandate violates the separation of church and state and would isolate students who are not Christian. Louisiana plans to appeal the ruling, potentially taking it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Similar laws have been challenged in other states, and the Supreme Court has previously ruled against such displays in certain contexts. </p>
