        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>University of Texas football coach Steve Sarkisian refuted claims that the program spent $40 million to build its roster, calling the reports "irresponsible." Sarkisian acknowledged that substantial financial resources are allocated to college football programs due to name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals and revenue sharing. He suggested that $25 million was a more accurate figure for Texas' investment, emphasizing that other schools are also spending significant amounts to acquire players. Sarkisian's remarks come amid discussions about the financial landscape of college football and the increasing costs associated with maintaining a competitive team. The article is matter-of-fact, focusing on the coach's denial and the broader context of college football spending. The tone is relatively neutral, as it is focused on reporting Sarkisian's statements and the surrounding context.</p>
