          <p>Following a deadly attack in Kashmir, India has launched a diplomatic initiative to garner international support for its "zero tolerance" policy on terrorism, which it attributes to Pakistan-based militant groups. Parliamentary delegations have been dispatched to 33 countries, equipped with dossiers detailing Pakistan's alleged history of fostering terrorism and evidence linking the April attack to these groups. While Pakistan denies any involvement, India seeks to build a global consensus against cross-border terrorism and present its military strikes as legitimate acts of self-defense. This diplomatic offensive aims to counter Pakistan's narrative and reinforce India's position on combating terrorism, particularly in the context of Kashmir.</p>

          <p>French President Macron's office addressed an incident where his wife, Brigitte Macron, appeared to push his face away upon arriving in Hanoi, Vietnam, dismissing it as a harmless joke between the couple. Video footage of the event circulated online, prompting initial denials from Macron's office before they confirmed its authenticity. Macron himself later commented that they were simply "horsing around" and that reports of the incident were overblown. The visit to Vietnam marks the beginning of Macron's Southeast Asian tour, where he aims to position France as a reliable alternative to the United States and China amid global economic uncertainty.</p>

Onosato clinched the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament title with a 14-1 record and expressed his commitment to learning and understanding the responsibilities of a yokozuna. His promotion is the fastest under the six-tournament calendar introduced in 1958, and he dedicates his championship to those affected by the Noto Peninsula earthquake.</p>

Chelsea secured a Champions League spot after a strange season, and many fans remain unconvinced by Maresca's style.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Senior figures in British business have noted a chilling effect on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, leading to their "rebranding" to avoid political attention. As DEI faces a right-wing backlash, organizations are reframing policies under names like "wellbeing," "belonging," and "culture." While some companies, particularly US-headquartered firms, are scaling back public commitments, experts believe a full-scale rollback is unlikely in the UK due to the Equalities Act. Employees are also exerting pressure on employers to maintain DEI policies, even as the landscape becomes more politically charged.</p>

The protests exacerbated the already poor state of officers' mental health, bringing the issue onto a broader public radar. Initiatives such as dedicated wellness units, peer support teams, and specialized training programs are being implemented to address the stressors of the job. These efforts aim to reduce the stigma associated with seeking help and provide officers with resources to cope with the trauma and challenges they face.</p>

          <p>As climate change intensifies, a reevaluation of how we perceive nature is emerging, challenging the traditional separation between living beings and inanimate matter. The concept of "Agua es vida" (water is life) highlights the interconnectedness and inherent aliveness of natural elements, such as rivers and lakes. This perspective aligns with the Rights of Nature movement, which seeks to grant legal rights to ecosystems to protect them from exploitation. The article discusses the importance of recognizing the agency of nonhuman actors in shaping our world and the need for new narratives that foreground their role in addressing the climate crisis.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns about democratic erosion in the United States, particularly with the current administration's actions, there are reasons to remain hopeful about the country's resilience. Key factors include a robust network of advocacy groups, a powerful and independent judiciary, a constitutional system that resists rapid change, a diverse and free private press, a federal system of government, and a strong commitment to free speech. These elements provide checks and balances against authoritarian tendencies and empower resistance to potential abuses of power. The article suggests that these features make the American system easier to defend and worth preserving.</p>

          <p>The author advocates for focusing on local action as a means to address the nation's larger problems, emphasizing the importance of rebuilding trust in local institutions. The story of Minnesota's unemployment insurance program, where immigrant high school students, a union electrician, and a government official worked together to change an unfair law, serves as an example of positive change at the local level. The author encourages readers to engage in their communities by volunteering in local elections, supporting local businesses, and checking on their neighbors.</p>
