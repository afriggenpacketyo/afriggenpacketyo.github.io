          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old new mother, is sharing her story of surviving an amniotic fluid embolism, a rare and often fatal complication during childbirth. Shortly before her due date, Choate's heart stopped during induced labor, but she was successfully resuscitated and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. The condition, which occurs in about 1 in 40,000 U.S. births, causes a catastrophic shutdown of the mother's organs and has a high mortality rate. Despite the traumatic experience, Choate made a remarkable recovery without long-term complications, driven by the desire to be with her newborn daughter.</p>

          <p>The Sudan Emergency Response Rooms (ERRs), a volunteer network providing essential aid during the country's civil war, were a front-runner for the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize and received the 'Alternative Nobel' Right Livelihood Award. Since the war began in April 2023, thousands of volunteers have organized to deliver food, shelter, and medical support to millions of displaced Sudanese citizens. The effort is rooted in the Sudanese tradition of 'nafeer,' or collective action, where communities come together to help one another. Despite challenges like unreliable communication and risks from combatants, the ERRs continue their vital work.</p>

          <h2>Author Morgan Housel Discusses the Philosophy of Spending and Wealth Building</h2>

          <p>In his new book, "The Art of Spending Money," author Morgan Housel argues that financial decisions are highly personal and subjective, emphasizing that true wealth is a balance between what one has and what one wants. He cautions against spending based on external benchmarks like social status, suggesting that people should focus on internal values that genuinely bring happiness, such as time with family and friends. Housel advises that building wealth is a long-term endeavor achieved through consistent, average returns over time, rather than chasing quick riches, which can lead to dangerous financial behaviors driven by fear of missing out.</p>

          <p>As the Scottish National Party (SNP) prepares for its annual conference, leader and First Minister John Swinney is focused on stabilizing the party and shifting focus to governance ahead of the next election. After a period of turmoil following the resignations of his predecessors, Swinney has worked to calm controversies and prioritize public services. While the path to Scottish independence remains a central, though challenging, issue for the party, recent polls show the SNP with a lead over a slumping Labour party. The conference will be a key opportunity for Swinney to define his leadership and outline his vision for Scotland.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump announced that eight Ukrainian children displaced by the war have been reunited with their families following her communication with Russian President Vladimir Putin. She stated that an "open channel of communication" was established after she sent a "peace letter" to Putin in August, urging him to protect child victims of the conflict. The reunification was reportedly facilitated by both Russia and Ukraine, and the First Lady said she received a detailed report confirming the identities and circumstances of each child. Russia has been accused of unlawfully deporting thousands of Ukrainian children, a charge it denies.</p>
