          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have issued an apology after finisher medals and merchandise for the event mistakenly featured an aerial view of Sunderland and the River Wear instead of the correct route through Newcastle and the River Tyne. Approximately 60,000 participants in the half-marathon received the erroneous items. In a lighthearted statement, the Great Run Company acknowledged the mistake, humorously suggesting it made the items a unique keepsake and joking, "Wear sorry!". The event's founder, Sir Brendan Foster, admitted he also failed to spot the error despite closely examining the designs.</p>

          <p>Following the Pittsburgh Steelers' 34-32 victory over the New York Jets, quarterback Aaron Rodgers expressed his satisfaction in defeating his former team. Rodgers delivered a strong performance, throwing for 244 yards and four touchdowns, marking his second consecutive game with four touchdown passes. When asked if the win was more significant because Jets' head coach Aaron Glenn had previously suggested Rodgers wasn't a good fit for the team, he quipped, "I was happy to beat everybody associated with the Jets." He added that his main goal was to enjoy the game with his new teammates.</p>

          <p>American culture is witnessing a significant shift as Southern culture gains mainstream prominence, influencing everything from music and film to college enrollment trends. This cultural takeover is attributed to several factors, including the civil rights movement, the advent of air conditioning, and the development of the interstate highway system, which made the region more accessible and livable. While the South's growing influence helps legitimize the region, it also raises questions about the appropriation of Southern aesthetics without a deeper understanding of its complex history of racial and social dynamics, a history that Southerners themselves regularly confront.</p>

          <p>On the anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's death, members of the royal family paid tribute in separate engagements. The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, attended an event with the Women's Institute, an organization with which the late Queen had a long association. Meanwhile, Prince Harry, who returned to the UK from California, privately laid a wreath at his grandmother's burial site in Windsor. This visit marks Harry's first time in the UK in five months, fueling speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, who is spending the day in Balmoral.</p>

          <p>Following the resignation of Angela Rayner, former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman has stated that the party must choose a woman from outside London to fill the role. The party's National Executive Committee is set to determine the rules and timetable for the leadership contest. Baroness Harman argued that a new deputy should complement leader Keir Starmer and broaden the party's reach. The contest was triggered by Rayner's departure after an investigation found she breached the ministerial code, prompting a major cabinet reshuffle and a new internal election.</p>

          <p>Rory McIlroy secured a dramatic victory at the Irish Open after making a 30-foot eagle putt on the final hole to force a playoff. However, the celebratory atmosphere was soured by the crowd's behavior during the playoff against Swedish golfer Joakim Lagergren. Some spectators reportedly yelled for Lagergren's ball to go in the water and cheered loudly when it did on the third playoff hole. This unsportsmanlike conduct serves as a timely reminder of the intense, partisan atmospheres that can emerge in golf, particularly with the Ryder Cup set to take place in a hostile New York environment.</p>

          <p>China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) has unveiled an ambitious plan to become a global leader in the application of artificial intelligence within the energy sector by 2030. The strategy involves developing at least five industry-specific AI models for power grids, coal, oil, and gas. By 2027, the government aims to establish a framework for integrating AI, identifying over 10 pilot projects and 100 application scenarios. The initiative also includes creating AI innovation platforms and training specialists to drive breakthroughs in core technologies and achieve progress in smart energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While artificial intelligence has generated concerns about job displacement, labor economists argue that its current impact on the broader labor market remains relatively small. Experts suggest that the recent slowdown in hiring and general job market turbulence are more attributable to widespread economic uncertainty, particularly regarding the Trump administration's policies. Although some AI-driven layoffs have occurred, they have been largely confined to the tech industry. Instead of replacing workers, many employers are showing more interest in retraining their current workforce and are creating more demand for employees who possess AI-related skills.</p>

          <p>Amid declining favorability of the United States in Germany, some major American companies are strategically rebranding their products as "Made in Germany" to appeal to local consumers. Firms like Coca-Cola have launched campaigns highlighting their German-based production and employees, aiming to distance their brands from U.S. politics. This trend reflects a broader shift where U.S. companies are tailoring their image for international audiences. The move comes as consumer sentiment, influenced by figures like Elon Musk and policies of the Trump administration, has negatively impacted sales for some American brands in Europe.</p>

          <p>Driven by staggering demand for advanced chips to power the AI revolution, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is poised for massive growth, with some analysts predicting it could become the next $3 trillion company.

With data center capital expenditures projected to reach up to $4 trillion annually by 2030, TSMC's role as the primary manufacturer for key AI components positions it for potentially sustained, rapid expansion.
