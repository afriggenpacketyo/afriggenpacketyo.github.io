          <h2>End of Federal Electric Vehicle Tax Credit Expected to Drive Summer Sales Rush</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:22:45 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The imminent termination of the federal tax credit for electric vehicles, worth up to $7,500, is predicted to cause a surge in EV purchases this summer. President Trump's new bill eliminates the incentive after September 30, prompting automakers like Tesla to urge consumers to buy now. Analysts suggest this "sense of urgency" will lead to competitive deals as buyers rush to take possession of vehicles before the deadline. The move is seen as removing "training wheels" from the EV market, which has relied on subsidies to approach price parity with gasoline-powered cars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film “Don’t Let’s Go to the Dogs Tonight,” adapted from Alexandra Fuller's memoir, explores a white family's precarious existence in 1980 Zimbabwe-Rhodesia during a period of intense civil unrest. Told through the eyes of 7-year-old Bobo, the movie captures the unsettling mix of childhood innocence and the harsh realities of a country on the brink of political transformation. Directed by and co-starring Embeth Davidtz, the drama highlights the family's entitlement and fear, juxtaposed with the perspective of their Black servants. The review praises the lead performance by Lexi Venter and the film's ability to reveal complex political undertones.</p>

          <h2>Understanding How Annuities Can Complement and Potentially Enhance Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can serve as a strategic financial tool to supplement and optimize Social Security benefits for retirees. By providing a guaranteed income stream, an annuity can allow an individual to delay claiming Social Security, which increases their future monthly payments for each year of deferral. This strategy helps create a more stable "paycheck" in retirement, covering essential expenses that Social Security alone may not fully fund. Additionally, certain types of annuities can offer tax advantages, potentially reducing the taxable portion of one's Social Security income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement its Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System during the upcoming All-Star Game in Atlanta, marking a significant step towards its potential use in the regular season. Each team will receive two challenges, which can be initiated by the pitcher, catcher, or batter to review a plate umpire's call. The Hawk-Eye tracking system will then display the pitch's trajectory and location for a final ruling. This test follows years of implementation in the minor leagues and a trial during spring training, with MLB aiming for a possible full-season rollout in 2026.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has created its own proprietary liquid cooling hardware to manage the heat generated by Nvidia's next-generation Blackwell AI chips. As advanced AI processors require liquid cooling, a shift from traditional air cooling, Amazon developed its "In-Row Heat Exchangers" to upgrade its existing data centers quickly. This innovation allows Amazon to deploy more of the powerful Blackwell chips without the delay of building new facilities. The development is seen as a positive for both companies, enabling a faster rollout of advanced AI infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

Founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, Liberia's official language is English, and its culture, flag, and capital city all reflect strong American influence. This shared heritage explains why many Liberians speak with an American-style accent. The West African nation was Africa's first independent republic and has produced notable figures like Nobel Peace Prize winner and former president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.</p>

If it occurs, the meeting would take place on the sidelines of an upcoming ASEAN summit and would be the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also suggested the U.S. might ask for Beijing's assistance in pressuring Russia to end the war in Ukraine. This potential diplomatic engagement comes despite Rubio, known for his hawkish views on China, having been personally sanctioned by Beijing twice.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the historical "Battle of the Brows," focusing on Virginia Woolf's fiery 1932 critique of the "middlebrow." Woolf defined the middlebrow as a dishonest consumer of art who lacks genuine taste, instead molding their preferences to fit current fashions. She proudly declared herself a "highbrow," one who pursues ideas with thoroughbred intelligence, and even had a certain respect for the "lowbrow," who pursues life itself. However, she reserved her sharpest disdain for the middlebrow, famously writing she would "stab him, dead" if anyone dared call her one. The essay explores how the term was once at the center of a fierce debate about art, class, and taste.</p>

          <p>The very first Hermès Birkin bag, created for and once owned by the late actress and singer Jane Birkin, has been sold at a Sotheby's auction in Paris for over $10.1 million. This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction. The iconic bag was famously conceived in 1984 after Birkin lamented to the head of Hermès on a flight that she couldn't find a suitable bag for a young mother. He sketched a design on an airplane sick bag, leading to the creation of the legendary accessory. The prototype was sold to a private collector after a heated bidding war.</p>

          <p>If you suffer from migraines, you may notice they become more frequent or severe during the summer, and a neurologist confirms there are scientific reasons for this. Dr. Shae Datta explains that weather-related changes, including bright sun, heat, and shifts in barometric pressure, can be significant triggers. Dehydration is another major factor, making it critical to stay hydrated. To help prevent attacks, experts recommend wearing sunglasses to reduce light sensitivity, ensuring adequate rest, and avoiding other personal triggers like certain fragrances in sunscreens or a lack of caffeine.</p>

          <p>A Brighton, Boston resident named Jean Powers has created a "not mail" box outside her home to foster a sense of community and connection. She invites strangers to leave notes containing "thoughts, opinions, poetry, secrets and lies," an idea she conceived during the pandemic. The responses have ranged from silly notes and poems to deeply personal and heartfelt confessions. Powers says she is often moved by the anonymous contributions, which she feels allow her to "look into the hearts and souls of strangers."
