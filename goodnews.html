Coach JJ Redick debuted a starting lineup featuring Gabe Vincent, who continued his strong preseason with 14 points. While Doncic showcased individual brilliance, the Kings' rally highlighted areas for the Lakers to address before the regular season begins.</p>

          <p>Antony Easton discovered his family's hidden past and immense fortune, lost under Nazi rule, through an old suitcase belonging to his late father. The investigation revealed his Jewish great-grandfather, Heinrich Eisner, was a multi-billionaire industrialist whose assets were forcibly sold to a non-Jewish associate during the Holocaust. While restitution for properties is time-barred, efforts to reclaim stolen artworks have seen success, with one painting returned and another claim pending. This journey has not only recovered tangible assets but also provided a profound understanding of his family's identity and tragic history.</p>

          <p>Renowned theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang, a Nobel Prize winner often compared to Albert Einstein, has died in Beijing at the age of 103. Yang, alongside Robert Mills, co-authored the groundbreaking Yang–Mills theory in 1954, which provided the mathematical framework for understanding three of nature's four fundamental forces. This pivotal work laid the foundation for the Standard Model of particle physics, a cornerstone of modern physics explaining elementary particle behavior. His passing marks the end of an era for a giant in the field of theoretical physics.</p>

          <p>Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) have achieved an impressive 86% growth in SUV sales volume in South Africa between January and August, capturing 15% of the total market share. This surge is primarily driven by strong performances from Chery and Haval, whose sales volumes rose by 27% and 45% respectively. Consequently, the market dominance of established Japanese leaders like Toyota and Suzuki is waning, as both brands experienced a decline in their individual market shares during the same period. This article highlights a significant shift in the competitive landscape of the South African automotive market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alibaba Group Holding's Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a new computing pooling solution that reportedly slashes the number of Nvidia GPUs needed for its artificial intelligence models by 82%. Beta testing demonstrated a reduction from 1,192 to 213 Nvidia H20 GPUs for serving dozens of models up to 72 billion parameters. This innovation, presented at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, addresses resource inefficiency in cloud services where many AI models are served concurrently but only a few are popular.

          <p>Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, is lauded as a visionary technocrat and naval genius credited with orchestrating the comprehensive modernization of China's naval forces. Often compared to 19th-century American strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu's leadership transformed the PLA Navy into a world-class blue water fleet. Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at 13 and rose through the ranks before being transferred to the newly established navy in 1952, where he first encountered the sea.

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is set to peak next week, offering a spectacular "fireworks" display in the night sky, visible until November 7th. Known for their brightness and speed, these meteors originate from debris left by Halley's Comet as Earth passes through its trail. Viewers can expect around 15 meteors per hour during the peak around October 22nd, which will appear to emanate from the constellation Orion. For optimal viewing, the article advises finding a dark spot away from city lights between midnight and dawn, without the need for binoculars or a telescope.</p>
