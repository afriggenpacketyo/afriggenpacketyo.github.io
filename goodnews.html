          <p>NHS Lothian psychiatrist Prof. Andrew McIntosh hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by year's end, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for severe depression. This follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began providing ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, charging ¬£6,000 for four infusions and psychotherapy. Ketamine, while not licensed for routine depression treatment, can be used 'off-label' by doctors. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release a new report on psychedelics, including updated ketamine information. The implementation of ketamine clinics may help people who suffer from severe depression when more traditional treatments have failed.</p>

Fleetwood expressed his disappointment, describing it as the "worst way to finish" after leading late in the tournament.

          <p>After Hurricane Maria devastated Puerto Rico in 2017, scientists feared for the survival of the rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, also known as Monkey Island. Despite the island losing two-thirds of its vegetation, a census revealed that most of the monkeys had survived. Researchers believe they may have huddled together for protection and consumed seaweed deposited on the beach during the storm. The staff managed to preserve decades of research data and biological samples by using generators to maintain critical temperatures, highlighting the resilience of both the research project and the monkeys themselves.</p>

Working with National Geographic Explorer Enric Sala, Vega snorkeled with the whales, which are considered a vulnerable species due to threats like noise pollution, plastic consumption, and ship strikes. Sala is working with Dominica's government to create a sanctuary for the whales, which has since been established as the first sperm whale reserve in the world. Vega described the experience as both terrifying and rewarding, emphasizing the whales' curiosity and gentle nature. The creation of the sanctuary will help preserve the sperm whale population.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report explores the unique survival strategies of sloths, the world's slowest mammal, highlighting their ability to thrive despite their apparent disadvantages. Zoologist Lucy Cooke explains that sloths' slow movement is an energy-saving adaptation to their vegetarian diet, which consists of toxic leaves that require slow digestion. They spend most of their lives hanging upside down in trees, moving with deliberate slowness to avoid predators. Cooke also challenges conventional wisdom about animal behavior, emphasizing the extraordinary and strange lives of often-overlooked creatures, advocating for a slower, more sustainable way of life inspired by the sloth. This animal has proven itself to be uniquely built to survive.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying rhesus macaque monkeys on Cayo Santiago, or Monkey Island, to understand how environmental stressors impact longevity and overall health. The monkeys, who share 94% of their DNA with humans, have been studied for over 80 years. Hurricane Maria in 2017 devastated the island, but most of the monkeys survived, leading researchers to investigate their resilience. The study revealed that monkeys who lived through the hurricane aged an extra six to eight human years, and those with stronger social bonds were more resilient to the stress. This research could provide insights into human survivability in the face of climate-related trauma.</p>

          <p>A 60 Minutes report highlighted the issue of Social Security overpayments, where beneficiaries may unexpectedly owe large sums of money, even if the error wasn't their fault. Experts recommend regularly checking earnings history, especially before retirement, to ensure accuracy. Recipients should also carefully track income if receiving disability benefits and report any worker's compensation. For those on Supplemental Security Income (SSI), understanding complex eligibility rules is crucial, and it is important to contact Social Security to request a $10 per month repayment program if eligible for a full Medicare Part D subsidy. The goal is to help people avoid unexpected bills from the Social Security Administration.</p>

          <p>Florida Republican congresswoman Kat Cammack experienced difficulties receiving treatment for an ectopic pregnancy due to concerns among hospital staff about the state's abortion law. Cammack, who opposes abortion, blamed fearmongering from pro-abortion groups for the delay, arguing it created confusion about permissible medical procedures. While Florida's healthcare agency issued guidance clarifying that ectopic pregnancies are exempt from abortion restrictions, the incident underscores the challenges and confusion arising from restrictive abortion laws. Cammack hopes her experience will foster common ground between opposing political groups to ensure women receive necessary care.

          <p>Caitlin Clark's shooting struggles persisted as the Indiana Fever lost to the Las Vegas Aces, with Clark going 1-of-10 from three-point range. The Fever led for much of the game but were outscored in the fourth quarter by the Aces, led by A'ja Wilson. Aliyah Boston led the Fever with 26 points, while Kelsey Mitchell contributed 20.

          <p>The government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting growth, with lower energy costs for businesses as a central component. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms by exempting them from green levies. The most energy-intensive firms will receive even greater discounts on network charges. The plan also includes measures to speed up energy grid connections, upskill workers, attract global talent, and boost research and development spending. The plan is aimed at helping businesses and creating new jobs.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police chief expressed shock and frustration over a planned protest in London supporting Palestine Action, an activist group. The group has engaged in activities targeting arms companies and recently broke into RAF Brize Norton, prompting the Home Secretary to consider proscribing the group as a terrorist organization. While acknowledging the right to protest, the Met chief condemned Palestine Action's actions and stated that the police would impose conditions to prevent disorder and disruption. The police will be monitoring the situation.</p>
