          <p>Professor Michele Dougherty has been appointed as the UK's first female Astronomer Royal, a prestigious advisory role to the monarch that has existed for 350 years. Despite not studying science in secondary school, she became a leading space scientist and is currently involved in a mission to explore Jupiter's icy moons for potential life. Professor Dougherty hopes her appointment will inspire more women and girls to pursue science and aims to engage the public with the wonders of astronomy. Her achievement is celebrated as a reflection of growing diversity in the scientific community.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer analyzed the upcoming initial public offering of design software company Figma, expressing admiration for its business model but cautioning against investing immediately. He noted that while Figma has impressive revenue growth and profitability, it is already priced at a high valuation that could become excessive if the stock surges upon debut. Cramer also raised concerns about the broader weakness in the enterprise software sector and the potential for increased AI spending to negatively impact Figma's profitability in the near term, as mentioned by the company's CEO.

          <p>The city of New Orleans has introduced the Crescent City ID program, a municipal identification card designed to improve access to city services for all residents. The initiative is particularly aimed at assisting vulnerable populations, including migrants, the homeless, and LGBTQ+ individuals, who may face difficulties obtaining other forms of ID. This move comes as the Trump administration continues to challenge sanctuary city policies nationwide. To protect applicants' privacy, a city official stated that the program will store minimal personal information, addressing fears seen in other cities like Chicago.</p>

          <p>The Senate has confirmed Susan Monarez as the new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making her the first person to hold the position through Senate confirmation, a new requirement. Monarez, a health scientist, takes leadership of an agency facing staffing cuts and funding challenges under the Trump administration. During her confirmation hearing, she emphasized restoring trust in the CDC, modernizing public health infrastructure, and ensuring recommendations are based on science. Public health experts expressed support for her qualifications but also anxiety over her ability to maintain scientific independence under the current administration.</p>

          <p>Las Vegas is set to host the draw for the 2026 FIFA World Cup on December 5, according to multiple reports.

The Sphere, a high-tech entertainment venue, is considered the leading candidate to stage the event. This marks a repeat of 1994, when Las Vegas also hosted the draw for the World Cup held in the U.S.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious fruit, health experts caution against excessive consumption due to several potential side effects. It is a high-FODMAP food, meaning its sugars can cause digestive issues for some people, particularly those with irritable bowel syndrome. The fruit also contains high levels of tyramine, an amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible individuals. Additionally, due to its natural sugar content, people with diabetes are advised to eat it in moderation. Experts recommend enjoying watermelon as part of a balanced diet rather than as the sole feature of a cleanse.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the Mexican national wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from ICE detention in Louisiana following intervention from the office of Republican Senator John Kennedy.

After a judge halted the deportation, Senator Kennedy's office requested her release from the Department of Homeland Security. The case highlights instances where Republican lawmakers, who generally support hardline immigration policies, have intervened in specific cases involving constituents.</p>
