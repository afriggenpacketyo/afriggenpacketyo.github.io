          <h2>Nvidia Plans Modified H20 Chip Release for China Amid Export Restrictions</h2>

          <p>Nvidia is reportedly planning to release a modified version of its H20 chip for the Chinese market in July, aiming to navigate U.S. export controls. The downgraded H20 chip is Nvidia's attempt to maintain its presence in China, a crucial market, after U.S. officials blocked the original H20 due to export license requirements. The new chip will have significantly reduced memory capacity, but customers may be able to adjust its performance. Nvidia declined to comment on the report, and the U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>

          <h2>China's Exports Surge Despite U.S. Tariffs Due to Increased Trade with Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 01:37:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced an 8.1% surge in April, driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which compensated for a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. due to tariffs. Exports to the U.S. plummeted by over 21%, while imports from the U.S. dropped nearly 14%. Conversely, exports to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) surged by 20.8%, with Vietnam and Malaysia remaining key destinations, and Indonesia and Thailand seeing substantial growth. The surge in overall exports may be partly attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced.</p>

          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, surpassing expectations despite increased tariffs from the U.S., giving Chinese negotiators a possible advantage in upcoming trade talks. However, exports to the U.S. fell by 21%, marking the sharpest drop in 21 months. Some economists believe that the full impact of the US tariffs has not yet been reflected in the data. Many exporters are finding ways to work around the tariffs, including finding alternative markets.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A mines developer suggests that developed nations are waking up to the need to diversify their tungsten supply sources after China restricted exports. Beijing added tungsten to its export restriction list in February, leading to panic in the industry that has relied on China for raw materials for 30 years. US defense contractors face a looming supply chain challenge to stop using Chinese tungsten by 2027. China accounts for over 80% of global tungsten ore mined, making diversification critical for other nations.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has granted refugee status to 54 Afrikaans South Africans, white descendants of Dutch colonizers, who are expected to arrive in the U.S. The group is the first to be accepted after President Trump signed an executive order offering them possible resettlement.

Several of the people granted refugee status have family ties in the U.S., they said.</p>
