          <p>Emily Thornberry has withdrawn from the race for deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party after failing to secure enough nominations from her fellow Members of Parliament. Her departure leaves four candidates, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson considered the frontrunner, having already secured the necessary backing. The contest is seen by some as an unwelcome distraction for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, as it could become a platform for party members to express discontent with the current leadership. The winner of the contest will be announced in late October.</p>

          <p>According to a new Morgan Stanley report, interest from U.S. investors in Chinese stocks has reached its highest level in five years, with over 90% expressing a desire to increase their exposure. This renewed interest extends beyond U.S.-listed equities to include onshore A-shares, driven by China's sector leadership, market stabilization efforts, and a need for diversification from U.S. assets. The bank suggests that this shift marks only the beginning of a potential significant capital inflow back into China's market after a multi-year retreat by many international funds.

          <p>As part of a sweeping anti-corruption investigation, China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force has banned nearly 200 entities, including 116 suppliers and 74 bid evaluation experts, from its procurement projects. The move, reported by official military procurement channels, is part of a broader crackdown on corruption within the military's equipment sector that intensified following the downfall of former defense minister Li Shangfu. The Rocket Force is a critical branch of the PLA, responsible for overseeing China's strategic nuclear missile arsenal, making integrity in its supply chain a national security priority.</p>

          <p>After narrowly avoiding relegation and facing financial penalties, Everton has undergone a significant revival, marked by a record net spend of £97 million on nine new players this summer. This financial turnaround was enabled by a period of minimal spending, profitable player sales, and a transformative takeover by the Friedkin Group that resolved the club's debt issues. The club's revitalized transfer strategy, highlighted by the successful loan signing of Jack Grealish, has propelled them to fifth in the Premier League, raising expectations for a successful season.</p>

          <p>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has addressed allegations that the Los Angeles Clippers circumvented the salary cap through an endorsement deal for star Kawhi Leonard, stating the league needs definitive proof of wrongdoing before taking action. The league is investigating claims that a fraudulent sustainability firm, Aspiration, paid Leonard $28 million for a nominal role at the behest of Clippers owner Steve Ballmer, who had invested in the company. Silver emphasized that the burden of proof is on the league and that he would be reluctant to act on a "mere appearance of impropriety."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to an industry-wide slump, major luxury brands like Louis Vuitton and Prada are diversifying their offerings with less expensive products, such as $160 lipsticks and high-end bag charms. This strategy aims to engage a broader and younger base of aspirational consumers without diluting the exclusivity of their core high-ticket items. The move reflects a "treatonomics" trend, where shoppers splurge on small luxuries while cutting back on larger purchases, allowing brands to build loyalty with the hope that these new customers will eventually graduate to more expensive products.</p>

          <p>Stock markets across the globe, including the S&P 500 and Japan's Nikkei 225, are hitting record highs, driven by growing investor optimism. This rally is fueled by resilient corporate earnings, positive inflation data like a surprisingly soft U.S. producer price index, and strengthening expectations that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates soon. Analysts note that this positive sentiment marks a significant shift from earlier in the year, with factors like Oracle's strong AI-related outlook boosting confidence that the tech-led surge has continued momentum.

          <p>China has invested nearly 450 billion yuan (US$63.2 billion) in a five-year strategic mineral exploration program, resulting in major discoveries of oil, gas, copper, lithium, and uranium. Officials announced the initiative has identified over 500 large and medium-sized deposits, including 10 large oilfields and 19 major gas fields, significantly bolstering the nation's energy security. These efforts are part of China's broader strategy to reduce its reliance on imports for critical resources amid geopolitical tensions and increasing demand from high-tech industries.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for a private tea at Clarence House, their first face-to-face meeting in over a year and a half. The meeting is being interpreted as a small but significant step toward healing the deep rift within the royal family, following a period of public criticism and strained relations. While details of the 50-minute conversation were kept private, the fact that the meeting occurred, and was not undermined by leaks, suggests a potential shift toward dialogue, though a full family reconciliation, particularly with Prince William, remains distant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Redfin analysis suggests that San Francisco's housing market has returned to a "normal" state, with the mortgage payment-to-income ratio reverting to its July 2018 level. This stabilization is attributed to slowing home-price growth combined with rapidly rising wages for the city's high-earning tech workers. However, the report clarifies that "normal" does not mean affordable, as the typical San Francisco household in 2018 still spent a staggering 74% of its income on a mortgage. The trend also does not reflect the reality for renters, who face spiking costs driven by the recent AI boom.</p>

          <p>Scientists report that NASA's Perseverance rover has collected rock samples from a dry river channel on Mars that contain compelling potential signs of ancient microbial life. The samples show evidence of organic carbon alongside iron phosphate and iron sulfide compounds, which on Earth are byproducts of microorganisms consuming organic matter. While researchers stress that non-biological processes could also explain these features, they represent the most promising candidate yet in the search for extraterrestrial life, though conclusive analysis must await the samples' eventual return to Earth.</p>
