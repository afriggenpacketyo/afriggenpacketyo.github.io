          <p>Homeowners in disaster-prone areas are increasingly investing in upgrades to protect their properties from extreme weather events, leading to insurance premium discounts. States like Alabama and California are implementing programs that offer incentives for strengthening homes against hurricanes and wildfires. These upgrades include fortified roofs, fire-resistant materials, and defensible space around the property. While these measures can help reduce insurance costs, some experts argue that insurance companies need to better account for these improvements when determining coverage and renewal policies.</p>

This approach requires extra effort and negotiation with the city but demonstrates the possibility of building density with trees in mind.</p>

          <p>New guidelines from the Chinese government may allow Hong Kong-listed companies to seek secondary share listings in Shenzhen. The new opportunity would diversify fundraising options for businesses within the Greater Bay Area. The dual-listing scenario could also tempt more businesses to seek listings in Hong Kong, as a single application could allow them to offer shares in both markets.</p>

          <p>South Korea's military has suspended its loudspeaker propaganda broadcasts across the border to North Korea. This action aims to "restore trust" between both countries. The action comes a week after the election of new president Lee Jae-myung, who had campaigned on improving inter-Korean ties. Organisations advocating to improve the human rights of North Koreans have criticised the suspension.</p>

          <p>The Bensalem Township School District is weighing options for a new middle school, with all plans costing over $100 million. The options include renovating existing schools, constructing a single building, or creating a campus with separate buildings. A decision is expected soon, as the district aims to alleviate capacity issues in its elementary and middle schools. The board voted unanimously last fall to move the district's sixth graders up to the middle school in the hope to alleviate capacity issues within the district's elementary and middle schools.</p>
