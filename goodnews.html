          <p>Burberry is set to cut 1,700 jobs globally as part of its ongoing turnaround strategy, aiming to save ¬£60 million by 2027. The job cuts, impacting around 20% of the workforce, will primarily affect office-based roles, stores, and its Castleford factory. Despite a 6% sales decrease in the fiscal fourth quarter, slightly better than analysts' expectations, Burberry shares surged 17%. CEO Joshua Schulman remains optimistic about the brand's future, citing the company's diversified business model and planned steps to mitigate risks from tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Honeywell and Dover, two industrial stocks, are benefiting from easing tensions between the U.S. and China, with both companies reporting encouraging business updates. Honeywell anticipates a lower tariff exposure of around $400 million due to reduced duty rates, while Dover emphasizes its manageable supply chains and limited China exposure. Both companies remain confident in their fiscal guidance, with Honeywell noting strong orders and Dover highlighting growth in its biopharma business. These factors, combined with strategic price hikes and a focus on domestic sales, position both companies to weather potential tariff-driven slowdowns. (not investment advice)</p>

He served in the state department and the Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton, and his thinking had a significant impact on the Obama administration.

The brothers, now 54 and 57, have garnered support due to allegations of abuse they experienced from their father, with family members forgiving them and expressing a desire to see them released.

Judge Giles refuted the government's claims that he has ties to Hamas through his father-in-law, and said that Suri's continued detention in Texas will cause "irreparable harm" both to him and to the public due to the "chilling effect" his detention has caused on First Amendment protected free speech.</p>
