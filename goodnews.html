          <p>New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani, 33, is campaigning on an ambitious platform that includes substantial tax increases for the wealthy and businesses, free bus services, universal childcare, and a $30 minimum wage by 2030. However, this article from The Economist raises significant doubts about the feasibility of many of these proposals, suggesting they have little chance of becoming reality. The publication characterizes Mamdani as partly a "fabulist," implying that the grand scope of his promises may be more aspirational than practical. The piece highlights the common political challenge of candidates making commitments that are difficult to deliver.</p>

          <p>Berlin's Mohrenstrasse has been officially renamed Anton Wilhelm Amo Strasse, culminating a multi-year effort to address racial sensitivity and promote inclusion. Local politicians championed the change, citing the derogatory historical connotations of "Mohr," a term formerly used for people of African descent. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, born in Ghana in 1703, who became the first well-known Black philosopher and legal scholar at a German university. This article underscores the significance of the renaming as a "clear sign in favor of respect and diversity," reflecting a broader commitment to confronting and rectifying racist historical legacies within public spaces.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce legislation next month proposing a significant overhaul of sentencing rules, which would empower courts to impose new pub, sports match, driving, and travel bans as part of community sentences. These reforms, drawing from an independent review, also aim to alleviate prison overcrowding by limiting short prison sentences and allowing for the early release of certain well-behaved inmates. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood has, however, clarified that the most serious offenders, including those convicted of terror offenses, will not be eligible for early release. This article points to concerns from legal experts and the hospitality sector regarding the practical implementation, enforcement, and adequate funding necessary for these new restrictions and enhanced monitoring systems.</p>
