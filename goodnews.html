          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position for Red Bull at the Miami Grand Prix with a remarkable lap at the Hard Rock Stadium, edging out McLaren's Lando Norris and Mercedes' Kimi Antonelli. Lewis Hamilton, however, was eliminated in Q2, failing to advance after finishing 12th. Verstappen's pole position marks a comeback after a penalty in the sprint race, offering him an opportunity to close the gap in the championship standings. He expressed confidence in his ride after managing only sixth in Bahrain with a car that lacked balance, and his team's discussions led to improvements with the new floor they brought to Miami. The pole may prove key for the race in what remains a very closely fought title fight.</p>

          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The legislation provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Democrats argue that the bill will siphon funds from already underfunded public schools, primarily benefiting wealthier students already in private education. The bill's passage marks a significant victory for conservatives advocating for school choice, with supporters arguing it empowers parents to choose the best educational option for their children.</p>

          <p>Florida lawmakers have sent a bill to the governor addressing the rising costs faced by condominium owners in aging buildings, balancing safety requirements with financial relief. The legislation comes in response to strict requirements imposed after the 2021 Surfside collapse, mandating structural integrity inspections and fully funded reserves for repairs. The new bill pushes back deadlines for inspections and allows condo associations a two-year grace period for funding reserves. It also permits associations to secure loans with member approval, aiming to alleviate the financial strain on condo owners while maintaining safety standards.</p>

          <p>An election is underway to incorporate a new city on the southern tip of Texas, dominated by Elon Musk's SpaceX company, called Starbase. Local residents are voting on incorporating Boca Chica Village as a new municipality, with most of the eligible voters being SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase would establish a local government with power over planning, taxation, and other local issues, but some nearby residents oppose the measure, citing environmental concerns. The city's incorporation could lead to conflicts with county officials over access to Boca Chica Beach as SpaceX aims to increase its launch frequency.</p>
