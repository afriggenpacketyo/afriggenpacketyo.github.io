          <p>The island nation of Cape Verde is celebrating 50 years of independence, marking five decades of significant progress in development, education, and healthcare. Since 1975, the country has drastically reduced illiteracy from 65% to about 3% and boasts one of the highest life expectancies in Africa at nearly 75 years. Despite these successes, challenges such as youth unemployment and poverty persist, prompting the government to implement targeted social policies funded by a tourism tax. While many young, educated citizens migrate for better opportunities, their remittances remain a vital part of the nation's economy.</p>

          <p>Mercedes driver George Russell has stated he is confident about his future with the team, despite ongoing speculation linking four-time world champion Max Verstappen to his seat. Russell, whose contract expires at the end of this season, emphasized that he believes the likelihood of him not being at Mercedes next year is "exceptionally low." He trusts team boss Toto Wolff, who has never let him down, and believes his strong performance on the track speaks for itself. Russell is currently fourth in the drivers' championship and recently secured a victory at the Canadian Grand Prix.</p>

          <p>Seven-time champion Novak Djokovic delivered a dominant performance to defeat British veteran Dan Evans in the second round at Wimbledon, winning in straight sets. Djokovic's masterclass in serving and returning secured his 99th match win at the tournament, setting up a third-round match against fellow Serb Miomir Kecmanovic. For the 35-year-old Evans, the match may have been his final appearance at the All England Club. Meanwhile, British wildcards Jack Pinnington Jones and Arthur Fery were both eliminated from the tournament, ending their respective runs in the second round after being defeated by Italian opponents.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several conservative House Republicans who initially opposed a massive spending bill ultimately voted for it after receiving personal assurances from President Donald Trump. While the legislative text remained unchanged from the Senate's version, holdouts said Trump promised to address their concerns in the future, potentially through executive action. Lawmakers like Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina mentioned receiving assurances about changes to wind and solar tax credits. Others, like Rep. Chip Roy, claimed the Freedom Caucus had already secured important reforms, such as changes to Medicaid, even as they acknowledged more work was needed.</p>

          <h2>Government Sector Led U.S. Job Growth in June 2025</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 11:45:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. labor market's expansion in June was primarily driven by hiring in state and local governments, which added 73,000 jobs. This sector accounted for about half of the total 147,000 nonfarm payrolls added during the month, with most new positions in education. The healthcare and social assistance sector also saw significant growth, adding over 58,000 jobs. In contrast, the federal government workforce shrank by 7,000 positions, reflecting ongoing job-cutting initiatives. While this government-led growth helped the overall numbers exceed expectations, analysts caution that such strong public-sector hiring may not be sustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. labor market continued to defy expectations in June, adding 147,000 jobs and lowering the unemployment rate to 4.1%. The job growth, which surpassed economists' predictions, was largely driven by hiring in the government and healthcare sectors. These strong figures indicate a resilient economy, even amidst uncertainty from trade policy and potential tariffs. The robust report likely gives the Federal Reserve justification to maintain its current interest rate policy, holding off on cuts despite pressure from the White House. Economists still anticipate a slowdown in growth later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a long-term Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account is more profitable for a $10,000 deposit in the current interest rate environment. While high-yield savings accounts currently offer slightly higher variable rates, calculations show they would earn only marginally more than fixed-rate CDs over terms of 18 months to three years. Given the high probability of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut later this year, locking in a competitive CD rate now could prove to be the more lucrative long-term strategy, as savings account rates are expected to fall.

          <p>The technology IPO market is showing signs of life after a prolonged drought, with a recent surge in public offerings sparking optimism among venture capitalists. Crypto company Circle's successful debut, with its stock up sixfold since its IPO, has been a major highlight, providing significant returns for its early investors. After a virtual standstill since early 2022, five tech companies went public in June 2025, a notable acceleration from previous months. While the market is not fully recovered, this momentum suggests that the 'liquidity drought' that has plagued venture-backed startups may finally be ending. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer views the strong June jobs report as a vindication of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's cautious approach to interest rates, which has been at odds with President Trump's demands for immediate cuts. With better-than-expected job growth and a lower unemployment rate, Cramer argues there is no justification for an imminent rate cut. In an overbought market, he suggests investors consider trimming profits from high-performing stocks like Broadcom and certain bank stocks. This analysis highlights the ongoing tension between the independent Federal Reserve and the political pressures exerted by the administration. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the long history of older generations expressing concern and condescension toward the youth, a practice seen in publications for over a century. From a 1925 piece lamenting the supposed lack of romance and intellectual curiosity in young people to Midge Decter's 1975 critique of hippies, adults have consistently scrutinized the habits and morals of the next generation. The author, a Millennial who often writes about Gen Z, questions the line between empathy and judgmental observation. Ultimately, the piece suggests that the most valuable commentary avoids broad stereotypes and approaches youth culture with humility and genuine curiosity.</p>
