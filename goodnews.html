          <p>Chrysler is recalling more than a quarter-million 2022-2025 Pacifica and Voyager vehicles due to a potential side curtain airbag issue. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration noted that improperly sealed seams could prevent the airbags from holding enough pressure during deployment in certain crashes, increasing injury risk. While the company is unaware of any related accidents or injuries, it is urging owners to comply with the recall notices. Dealers will inspect and replace the faulty airbags free of charge to ensure passenger safety.</p>

          <p>India's Smriti Mandhana delivered a masterful performance, scoring her first T20 international hundred with 112 runs from 62 balls. Her stunning century powered India to a total of 210-5, their second-highest in the format, setting the stage for a commanding 97-run victory over England at Trent Bridge. England's chase faltered early, and they were ultimately bowled out for 113, with debutante spinner Shree Charani taking four wickets. The result marks England's heaviest T20 defeat by runs and highlights areas for improvement early in the five-match series.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in Budapest's 30th annual Pride march, defying a government ban and risking significant fines. The event was a direct challenge to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's administration, which recently passed a law outlawing events that "promote" homosexuality to minors. Despite the threat of police intervention, the march proceeded with the support of Budapest's mayor and was seen as a major demonstration for LGBTQ+ rights and broader democratic freedoms in Hungary. The massive turnout is considered a significant rebuke to Orb√°n's increasingly restrictive policies.</p>

          <p>The lavish wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice has created a divided response in the city. While the event brought a host of A-list celebrities and was hailed by some as the "high-quality tourism" Venice needs, it also triggered protests. Activists demonstrated against over-tourism, capitalism, and the environmental impact of the elite, arguing that billionaires are using the historic city as a private amusement park. Despite the controversy and some minor disruptions, city officials defended the wedding, highlighting a multi-million euro donation from Bezos to help protect the fragile city.</p>

This move aligns with similar pledges from other major food corporations like Nestle, Kraft Heinz, and General Mills amid increased federal scrutiny of synthetic dyes. The company stated that while most of its products, like Uncrustables, are already free from these additives, some items such as sugar-free jams and Hostess-brand snacks still contain them. The transition will also apply to foods sold to K-12 schools, with a target completion date of the 2026-2027 school year.</p>

          <p>Lockheed Martin, in partnership with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, has successfully completed a critical flight test of its Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR). The test, designated FTO-26a, took place over the North Pacific Ocean and demonstrated the system's ability to detect, track, and differentiate a live ballistic missile target from countermeasures in a complex scenario. This event marked a significant milestone, proving the LRDR's advanced capabilities and its integration with the Command and Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC) system for a simulated engagement. The test reinforces the system's role in enhancing national missile defense. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An employee at a St. George, Utah, auto center foiled a sophisticated auto theft scheme by noticing a "suspicious" Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) on a pickup truck. The dealership was about to pay $51,000 for the 2023 Chevrolet truck when the employee discovered the VIN had been altered. The real VIN revealed the vehicle was stolen, prompting the dealer to contact law enforcement, who set up a sting operation. The arrest of three suspects also uncovered a second stolen truck they had sold to another dealer for $44,000, preventing a total loss of $95,000.</p>

The review comes as former Health Minister Jens Spahn faces criticism for procuring overpriced face masks, a decision that could cost the government billions in lawsuits. Lawmakers and scientists support the inquiry, hoping to rebuild public trust and learn lessons for future crises. The commission will likely examine the scientific advice process, coordination between federal and state governments, and the societal impact of measures like lockdowns, aiming to address lingering divisions and support those still affected by the pandemic.</p>
