          <p>Alison Hall, an "Inside Edition" correspondent, attributes her early-stage breast cancer diagnosis to actress Olivia Munn's public sharing of her own breast cancer story. Inspired by Munn's advocacy for early detection, Hall underwent a breast cancer risk assessment test and subsequent MRI, leading to the discovery of stage zero cancer. Hall met Munn, expressing gratitude for the "gift of early detection" and highlighting the impact of Munn's openness on other women. Hall underwent a double mastectomy and reconstructive surgery, avoiding chemotherapy and radiation due to the early diagnosis, and emphasized the importance of body image and self-acceptance after cancer treatment. The full report will air on "Inside Edition" on Wednesday, with Hall sharing letters from other women who were similarly impacted by Munn's story.</p>

          <p>Amazon's autonomous vehicle unit, Zoox, is ramping up robotaxi production at its new facility in Hayward, California, with plans for a commercial launch in Las Vegas later this year. The facility currently produces one robotaxi per day, with expectations to accelerate production to three per hour at full scale, aiming for 10,000 robotaxis annually. Zoox began testing its robotaxis on public roads in 2023 and currently operates a few dozen in Foster City, San Francisco, and Las Vegas.

          <p>A recent study reveals that mothers disproportionately manage 71% of family tasks, leading to cognitive and emotional overload. Psychiatrist Dr. Sue Varma emphasizes the invisible load women carry, including constant attention to children's needs and household management. This mental load can result in anxiety, sleep disturbances, and irritability, impacting women's well-being. Varma suggests partners should actively participate in household tasks, engage in open communication, and acknowledge the emotional burden women face. Partners can show support by initiating tasks without being asked, taking ownership of responsibilities, and expressing appreciation for the caregiver's role.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins, with a 68-30 vote. The bill requires full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. The legislation grants authority to the Treasury Secretary and faces hurdles in the House. Senator Jeff Merkley criticized the bill, accusing Republicans of enabling Trump's crypto corruption. The GENIUS Act restricts non-financial large tech companies from directly issuing stablecoins and allows traditional financial institutions to adapt to the stablecoin era.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to hold its benchmark interest rate steady at its upcoming meeting, reflecting a cautious approach due to economic uncertainty. The CME Group's FedWatch Tool indicates a high probability that the Fed will maintain the current range of 4.25% to 4.5%. This decision signals ongoing caution as the Fed monitors the impact of President Trump's tariffs, with recent commentary reinforcing a wait-and-see approach. While consumer sentiment has improved, uncertainty persists, and the inflation rate has slightly increased. Economists predict a low probability of a rate cut, with expectations for credit card rates, auto loans, and mortgages to remain high.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will delay the enforcement of a law banning TikTok in the U.S. for a third time, five months after the initial start date. He plans to grant a 90-day extension while the administration works to close a deal, potentially requiring China's blessing. This decision follows a high-stakes meeting between U.S. and Chinese officials to revive stalled trade negotiations. Trump's actions contradict the bipartisan law passed last year, which demanded that TikTok, used by over half of Americans, be divested from its Beijing-based owner due to concerns about spying and influence.</p>

          <p>Juneteenth, now a federally recognized holiday, commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. and is celebrated annually on June 19. The name Juneteenth combines the words June and nineteenth, originating from June 19, 1865, when enslaved people in Texas were informed of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation. Although the Emancipation Proclamation was issued earlier, its enforcement in Confederate states, including Texas, was delayed until the Union Army arrived. The holiday symbolizes freedom, unity, and resilience, with celebrations including parades, parties, and educational events.</p>
