CEO Alexander Sagel and COO Emmerich Schiller are leveraging their automotive backgrounds to facilitate this cross-industry collaboration, hiring engineers who can bring efficiency and quality improvement methods to the defense sector.

          <p>A US federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs, ruling that the emergency law invoked by the White House does not grant the president unilateral authority to impose tariffs on nearly every country. The court stated that the US Constitution gives Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration has lodged an appeal and the immediate implications of the court's ruling are unclear, as the case needs to go through the appeals process. The ruling has boosted global financial markets, with major stock markets in Asia rising and the US dollar gaining ground against safe-haven currencies.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. reported a 10% year-on-year increase in global sales for April, reaching a record 876,864 vehicles, driven by growing demand ahead of potential negative impacts from higher US tariffs on imported cars. Global production also rose by 7.8% to 814,787 vehicles, marking an all-time high for April. While Toyota plans to absorb the tariff costs, analysts believe the company may face pressure to pass them on to consumers in the long term. The automaker anticipates a significant drop in net profit for the business year due to the tariffs and a stronger yen. (not investment advice)</p>
