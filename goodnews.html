          <p>Brian Wilson, the visionary leader of the Beach Boys, has died at the age of 82, according to a statement from his family. Wilson's genius for melody and arrangements led to iconic summertime anthems like "Good Vibrations" and "California Girls," making him one of the most influential recording artists. The Beach Boys, formed with his brothers Carl and Dennis, rose to international fame in the 1960s, selling over 100 million records and becoming symbols of California culture. Wilson's musical ambition pushed the Beach Boys beyond simple pop, but his personal struggles and mental health challenges also became part of the band's story, influencing his career in both positive and negative ways. The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, cementing their legacy. </p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deport or detain Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil based on foreign policy reasons cited by Secretary of State Marco Rubio. The preliminary injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge Michael Farbiarz, focuses on Rubio's determination that Khalil's presence would compromise U.S. foreign policy interests. The judge found that Khalil's career, reputation, and speech were being irreparably harmed by the detention. However, the ruling does not prevent the administration from pursuing deportation based on alleged inaccuracies in Khalil's green card application. </p>
