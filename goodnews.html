          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 16:15:30 EDT</div>

          <p>Warren Buffett, the 94-year-old famed value investor, announced his plans to step down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, the $1.1 trillion conglomerate he transformed from a failing textile manufacturer. Buffett's value investing approach, focusing on buying wonderful businesses at fair prices, influenced generations of financiers and promoted long-term investing. Under his leadership, Berkshire acquired numerous successful businesses and insurers, amassing a personal fortune of about $168 billion and earning him millions of admirers. His successor, Gregory Abel, is regarded as an excellent operator of businesses and a savvy deal maker, but some investors worry that the company will become less special without Buffett's stock-picking prowess.

          <p>Jack Draper, despite losing to Casper Ruud in the Madrid Open final, showcased his potential as a top player on all surfaces. Andy Murray has previously noted Draper's potential to become world number one, and his recent performances, including winning his first Masters title at Indian Wells, support this. Ruud, a leading clay-courter, acknowledged Draper's talent and predicted he would become a significant threat on clay. Draper's strong serving and forehand were key to his success in the tournament, but Ruud's experience and physicality ultimately secured him the victory.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that he would not fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell before his term ends in May 2026, despite calling for lower interest rates. Trump believes Powell's reluctance to lower rates stems from personal dislike, but acknowledged he will soon have the opportunity to appoint a replacement. Trump emphasized the need for lower interest rates to boost the economy, but ruled out immediate action against Powell, despite their differing views. The President feels that the current economic conditions warrant a decrease in interest rates.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is seeking to incorporate its launch site in Cameron County, Texas, into its own city named Starbase. A preliminary vote indicates strong support for the initiative, which would allow SpaceX to create its own fire department, emergency services, and school district. However, residents express concerns about SpaceX's increasing control over the area, including potential restrictions to Boca Chica Beach. Environmental groups also raise concerns about the impact of frequent rocket launches on the environment and local community, as SpaceX seeks permits for up to 25 launches per year.</p>
