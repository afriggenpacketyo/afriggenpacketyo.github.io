          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer are scheduled to meet with their Chinese counterparts in Switzerland to discuss trade and economic matters. The meetings aim to de-escalate the ongoing trade war ignited by President Trump, who recently increased tariffs on Chinese imports. Bessent emphasized the need for fair trade rather than decoupling, acknowledging that the current tariff war is unsustainable, particularly for China. Stock futures rose following the announcement, indicating market optimism about potential progress in resolving trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gold prices have recently surged, reaching record highs, but experts suggest several scenarios that could trigger a price drop. These include investors taking profits, a sharp strengthening of the U.S. dollar, economic recovery reducing safe-haven demand, cooling political and economic tensions, a breakout equity market rally, and deflationary pressure with central bank shifts. Despite potential declines, experts advise that gold investing should be viewed as a long-term strategy, and that it is best secured before market turmoil begins. (not investment advice)</p>

The bill follows campaigns by families of murder victims whose killers refused to attend sentencing, and it seeks to ensure that perpetrators face the consequences of their actions. The bill is seen as a 'step in the right direction' by some victims' families.</p>
