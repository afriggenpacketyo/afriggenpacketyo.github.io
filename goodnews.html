          <p>Suga, a rapper and songwriter from the K-pop group BTS, has completed his mandatory military service in South Korea, marking the official return of all seven members after their enlistment duties. Big Hit Entertainment, BTS's management agency, confirmed that Suga completed his alternative service duties, with no special events planned for his release due to concerns about overcrowding. In South Korea, all eligible men between 18 and 28 are required to serve in the military for 18 to 21 months, though special exemptions are granted to athletes and classical musicians who have achieved significant recognition. BTS members were able to postpone their service until the age of 30, and the group plans to reunite as a whole in 2025.</p>

          <p>US Vice President JD Vance stated that the U.S. is only at war with Iran's nuclear program, not Iran itself, following U.S. airstrikes ordered by President Trump. Vance suggested the strikes have significantly set back Iran's nuclear program and presented an opportunity to reset the relationship and negotiations between the two countries. He accused Iran of not negotiating in good faith during previous diplomatic talks, which he said prompted the U.S. strikes. Vance added that the U.S. does not seek regime change in Iran but desires a long-term settlement that ensures Iran is not a threat to its neighbors or the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rumor circulating online claimed that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" would occur that the world would remember for centuries, but this claim appears to be false. Searches of major wire services found no reports of such an announcement, and the rumor likely originated from an X post by an account not affiliated with any government entity. The claim was shared amid escalating tensions in the Middle East, but lacked credible evidence to support its validity. Snopes contacted Iran's ministry of foreign affairs for clarification but has not yet received a response.</p>

          <p>England captain Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. India was carefully building their lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a lead of 96 runs at the close of play. Brook's innings featured some remarkable shots, but he was eventually caught out just short of his century. England had previously been bowled out for 465, trailing by six runs.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East closed mostly higher on Sunday, demonstrating resilience following the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by optimism that Washington's involvement would help resolve the conflict with Tehran. While Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed down slightly, other Gulf markets, including Qatar and Bahrain, saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was the major gainer in the region, closing significantly higher. Fadi Arbid of Amwal Capital Partners suggested that the Gulf's distancing from the conflict and calls for peaceful resolution have helped isolate it from significant market impact.
