          <p>Journalism, the favorite after finishing second in the Kentucky Derby, triumphed at the 150th Preakness Stakes held at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore. Overcoming a trailing position, Journalism surged ahead in the final stretch, securing a win for trainer Michael McCarthy and jockey Umberto Rispoli, the first Italian jockey to win a Triple Crown race. Sovereignty, the Kentucky Derby winner, did not participate, but is expected to run in the Belmont Stakes, setting up a potential rematch. The Preakness is set to be held at nearby Laurel Park, between Baltimore and Washington, D.C., next year before a planned return to the new Pimlico in 2027.</p>

          <p>Federal courts have consistently pushed back against the Trump administration's efforts to expedite deportations, emphasizing the importance of due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court has chastised the administration for providing inadequate notice to immigrants facing deportation, while other courts have insisted on fair warning periods and the right to challenge removal orders. These rulings underscore the constitutional principle that all individuals, regardless of citizenship status, are entitled to due process before being deprived of life, liberty, or property. The cases highlight concerns over the administration's manipulation of processes to avoid judicial review and the potential for indefinite detention or persecution in countries to which immigrants are deported.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator, Mosura fentoni, in the Canadian Rockies. The creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," possessed a pencil sharpener-like mouth and claws extending from its head. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period and reveals the complexity of early life forms. The sea moth is believed to have used its body flaps to swim similarly to modern stingrays, sharing the waters with fellow radiodont and early apex predator, the iconic Anomalocaris canadensis.</p>
