          <p>Italians are participating in a two-day referendum concerning potential changes to citizenship and labor laws. The vote, triggered by an NGO-led grassroots campaign, includes questions about reducing the residency requirement for citizenship applications for non-EU adults from 10 to 5 years. Campaigners argue this change would aid the integration of second-generation Italians and align Italy with other European countries, potentially benefiting around 2.5 million people. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's right-wing coalition advises supporters to abstain, hoping to prevent the referendum from reaching the required 50% turnout, as they do not support easing citizenship requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the dangers of "anticipatory compliance" with potentially authoritarian measures, using Donald Trump's presidency as a case study. It argues that institutions often preemptively comply with perceived demands, thus smoothing the path to autocracy. The author advocates for "anticipatory noncompliance," highlighting examples of resistance from universities, law firms, and corporations. By standing firm against unconstitutional actions and questionable demands, citizens and institutions can halt the erosion of democracy and protect civil liberties.</p>

          <p>A network of women in Latin America transformed safe, self-managed abortions by sharing information and providing support despite legal restrictions. The movement started with the discovery of misoprostol's potential for abortion and grew through grassroots activism, hotlines, and accompaniment networks. Activists provided information, resources, and emotional support to women seeking abortions, challenging legal barriers and societal norms. Their efforts have contributed to the legalization of abortion in several Latin American countries, and they continue to provide essential services and expertise.</p>
