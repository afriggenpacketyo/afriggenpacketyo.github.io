          <p>This article recounts the story of Julie Moore, an Army spouse who spearheaded a movement to change the way the U.S. military notifies families of service member deaths. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for in-person notifications with support for the grieving families. Her efforts led to a significant shift in Army culture, with service members now personally delivering the news and offering assistance. Moore's legacy was honored in 2023 when Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore, marking the first time a military base was named after a civilian.</p>

          <p>A police officer in Dalton, Georgia, has resigned after mistakenly arresting a 19-year-old undocumented college student, Ximena Arias Cristobal, leading to her detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The officer pulled Arias-Cristobal over for a traffic violation, but after reviewing dashcam footage, officials found the wrong vehicle had been stopped and dismissed the charges. Arias Cristobal, who came to the U.S. from Mexico at age 4, was released from ICE custody after an immigration judge granted her bond, and her father, also detained by ICE, was released as well. Both still face deportation proceedings.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent shift in policy toward Syria, marked by meetings with President Ahmed al-Sharaa and plans to lift sanctions, has complicated Israel's military strategy in the region. Previously, Israel conducted numerous airstrikes in Syria, aiming to prevent hostile groups from acquiring weapons and establishing a presence near its borders. However, since Trump's embrace of al-Sharaa, Israeli airstrikes have significantly decreased, indicating a potential shift towards de-escalation and dialogue. This change in U.S. foreign policy is reshaping the dynamics in the Middle East, prompting Israel to reassess its approach to Syria.</p>

          <p>Aryna Sabalenka, the world number one, began her French Open campaign with a dominant victory over Kamilla Rakhimova, dropping only one game in the match. Sabalenka needed just one hour to secure the win, showcasing her strong serving and powerful hitting. As a three-time Grand Slam singles champion, Sabalenka is considered one of the tournament favorites, with a potential quarter-final match against Zheng Qinwen and a semi-final against Iga Swiatek on the horizon.</p>
