        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple has entered into a $500 million agreement with MP Materials to procure rare earth magnets produced in the United States, significantly boosting its domestic supply chain. The deal involves magnets from a new facility in Texas and the development of a recycling line in California, with shipments expected to begin in 2027. This partnership aims to reduce US reliance on China for these critical components, which are essential for electronics, and follows a recent Department of Defense investment in MP Materials. The announcement caused MP Materials' stock to surge by 17%.</p>

          <p>Senators Tammy Baldwin and Joni Ernst are leading a bipartisan effort to reauthorize and increase funding for the Farm and Ranch Assistance Network, a mental health and suicide prevention program for agricultural workers. Their proposed Farmers First Act of 2025 would allocate an additional $75 million over five years to support the program's network of regional hubs. This initiative addresses the high suicide rate among farmers, which is reportedly three and a half times the national average. The funding aims to enhance access to stress assistance programs, crisis lines, and behavioral health specialists.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 10:00:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba is reportedly preparing to launch a new promotional event called 'Super Saturdays' for its on-demand delivery services, including Ele.me and Freshippo, as competition intensifies in China. This move is a direct response to aggressive subsidy campaigns from rivals like Meituan and JD.com, who are offering deep discounts and free items to capture market share. While a price war could impact revenues, the broader instant commerce market in China is projected to grow substantially, reaching over 2 trillion yuan by 2030. The new initiative signals Alibaba's commitment to remaining a dominant player in this rapidly expanding sector.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 09:52:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current interest rate environment, money market accounts are offering slightly higher returns than long-term certificates of deposit (CDs), a reversal of historical trends. For a $5,000 deposit, a money market account at a 4.32% rate would nominally outperform a 5-year CD at a 4.20% rate. However, the key difference lies in rate stability; a CD locks in its rate for the entire term, protecting against future rate drops. In contrast, money market account rates are variable and could decrease if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates, making the choice dependent on an individual's risk tolerance.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Retirees on Social Security facing debt can take several strategic steps to regain financial control, even on a fixed income. Federal law generally protects Social Security benefits from being garnished for consumer debts like credit cards, though not for federal taxes or student loans. Experts advise creating a strict budget, prioritizing essential payments, and contacting creditors to inquire about hardship programs that might lower interest rates or payments. For more significant debt, reputable credit counseling agencies can offer debt management plans, while debt settlement may be a viable, albeit risky, option for some. (not investment advice)</p>

The bank's revenue of $21.67 billion also beat forecasts, driven by a 16% year-over-year increase in markets revenue and an 18% jump in banking revenue. The strong performance, particularly in equity and fixed income trading, was aided by market volatility during the quarter. Despite the positive results, the bank noted a 16% growth in the cost of credit, citing a deteriorating economic outlook compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

These include a new hotel, office building, and a joint city-county government center.

The decision also affects the historic downtown clock tower, which may be dismantled and preserved as part of the new government complex, though some council members hope it can be relocated entirely.</p>
