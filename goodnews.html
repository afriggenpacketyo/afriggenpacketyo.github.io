          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang addressed the World Economic Forum's "Summer Davos" in Dalian, China, advocating for international trade collaboration despite rising tariffs and geopolitical barriers. He emphasized that globalization is irreversible and urged against politicizing trade or turning it into a security issue. Li highlighted the importance of engaging in the international economy to reshape global rules and order. The premier did not directly address U.S. tensions or the Israel-Iran conflict during his speech, which was attended by several top political and business leaders. The event underscores China's ongoing efforts to maintain its economic influence amid global uncertainties.</p>

          <p>Following a fragile ceasefire between Israel and Iran, US envoy Steve Witkoff announced that Washington and Tehran are in preliminary discussions to resume nuclear talks, which had been disrupted by the recent Israeli strikes and subsequent war. Despite reports of violations in the initial hours, the ceasefire appears to be holding after strong reprimands from US President Donald Trump. An early intelligence assessment suggests that Iran's nuclear program was only delayed by a few months due to the American strikes, contradicting Trump's claims of complete obliteration. The article provides ongoing updates on the ceasefire and broader Middle East developments.</p>

          <p>China is implementing new strategies to encourage foreign institutions to use the yuan, aiming to challenge the U.S. dollar as international confidence in the greenback weakens. These efforts include establishing a digital yuan internationalization center in Shanghai and promoting yuan foreign exchange futures trading. The timing is opportune, as the U.S. dollar index has fallen by over 9% this year, while the offshore yuan has strengthened against the dollar. However, despite these advancements, China faces challenges in becoming a dependable alternative due to strict capital controls and geopolitical risks, according to analysts.

          <p>In a surprising upset, Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing Democrat and state assemblyman, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary. Cuomo conceded the race, acknowledging Mamdani's victory, who, if elected in November, would become the first Muslim and Indian American mayor of New York City. The primary was closely watched as a gauge of the Democratic Party's direction following recent election losses. While Mamdani held a commanding lead, he fell short of the 50% threshold, but Cuomo's concession was unexpected given the ranked-choice system that allows for continued counting.</p>

          <p>Antoinette Lattouf, an Australian journalist, won her case against the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), with a court ruling that she was unfairly sacked over a social media post about the war in Gaza. The court found that the ABC dismissed Lattouf partly due to her opinions on the Israeli military campaign in Gaza, rejecting claims that her dismissal was related to her race. Lattouf shared a Human Rights Watch post critical of Israel, which the ABC claimed violated its editorial policy. The ABC apologized to Lattouf, admitting it failed its staff and audiences in handling the situation.</p>

          <p>New York Democrats are heading to the polls to select a nominee for mayor, in a race that is viewed as a proxy war between the moderate and left-wing factions within the party.

Mamdani's platform focuses on affordability issues, such as free public buses and universal childcare, while Cuomo emphasizes his experience and competence in leading the city. The outcome of the primary could have implications for the Democratic Party nationally.</p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have used the slowing spin of dying stars to study the Milky Way's past and discover that stars born today spin much faster than those formed billions of years ago. Using data from Europe‚Äôs Gaia space telescope, researchers found that newly formed stars spin up to 10 times faster than their older counterparts. This extra spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, making it harder for massive stars to take shape. The study provides direct evidence that the galaxy‚Äôs star-forming clouds have grown more turbulent over time.</p>
