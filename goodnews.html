        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial markets experienced a volatile day, with stocks, bonds, and the dollar initially sliding before recovering. Market jitters were triggered by concerns over government debt, including Moody's recent downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, and a bill in Congress that would make President Trump's tax cuts permanent, potentially adding trillions to the federal debt. Raphael Bostic, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, acknowledged the Moody‚Äôs downgrade would impact the cost of capital and contribute to market turbulence. Investors are also closely watching negotiations to rein in government spending, as well as signs of potential progress. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ordered Apple to resolve its ongoing dispute with Epic Games over the restoration of Fortnite to the iOS App Store. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers stated that Apple is capable of resolving the issue without further court intervention. If the conflict is not resolved, the Apple official responsible for compliance must personally appear at a hearing scheduled for May 27th. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney claimed Apple is ignoring their Fortnite submission until the Ninth Circuit Court rules on a stay request. The judge noted that the Ninth Circuit has not yet granted Apple a stay of the injunction after 12 days.</p>

          <p>As gold prices have recently declined after reaching record highs, investors are advised to re-evaluate their holdings but avoid panic-selling. Experts recommend considering buying more gold at the lower price point, remembering its long-term benefits as a hedge against inflation and a portfolio diversifier. Investors should explore alternative gold investment types and avoid rushing to sell, as price declines often precede surges. Consulting with a gold investment advisor is also recommended to tailor strategies to individual investor profiles and goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Homeowners with 100% home equity have the potential to borrow money through home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs).

HELOCs and home equity loans offer lower interest rates compared to personal loans and credit cards.
