        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the May 7 deadline approaches for REAL ID requirements, experts are divided on the benefits and potential drawbacks. Supporters like Simon Hankinson from the Heritage Foundation argue that REAL ID will bolster national security by requiring additional documentation and preventing illegal immigrants from easily moving throughout the country. Conversely, critics such as Jim Harper from the American Enterprise Institute contend that REAL ID effectively creates a national identification system that could infringe on individual liberties and treat law-abiding citizens with suspicion. Harper argues that entering citizens into a national database poses risks of government overreach and monitoring.</p>

          <p>A valuation metric known as the 'Buffett Indicator,' favored by Warren Buffett, suggests that U.S. equities may be trading at relatively attractive levels. The ratio, which compares the total value of publicly traded U.S. companies to the country's GDP, currently sits around 180%. This level is similar to that seen after last year's rapid unwinding of the Japanese yen carry trade, which preceded a strong S&P 500 rally. Some analysts believe this signals an opportunity to deploy capital and buy stocks, but others caution about factors like elevated interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

An open-heart procedure was performed to remove the cyst and rebuild his RVOT, allowing Donaldson to resume his normal activities.
