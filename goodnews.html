          <h2>UK Considers Expanding Ban on Bottom Trawling to Protect Marine Ecosystems</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 05:22:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing to extend the ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets across the seafloor, across English waters. The proposal would expand the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2 of the UK's offshore protected areas. This announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France, where concerns about the destructive impact of bottom trawling on marine life have been raised. President Macron has called for a moratorium on deep sea mining, highlighting the importance of protecting the ocean as a shared resource. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Health experts discuss the importance of magnesium, a mineral involved in over 300 enzyme systems, and the potential risks of deficiency. Magnesium supports energy production, muscle and nerve function, and blood pressure regulation, and may help lower the risk of certain diseases. Symptoms of deficiency include insomnia, muscle cramps, fatigue, and heart arrhythmias, and can be caused by certain medical conditions, medications, or poor diet. While dietary sources like nuts, seeds, and leafy greens are best, supplements may be recommended in certain cases of deficiency or health conditions. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) are gaining popularity among non-diabetics, with companies claiming they can revolutionize health by tracking blood sugar levels. These devices, which involve wearing a small patch that sends glucose readings to a phone app, have proven beneficial for people with diabetes. However, studies on their effectiveness for non-diabetics are mixed, with some showing limited weight loss benefits compared to standard diets. While CGMs may help individuals identify carbohydrate sensitivities, motivate healthier eating, and increase dietary awareness, experts caution that the data can be confusing, misleading, and may not always provide a complete picture of metabolic health. </p>

          <p>Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, discusses his political views and the "manosphere" in an interview. He says his vote for Trump was more of an indictment of the Democrats, citing a lack of "blunt talk" and an excess of "woke politics." While he differs with Trump on some issues, such as abortion rights and immigration, he feels looked down upon for his success as a white person who wants to make money. Portnoy acknowledges that his language has evolved, stating he would never again use the N-word, which he used in social media posts years ago. </p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) is calling for 200,000 new blood donors to address a "challenging" blood shortage, with supplies low enough to impact patient treatment. There is a critical need for more donors with O negative blood, which can be given to most patients. The NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) aims to increase the number of regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to maintain a safe and reliable supply. The appeal emphasizes the need for more black donors, who are more likely to have specific blood types that can help treat people with sickle cell disease.</p>

The move follows trade talks between Chinese and EU trade officials, with China expressing hope for reciprocal steps from the EU.
