          <p>Thousands of protesters gathered in Budapest to demonstrate against Prime Minister Viktor Orb치n's government, citing concerns over anti-democratic practices and alleged corruption. Speakers criticized a recent law effectively banning public LGBTQ+ events and a draft bill that could blacklist critical media and NGOs, viewing these measures as authoritarian tactics to silence opposition. The demonstration, attended by writers, actors, musicians, and journalists, reflects growing resistance to Orb치n's leadership as national elections approach in 2026. Protesters believe support for Orb치n is waning, expressing hope for a change in government after 16 years.</p>

          <p>Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, the former president of Mongolia, urged Japanese lawmakers to abolish the death penalty, despite public support for executions in Japan. Elbegdorj, who abolished capital punishment in Mongolia in 2017, suggested that the Japanese government should provide more information about the death penalty to foster open debate. He emphasized that the death penalty contradicts the spirit of democracy and poses the risk of executing wrongly convicted individuals. He noted a decrease in violent crimes in Mongolia after the death penalty was abolished.</p>
