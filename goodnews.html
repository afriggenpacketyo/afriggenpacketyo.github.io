          <p>Kendrick Lamar and SZA's co-headlining Grand National Tour at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., featured a blend of their complementary yet distinct styles of sentimentalism. Lamar's set list addressed his recent beef with Drake, highlighting his shift toward anthemic songs, while SZA explored themes of spiritual rebirth after emotional abrasion. The performance balanced Lamar's principled stoicism with SZA's exuberant moodiness, creating a dynamic experience where competing visions of vengeance could coexist. The article characterizes the show as a victory lap for both artists, with Lamar touring stadiums for the first time and SZA celebrating her successful 2022 album.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Camogie Association of Ireland is facing mounting pressure to relax its rule mandating skorts for players, with critics labeling the enforcement as "sexism." Former Antrim camogie All-Star Jane Adams argues that players should have the choice between skorts and shorts for comfort and performance reasons. A recent Gaelic Players Association survey indicated that 70% of players experience discomfort wearing skorts, and 83% desire the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for 22 May to vote on the issue, as some players threaten to boycott matches if forced to wear skorts.</p>

          <p>The stock market remained cautious as investors awaited the outcome of key weekend trade talks between the U.S. and China.

Despite a rebound from an April drop following President Trump's tariff announcements, concerns persist about a potential slowdown in U.S. economic growth. Market analysts express skepticism about the impact of a U.K.-U.S. trade deal on easing global trade tensions, particularly with challenging negotiations ahead with major trading partners.</p>

Google's vice president of government affairs stated that the company uses Gulf of America to follow "longstanding maps policies impartially and consistently across all regions."

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals can collect both Social Security benefits and annuity payments without penalties, providing a stronger financial foundation for retirement. Social Security benefits do not have income limitations that would prevent receiving income from an annuity. However, claiming Social Security before full retirement age results in a smaller monthly check, and total income, including annuity payments, may make Social Security benefits taxable. Strategies to maximize income include delaying Social Security, laddering annuities for flexibility, and consulting a retirement income specialist.</p>

          <p>Homeowners with a home equity line of credit (HELOC) should take advantage of the interest-only payment period by paying more than just interest, especially with lower interest rates. It is also important to monitor the interest rate climate for opportunities to make larger payments or just make the minimum payment. HELOCs can also be used for select home repairs and renovations, as the interest charges may be tax-deductible. Homeowners should speak to a lending expert to build a personalized repayment strategy.</p>
