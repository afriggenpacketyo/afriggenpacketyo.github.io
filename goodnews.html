          <p>Despite reporting another quarter of shrinking same-store sales and missing earnings expectations, Starbucks is showing early signs of a turnaround. Executives highlighted that customer traffic improved sequentially each month during the quarter, with notable growth from customers outside its loyalty program. Analysts are pointing to these "green shoots," such as an accelerated rollout of new service programs and menu innovations, as reasons for cautious optimism. However, the stock's modest rise suggests some investors remain unconvinced about the pace of the recovery.</p>

          <p>Following a stock drop after Palo Alto Networks announced its $25 billion acquisition of CyberArk, Jim Cramer's Investing Club upgraded its rating on the company. The club views the market's negative reaction as a mistake, arguing the deal strategically strengthens Palo Alto's cybersecurity platform by adding a crucial identity security component. They express confidence in CEO Nikesh Arora's vision, comparing the current situation to a previous successful buying opportunity when the market initially doubted the company's strategy.

          <p>Following a powerful earthquake near Russia, widespread tsunami warnings for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast have been downgraded to advisories. While Hawaii recorded waves nearly six feet high, the threat of catastrophic flooding has diminished, allowing many evacuees to return home. Authorities still urge caution, advising people to stay away from the water due to the continued risk of strong and unpredictable currents. The downgrades brought relief to coastal communities that had prepared for a potentially devastating event.</p>

          <p>With concerns over retirement savings, many seniors are considering annuities to supplement their Social Security income. Annuities can offer a guaranteed income stream, diversifying retirement funds and protecting against outliving savings, which is beneficial for the risk-averse or those without pensions. However, they are complex products that reduce liquidity and come with fees, making them unsuitable for those with immediate cash needs or shorter life expectancies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a significant rebound in the second quarter of 2025, with GDP growing at a 3% annual rate after shrinking in the first quarter.
