          <p>Carnival shares experienced a rise of approximately 7% after the cruise line announced better-than-expected second-quarter results and increased its full-year guidance. The company reported adjusted earnings of 35 cents per share, surpassing analysts' estimates, and a record revenue of $6.3 billion. Net income significantly increased to $565 million, and CEO Josh Weinstein noted strong momentum across all of Carnival's brands. As a result of this outperformance, Carnival has raised its adjusted net income forecast for the year by 40%, with the opening of Celebration Key in the Bahamas expected soon.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 1-year certificate of deposit (CD) currently offers a higher guaranteed interest rate than a high-yield savings account, making it a potentially more lucrative option for a $10,000 deposit. With a CD, the interest rate is fixed, ensuring a specific return over the term, while high-yield savings account rates are variable and subject to change. Considering potential interest rate cuts, locking in a higher rate with a CD may be beneficial. Money market accounts offer similar high rates but also have variable interest rates, making them a risk for long-term savers (not investment advice).</p>

Vessel tracking services indicate a rise in ship arrivals, with the highest numbers since January 2025. While officials are not describing it as a "surge," the increase is expected to boost trucking, railroads, and warehouse companies, with the ports operating at 60-70% capacity.

          <p>A new study in The Lancet reveals that global efforts to boost childhood vaccination rates have stalled or reversed in many places since 2010, despite significant progress over the past 50 years. While vaccination rates have improved dramatically, there have been declines in measles vaccination rates in many countries. The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted vaccination efforts, but there has been a concerted effort to catch up, and India stands out as a success story for reducing the number of zero-dose children. Researchers say the world's vaccination efforts are at a critical time, and global health organizations must decide whether to turn their backs on one of the most remarkable public health achievements that the world has ever seen.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This June, a $50,000 home equity loan is cheaper than a $50,000 personal loan due to lower interest rates. Home equity loans offer fixed rates and utilize the home as collateral, while personal loans often have higher and potentially variable rates. Borrowers can save money both monthly and annually with a home equity loan, but they risk their home if they default. HELOCs are another option but come with variable rates, making long-term budgeting difficult, so using a home equity loan for advantageous purposes is the better decision (not investment advice).</p>
