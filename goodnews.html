          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller indicated the central bank might consider lowering interest rates as early as July, citing a lack of significant inflation boost from tariffs. In a CNBC interview, Waller emphasized a gradual easing approach, suggesting that current inflation levels do not pose a substantial economic threat. He advocated for proactive rate cuts to mitigate potential labor market slowdowns, cautioning against waiting for a market crash before acting. Waller's perspective contrasts with other officials who are hesitant to cut rates due to uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Japan's 150-day regular parliamentary session is set to conclude on June 22, preceding a crucial national election for the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces pressure from opposition parties advocating for the repeal of a controversial gasoline tax. The ruling coalition aims to maintain control of the upper house despite low public support and concerns over rising prices outpacing wage growth. The opposition's move to scrap the gasoline tax is seen by some as a symbolic gesture ahead of the House of Councillors election expected on July 20.</p>

          <p>Greenland, rich in mineral resources, is not aiming to become a major mining country, despite its potential.

This decision reflects a focus on sustainable development and managing the environmental and social impacts of mining activities.
