          <p>Hong Kong is actively working to strengthen its connections with emerging markets, highlighted by Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu‚Äôs visits to Qatar and Kuwait, which resulted in 59 memorandums of understanding and agreements to bolster economic and cultural ties with the Middle East. Hong Kong's strategic position as a link between mainland China and the rest of the world is becoming increasingly important as globalization faces fragmentation and arbitrary trade practices. The city's ability to navigate volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) is seen as an asset, especially with rapid technological advancements and the need for a new global consensus. Hong Kong's role is amplified in this evolving landscape.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has agreed to postpone the threatened 50% tariffs on the European Union until July 9, following a "very nice call" with EU chief Ursula von der Leyen. The delay aims to provide additional time for negotiations between Brussels and Washington to avert a transatlantic trade war. Von der Leyen stated that Europe is prepared to advance talks swiftly to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The initial tariff threat had caused significant disruption in stock markets, prompting concerns about renewed global economic instability, but the delay offers a window for constructive dialogue.</p>

          <p>The Argentine comic "El Eternauta," a dystopian drama about a group of friends fighting to survive a deadly snowfall, has gained international recognition with its Netflix adaptation. The series, which premiered on April 30, has been renewed for a second season and has resonated deeply in Argentina, where the original graphic novel was written by H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld in 1957. Oesterheld and his four daughters were "disappeared" during the Argentine military dictatorship, adding historical weight to the story. The comic's themes of resilience and humanity have found renewed relevance amid growing anxiety about the state of Argentine society under President Javier Milei.</p>
