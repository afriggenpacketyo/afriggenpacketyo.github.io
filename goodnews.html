          <p>New Orleans is preparing for the arrival of National Guard troops by late November, as confirmed by Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick. The deployment, requested by Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry, aims to bolster security for major events like the Bayou Classic, New Year's Eve, and Mardi Gras. Kirkpatrick emphasized that the troops will operate in partnership with local law enforcement as a 'force multiplier,' not to take over, despite the city's police department facing understaffing issues. While acknowledging the need for support during large events, the superintendent expressed that she does not believe Guard troops should be deployed for general law enforcement functions outside of these specific circumstances.</p>

          <p>Samsung and Google have launched their new Galaxy XR mixed reality headset, powered by the Android XR operating system co-developed with Qualcomm. Priced at $1,799, the device aims to compete with Apple's Vision Pro and Meta's Quest 3, offering passthrough vision, eye-tracking, and hand gesture navigation. A key differentiator is the integration of Google's Gemini AI assistant, enabling users to ask questions about their real-world surroundings or on-screen content. Samsung views the Galaxy XR as a foundational step toward future 'AI glasses,' which will eventually include wired, then wireless, smart glasses with built-in displays, demonstrating a long-term vision for augmented reality technology.</p>

          <p>Samsung has introduced its Galaxy XR mixed reality headset, a collaboration with Google and Qualcomm, aiming to disrupt the burgeoning XR market. The $1,800 device, visually similar to Apple's Vision Pro, integrates Google's Gemini AI assistant as a central feature, allowing for intuitive control and content interaction. While the market for such headsets remains niche and expensive, Samsung and Google position the Galaxy XR as a stepping stone toward future AI glasses. However, privacy concerns exist as Gemini processes user data in the cloud, contrasting with Apple's private cloud approach, and the long-term viability of AI glasses replacing smartphones remains uncertain given current market adoption rates.</p>

          <h2>Japan's Overall Exports Rebound in September, Despite Continued Decline in U.S. Shipments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 21:42:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese exports in September ended a four-month streak of declines, increasing by 4.2% year-on-year, primarily due to robust growth in shipments to Asia, especially mainland China. However, exports to the U.S., Japan's second-largest trading partner, dropped significantly by 13.3%, largely impacted by a 24.2% fall in auto shipments. This rebound in overall exports, driven partly by semiconductor exports, still missed analyst expectations. Despite a trade deal with Washington that lowered tariffs, the U.S. market remains challenging, while Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's loose monetary policy stance is anticipated to weaken the yen, potentially making Japanese goods more competitive globally.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) announced the impending closure of Terminal 5 for a complete demolition and overhaul project, effective October 28. This renovation is part of a massive $30-billion airport-wide upgrade in preparation for the 2028 Olympics and Paralympics. Airlines previously housed in Terminal 5, including JetBlue, Spirit, and American Airlines, are being relocated to other terminals. The airport's new Midfield Satellite Concourse South, which adds significant gate and square footage, has opened this week to help manage operations during the extensive construction. The ambitious project aims to deliver a brand new terminal and enhance the overall airport experience for travelers.</p>

          <h2>Government Proposes 'Quicker and Easier' Fines for Water Companies Over Sewage Spills</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:50:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced new proposals to make fining English water companies for raw sewage spills 'quicker and easier.' Environment Secretary Emma Reynolds stated the plans would introduce automatic fines of up to £20,000 for minor offenses and simplify the process for punishing more serious breaches. The initiative aims to give the Environment Agency more power to tackle frequent rule-breaking, which has been highlighted by recent BBC investigations into dry weather spills and treatment failures. The government anticipates raising £50m-£67m annually, with costs borne by shareholders, not customers, in an effort to incentivize water companies to improve their environmental practices.</p>

          <h2>Haircare Experts Debunk Common Myths About Hair Repair and Washing Habits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 20:34:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Haircare experts have debunked several common myths about hair health, emphasizing that healthy hair relies on fundamental care rather than expensive products or complicated routines. Trichologists Eva Proudman and Tracey Walker clarify that cold water rinses do not make hair shinier, and no product can truly repair damaged hair or split ends, which require a haircut. They also refute the idea of 'self-cleaning' hair, stressing that regular washing is crucial to prevent oil and debris buildup, which can worsen scalp conditions. The article advises against excessive dry shampoo use, recommending it only once between washes to maintain scalp health and avoid issues like itchiness and flakiness.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking study has for the first time ranked the physical side effects of various antidepressants, revealing substantial differences between medications. Researchers from King's College London and the University of Oxford analyzed 151 studies covering 30 drugs, focusing on the first eight weeks of treatment. The findings show significant variations in weight changes, heart rate, and blood pressure, with some drugs causing up to a 2kg weight gain or a 21-beat-per-minute heart rate difference. The article emphasizes that these differences are clinically important and call for a more personalized approach to prescribing, matching antidepressants to individual patient needs and health conditions to improve adherence and outcomes.</p>

          <p>During an interview, Steve Bannon expressed surprise and a touch of skepticism after MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell announced he is considering a run for governor of Minnesota. Lindell, known for his conservative activism, revealed his political ambition while discussing legal challenges he faces, which he attributed to his Christian-based addiction recovery network and perceived political targeting. Bannon jokingly suggested Lindell 'just go back and sell some pillows' for now, indicating that the news of a gubernatorial bid was unexpected and a significant development during their conversation. The exchange highlights Lindell's continued presence in the political sphere beyond his business ventures.</p>

          <p>Fiona Eastwood, CEO of global theme park giant Merlin Entertainments, states that the company's primary competitor is people choosing to stay home on their digital devices.

Despite a recent dip in consumer confidence and a slight revenue decline, Merlin Entertainments attracted nearly 63 million visitors in 2024, demonstrating that escapism remains a valued expenditure. The company is investing £85 million in immersive experiences, including Minecraft-themed rides, and relies heavily on seasonal events and big brand partnerships to draw families away from screens and into their parks.</p>
