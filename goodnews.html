          <p>WorldPride 2025 is concluding its first celebration in Washington, D.C., with a weekend parade that began Saturday in a historic gay neighborhood and ends at the U.S. Capitol. This year marks the 50th anniversary of Pride events in D.C., traditionally one of the largest Pride celebrations in the country. Despite the usual magnitude, organizers noted that the current political environment, including executive orders limiting trans rights, has dampened excitement. Some corporate sponsors declined to support the event due to executive orders targeting "illegal DEI" initiatives. The National Park Service's decision to close Dupont Circle Park, a queer landmark, sparked backlash, adding to the tension surrounding the celebration. Optimism score is 60.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Foot care experts recommend six exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, focusing on strengthening foot muscles and improving overall foot health. These exercises include foot doming, which strengthens the foot core; wall stretches, effective for pain relief and increasing blood flow; and toe spreads, which improve flexibility and stability. Toe yoga enhances balance, calf raises strengthen stabilizing muscles, and interlacing fingers with toes provides a gentle massage. Regularly practicing these exercises can reduce the risk of injury, prevent pain, and improve foot function. These simple exercises can be incorporated into daily routines for optimal foot health. Optimism score is 90.</p>
