          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be part of a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer emphasized that this scheme would be reciprocal and would not equate to a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the proposal as "free movement through the back door," while Reform UK echoed similar concerns. An agreement in principle is expected to be announced at a summit held at London's Lancaster House.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump publicly rebuked Walmart after the retailer cautioned that tariffs would lead to higher prices for consumers. Trump suggested that Walmart and China should "eat the tariffs" rather than pass the costs on to customers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had previously stated that the company would absorb some of the tariff-related costs and work with suppliers to minimize price increases. Several other companies, including Microsoft, Mattel, and Ford, have also announced or warned of price increases due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece highlights the operational success of the Chinese-made J-10C fighter jet in a recent aerial clash between India and Pakistan. According to U.S. officials, the J-10C, equipped with Chinese PL-15 missiles, successfully shot down at least two Indian jets, marking the first combat validation for Chinese aircraft using domestic systems. This achievement signifies China's shift from merely imitating foreign technology to innovating and competing on a global scale. The article emphasizes China's embrace of ecosystem-centric warfare, prioritizing information dominance and coordinated asset deployment.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have unearthed the fossilized remains of a 500-million-year-old creature named Mosura fentoni, a three-eyed predator with a unique mouth structure. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing that the creature was more complex than previously understood. Mosura, nicknamed the "sea moth," possessed flaps for swimming, claws for predation, and a segmented body with gills, similar to modern arthropods. The finding contributes to a better understanding of the diversity of life on Earth before the Cambrian explosion.</p>

Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney suggested that the occasion may have gotten to Haaland, highlighting the difference between him and Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo. City manager Pep Guardiola said that the decision was ultimately down to the players' feeling in that moment.</p>
