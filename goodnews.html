          <p>Angels outfielder Mike Trout testified in a civil trial regarding the death of his teammate Tyler Skaggs, who died of an overdose in 2019. Trout stated that he loved Skaggs like a brother and never saw signs of drug use, and that Kay was good at his job getting players to give interviews. Trout also mentioned that he had seen Kay acting "wired" and sweating and "the first thing that came to mind was drugs." The trial is to determine if the Angels are responsible for Eric Kay, who provided Skaggs with the fentanyl-laced pill that caused his death, with the family seeking $118 million in damages. The testimony highlighted the close bond between teammates and the tragic circumstances surrounding Skaggs' death. The loss led MLB to begin testing for opioids. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix shares fell after the company reported lower-than-expected third-quarter earnings, citing an ongoing dispute with Brazilian tax authorities. Revenue rose 17%, driven by membership gains, pricing adjustments, and increased ad revenue, with the company expecting similar growth in the fourth quarter. While Netflix had its best ad sales quarter ever, the company did not provide specific figures, leading analysts to believe subscription fees will continue to be the primary source of revenue. Netflix is also expanding the reach of "KPop Demon Hunters" with partnerships for consumer products. The company is looking into incremental opportunities related to live experiences, publishing, beauty and lifestyle as well as food and beverages related to the film. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mattel reported third-quarter results that missed analyst expectations, primarily due to declining sales in North America. The company's net sales fell 6% to $1.74 billion, with North American sales dropping 12%. Global Barbie and Fisher-Price sales also experienced declines, while Hot Wheels sales increased. The company issued full-year guidance projecting a net sales increase between 1% and 3% and earnings per share between $1.54 and $1.66. Mattel is focusing on expanding its entertainment offerings, partnering with Netflix on products tied to the movie "KPop Demon Hunters". (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total compensation for fiscal year 2025 rose 22% to $96.5 million, driven by the company's strong stock performance and growth in artificial intelligence. The pay plan is largely tied to Microsoft's share performance, which has risen by 23% in 2025. Despite the financial success, Microsoft has faced workforce turmoil, including layoffs and the termination of activist employees. Nadella had previously requested a reduction in his cash incentive due to a series of cyberattacks. Microsoft Azure's business is driving expansion as companies' cloud infrastructure needs grow to meet AI demand.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance and Jared Kushner expressed optimism about the U.S.-brokered ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, despite recent violence. Vance stated that the peace plan is going better than expected and urged patience as Israel awaits the return of all hostages' remains. Kushner noted that both sides are transitioning from warfare to a peacetime posture. The peace process has seen incremental steps forward, including the return of Palestinian bodies and the release of Israeli hostages. Some Israelis, like Alon Pinkas, remain skeptical of Netanyahu's commitment to a lasting peace. Trump warned Hamas against breaching the deal.</p>

          <p>Norway and Germany are trying to persuade Canada to join their submarine project, aiming to secure an order for up to 12 units. The partnership would strengthen North Atlantic naval cooperation and address growing concerns about Russia's presence in the Baltic Sea and North Atlantic. Germany is increasing its naval presence and deploying reconnaissance aircraft from Iceland to track Russian submarines. The talks also involve expanding strategic and economic partnerships, with Canada potentially exporting more liquefied petroleum gas to Europe. Canada is also considering a similar offer from South Korea. </p>

          <p>A 15-hour disruption to Amazon Web Services (AWS) exposed the fragility of a system heavily reliant on a few tech giants. The outage disrupted various online services and underscored the "concentration risk" of building on a handful of cloud providers. Experts say it could compel companies to diversify their cloud services to avoid relying on a single provider. The issue was partially tied to AWS' domain name system, which converts domain names to IP addresses. While the incident was significant, experts do not expect a mass exodus of AWS customers. The event serves as a reminder of the vulnerabilities in the internet's infrastructure.</p>

The stock experienced a short squeeze, with investors who bet against the stock forced to cover their positions. The surge marks a turnaround for a stock that had tumbled significantly in recent years. The return of Beyond Meat could be a sign of a frothy market, as investors pile into more speculative names. Roundhill had previously shut down its meme ETF due to lack of interest but revived it earlier this month. (not investment advice)</p>
