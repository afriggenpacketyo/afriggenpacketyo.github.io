          <p>Karla Flores, 19, was diagnosed with a chordoma wrapped around her brain stem, and during an MRI before surgery, doctors discovered a second chordoma on her spine. Neurosurgeon Dr. Mohammed Labib developed a unique surgical plan to remove the spinal tumor through her eye, a first-of-its-kind procedure. The surgery, called the "third nostril" approach, involved removing part of Flores' eye socket and cheekbone to access the tumor. After a 20-hour operation, the chordoma was successfully removed, and Flores is now cancer-free.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the 'Mission: Impossible' franchise argues that its early films, particularly the first four, were defined by their lack of continuity and strong authorial styles, which allowed for creative freedom and unpredictability. Directors like Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams, and Brad Bird were given the space to put their own stamp on the series. In contrast, later installments have become more focused on franchise building and interconnected storylines, sacrificing the unique appeal of the earlier films. The article suggests that the franchise's initial inconsistency proves the value of ignoring brand-building pressures.</p>
