          <p>Haley Joel Osment must commit to six months of court-mandated Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and therapy after his arrest for alleged public drunkenness and cocaine possession. A judge granted the former child actor's request for a one-year diversion, which will clear his charges if he completes the terms. Osment, known for roles in "The Sixth Sense" and "Blink Twice," was arrested at the Mammoth Mountain ski resort in April. Osment expressed remorse for his behavior, including making an antisemitic slur, and promised to atone for his mistake.</p>
