          <p>During a state visit to the United Kingdom, President Donald Trump advised Prime Minister Keir Starmer to "call out the military" to control the country's borders, drawing parallels to U.S. immigration policies. At a press conference, Trump also addressed other topics, including his disappointment with Vladimir Putin regarding the Ukraine war and the strategic importance of the Bagram airbase in Afghanistan. Despite some policy disagreements, such as the UK's plan to recognize a Palestinian state, the visit was managed to avoid major diplomatic conflicts.</p>

          <p>A pill form of the popular weight-loss drug Wegovy may soon be available, as new trial results show it is nearly as effective as the injectable version. Manufacturer Novo Nordisk announced that participants taking a daily oral dose lost an average of 16.6% of their body weight over 64 weeks, a result comparable to the injectable form. The development could make the treatment more accessible, and the company has already sought FDA approval, expecting a decision by the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>An analysis of President Trump's state visit to the UK suggests that while the trip successfully demonstrated a warm personal relationship with Prime Minister Keir Starmer, it will likely have little impact on U.S. policy. The article notes Trump was particularly impressed by the royal pageantry at Windsor Castle but remained firm on key issues like trade tariffs and international affairs. Ultimately, the visit may have secured the UK's ability to disagree with the U.S. without severe diplomatic penalty, but it did not change the president's established positions.</p>
