The lifting of these curbs, which previously impacted major electronic design automation (EDA) firms, led to a significant rise in the shares of affected companies.

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital market is witnessing a remarkable resurgence, with initial public offering (IPO) volumes reaching their strongest first half-year since 2021, fueled by a rush of Chinese companies seeking listings. This surge is attributed to Beijing's supportive regulatory policies, a slower pace of A-share listings, abundant market liquidity, and concerns over potential delistings from U.S. exchanges. The trend of dual-listing (A-then-H shares) is particularly prominent, as Chinese firms utilize Hong Kong's more fungible currency for their global expansion strategies.

          <p>South America's Mercosur trade bloc has signed a comprehensive trade deal with the four-nation European Free Trade Association (EFTA) after a decade of negotiations. The agreement aims to establish a free trade area encompassing nearly 300 million people and a combined GDP exceeding $4.3 trillion, designed to significantly boost bilateral trade by removing customs duties. While the deal represents a major step forward in economic cooperation between the two regions, it still requires approval from the parliaments of the member countries.
