          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 11:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After the removal of four hydroelectric dams, the Klamath River is experiencing a rebirth, revealing 45 miles of previously submerged river between the Keno and Iron Gate dams. This restoration marks the end of a decades-long campaign led by Indigenous tribes, environmental groups, and fishing advocates, aiming to revitalize the river's ecology and cultural significance. As the river reclaims its natural course, new recreational opportunities like rafting and hiking are emerging, with five public recreation sites planned for completion by August 1. The Shasta Indian Nation, which lost ancestral lands to the dams, will regain over 2,800 acres, fostering a renewed connection to their heritage and stewardship of the land. The recovery of the Klamath serves as a hopeful example of how diverse interests can align to enact positive change, even amidst climate challenges. The article details the efforts to restore the river's ecosystem and the cultural revitalization for the Indigenous people. This is a story of ecological recovery and cultural reconnection.</p>

          <p>After interviewing parents of highly successful children, the author identifies five key strategies they employed, including fostering optimism and tailoring motivational approaches to each child's interests. Encouraging a love of learning and recognizing that learning can happen anywhere are also crucial, and the parents emphasized love and support over being coaches or critics. A study showed that parents often underestimate how capable their children are, and how much they will learn from trying hard even in everyday tasks. These lessons highlight the importance of creating a supportive environment that nurtures a child's natural curiosity and drive.</p>
