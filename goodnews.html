          <p>In a groundbreaking legal move, the sister of Christopher Pelkey, a victim of a 2021 road rage incident, used artificial intelligence to create a likeness of her brother to deliver a victim impact statement during the sentencing of Gabriel Horcasitas. The AI-generated avatar spoke of forgiveness and a desire for friendship in another life, which Judge Todd Lang praised as genuine and impactful. While the use of AI in legal proceedings raises ethical questions about manipulation and deception, the video was prefaced with a disclaimer identifying it as an AI recreation. The defense lawyer suggested that the court‚Äôs reliance on the AI video could be grounds for appeal. Optimism score is 70.</p>

No injuries were reported, and the extent of the damage is still being assessed. The tower was being transported to a warehouse for testing to determine the cause of the fire.
