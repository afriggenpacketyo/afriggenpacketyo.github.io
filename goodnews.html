        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Acclaimed actor Denzel Washington has voiced strong opposition to "cancel culture," questioning the modern emphasis on public support and online followers. In a recent interview, he stated that his focus is on his faith in God rather than the approval of man, asserting, "You can’t be canceled if you haven’t signed up." Washington argued that true leadership involves following a higher power, not public trends, and dismissed the idea that online followers are a meaningful form of currency. His comments underscore a belief in personal conviction and spiritual guidance over societal pressures and online validation.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in a remote area of California. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the force of the water pushed him off his lines, trapping him. After he was reported missing, a search operation involving a drone located him alive and responsive. A California Highway Patrol helicopter then hoisted him to safety, where he was treated for minor injuries and dehydration before being reunited with his family.</p>

          <p>A prominent academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences is calling for China to expedite its research and development of space-based solar power technology. The technology involves placing large solar power stations in orbit to collect solar energy, convert it to electricity, and transmit it to Earth. This method offers a continuous power source unaffected by weather or nighttime, making it more efficient than ground-based solar plants. The scientist argues for a top-down national strategy to close the technological gap with the United States and establish a stronger position in the renewable energy sector.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting philosophy known as the 'Lighthouse Parent' is gaining traction as a healthier alternative to the prevalent trend of intensive, hands-on parenting. This approach encourages parents to act as a steady, guiding presence, offering support and safety without controlling every aspect of a child's life. Proponents argue that while the instinct to solve a child's problems is strong, constantly intervening can be detrimental to their development and exhausting for parents. By serving as a reliable beacon, parents can foster more confident and resilient children who are better equipped to navigate their own challenges.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit he paid for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. A court order granted the forfeiture after the police argued the funds were derived from tax evasion and money laundering, which Tate did not contest. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously confiscated from Tate and his brother for failing to pay taxes on revenue from their online businesses. Authorities stated the money will be reinvested into crime prevention and victim support initiatives within the community.</p>

Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware of the need to furnish their sparse rooms with items like bedding, towels, and lamps. The initiative aims to level the playing field, ensuring these students feel prepared and equal to their peers from their first day. By hosting annual events where students can select their own items, the program provides both material support and a sense of ownership and dignity.</p>

          <h2>Therapist Advocates for Waking Up Early as Key Morning Ritual for Daily Success</h2>

          <p>Sadie Salazar, a therapist and COO of Sage Therapy, emphasizes that the most crucial part of her morning routine is simply waking up early when her alarm goes off. This practice provides her with dedicated personal time before the day's demands begin, which she uses for rejuvenating activities like reading or walking her dog. She advises against rigid, complex morning schedules, as failing to complete them can start the day with a sense of failure. Instead, by committing only to rising early, she creates a flexible window for self-care that helps ground her and prevent feelings of chaos and anxiety.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, William and Catherine, are preparing to move into a new residence, the eight-bedroom Forest Lodge, located in Windsor Great Park. This move will take them a short distance from their current home, Adelaide Cottage, and allow their three children to continue attending the nearby Lambrook School. The family relocated from Kensington Palace to Adelaide Cottage in 2022 to seek a more private life. The move to the larger property comes after minor alterations were approved and aligns with the family's desire for a setting that emphasizes nature and tranquility.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining significant ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter. This resurgence is largely attributed to the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone design. While Apple still holds the top position, its market share has declined, signaling renewed competition. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond with its own slimmer and potentially foldable iPhone models to counter Samsung's momentum. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy, building emotional endurance—the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed—can be achieved through three key practices. The first is using a visual aid to understand that learning and growth occur in the challenging space between knowing and not knowing. The second is engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as part of the process rather than as failures. Finally, she recommends undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body to tolerate discomfort more effectively.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey reveals that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest point since the question was first tracked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, with growing concerns about the health impacts of alcohol. This trend is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where rates of drinking have fallen sharply since the 1990s. This societal shift is viewed as positive for public health, as reduced alcohol consumption is linked to lower rates of various diseases, accidents, and violence.</p>

          <p>A fisherman using sonar technology in the Mississippi River may have helped solve the 57-year-old disappearance of Roy Benn. After the fisherman spotted a submerged car, divers located a 1960s-era Buick and found human remains inside. The vehicle's identification number matched the car Benn was driving when he went missing in 1967. Authorities believe the remains belong to Benn and have notified his surviving next of kin. The discovery is a major breakthrough in the decades-old cold case, potentially bringing long-awaited closure to his family.</p>
