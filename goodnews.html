Acknowledging North Korea as "sort of a nuclear power," Trump indicated a desire to continue the diplomatic relationship established during his first term, which included three historic summits. While White House officials clarified that no meeting is currently scheduled, they reiterated that the president remains open to talks without preconditions to maintain stability on the Korean Peninsula.</p>

          <p>The UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has uncovered and dismantled the country's first known illegal factory producing weight-loss drugs. The raid in Northampton resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight-loss medicines, including thousands of unlicensed pens and raw ingredients worth over £250,000. Officials warned that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging the public to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies to avoid risks posed by organized criminal networks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread panic about AI tools like OpenAI's Sora 2, the technology's integration into Hollywood has been slow and has not yet led to the massive job losses or cost savings that many predicted. Major studios like Disney have reportedly invested millions with little to show in terms of efficiency gains, facing legal, technical, and security hurdles. While AI is being used in niche areas like dubbing and animation, its inability to consistently produce Hollywood-caliber quality and concerns over copyright protection mean its role remains more of a curiosity than a transformative force for now.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock value from Fluor's significant holding in nuclear technology firm NuScale Power. Starboard argues that Fluor's 39% stake in NuScale, worth approximately $3.4 billion post-tax, is not fully reflected in its stock price and is depressing its valuation. The activist investor is pushing for a separation, such as a sale or tax-free spinoff of the NuScale shares, which they believe could lead to a significant rerating of Fluor's core business.

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital city of Tbilisi for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of uranium. The suspects allegedly planned to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material with the intent of transporting it to China via Russia. The security service stated that the operation was coordinated from China and that the individuals were detained while negotiating the final details of the illicit transaction, preventing a potentially dangerous proliferation of radioactive materials.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments like private equity and real estate, moving beyond traditional stocks and bonds. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a practical way for retail investors to gain exposure to these assets without the typical complexities, such as long lockup periods and lack of liquidity. While "boring investing" in broad market indexes has historically proven effective, ETFs offer a regulated and tradable vehicle for those seeking to diversify into alternatives, though advisors recommend limiting such holdings to a small portion of a portfolio.

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's governing Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. Powell, who was removed from the cabinet in September, ran on a platform of giving grassroots members a stronger voice and advocating for a "bolder" policy direction, drawing support from those dissatisfied with the current government's course. In her victory speech, she promised to be an ally to Prime Minister Keir Starmer but emphasized the need to change the party's approach and more strongly set the political agenda.</p>

A second truce, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, is currently holding, and the new negotiations aim to establish mechanisms to ensure stability, addressing Pakistan's concerns about terrorism and Afghanistan's focus on territorial integrity.</p>

          <p>In a move seen as hopeful by traditionalist Catholics, American Cardinal Raymond Burke celebrated the old Latin Mass in St. Peter's Basilica with the explicit approval of the new Pope Leo XIV. This marks a potential shift from the policies of Pope Francis, who in 2021 significantly restricted the use of the traditional liturgy, citing concerns that it had become a source of division and opposition to the Second Vatican Council. The approval is being interpreted by supporters as a sign that the new pontiff may be more open to dialogue and reconciliation regarding liturgical practices within the Church.</p>

          <p>Researchers have captured rare and significant footage of a Bornean clouded leopard with two cubs in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park. This is the first time a female of this threatened species has been documented with two offspring in the park, providing a hopeful sign for the declining population. Clouded leopards have a low reproductive rate and require undisturbed rainforest to thrive, so the presence of a successful breeding female indicates that conservation efforts within the park are creating a sufficiently protected and healthy habitat.</p>

          <p>A Goldman Sachs report indicates that major Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their export focus away from the United States and towards less-developed markets like Southeast Asia. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-U.S. markets have grown at an annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the U.S. have slightly declined. This strategic pivot allows Chinese firms to leverage their low-cost advantages and build new supply chains, while also moving up the value chain by exporting higher-end products to these emerging economies.
