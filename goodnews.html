          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion, making it the fifth-largest in the game's history after no winning tickets were sold in Saturday night's $1 billion grand prize drawing. The next opportunity to win this massive sum, which carries an estimated cash value of $498.4 million before taxes, is scheduled for Monday at 11 p.m. ET. This marks the sixth instance in Powerball's 33-year history that the top prize has climbed past the billion-dollar mark, with the last jackpot winner occurring on May 31. A single winner could choose a lump sum or 29 increasing annual payments, emphasizing the life-changing potential of this lottery.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 00:38:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Biologists near the California-Oregon border are deploying drones equipped with loudspeakers to deter wolves from livestock, utilizing unconventional tactics like blasting AC/DC's "Thunderstruck," movie clips featuring Scarlett Johansson, and live human voices. This innovative experiment aims to reduce the increasing conflict between recovering gray wolf populations and ranchers, who have historically employed various nonlethal techniques. While initial trials show success in interrupting wolf hunts and promoting coexistence, the high cost of the specialized drones (around $20,000) and the potential for wolves to habituate to the noise present ongoing challenges for long-term viability, making it impractical for many ranchers.</p>

          <p>The No. 9 LSU Tigers secured a hard-fought 17-10 road victory over No. 4 Clemson in South Carolina, marking a significant upset in a game dominated by defensive play. Offense was scarce, with LSU's Garrett Nussmeier eventually finding Trey-Dez Green for the go-ahead touchdown in the fourth quarter, after a previous score was ruled incomplete. Clemson's offense, led by Cade Klubnik, struggled to convert opportunities, including a missed field goal and multiple turnovers on downs, failing to capitalize on drives. This crucial win positions LSU favorably early in their season, while Clemson looks to rebound.</p>

          <p>The USC Trojans' football team achieved a dominant 73-13 victory over Missouri State in their season opener, marking the most points scored by USC since 1930. Quarterback Jayden Maiava led a seamless offense, completing 15 of 18 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns before halftime. The defense also impressed, tallying five sacks and a pick-six, holding Missouri State to 224 yards. Despite the impressive scoreline against a lower-division opponent, coach Lincoln Riley characterized it as merely a "good start" for the team, which utilized the game to break in many new players.</p>

          <p>German beer sales have reached a 30-year low, experiencing a 6.3% slump in the first half of 2025, while non-alcoholic beer sales have more than doubled since 2013. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting to this changing market, with non-alcoholic varieties now comprising a quarter of their production and being promoted at sporting events as a healthy alternative. This trend reflects a growing health consciousness and more mindful consumption habits among younger Germans, who tend to drink less daily. However, traditional alcoholic beer remains a deeply ingrained part of the country's cultural life, especially at festivals.</p>

The article explores the reasons behind Kojima's split, largely attributed to the spiraling costs of 2015's Metal Gear Solid V, and Konami's subsequent shift away from console games. Fans and critics are praising the remake for its faithful recreation, improved graphics, and retention of original voice performances, positioning it as a strong entry for both long-time fans and new players.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new reality dating show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," described as a blend of Love Island, Married at First Sight, and Survivor. Couples meet briefly, have a fake wedding, and are then isolated on a remote tropical island to test if love can thrive under harsh, primitive conditions, stripped of modern comforts and beauty products. Contestants emphasize the show's authenticity and the challenge of building a relationship through adversity. With a slightly older average age for participants, the article suggests it reflects evolving dating trends and a desire for deeper connections.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are deploying an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs and drones, to combat the spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus), a tiny but devastating pest threatening the nation's forests. This beetle, which has killed millions of spruce trees in Europe and arrived in the UK via winds, has been labeled "public enemy number one." The efforts have successfully eradicated the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England. However, rising European populations due to climate change, creating stressed trees and favorable conditions, pose ongoing challenges to prevention and detection, requiring continued vigilance and advanced modeling.</p>
