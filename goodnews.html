          <p>Beyonc√©'s Cowboy Carter tour kicked off its London residency with a nearly sold-out show at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, showcasing her new country era with elaborate costumes and a 40-song setlist. The performance featured nods to black performers historically excluded from the country scene, and included appearances by her daughter, Blue Ivy. However, the tour has been marked by slow ticket sales and high prices, with some fans feeling short-changed after dynamic pricing led to significant price drops before the show. Despite pricing concerns, the show was well-received, blending her biggest hits with tracks from Cowboy Carter.</p>

          <p>Under new regulations to be published this year, the majority of new build homes in England will be required to have solar panels, according to Energy Secretary Ed Miliband. The regulations aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions, potentially saving households ¬£500 a year on energy bills. The Home Builders Federation supports the move but cautions against burdensome paperwork that could hinder the construction of new homes. The Labour government is promising to introduce rules which would mandate developers to add solar panels to all new builds.</p>
