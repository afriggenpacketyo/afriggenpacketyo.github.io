          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 but failing to reach Venus due to a rocket malfunction, made an uncontrolled reentry to Earth on Saturday after 53 years in orbit. Experts had predicted that parts of the half-ton spacecraft, built to withstand Venus's harsh conditions, might survive reentry. While the exact location of impact and the extent of debris survival remain unknown, scientists stated that the chances of anyone being hit by debris were exceedingly low. The U.S. Space Command is analyzing data to confirm the spacecraft's demise, as Kosmos 482 garnered attention due to its potential to survive reentry.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's sweeping government overhaul, siding with unions and non-profits who argued that Congress did not authorize large-scale staffing cuts. Judge Susan Illston issued a 14-day restraining order against the mass layoffs, known as ‚Äúreductions in force,‚Äù asserting that the president requires congressional approval for broad agency restructuring. The ruling follows dozens of lawsuits challenging the administration's ‚Äúdepartment of government efficiency‚Äù (Doge), with plaintiffs presenting evidence of widespread terminations disrupting critical services across various agencies. A hearing is scheduled for May 22 to consider a longer-lasting preliminary injunction.</p>

          <p>The article argues that declining birth rates and family formation are becoming increasingly politicized, posing a threat to rational discussions about population. It asserts that an aging and shrinking population can lead to economic challenges and a decreased quality of life.

It urges progressives to engage in the conversation about population trends and advocate for policies that support families, rather than ceding the issue to other political groups.</p>

          <p>Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh is using a unique approach to evaluate rookie talent at the team's minicamp, prioritizing individual drills over 11-on-11 periods. The new system aims to provide a fair way for rookies to compete and showcase their raw talent, allowing the coaching staff to identify hidden gems. Harbaugh's "mining for gold" approach will focus on teaching and evaluating specific drills related to the Chargers' offensive, defensive, and special teams schemes. Undrafted free agents and tryout players will have the opportunity to impress the coaching staff and earn a spot on the team.</p>

          <p>The United States and China initiated high-level discussions in Switzerland to de-escalate trade tensions. The negotiations mark the first known in-person engagement between the two largest economies since President Trump imposed steep tariffs on imports earlier this year. The talks involved U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng, who oversees economic matters. Both countries face economic repercussions from the ongoing trade war, with China urging the United States to demonstrate sincerity and lift unilateral tariffs.</p>

          <h2>New Bill Aims to Facilitate Cannabis Research Amidst Rising Consumption</h2>

          <p>A proposed bill, the Evidence-Based Drug Policy Act of 2025 (EBDPA), seeks to ease research restrictions on cannabis and other schedule I substances in the US. The bill aims to allow research to catch up with the country's increasing cannabis consumption, potentially informing future legislation and enabling more clinical research on medical cannabis. If passed, the EBDPA would repeal sections of the Office of National Drug Control Policy Reauthorization Act of 1998 that currently hinder federal funding for research on schedule I substances. Some experts believe the bill could garner bipartisan support due to its emphasis on evidence-based policy-making.</p>
