          <h2>Tyler Glasnow Shows Encouraging Progress in Dodgers' Shutout Loss to Brewers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 00:39:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Los Angeles Dodgers losing 2-0 to the Milwaukee Brewers, pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a promising performance in his second start after returning from injury. He pitched six strong innings, allowing only one run and demonstrating increased fastball velocity, a positive sign for the team's postseason aspirations. Glasnow has historically struggled with injuries and maintaining focus, but his recent outings suggest a simplified, more athletic approach may be yielding results. His dependability is seen as crucial for the Dodgers' rotation, especially as they hope he can form a powerful trio with Yoshinobu Yamamoto and a returning Blake Snell.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists at the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Engineering University have proposed a new electromagnetic railgun design that could nearly double the firing power of existing models. The innovative concept involves cross-stacking two railguns into a single weapon, which they project could launch a 30kg projectile at Mach 7. This development addresses a key limitation of the current naval railgun, whose power constraints limit shells to 15kg, making them too light for significant wartime impact. The researchers state this advancement is necessary to overcome the technological hurdles that have hampered the military application of railgun technology.</p>

          <h2>Poll Reveals Strong Public Support for U.S. Return to the Moon and Mars Exploration</h2>

          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that a significant majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the U.S. undertaking missions to return to the moon and eventually travel to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original Apollo moon landing. The 1969 lunar mission continues to be viewed as a worthwhile achievement by most, and the space program in general is seen as a source of national pride. Additionally, the public tends to believe that space exploration contributes, at least somewhat, to technological advancements that benefit society as a whole.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology firms are reshaping the global AI landscape by championing open-source models, presenting a significant challenge to closed systems from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google. Companies such as DeepSeek have released powerful, free-to-use large language models that rival the capabilities of their Western counterparts, fostering a collaborative global development community. This open-source movement has not only spurred a wave of AI applications within China but also provides a viable alternative for international developers. Analysts suggest that this trend could seriously challenge the dominance of proprietary AI systems from Silicon Valley.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed ceasefire terms include the return of these 10 hostages and the remains of 18 others in exchange for Israel releasing an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement comes amid reports that Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad, has sought U.S. support in relocating hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from Gaza to other countries. Trump has been vocal about an impending ceasefire agreement, which is currently being negotiated.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a significant military aid package to support its defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. Defence Minister Richard Marles confirmed that Ukraine has already taken possession of most of the 49 tanks provided. This contribution is part of a larger A$1.5 billion in total aid from Australia, one of the largest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine's war effort. Since the conflict began, Canberra has also supplied other military equipment and ammunition, imposed sanctions on Russian entities, and banned key exports to Russia, firmly labeling it as the aggressor.</p>

          <p>A U.S. Marine veteran, Scott Harrison, has brought to life a vision that helped him endure the Vietnam War.

After struggling with PTSD for years, Harrison decided to build that carousel, spending 26 years restoring a broken one and carving new animals for it. Now a nonprofit, the "Carousel of Happiness" in Nederland, Colorado, has brought joy to over a million visitors and provided its creator with profound healing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for stablecoins in the United States. The bipartisan legislation allows banks and other financial institutions to issue stablecoins backed one-for-one by U.S. dollars and Treasury bills, aiming to enhance consumer protection and integrate digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. Supporters believe the law will bolster the U.S. dollar's global status and facilitate faster, lower-cost transactions. At the signing, Trump hailed the act as a massive validation for the crypto community and a potential revolution in financial technology. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A top adviser at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has called for the global financial system to rewrite its rules to adapt to a future dominated by tokenization. Shin Hyun-Song, head of the BIS economic department, warned that the rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment infrastructure and regulatory oversight. He noted that the cross-border and pseudonymous nature of stablecoin transactions could complicate efforts to combat money laundering and require banks to adapt their customer verification processes. This call for reform comes as the stablecoin market grows rapidly, attracting both investors and increased scrutiny from global regulators. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fintech company Block, formerly known as Square, is set to be included in the S&P 500 index, replacing oil producer Hess following its acquisition by Chevron. This change will take effect on July 23, and the announcement led to a more than 10% surge in Block's shares in extended trading. Such additions often boost a stock's value as index-tracking funds must purchase shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite a 14% decline in its stock value this year, Block's market capitalization of approximately $45 billion places it well above the median for the index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common condition, after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. According to the White House physician, tests confirmed CVI, which occurs when veins struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool in the legs. Vascular surgeons explain that CVI affects about one in three U.S. adults and is often caused by weakened vein valves, with risk factors including age and prolonged sitting. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, with the president's physician describing his condition as benign and manageable.</p>

          <p>The developers behind "California Forever," a controversial plan to build a new city on California farmland, have announced plans for a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub within the community. The proposed "Solano Foundry" aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other frontier technologies, with the goal of bringing R&D and manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project, backed by Silicon Valley billionaires, predicts the creation of at least 35,000 manufacturing jobs. However, local community groups remain skeptical, arguing that the industrial development does not necessitate building an entire new city and that the proposal is primarily hype.

          <p>Microsoft has revised its practices to ensure that engineers based in China will no longer provide technical support for its U.S. Department of Defense cloud services contracts. The change follows a ProPublica report that raised national security concerns about the arrangement, which involved U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervising more technically proficient engineers in China. In response, Microsoft stated it is committed to providing the most secure services possible and will adjust protocols as needed. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth called the previous system unacceptable and announced a review to find any similar vulnerabilities in government systems.</p>
