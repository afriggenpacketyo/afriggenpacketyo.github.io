          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that the Trump administration is open to extending the current 90-day tariff pause for key trading partners demonstrating "good faith" in ongoing trade negotiations. Bessent highlighted that the U.S. is engaged in trade discussions with 18 significant partners, including the European Union. He suggested that for those negotiating constructively, the U.S. would likely extend the tariff pause beyond its expiration date. This contrasts with previous statements requiring an agreement before any extension. The announcement provides a glimmer of hope for businesses seeking stability in international trade relations.

          <p>Researchers have analyzed gold coins from the San Jose galleon, a Spanish ship that sank in 1708, confirming their origin and revealing intricate designs. The coins feature depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, as well as the "Crowned Pillars of Hercules." The study, published in Antiquity, used images taken by remotely operated vehicles to analyze dozens of coins scattered around the shipwreck. Colombian authorities plan to begin extractions from the wreck, which was discovered in 2015. The discovery has sparked legal claims from multiple parties, including Colombia, Spain, and an American salvage company. The images offer a glimpse into a fascinating historical find.</p>
