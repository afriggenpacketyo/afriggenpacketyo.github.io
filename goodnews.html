          <h2>Five Phrases to Avoid When Communicating With Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 13:03:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a study of over 200 parent-child relationships, parents who avoid defiance in their children do not use threats, bribes, or harsh consequences, and instead use language that encourages cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," "Stop crying. You're fine," "How many times do I have to tell you?," and "You know better than that" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, parents should explain their reasoning, give children agency, validate emotions, invite problem-solving, and encourage self-reflection. This approach helps children feel respected, emotionally safe, and involved, which reduces power struggles and fosters emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>The Phoenix Suns have reportedly agreed to trade Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets in a major NBA offseason move. Durant will join the Rockets in exchange for Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, the No. 10 overall pick of the 2025 draft, and five second-round picks. Durant, despite being 36, remains a top scorer, while the Suns gain young talent in Green and Brooks, who are expected to contribute significantly to the team's performance. This trade marks a significant shift in the NBA landscape, with Houston aiming to bolster its roster and Phoenix seeking to rebuild with younger players.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to debut its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, offering select individuals rides in Model Y Robotaxis within a geofenced area. The pilot program will involve a small number of cars, with "Early Access" invites primarily going to Tesla investors and enthusiasts, who will be able to hail the self-driving cars via a Robotaxi App. The launch comes amid scrutiny from government officials and safety advocacy groups, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration seeking information on Tesla's plans to evaluate the robotaxis, while some Texas lawmakers have requested a delay until a new law regulating autonomous vehicles takes effect. The initial rollout will include a "Tesla Safety Monitor" in the front passenger seat and remote monitoring.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO member countries have reportedly agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their GDP, a benchmark long sought by the U.S., with Spain initially blocking the measure but ultimately agreeing to an exemption. The agreement is expected to be voted on during the upcoming NATO meeting in The Hague, requiring all member nations except Spain to reach the 5% goal by 2035. At least 3.5% of national GDP will be spent on core military needs, while an additional 1.5% can be allocated for related expenditures. This move signals a significant shift in NATO's financial commitment to defense.</p>

          <p>Following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Iranian authorities have reported no signs of off-site radiation or contamination, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency. Rafael Mariano Grossi, the agency's Director General, stated that no health consequences are expected for people or the environment outside the targeted sites. The three sites hit by U.S. bombs contained nuclear material in the form of uranium enriched to different levels, which is considered to be at the low end of hazard with regard to radioactive materials. Neighboring countries have also reported no abnormal radiation levels.</p>

          <p>Chelsea's head coach, Enzo Maresca, faces a midfield puzzle with numerous options, including the expensive acquisitions of Enzo Fern√°ndez, Mois√©s Caicedo, and Rom√©o Lavia. Balancing these players in the starting XI, particularly with Cole Palmer's role, presents a challenge, and Chelsea's recent performance against Flamengo in the Club World Cup highlighted these difficulties. The team's US tour is doubling as pre-season preparation, but Maresca must find a way to effectively utilize his midfield talent while addressing concerns about player frustration and squad rotation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author argues that President Trump's decisive action against Iran's nuclear program is commendable, despite his many flaws, highlighting the danger posed by a nuclear-armed Iran and the regime's history of hostility. The article emphasizes that Trump's move, while limited, was a necessary step, and that his threat of further punishment is justified. It dismisses concerns about a broader war, noting Iran's weakness and the preparedness of the U.S. and its allies, ultimately applauding Trump for his brutal clarity and for making the world a better place.</p>
