          <p>Poland held a pivotal presidential election on Sunday, with early exit polls indicating that pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski is narrowly ahead of nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski, backed by Prime Minister Donald Tusk's centrist Civic Coalition, has pledged to support abortion rights and LGBTQ protections. Meanwhile, Nawrocki, supported by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, presents himself as a defender of conservative values and national sovereignty. The election results are expected to significantly shape Poland's political future and its relationship with the European Union, with a runoff election likely to occur in June.</p>

          <p>House Speaker Mike Johnson said that Republicans are still "on track" to pass the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill Act‚Äù by the end of the week, despite opposition from some GOP members. The bill, encompassing President Donald Trump‚Äôs agenda, aims to provide major tax breaks by cutting spending, including significant reductions to Medicaid. A group of Budget Committee hard-liners initially blocked the bill over concerns with Medicaid work requirements. Johnson expressed confidence in reaching a compromise, emphasizing the need to pass the package by July 4 to address the debt limit.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists warn against the common habit of leaving razors in the shower due to the moist environment being a breeding ground for bacteria. The combination of oxygen and moisture causes razor blades to rust faster, increasing the risk of nicks and cuts. Bacteria found on wet razor handles can irritate the skin and cause infections. Dermatologists recommend rinsing the razor thoroughly, drying it with a towel, and storing it in a dry place outside the bathroom to keep the blades sharper and reduce skin issues. Additionally, after-shave lotion and moisturizer are advised to prevent skin infections.</p>

Taylor, who was in the final season of a four-year, $60-million contract, had experienced declining production in recent years. The emergence of rookie utilityman Hyeseong Kim and the return of other players from injury contributed to the decision. Taylor was once a key player for the Dodgers, earning an All-Star selection in 2021 and playing a crucial role in their 2020 World Series win.</p>
