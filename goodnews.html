          <p>President Donald Trump stated that he and Chinese Premier Xi Jinping have approved a deal concerning the future of TikTok's U.S. operations during a phone call. The agreement would reportedly see TikTok's U.S. business sold to a group of American investors, including Oracle, allowing it to continue operating while using an algorithm licensed from its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. However, statements from Chinese state media and ByteDance suggest negotiations are ongoing, with control over the powerful algorithm remaining a key issue. The two leaders also agreed to meet at the upcoming APEC summit in South Korea.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. The National Hurricane Center forecasts that the system will strengthen into a hurricane by Sunday but is expected to remain over open waters for several days. Its current projected track carries it north of the Caribbean islands and away from the U.S. mainland. However, the storm could pass east of Bermuda next week as it continues to intensify, potentially bringing some impacts to the island, according to meteorologists.</p>

The police department is making special accommodations for him, including finding a large enough uniform and a suitable patrol car.

Inspired after her own grandfather was targeted, she developed a website and an AI-powered app called "Shield Seniors" to help older adults identify and report fraudulent messages. Manoj now spends her time teaching cybersecurity classes at senior centers, aiming to empower the elderly and remove the stigma of asking for help. She hopes the recognition will help her secure funding to launch the app widely by the end of the year.</p>

          <p>Facing saturated markets and slowing demand in Europe and the United States, many Chinese companies are now shifting their focus toward Southeast Asia. A trade fair in Nanning is serving as a key testing ground for these exporters, who are attracted to the region's rapidly growing economies and large, young consumer base. Companies that have traditionally relied on Western markets view Southeast Asia as a region with immense potential for growth and expansion. This strategic pivot reflects a broader trend in global trade as Chinese firms seek new avenues for their products.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has thrown out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Donald Trump against The New York Times, calling the language in the 85-page complaint an "improper and impermissible" political attack rather than a valid legal document. The judge did not rule on the merits of the case but criticized the filing as being full of "tedious and burdensome" language. Trump's legal team has been given 28 days to submit a revised, more professional complaint that adheres to procedural rules and does not exceed 40 pages. The lawsuit alleged that several articles and a book by two reporters were intended to undermine his presidential campaign.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-19 19:21:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent threats by President Trump and FCC Chairman Brendan Carr to revoke broadcast licenses of critical TV networks have highlighted the federal government's regulatory power over the media. This article explains that networks like ABC, CBS, and NBC require licenses from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to use public airwaves, obligating them to operate in the "public interest." While the FCC can theoretically revoke a license, the process is complex and typically involves issues like obscenity or children's programming, not political content. The current pressure is seen by experts as an unprecedented use of this regulatory authority.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, supermodel David Gandy reflected on his nearly 25-year career and voiced significant concerns about the rise of artificial intelligence in the fashion industry. He is part of a coalition of over 2,000 models urging the UK government to regulate generative AI, which can create human-like images without real models, photographers, or makeup artists. Gandy fears this trend could make entire creative teams redundant and damage Britain's legacy of producing top models. He also discussed the importance of maintaining his family's privacy in an era of public scrutiny.</p>

          <p>A recent surge of multi-billion-pound investments from U.S. tech giants like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Google is bolstering the United Kingdom's ambition to become an AI superpower. This influx of capital, celebrated during President Trump's state visit, is seen as a sign of strong confidence from Silicon Valley in the UK's research and development capabilities. While some critics, like Sir Nick Clegg, warn of the UK becoming too dependent on U.S. tech, others see it as a pivotal opportunity to grow the economy. The investments are focused on AI infrastructure and research, primarily within the Oxford-Cambridge-London "Golden Triangle."</p>

In a competitive scene where Latinx comics often feel marginalized, the show provides a platform to joke about the immigrant experience and build community.
