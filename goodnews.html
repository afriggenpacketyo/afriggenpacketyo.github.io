          <p>Newly elected South Korean President Lee Jae-myung is seeking China's assistance in de-escalating tensions with North Korea.  He requested China's constructive role in denuclearization efforts during a phone call with President Xi Jinping.  While China expressed support for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, its statement omitted the denuclearization aspect, reflecting its cautious approach to North Korea.  Analysts interpret this as China's preference for maintaining peace without directly pressuring North Korea.</p>
