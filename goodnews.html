          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new training strategy focused on building resilience and team cohesion. Athletes are now living together in a "virtual athletes' village" to simulate Olympic conditions and learn to perform well under unfamiliar or challenging circumstances, such as travel delays or shared living spaces. The initiative, trialed ahead of the world championships, has reportedly improved team morale and motivation. Officials hope this approach will better prepare swimmers for the pressures of the 2028 Los Angeles Games.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, UK, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to address the rising incidence of melanoma skin cancer. The initiative, set for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen, aiming to instill lifelong protective habits. Experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases melanoma risk later in life, and this preventative education is crucial as cancer cases are projected to rise. The program seeks to empower children to take responsibility for their own skin health.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year career for the country's workhorse space vehicle. The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, successfully placed a government satellite into orbit for monitoring greenhouse gases. Developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, the H2A series has been pivotal to Japan's space program, achieving a 98% success rate over its lifetime. It is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, designed to be more competitive in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration of opposition against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly a reaction to the government's attempts to ban the march under a controversial "child protection" law that critics say equates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, championed the event as a celebration of freedom and human rights, sending a clear message of defiance to the ruling Fidesz party's socially conservative policies.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has again rejected President Donald Trump's attempt to have a defamation lawsuit filed by the exonerated "Central Park Five" thrown out. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which is designed to protect against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. The lawsuit was filed by the five men after Trump, during a presidential debate, falsely claimed they had killed someone and pled guilty. This marks another setback for Trump in his efforts to dismiss the case.</p>
