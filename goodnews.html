          <p>The United States and Australia have signed a significant agreement on critical minerals, establishing a project pipeline valued at up to $8.5 billion. This partnership aims to reduce Western dependence on China, which currently dominates the global supply chain for rare earths. The deal comes amid escalating trade tensions, with the U.S. threatening substantial tariffs on Chinese goods in response to Beijing's recent export controls on these vital materials, underscoring a strategic push for supply chain security.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, actress Keri Russell, 49, shared her perspective on aging naturally and avoiding the trend of plastic surgery prevalent in Hollywood. She explained that forgoing cosmetic procedures makes her feel unique in an industry where many stars, even those in their 20s, opt for surgical enhancements. Russell connected this personal choice to her role in "The Diplomat," where her character often faces scrutiny over her appearance, a pressure she finds relatable as a woman in the public eye.</p>

          <p>A recent American Heart Association survey found that nearly 90% of U.S. adults are unaware of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, despite a similar percentage being at risk. CKM syndrome, defined in 2023, describes the interconnectedness of heart disease, kidney disease, diabetes, and obesity, where each condition can exacerbate the others. Health experts emphasize that this holistic view is crucial for prevention and treatment, as these chronic diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in the United States.</p>

          <p>According to market commentary, Apple's stock is experiencing a significant rally, reaching new highs as concerns about the iPhone 17 upgrade cycle prove to be unfounded. Positive data indicates the new models are outselling their predecessors, driven by compelling value and features, which has led several Wall Street firms to upgrade their ratings and price targets for the company. This renewed investor confidence follows a period of underperformance due to worries about AI strategy and potential tariffs, suggesting a bullish outlook for the tech giant.
