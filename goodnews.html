          <p>Marco Rubio's dual role as US national security advisor and secretary of state could potentially streamline communications with Beijing, despite his known hawkish stance on China. Taking on the responsibilities previously held by Henry Kissinger, Rubio becomes the direct counterpart to China‚Äôs Wang Yi, and this appointment follows Michael Waltz's departure. While Rubio's senatorial focus was on human rights issues related to Russia, China, and Iran, his current administration role shifts towards addressing China's trade practices. The article suggests this consolidation of power could lead to more efficient diplomatic interactions between the two nations, although Rubio's underlying views remain a point of consideration. </p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, despite a decline from the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. The company attributed its success to volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, combined with cost-cutting measures, which offset the impact of weaker oil prices. Exxon's global production business saw a 19% increase in earnings, driven by growth in the Permian and Guyana, while U.S. production earnings soared by over 70%. The company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share purchases, and its capital expenditures remain in line with its 2025 guidance.</p>

The meeting, marking Buffett's 60th year leading the company, occurs amid economic uncertainty and follows the death of his long-time partner, Charlie Munger. Investors are eager to learn Buffett's perspective on the economy and his plans for Berkshire's large cash reserves, especially after the company sold more stock than it bought for nine consecutive quarters. Shareholders are also curious about Buffett's decision to reduce Berkshire's stake in Apple and whether he sees opportunities in the current market conditions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As debates intensify regarding President Donald Trump's policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could significantly impact higher earners. The $10,000 limit on the federal deduction for state and local taxes, enacted through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action. Lawmakers from high-tax states are advocating for raising the SALT cap, and Trump has expressed support for reform. While a complete repeal seems unlikely, experts suggest that a higher SALT deduction limit is a possibility, potentially benefiting taxpayers in states like California, New Jersey, and New York.</p>

          <p>A suspected glitch on the Deliveroo app caused some Co-op product prices to drop by as much as 100%, allowing shoppers to acquire items like pasta sauce, coffee, and cookies for free.

While retailers' obligations to honor mispriced products depend on their terms and conditions, Co-op and Deliveroo have been approached for comment.

          <p>Chevron's stock experienced a decline following the release of its first-quarter earnings report, which revealed a decrease in profit due to the steep drop in oil prices this year. The company plans to repurchase $2.5 billion to $3 billion of its own stock in the second quarter, which is lower than the $3.9 billion it bought back in the first quarter. Chevron's net income decreased by over 30%, and its U.S. production business also saw a decline in profit due to higher operating expenses and lower commodity prices. The company's U.S. refining business, however, swung to a profit after a loss in the previous quarter, though earnings still declined year-over-year.</p>

The color of the smoke emitted from the chimney will indicate whether a pope has been elected: black smoke signifies no decision, while white smoke signals the selection of the 267th pope.

The agreement lists 55 minerals, including rare earth elements like scandium and yttrium, as well as titanium, lithium, and uranium. This partnership comes as China has imposed export restrictions on some of these minerals, making Ukraine a potentially valuable source for these strategically vital resources.</p>

Kirp calls for universities to band together, publicly condemn the government's actions, and provide financial support to institutions facing legal challenges. He suggests a mutual defense pact, similar to NATO, to deter the administration's assaults on academic freedom, emphasizing that universities must either hang together or hang separately.</p>

The 27-year-old has consistently performed well in domestic cricket and now has an opportunity due to injuries to several key players. With Chris Woakes, Mark Wood, Brydon Carse, and Olly Stone all unavailable, and Jofra Archer still recovering, England will field an inexperienced pace attack, likely including Cook, Josh Tongue, Gus Atkinson, and Matthew Potts. A likely combination of Atkinson, Tongue and Cook in the XI on 22 May would have 13 caps between them.</p>
