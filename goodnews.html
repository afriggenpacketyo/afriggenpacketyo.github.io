        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A rare dust storm warning was issued for the Chicago area, marking only the second time in history that the National Weather Service's Chicago office has issued such a warning. High winds blowing over dry farmlands caused significantly reduced visibility on major interstates and prompted ground stops at O'Hare and Midway airports. Some areas experienced 'mud rain' due to showers coinciding with the dust storm. A few schools closed due to power outages resulting from previous severe weather events and strong winds are expected to continue into the weekend.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark spoke about the importance of rivalries in sports as she prepares to face Angel Reese in the WNBA season opener between the Indiana Fever and Chicago Sky. The rivalry between Clark and Reese began during the 2023 NCAA championship game and continued into their rookie WNBA seasons, marked by contentious fouls and intense matchups. Last season, Clark's team won three of the four games against Reese's Sky, which were among the most-watched WNBA games. The Sky and Fever are scheduled to play each other five times in the 2025 season.</p>

          <p>Angels Flight Railway in downtown Los Angeles will raise its fares from $1.00 to $1.50 starting June 1, citing rising costs of insurance, maintenance, and labor.

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency is considering integrating artificial intelligence into weather forecasting to enhance accuracy through deep learning. A new team has been established to develop infrastructure and technology to combine AI predictions with existing numerical forecasting models. The AI system will analyze historical weather data to generate forecasts for temperature, rainfall, and typhoon paths. While AI will play a significant role, human forecasters will still oversee and issue final weather reports and disaster alerts.</p>

Toru Fujii, the brewery's head, hopes that opening up to overseas participants will increase exports, particularly to Europe, as the domestic sake market declines.</p>

Residents speculate that it may have been an act of vandalism or melted down for cash. The statue had never quite captured the hearts of the town's residents, with some describing it as unaesthetic.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the UK/EU summit, youth mobility and fishing rights have emerged as key issues for negotiation. The EU is proposing a 'youth mobility scheme' to allow stays of up to four years, but concerns exist about the impact on UK immigration numbers. Fishing rights are another potential sticking point, with the EU seeking an extension of current arrangements while UK fishing groups are calling for changes. The post-Brexit deal on fishing rights expires at the end of June 2026.</p>
