        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional Republicans are facing confusion due to President Trump's inconsistent messaging regarding tax policy within the 'big, beautiful bill.' Trump has suggested a 'tiny' tax increase for the wealthy, which clashes with the Republican Party's long-held stance against raising taxes. This mixed messaging has caused frustration among Republicans, especially after Trump stated he was 'OK' if they did it but Republicans 'probably should not do it.' Trump's economic message resonated with blue-collar voters, but the lack of clear direction from the White House is causing uncertainty as the House attempts to pass the measure.

Despite these hardships, his father reports that Edan's spirit remains unbroken, and he is described as still being his goofy, funny self, though simply tired.
