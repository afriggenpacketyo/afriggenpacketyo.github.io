          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll indicates that approximately two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority still view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride. These positive sentiments for space exploration are broadly consistent across different political and ideological groups.</p>

          <p>Chinese technology companies are increasingly challenging the dominance of U.S. firms like OpenAI and Google by releasing powerful, open-source artificial intelligence models. Companies such as DeepSeek and Alibaba have launched advanced large language models (LLMs) that are freely available for global developers to use and modify. This strategy fosters a collaborative approach to AI development and presents a significant alternative to the closed, proprietary systems common in Silicon Valley. The trend is redefining the global AI landscape and gaining widespread support from the international developer community.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages are expected to be released from Gaza "very shortly," as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce terms involve the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement follows recent indirect talks mediated by Qatar and a visit from Israel's Mossad director to Washington. Hamas has indicated it favors an interim truce but may revert to demanding a full deal if negotiations stall.</p>

          <p>The Australian government has delivered a shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine as part of a $160 million military aid package. This contribution is intended to bolster Ukraine's defense capabilities against the ongoing Russian invasion. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors to Ukraine's war effort, Australia has provided over $980 million in total aid, including ammunition and other defense equipment. The delivery underscores Australia's continued commitment to supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable for what it terms an "illegal and immoral invasion."</p>

          <p>Retired Marine Cpl. Scott Harrison, who found solace during the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel, has turned that vision into a reality in Nederland, Colorado. To cope with the horrors of war, Harrison would listen to a music box and picture a peaceful carousel, an image that helped him through his service and subsequent battle with PTSD. In 1986, he began restoring a broken-down carousel, hand-carving new animals over 26 years. Now a nonprofit, the Carousel of Happiness has brought joy to over a million visitors and provided Harrison with profound healing.</p>

          <p>An economic adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must rewrite its rules to adapt to a future of tokenized assets. Shin Hyun-Song, head of the BIS monetary and economic department, highlighted that the rise of stablecoins presents new challenges for payment systems and regulatory efforts like anti-money-laundering. He noted that the borderless and pseudonymous nature of these digital tokens complicates oversight. The warning comes amid growing hype in the crypto market and as jurisdictions like Hong Kong prepare new stablecoin regulations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump was recently diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI) after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs, according to his physician. The White House doctor described the condition as "benign and common," especially in people over 70, and confirmed that tests found no signs of more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when veins, particularly in the legs, struggle to return blood to the heart, causing it to pool. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like compression, elevation, and exercise, and the president is reported to be in "excellent health" otherwise.</p>

The request cites "extensive public interest" and the administration's commitment to transparency as the primary motivations. The filing asks the court to release the records from both the Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell cases, subject to redactions to protect victim identities and other personal information. This move comes amid intense public pressure and controversy over the administration's initial decision not to release any further files.</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its next phase: a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other "frontier tech" sectors, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, pitched the plan as a way to restore the "designed in California, made in California" model.

Previously, Chinese engineers provided support for Microsoft's Azure cloud services under the supervision of U.S.-based "digital escorts."

          <p>After a warm and dry spring, the UK appears to be heading into a "summer of the wasp," with pest control experts reporting an increase in callouts for nests. While official scientific data is not yet available, entomologists believe the weather conditions have been ideal for social wasps to thrive. Although often disliked, experts emphasize that wasps are vital apex predators in the ecosystem, acting as natural pest controllers for gardens and farms. To coexist peacefully, they advise against swatting at the insects and suggest distracting them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy-epic parody. Written by a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the musical comedy draws inspiration from a tabloid myth about Coleen throwing her engagement ring away. The play transforms the couple into heroic, medieval-style characters on a quest, aiming for affectionate homage rather than mockery. The show is characteristic of the Liverpool Royal Court theatre's focus on creating original, locally relevant comedies for its audience.</p>

          <p>Northern Ireland's public health service will extend its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccination program to include premature babies starting this autumn. A new, long-acting injection will be offered to infants born too prematurely to have benefited from the maternal RSV vaccine administered during pregnancy. RSV is a highly infectious virus and a leading cause of hospitalization in young children. Officials stated the new vaccine will offer around 80% protection and is expected to reduce pressure on hospitals and emergency departments during the winter months.</p>
