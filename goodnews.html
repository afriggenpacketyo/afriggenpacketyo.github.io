          <p>A New York mayoral debate saw Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani clash over experience and records, with Mamdani criticizing Cuomo's controversies, including his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations.

          <p>Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has called for an end to the windfall tax on oil and gas companies and advocated for new licenses for drilling in the North Sea. Addressing the Scottish Conservative party conference in Edinburgh, Badenoch argued the tax should be scrapped before its current 2030 expiration. She claimed the windfall tax on the sector is wrong as "for months there has been no windfall to tax." Opposition politicians criticized Badenoch's comments, while the End Fuel Poverty Coalition described them as "out of touch."</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that Elon Musk has lost some popularity among Republicans following his public falling-out with President Donald Trump. Fewer Republicans view Musk ‚Äúvery favorably‚Äù compared to April, with some expressing disappointment over his opposition to Trump's policies. Despite the shift, most Republicans still hold a positive view of Musk. The poll also reveals that Americans are less likely to view Musk favorably than his company, Tesla, which is facing its own challenges.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Disrupting oil flows would likely trigger further retaliation and could draw backlash from China, Iran's largest oil customer. Experts also suggest that a full-scale disruption of global oil flows may be physically impossible. The Strait of Hormuz sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments.</p>
