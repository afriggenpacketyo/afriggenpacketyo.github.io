          <p>A Baltimore couple, who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on the tenth anniversary of its nationwide legalization. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak recount their personal struggles, such as being denied access during childbirth, which fueled their fight for equality. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, it raised awareness that contributed to Maryland legalizing same-sex marriage in 2012. They express concern over current efforts to roll back these rights, emphasizing the importance of protecting the safety and equality of the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>A group of engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has successfully invented a specialized printer capable of adding braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a machine to handle materials that commercial braille printers could not. Designed with open hardware, the printer allows employees with low or no vision to operate it easily by touch. The students have already used their invention to produce 400 labels for a fundraiser, streamlining a previously manual and laborious process for BISM workers.</p>

Other major draws included Charli XCX and Scissor Sisters on various stages.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved new record highs this week, demonstrating resilience in the face of escalating geopolitical tensions following U.S. military action in Iran. Markets initially reacted with concern but quickly shrugged off the conflict, betting it would not systemically impact the U.S. economy or corporate earnings. A key factor was the rapid decline in oil prices after an initial surge, which eased fears of inflation and constrained consumer spending. Investor sentiment was also buoyed by increasing expectations of multiple Federal Reserve rate cuts by the end of the year, despite a slightly hotter-than-expected core inflation report.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from the ancient city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society ruled by females over 9,000 years ago. Researchers analyzed DNA from over 130 skeletons buried under the city's houses and found that genetic connections were primarily traced through the female line. This indicates that female offspring likely remained in their family homes while males moved to their wives' households upon marriage. The findings are supported by the preferential treatment of females in burials, who received five times more grave goods than males, challenging Western biases about historical social structures.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly personally leading an aggressive effort to recruit top artificial intelligence talent from rival companies like OpenAI and Google. According to reports, Zuckerberg has spent months creating a secret list of leading AI engineers and researchers, personally reaching out to them with lucrative compensation packages potentially worth up to $100 million. This hands-on recruitment drive is part of Meta's high-stakes race for AI dominance, following its recent $14 billion investment in Scale AI. The aggressive tactics have reportedly drawn criticism from competitors, including OpenAI's CEO Sam Altman, who called the rumored offers "crazy."</p>

          <p>The California Highway Patrol (CHP) responded to an unusual report of a baby tiger stranded on the side of a highway in a remote area of San Luis Obispo County. A concerned driver had called in the sighting along Highway 166. However, when an officer arrived to investigate the scene, they found no evidence of a tiger cub. Instead, the officer discovered a deceased hawk on the roadside. It remains unclear why the caller mistook the bird for a large feline, and the California Department of Transportation was notified to remove the animal.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris secured a stunning pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outperforming the rest of the field by more than half a second. Norris described his qualifying lap as "as close to perfection" as he could ask for, stating that he felt a connection with the car that he had been missing for much of the season. This performance comes after a season where Norris has been hampered by qualifying mistakes, but recent car upgrades appear to have addressed his concerns. His teammate and championship leader, Oscar Piastri, will start in third, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc alongside Norris on the front row.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of up to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban and creating one of the largest LGBTQ+ rights demonstrations in Hungary's history. The event was seen as a significant rebuke to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's nationalist government, which recently passed a law restricting gatherings that "promote" homosexuality. Budapest's mayor enabled the march by declaring it a municipal event, bypassing the police ban. The massive turnout, supported by numerous EU officials and embassies, symbolized a broader resistance to what critics describe as an erosion of democratic freedoms in the country.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions started their tour of Australia with a decisive 50-point victory over the Western Force in Perth, scoring eight tries in a display of ambitious, attacking rugby. Despite the dominant performance, the team faces an early injury concern with Welsh scrum-half Tomos Williams, who scored twice before leaving the field with a tight hamstring. Head coach Andy Farrell noted that while the team's high penalty count in the first half showed a lack of composure, the overall attacking intent and creativity were promising signs. The tour now proceeds to Brisbane for a match against the Queensland Reds.</p>
