          <p>TikTok is launching in-app guided meditation exercises and well-being features for users of all ages, with a focus on young users, as it faces lawsuits and criticism regarding the app's effects on mental health. The meditation feature, which aims to improve sleep quality, will be triggered during "sleep hours" and automatically turned on for users under 18. This initiative comes amid public pressure and lawsuits alleging that TikTok is intentionally addictive and psychologically damaging to kids, leading to issues like depression, anxiety, sleep loss, and body dysmorphia. The company is also introducing educational feeds, online safety tools, and enhanced parental controls over screen time.</p>

          <p>The Polish government's approval ratings are declining due to President Andrzej Duda's obstruction of its reform plans, making the upcoming presidential election on May 18 crucial for the pro-European, center-left coalition led by Donald Tusk. Duda has been using his veto power and referring bills to the constitutional court, hindering the government's attempts to restore the rule of law, liberalize abortion legislation, and introduce LGBTQ+ rights. Tusk is backing Rafal Trzaskowski, the mayor of Warsaw, while Duda supports Karol Nawrocki, head of Poland's Institute of National Remembrance. The election's outcome will significantly impact the government's ability to fulfill its campaign promises.</p>

          <p>Pakistan has declared victory in its recent military clash with India, leading to a renewed public confidence in the state and the military, despite the country's ongoing political, economic, and security crises. The four-day fight, which ended with a U.S.-brokered cease-fire, allowed Pakistan to claim it hit the Indian military in a sensitive place by downing advanced fighter jets. The military, led by Gen. Syed Asim Munir, has seized the opportunity to rehabilitate its image and deflect attention from accusations of political repression. However, the support regained by the military could diminish if it is seen as overreaching in politics or failing to address internal security challenges.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 experienced historic volatility in April, including its fifth-largest two-day percentage decline since 1950. However, history suggests that such declines are often followed by significant gains, with the index averaging a 32.6% increase one year later, compared to its average annual return of 9.2%. This pattern underscores the disproportionate nature of stock market cycles, with bull markets typically lasting much longer than bear markets. Despite short-term fears, a long-term, optimistic approach to investing has historically proven to be a pathway to wealth creation.</p>

The work, led by the GenomeAsia 100K consortium, could reveal new insights about disease susceptibility and drug responses among indigenous populations.</p>
