          <p>Talks surrounding Newcastle striker Alexander Isak's potential transfer to Liverpool have stalled, with no new offers made since Liverpool's initial £110m bid was rejected nearly three weeks ago. Newcastle has publicly stated Isak is not for sale but is reportedly seeking two new strikers, a move Liverpool is watching closely before potentially increasing its offer to over £120m. The situation is complicated by a challenging market for strikers, with Newcastle struggling to find suitable and affordable replacements for both Isak and the departed Callum Wilson. As the September 1st deadline approaches, the club faces the difficult choice of selling a key player or potentially reintegrating a wantaway star.</p>

          <p>Nvidia has confirmed it is evaluating new products following reports that it is developing a more powerful AI chip, tentatively named B30A, for the Chinese market. This comes after the U.S. government halted sales of advanced chips to China over national security concerns, which led Nvidia to create the less powerful H20 chip specifically for that market. The potential new chip would be based on the advanced Blackwell architecture, and its sale would be subject to government approval. Recently, Nvidia and AMD agreed to give the U.S. government a 15% share of their sales in China in exchange for permission to resume some business. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>All-rounder Rehan Ahmed delivered a stellar performance with both bat and ball to lead the Trent Rockets to a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Manchester Originals in The Hundred. Ahmed scored an unbeaten 45 runs after taking two key wickets for just 14 runs, complementing captain David Willey's exceptional opening spell of 3-11. The Originals were restricted to a meager 98-8, a total the Rockets chased down with 26 balls remaining, significantly boosting their net run-rate. This victory solidifies the Rockets' position at second in the league table, keeping them in strong contention for a top-three finish.</p>

This marks a policy shift from the previous administration's approach of providing grants, with Lutnick stating the Trump administration wants "a piece of the action" for the American people. The news comes as Intel's stock rallied amid reports of increased government involvement and a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank. This new equity requirement could potentially be applied to other recipients of the $53 billion CHIPS Act funding as well. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has announced its intention to release documents related to the Jeffrey Epstein case, which it is set to receive from the Department of Justice following a subpoena. The committee plans to review the files and make them public after redacting sensitive information, such as victim identities and child sexual abuse material. This move follows controversy over a recent Justice Department internal review that found no evidence of a "client list" or blackmail scheme, a conclusion that angered many who have called for greater transparency. Committee Chairman James Comer stated the release is part of the Trump administration's commitment to providing the public with more information.</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are increasingly relying on new and customized beverage offerings to attract customers and boost sales. This trend is largely driven by younger consumers, particularly Gen Z, who favor unique, cold, and often sweet drinks. According to market research, beverage-specific purchases are on the rise, with customers visiting chains just for a drink rather than as an add-on to a meal. In response, companies are launching innovative products, from protein-infused cold foams at Starbucks to cereal-flavored lattes at Dunkin', to capitalize on this profitable and growing market segment.</p>

Gallagher also expressed pride in his brother, frontman Liam, praising his vocal performance and noting it has been great to be back in a band with him.

          <p>The back-to-school shopping season is being shaped by elevated import tariffs and budget-conscious consumers, leading to forecasts of slightly lower spending compared to last year. Surveys indicate that families are shopping earlier out of concern that prices will rise, and they are increasingly turning to value-oriented retailers. This environment poses a challenge for many retailers but creates an opportunity for discount and bulk sellers like TJX Companies and Costco, which can attract shoppers looking to stretch their budgets. Major online retailers like Amazon also stand to benefit, as shoppers prioritize deals and the convenience of e-commerce. (not investment advice)</p>

The White House hopes to finalize a date and location within the week, aiming for a meeting in the next two weeks. Trump has indicated that if the bilateral talks are successful, he would then join for a trilateral summit to finalize a peace deal, which could include U.S.-coordinated security guarantees.</p>

          <p>The senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply shortage as the baby boomer generation ages, creating a surge in demand. With over 4 million boomers set to turn 80 in the next five years, occupancy rates are rising rapidly while new inventory growth has fallen to its lowest point since 2006. High interest rates and construction costs are major roadblocks to new development, creating what experts call a massive supply-demand imbalance. This situation has made the sector an attractive investment, with firms like Ventas and Harrison Street investing billions and seeing strong returns due to rising rents and occupancy.

The comments signal a continued thaw in the relationship between the two nuclear-armed powers, which had been tense since a deadly border clash in 2020. Modi is scheduled to visit China at the end of August for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, his first trip to the country in seven years. The diplomatic warming comes as both nations navigate increased trade friction with the United States under President Trump's aggressive tariff policies.</p>
