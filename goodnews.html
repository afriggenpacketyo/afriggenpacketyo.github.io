        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with overall beer sales reaching their lowest point in over 30 years, falling by 6.3% in the first half of 2025. In contrast, sales of non-alcoholic beer have more than doubled since 2013, indicating a growing preference among younger, more health-conscious consumers. Breweries like Erdinger are adapting by promoting alcohol-free options at sporting events as a natural alternative to energy drinks. While full-strength beer remains a strong cultural fixture, particularly at traditional festivals, the trend suggests a conscious move towards moderation.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," a new reality dating show hosted by Davina McCall, blending elements of "Love Island" and "Survivor." Couples meet briefly, are matched by experts, "marry," and then live in basic beach huts on a remote island to test if love can thrive in isolation. Contestants praise the show's authenticity, stripping away superficiality and focusing on genuine connection through shared adversity. The program also features slightly older contestants, reflecting a trend of people settling down later and seeking deeper relationships beyond typical dating app experiences.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are successfully combating the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest that threatens the nation's forests, using an innovative arsenal including drones and sniffer dogs. The beetle, which has ravaged European spruce trees, was found to be arriving in the UK via wind currents, not just imported wood. By deploying drones for aerial surveys and training dogs to detect beetle pheromones and frass, the UK has become the first country to eradicate the Ips typographus from its controlled at-risk areas. This success is crucial as climate change poses increasing risks for future incursions.</p>

In the women's draw, 15th seed Daria Kasatkina was defeated by two-time US Open champion Naomi Osaka in a hard-fought match.

          <p>Florida's "Alligator Alcatraz," a temporary immigration detention center built in the Everglades, is being shut down in compliance with a judge's order, just two months after opening. The facility, which became a symbol of President Trump's immigration policies, faced allegations of inadequate medical care and restricted legal access. Families reported distressing conditions and difficulties locating loved ones within the system. While the Department of Homeland Security disputes claims of mistreatment, the closure is a significant development, though new temporary facilities are being built in other states.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Indonesia's Prabowo Could Offer a New Pragmatic Approach to Global Diplomacy</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece suggests that Indonesia's leader, Prabowo, is uniquely positioned to offer a new, pragmatic roadmap for global diplomacy, moving beyond the current dysfunctional international system. Given Indonesia's extensive relationships and status as an economic powerhouse, it is not bound by a single ideological camp, making its philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" a potential model for cooperation over confrontation. The article argues that the world needs practical action to manage complexity, and middle powers like Indonesia can play a crucial role in shaping a "next world order."</p>

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, as both nations face economic pressures from high US tariffs. Experts suggest this visit could mark a turning point for the two economic powerhouses to reset their relationship, previously strained by border disputes and economic fallout. While a full resolution is unlikely, the leaders may seek "soft wins" like resuming direct flights and relaxing visa restrictions. This move signals a potential shift towards multipolar alliances and a clear message to Washington that India is exploring alternative economic and political partnerships (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Guillermo del Toro's highly anticipated Netflix adaptation of Mary Shelley's "Frankenstein" has debuted at the Venice Film Festival, starring Oscar Isaac as Victor Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi as the creature. Del Toro, known for his monster-humanizing films, has pursued this project for decades, aiming for a grand scale and a nuanced exploration of what it means to be human. The film, which is split into three parts, emphasizes practical effects over CGI and delves into both Frankenstein's motivations and the creature's perspective. Early reviews are mixed but largely acknowledge its ambition and artistic merit.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, marking the end of the Sino-Japanese war, this article explores how remembering shared World War II history could foster better China-US ties. The narrative highlights the forgotten front in China and the unsung heroes, including Chinese villagers who protected American airmen at great risk. This historical perspective suggests that cooperation between the two nations, rooted in a common fight against fascism, could provide a ground-up formula for mending current strained bilateral relations. It emphasizes the potential for diplomacy through shared heritage.</p>

          <p>A hotel in Machynlleth, Powys, had its proposal to silence the town's 150-year-old clock between midnight and 7:00 BST rejected by the town council. The Wynnstay Hotel's co-owner cited regular guest complaints about the quarter-hourly chimes, despite the council recently spending £55,000 on the clock's restoration. Councillors deemed the chimes an integral part of the town's "character," a sentiment echoed by some residents. The hotel, which must wait six months to resubmit its proposal, is now exploring other options, including gathering public opinion, highlighting a local dispute between business needs and historical preservation.</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter's new album, "Man's Best Friend," delves into her dating frustrations, suggesting that superstardom hasn't improved her love life. The album, which follows her chart-topping "Short n' Sweet," features a collection of songs lampooning various "loser" archetypes she encounters. Carpenter, now 26, continues to collaborate with Jack Antonoff and others, crafting a sound that blends '70s pop, country, and dance music. Despite a controversial album cover, the article argues the artist's work cleverly critiques social power structures and the limitations of the modern dating scene.</p>
