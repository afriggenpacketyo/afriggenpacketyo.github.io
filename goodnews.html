          <p>The S&P 500 experienced its largest gain in over a month following indications of de-escalation in the trade war between the U.S. and China. The agreement involves temporarily lowering tariffs, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10%. This development follows a period of market volatility triggered by unexpected tariff announcements. While economists warn of potential economic downturns from trade tensions, this apparent thaw provided clarity and boosted global markets, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index and Europe's Stoxx 600 also rising.
