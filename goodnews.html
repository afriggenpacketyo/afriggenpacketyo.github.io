          <p>The London City Lionesses have agreed to a world-record £1.4 million deal to sign French international midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain, signaling major ambitions for the newly promoted Women's Super League club. The signing is a statement of intent from the team's wealthy American owner, Michele Kang, who has heavily invested in the squad over the summer. Geyoro, a highly-rated midfielder, joins a team that is uniquely structured without affiliation to a men's club, aiming to disrupt the established order of women's football in England.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While tattoos have entered the mainstream, with a third of American adults now having at least one, a lingering social stigma remains. Research indicates that people with tattoos may still face negative assumptions in professional settings, such as being perceived as less trustworthy. Despite this, tattoos are increasingly embraced as a form of personal expression and art, especially among millennials, over 40% of whom are tattooed. Art institutions are also beginning to recognize tattoo artists, reflecting a broader cultural shift in perception.</p>

          <p>Lakeside High School in Georgia's DeKalb County School District is seeing significant positive results from its "Disconnect to Reconnect" program, which bans student cellphone use during the school day. Since implementing the policy, which requires phones to be kept in backpacks, the school has observed improved student engagement and a notable decrease in disciplinary issues. Teachers report that the ban has created a better learning environment by reducing distractions, a sentiment echoed by a growing number of schools and states enacting similar regulations across the country.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have committed to providing post-war security guarantees to Ukraine, which could include an international force on land, sea, and air. The announcement came after a Paris summit where European leaders sought to secure a clear commitment of support from the U.S. under President Trump. Macron stated the 'reassurance force' would not be deployed on the frontline but would aim to prevent future aggression once the conflict ends. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the commitment as a serious and concrete step forward.</p>

          <p>A spokeswoman for former President Joe Biden has confirmed that he recently underwent Mohs surgery for skin cancer, though further details about the procedure were not immediately provided. This follows a 2023 procedure where a cancerous basal cell carcinoma lesion was successfully removed from his chest. Mohs surgery is a precise technique used to remove skin cancer by excising thin layers of tissue until no cancerous cells remain. The confirmation came after recent photos showed Biden with a wound on his head.</p>

          <p>A secret final project by David Bowie, an 18th-century musical titled "The Spectator," has been discovered in notes from his locked New York study. The materials, now part of his archive at the V&A Museum, reveal his deep fascination with the art, satire, and criminal underworld of 1700s London. The project was unknown even to his closest collaborators and shows Bowie's lifelong ambition to write for the theater. These notes offer a final, intimate glimpse into the iconic artist's creative process and wide-ranging intellectual curiosity.</p>

Arora predicts that unless these browsers are designed with enterprise-grade security and credential management, they will face major adoption hurdles in corporate environments within the next two years.</p>

          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the blockbuster trade of star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was a decision based on "mathematics." Jones stated that the substantial salary required to retain Parsons could instead be allocated to pay for several other top-tier players, improving the team's overall depth and reducing the risk of having a large portion of the salary cap tied to one player. The trade made Parsons the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history, a financial commitment Jones felt was better distributed across the roster.</p>

          <p>In response to increasingly frequent and intense heat waves, the Los Angeles City Council is considering a measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at or below 82 degrees. The proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and aims to address a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased hospitalizations and deaths. The move would align cooling requirements with existing state laws that mandate heating capabilities in rental properties.</p>
