          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts plans to grant a preliminary injunction to prevent the Trump administration from restricting Harvard University's ability to enroll international students. Judge Allison Burroughs extended a temporary restraining order that prohibits the administration from acting on its threat, as Harvard sues the Department of Homeland Security. The Trump administration is giving Harvard 30 days to contest its efforts to end foreign student enrollment, requiring the school to provide evidence rebutting the administration's actions. Harvard's president, Alan Garber, addressed the graduates, emphasizing their role as the hope of the institution.</p>

          <p>England midfielder Ella Toone admitted she didn't properly grieve after her father's death until a calf injury sidelined her, forcing her to prioritize her mental well-being. Toone's father passed away shortly before the Women's Super League season began, leading her to play without fully processing her grief and losing her love for the game. The injury allowed her to step away from football, seek counseling, and spend time with her partner, enabling her to grieve and regain her passion for the sport. She realized the importance of mental health and the need to address her grief, which she had previously suppressed.</p>

          <p>As President Trump escalates his conflict with Harvard University, trade schools may emerge as an unexpected beneficiary. Trump has suggested diverting funds from Harvard to support vocational training, reflecting a shifting perspective on alternative career pathways. The rising cost of college and increasing student loan debt have contributed to changing views about higher education. While college enrollment is still climbing, community colleges are seeing larger gains, driven by students choosing shorter-term credentials at a lower cost. Education Secretary Linda McMahon noted a paradigm shift, with more adults looking at two-year or short-term programs.</p>
