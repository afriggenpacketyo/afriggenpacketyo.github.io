          <p>Global pop star Dua Lipa has officially been granted Kosovo citizenship in a ceremony hosted by President Vjosa Osmani. Born in London to Kosovan-Albanian parents, Lipa has been a vocal advocate for the country, where she lived for a period during her childhood. The president hailed her as an iconic cultural figure, and Lipa expressed that the citizenship "completes the duality" she has always felt. This follows her being granted Albanian citizenship in 2022 for promoting the nation through her international fame and philanthropic work.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reported a significant drop in second-quarter profits, largely due to a $3.76 billion writedown on its investment in Kraft Heinz. The conglomerate's operating earnings, a metric Buffett prefers, saw a slight dip to $11.16 billion, as strong performance from its railroad and utility businesses helped offset other challenges. The company is still holding a massive cash reserve of over $344 billion, indicating a continued struggle to find attractively priced acquisition targets. The report also comes as Buffett prepares to step down as CEO at the end of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent study published in Frontiers in Psychology indicates that matching workout styles to personality types can increase enjoyment and adherence to fitness routines. Researchers found that extroverts tend to prefer high-intensity group activities like HIIT or team sports, while conscientious individuals favor goal-oriented exercises such as marathon training. The study suggests that people with higher levels of anxiety may benefit from private, one-on-one sessions, and those who are more open and agreeable enjoy varied and fun options like Zumba or martial arts. This personalized approach could help individuals build more sustainable and effective exercise habits.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the recent passing of actor Malcolm-Jamal Warner, focusing on his nuanced and pivotal role as Theo Huxtable on "The Cosby Show." It argues that Warner skillfully portrayed Theo not just as a slacker punchline, but as a character with complex vulnerability who challenged his father's rigid definition of success. The piece highlights Theo's character arc, from an unmotivated teen to a young adult who finds purpose after a dyslexia diagnosis, as a central and groundbreaking element of the series. Warner's performance is praised for balancing humor with a relatable depiction of adolescent insecurity and growth.</p>

The pieces explore the logistical feats required to deliver mail to places like the bottom of the Grand Canyon and the quiet heroism of postal workers who help communities recover after natural disasters.

          <p>This article reviews Marc Maron's latest HBO Max special, "Panicked," framing it as the culmination of a trilogy of specials dealing with personal and societal anxieties. The piece praises Maron's controlled, narrative style as he confronts topics ranging from his father's dementia to his own childhood trauma with his signature brand of confrontational and ruminative humor. The review notes that while Maron's temperament has softened over the years, his comedy remains a consistent and authentic vehicle for self-reflection. His work is celebrated not for simple entertainment, but for its unflinching emotional vulnerability and excavation of humor from life's muck.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's JFK Airport is progressing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest, is part of a massive $19 billion overhaul of the airport and is designed specifically for international travelers. The new facility will feature light-filled spaces, a streamlined layout with departures and customs on the same level, and its own resilient microgrid for power. Upon full completion in 2030, it will boast 23 gates and over 300,000 square feet of retail and dining space.</p>

          <p>A newly declassified annex from Special Counsel John Durham's report has further weakened claims, championed by National Intelligence Director Tulsi Gabbard, of an Obama-era conspiracy to undermine Donald Trump. The document concludes that incriminating emails, which were central to the "Clinton Plan" intelligence theory, were likely a composite created by Russian intelligence hackers, not a genuine plot by Democrats. This finding complicates the narrative of a "deep state" plot to fabricate the story of Russian interference in the 2016 election. The article notes the irony that the effort to prove a conspiracy has instead reaffirmed the role of Russian espionage.</p>

The win was a powerful response after a narrow loss last week and allowed Australia to avoid a 3-0 series sweep.

This trend is fueled by younger generations' preference for bolder, more adventurous flavors, often amplified through social media platforms like TikTok.

          <p>Unlike global trends of declining religious affiliation, young people in India are engaging with spirituality in new and personalized ways. India's Gen Z is not abandoning religion but rather customizing it, seeking solace and mental well-being from spiritual practices without strictly adhering to traditional rituals. Many use spirituality as a coping mechanism for modern anxieties, accessing it through social media, meditation apps, and travel to spiritual sites. This re-engagement is also occurring within a political climate that actively promotes the country's Hindu heritage, making spirituality a complex mix of personal wellness, cultural identity, and national pride.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has placed limits on the Trump administration's sweeping asylum ban, ruling that it cannot be used to deport migrants to places where they would face torture or persecution. The decision partially upholds a lower court ruling that found the president's proclamation defied U.S. law. While the court allowed the administration to continue denying access to the discretionary asylum system, it affirmed that mandatory protections, such as "withholding of removal," must still be available to migrants. The ruling addresses a key part of the administration's crackdown on illegal immigration at the southern border.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has largely upheld a lower court's restrictions on "roving" immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, agreeing that sweeps based on factors like race or speaking Spanish are unconstitutional. The ruling requires federal agents from ICE and CBP to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, and it prohibits them from basing arrests solely on a broad profile. The case stemmed from controversial raids conducted by the Trump administration in Southern California that led to protests and widespread fear. The decision affirms that the Constitution's 4th Amendment protections apply to such enforcement actions.</p>
