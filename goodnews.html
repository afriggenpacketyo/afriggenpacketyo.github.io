          <p>Shares of Chinese luxury jeweller Laopu Gold jumped 15% to a record high, defying expectations of a sell-off after a one-year lock-up period expired. The end of the lock-up freed 69 million shares, a 40% stake, for pre-listing investors to sell. However, investors eagerly bought the newly available shares, signaling strong confidence in the company's growth prospects and branding power. Since its 2024 debut, Laopu's stock has surged over 1,300%, with analysts pointing to strong same-store growth as a key driver for its success. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's President Xi Jinping has signaled a move to address the intense price wars affecting many of the nation's industries, using the term "disorderly low-price competition." This marks a more direct characterization of the issue, which officials previously referred to more vaguely. The government aims to lawfully regulate this behavior, guide companies toward improving quality, and facilitate the exit of outdated production capacity. Beijing views tackling these price wars as essential for the economy's health, as they are seen to stifle innovation and hinder industrial upgrading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a surprising start to NBA free agency, the Milwaukee Bucks have agreed to a four-year, $107 million deal with longtime Indiana Pacers center Myles Turner. To facilitate the move, the Bucks waived nine-time All-Star Damian Lillard, who is recovering from a ruptured Achilles tendon and will likely miss most or all of the upcoming season. Lillard will now be a free agent, able to sign with any team while continuing his rehabilitation. The moves reshape the rosters of two top Eastern Conference contenders, with Turner joining Giannis Antetokounmpo in Milwaukee.</p>

          <p>A new version of President Trump's major domestic policy bill, passed by the Senate, includes a proposal to increase tax credits for semiconductor manufacturers from 25% to 35%. This measure aims to incentivize companies like Intel and TSMC to build and expand advanced manufacturing facilities within the United States, bolstering the domestic chip supply chain. The move builds on the 2022 CHIPS Act but reflects the Trump administration's broader strategy of using tariffs and tax incentives to onshore critical industries.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The administration had planned to end the program for Haitians in September, years ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge determined that the Homeland Security Secretary lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation before its official expiration date. The ruling is a significant, albeit potentially temporary, victory for migrants who had enrolled in schools and jobs in reliance on the program's continuation. The White House has stated it will appeal the decision.</p>
