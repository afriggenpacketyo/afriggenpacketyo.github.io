          <h2>NATO Leaders Aim for Unity on Increased Defense Spending</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO is expected to approve a collective defense spending increase from 2% to 5% of GDP by 2035, though some members express reservations about meeting the ambitious target. Secretary General Mark Rutte is working to reassure allies of the U.S.'s commitment to NATO, emphasizing that increased spending is necessary given the threat from Russia. Several member states, including Spain and Belgium, seek flexibility on how and when they must raise their defense spending. Despite potential challenges, other heads of state hope for consensus and unity among NATO allies on this critical issue. The need to get serious on defense is paramount amidst growing global security concerns. Optimism surrounding NATO unity remains cautiously optimistic.</p>

          <p>A growing number of Labour MPs are opposing the government's planned welfare changes, which aim to cut disability and sickness-related benefits payments. Over 130 MPs, including 122 Labour MPs, have signed an amendment to reject these plans, despite ministers' efforts to persuade them to back down. Senior cabinet members, including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, have reportedly contacted MPs to convince them to support the government. Defence Secretary John Healey stated that the government aims to create a system that better targets support towards those with the highest needs. The BBC's chief political correspondent noted the sour mood surrounding the issue and potential broader problems for the Labour leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer brings record high temperatures, it's crucial to understand the difference between heat exhaustion and heat stroke, both of which are heat-related illnesses. Heat exhaustion, characterized by headache, fatigue, and heavy sweating, requires immediate removal from the sun, hydration, and rest. Heat stroke, a more severe condition, can lead to impaired consciousness and requires immediate medical attention, including rapid cooling of the body. Preventing these conditions involves avoiding excessive sun exposure, staying hydrated, and wearing appropriate clothing. Being aware of the symptoms and taking prompt action can mitigate the risks associated with extreme heat.</p>

          <p>NATO chief Mark Rutte affirmed that President Donald Trump is "totally committed" to Article 5, the alliance's mutual defense guarantee, despite Trump's initial remarks that cast doubt on his interpretation of the clause. Speaking at the NATO summit in The Hague, Rutte emphasized that there is "absolute clarity" about Trump's position. He also noted the expectation that European and Canadian members will increase their defense spending. The summit is expected to endorse a higher defense spending goal of 5% of GDP, fulfilling a long-standing demand by Trump.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China and India, major thermal coal importers, are decreasing Indonesian shipments in favor of higher-energy-dense grades from other regions. A global price drop has made higher-quality coal more competitive. Indonesian coal is struggling to compete with discounted Russian supplies in China. Mongolian coal in China and South African coal in India have gained market share. Chinese coal imports fell nearly 10% and shipments to India dropped more than 5% in the first five months of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
