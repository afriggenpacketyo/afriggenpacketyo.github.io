          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Senator Chris Van Hollen engaged in a heated exchange during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing. The confrontation arose after Van Hollen criticized the State Department for revoking visas of individuals disrupting college campuses, likening Rubio to Joseph McCarthy. Rubio defended the visa revocations, asserting that visas are a privilege, not a right, for those coming to the U.S. to study. The exchange escalated when Rubio accused Van Hollen of supporting human traffickers, leading to interruptions and demands for substantiation.</p>

This marks a reversal from previous statements where he indicated his America PAC would remain active in future elections. Sources suggest this shift is due to frustrations with Washington and increasing attacks on his companies.</p>

          <p>Despite the rising price of gold, safe investment strategies include limiting gold to a maximum of 10% of an overall portfolio to protect income without hindering other investments. Investors should avoid riskier gold investment types, such as mining stocks, in favor of gold bars, coins, and individual retirement accounts. Monitoring the economic climate and one's portfolio is also crucial to ensure gold's ability to hedge against inflation and to identify potential selling opportunities. (not investment advice)</p>
