          <p>The city of New Orleans is holding a memorial service for the remains of 19 Black residents whose skulls were dismembered and sent to Germany in the late 1800s for now-debunked racist research. The skulls were taken from bodies at a charity hospital and sent to Leipzig University for studies attempting to prove the inferiority of Black people. After years of repatriation efforts, the skulls have been returned to New Orleans and will be laid to rest, allowing the city to confront a dark chapter in its history. The memorial service aims to restore dignity to the deceased and celebrate their humanity, providing closure for the community.</p>
