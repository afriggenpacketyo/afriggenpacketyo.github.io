          <p>The Brit School in Croydon has been awarded government funding to address poor building conditions, including a ceiling collapse that forced the closure of a classroom and changing rooms. The funding will support the replacement of the main building roof and fire safety works, addressing repair challenges in the school's five buildings dating from 1909 to 2012. The Condition Improvement Fund (CIF) supports urgent repair and maintenance work in smaller academy trusts and voluntary-aided schools. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson emphasized that this investment demonstrates the importance of children's education and futures.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to develop its domestic rare earth supplies amid China's restrictions on rare earth exports, which have caused shortages affecting various industries. Indian officials are considering leveraging India Rare Earths to increase rare earth magnet production, with Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal calling China's export pause a "wake-up call" for the world. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative to China for partners like the U.S., but it will require increased public and private investment. China currently dominates the rare earth elements market, producing approximately 60% of the world's supply and processing nearly 90%.</p>

          <p>Shakira's Las Mujeres Ya No Lloran tour, inspired by personal heartbreak and upheaval, has grossed over $150 million in ticket sales across North and South America. The show is a non-stop parade of bilingual hits, 13 costume changes, and intense movement, featuring elements like a Lebanese-inspired belly dance and a tribal knife routine. Shakira reflects on her experiences as an immigrant in the U.S., contrasting her acceptance with the Trump administration's policies, and emphasizes the need for humane treatment of all people. The emotional high point of the show comes during Acr√≥stico, a ballad Shakira wrote for her children, who appear on video screens duetting with their mother.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An expert from the World Gold Council stated that cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin and stablecoins, do not pose a threat to gold's role as a safe-haven investment. John Reade, the senior market strategist, argued that cryptocurrencies tend to move with equities, unlike gold, which acts as a hedge during market volatility. He emphasized that digital assets do not present any risks or comparison to gold, dismissing the notion of them being "gold 2.0." His comments come amid growing market interest in stablecoins and other digital currencies alongside a fresh rally in gold prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The average age of mothers giving birth in the U.S. has climbed to nearly 30 years old in 2023, according to a new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This increase is attributed to various factors, including changes in social expectations, advancements in fertility technology, and the rising cost of raising children. The report also noted a continuing decline in teen pregnancies, which could be due to adolescents delaying sexual activity or changes in contraceptive practices. The report highlights shifting trends in family planning and societal values.</p>

          <p>Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang announced his departure for Meta, confirming reports of a $14.3 billion investment from the social networking company. Meta will have a 49% stake in the AI startup but no voting power, while Jason Droege will take over as CEO of Scale AI. Wang's move fits into Mark Zuckerberg's plans to bolster Meta's AI efforts amid competition from OpenAI and Google, with Zuckerberg making AI his company's top priority. Meta's investment and hiring of Wang will not impact Scale AI's customers, and Meta will not have access to its business information or data.</p>
