          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to rise in premarket trading. The company's net income saw a significant boost from the sale of its Hulu stake to Disney, though it also experienced a loss of 226,000 broadband customers. This decline in broadband is an ongoing industry challenge, which Comcast is attempting to counter by pivoting its market strategy and focusing on growth in its mobile division, which added a record 378,000 new lines.

          <p>The Seattle Mariners have reportedly agreed to a trade with the Arizona Diamondbacks to bring back slugging third baseman Eugenio Suárez. The move is intended to bolster the Mariners' lineup as they make a push for a wildcard spot in the American League playoffs. Suárez, a two-time All-Star, has hit 36 home runs this season and previously played for Seattle in 2022 and 2023. In return, the Diamondbacks, who appear to be sellers at the trade deadline, will receive several prospects.</p>

          <p>A cultural phenomenon has emerged around Labubu dolls, vinyl figures from the Chinese company Pop Mart that have a distinctive "cute-ugly" aesthetic with large eyes and jagged teeth. The toys are sold in limited-time online drops, creating a frenzied market where collectors compete to purchase them at retail price to avoid significant markups on resale sites. This article explores the psychology behind the craze, attributing its success to manufactured scarcity, the thrill of the chase, and a polarizing design that creates a dedicated in-group of fans. </p>

          <p>A scientific expedition in the northwest Pacific Ocean has discovered the deepest known life habitat on Earth, a thriving oasis of tubeworms and molluscs at depths of up to 9,500 meters. These communities exist in total darkness and obtain energy not from sunlight but through chemosynthesis, feeding on chemicals like methane seeping from tectonic plates. Published in the journal Nature, the findings challenge current understanding of life at extreme limits and suggest such ecosystems may be more widespread in deep-sea trenches than previously thought.</p>
