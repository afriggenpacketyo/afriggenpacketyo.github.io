          <p>Bitcoin's price reached a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The rally was also fueled by a wave of short liquidations and investor expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve policy. This week's performance marks a nearly 10% gain for the cryptocurrency, its best since late April. Analysts suggest that a major macroeconomic event would be needed to suppress the current upward trend. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering new ways to segment its premium cabins, such as business class, following a model similar to the one used for its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that revenue from premium seats has been a key area of growth and that the company is focused on providing more tailored options for these customers. While specific changes were not detailed, possibilities could include different fare tiers within business class, potentially offering varied levels of perks like lounge access. This strategy aims to cater to diverse customer needs and further boost high-margin revenue.</p>

          <p>The U.S. government recorded a rare budget surplus of $27 billion in June, largely due to a surge in revenue from customs duties. This unexpected surplus contrasts with the year's trend of swelling deficits, which now stands at $1.34 trillion for the fiscal year to date. Tariff collections for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, reflecting the across-the-board tariffs levied by the Trump administration. Despite the monthly surplus, persistent high interest payments on the national debt remain a significant financial challenge for the government. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Three Potential Ways for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>

          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors may be seeking alternative income streams to supplement their retirement funds. This article explores three potential options for homeowners aged 62 and older to generate additional cash flow. These include reverse mortgages, which provide payments from home equity, and annuities, which offer guaranteed lifetime income in exchange for a lump-sum investment. A personal loan is also presented as a less favorable but viable option to cover financial gaps. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Fastest Methods for Obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit This July</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:22:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners looking to quickly tap into their home equity, several strategies can accelerate the process of obtaining a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC). Applying with a fully online lender, which uses digital platforms for verification and appraisals, can reduce approval times to a matter of days. Homeowners might also consider low-documentation HELOCs, which minimize paperwork, or applying with their existing mortgage lender, who already has their financial information on file. While these methods offer speed, they may come with tradeoffs like higher rates or more conservative credit limits. (not investment advice)</p>
