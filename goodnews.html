          <p>Republicans in Congress are considering legislation that could cut billions from the Affordable Care Act (ACA), potentially affecting millions of Americans. A KFF poll reveals that 45% of adults enrolled in ACA marketplace plans identify as Republicans, with a significant portion identifying as "MAGA" Republicans. The proposed cuts could lead to 15 million people losing health insurance if tax credits are not extended. This situation arises as many self-employed individuals and those in states that did not expand Medicaid rely on ACA plans for coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

The program aims to provide American children with a strong start in life at no cost to taxpayers.

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni alleged civil extortion and defamation after Lively accused him of sexual harassment and retaliation, accusations he denies. A similar lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete victory, while The New York Times expressed gratitude for the court's protection of honest reporting. Baldoni can amend claims related to Lively allegedly breaching her contract by June 23.</p>

          <p>The article explores home elevation as a strategy to mitigate increasing flood risks due to climate change. It highlights the experience of a New Jersey homeowner whose house survived Superstorm Sandy because it was elevated. While elevation can protect homes, it is expensive and requires community-wide efforts to protect infrastructure. The article also discusses the challenges of funding and the potential for gentrification due to the high cost of elevation.</p>

          <p>The race for global supremacy in AI has led to record venture investment in startups, with the top five companies on this year's Disruptor 50 list having a combined valuation of just under $500 billion. Consumer and business use of artificial intelligence rapidly grows, and more companies are using their cash to become aggressive acquirers, as they exponentially scale their generative AI business models. Twenty of this year's 50 companies have made the list for the first time, while another 19 were first-timers in either 2023 or 2024.</p>

          <h2>Keir Starmer Denies Bowing to Political Pressure on Winter Fuel Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 08:46:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer denied that his government's reversal on winter fuel payments was due to political pressure, claiming it was possible because of an improved economy. The government had initially withdrawn the payments from most pensioners but expanded eligibility following criticism. Starmer stated that difficult decisions were necessary to fix the UK's finances, and better-than-expected growth allowed for the change. However, critics argue that the move creates new complexity and that any savings would be offset by administrative costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has blocked the Trump administration from enforcing anti-diversity and anti-transgender executive orders in grant funding requirements. The ruling prevents the government from forcing recipients to halt programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) or acknowledge the existence of transgender people in order to receive grant funding. The judge stated that the executive branch cannot weaponize congressionally appropriated funds to suppress ideas it dislikes. The plaintiffs include health centers, LGBTQ+ services groups, and the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Historical Society.</p>
