          <p>Robinhood has launched tokenized shares of private firms OpenAI and SpaceX for its European Union customers, marking a significant expansion of its crypto services. This move, which makes equity in unlisted companies accessible to a broader audience, is facilitated by the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. The announcement caused Robinhood's stock to surge to an all-time high, although similar offerings are not expected in the U.S. soon due to stricter regulations. The company is also giving away tokens to new EU users to promote the launch.</p>

          <p>Two-time defending Wimbledon champion Carlos Alcaraz secured his place in the second round after a challenging five-set victory over Italian veteran Fabio Fognini. The match, played in sweltering heat on Centre Court, was briefly paused in the final set due to a spectator falling ill. Despite struggling with his serve and making uncharacteristic errors, the 22-year-old Spaniard extended his winning streak to 19 matches. Alcaraz will next face British qualifier Oliver Tarvet in his quest for a third consecutive Wimbledon title.</p>

          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in her home in 1967, solving one of the United Kingdom's longest-running cold cases. The case was cracked after 58 years when new forensic testing of DNA found on the victim's skirt linked Headley to the crime. Investigators also matched a palm print from the scene to Headley, whose DNA was added to a national database in 2012 for an unrelated incident. He will be sentenced on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has postponed by one month a plan to cut off access to a key satellite data program used by forecasters for hurricane prediction. The decision to suspend access to the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) data had alarmed scientists, who warned it could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced the delay after a request from NASA. The administration has cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the planned decommissioning of the data ingest system.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo are being seen as the biggest beneficiaries of the Federal Reserve's 2025 bank stress tests, according to Wall Street analysts. Both banks saw their required stress capital buffers‚Äîan emergency fund mandated by regulators‚Äîlowered more significantly than their peers. This easing of capital requirements, a sign of a more relaxed regulatory environment, could free up billions in capital. It paves the way for the banks to potentially increase shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks, as well as pursue more loan growth. (not investment advice)</p>
