          <p>The United Kingdom and France have agreed to a new pilot scheme to address illegal Channel crossings, which will see the UK return some migrants who arrive in small boats back to France. In exchange, the UK will accept an equivalent number of vetted asylum seekers from France, a "one in, one out" system. Prime Minister Keir Starmer and President Emmanuel Macron announced the plan, aiming to disrupt the business model of people smugglers. The deal also includes enhanced cooperation on nuclear deterrents and AI technology.</p>

          <p>Tesla has officially applied to operate its Robotaxi service in Phoenix, Arizona, aiming to compete with Waymo, which already has a significant driverless taxi presence in the city. The application covers testing and deployment with and without human safety drivers, with a decision expected by the end of July. This expansion follows a pilot program in Austin, Texas, which has faced some operational issues and regulatory scrutiny. Tesla's move into the Phoenix market signifies its continued push to scale its autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security's decision to end the mandatory removal of shoes at airport security checkpoints is framed in this article as a form of "populism theater." The author argues that the original policy, in place for over two decades since the Richard Reid "shoe bomber" attempt, was itself "security theater." The analysis suggests the reversal isn't based on new technology or intelligence but is a political move to give people a desired convenience, similar to how paid services like TSA PreCheck created a tiered system for travelers.</p>
