          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is expected to miss about six weeks with a bone bruise in his left knee, a less severe diagnosis than initially feared. Despite Muncy being a key offensive player, the team's management has indicated this injury will not alter their trade deadline plans. The Dodgers intend to rely on internal options like Tommy Edman to cover third base in the interim. The front office remains confident that Muncy will have sufficient time to return to form before the playoffs begin.</p>

          <p>Several beaches in the Far Rockaway area of Queens, New York City, were temporarily closed on the Fourth of July after multiple shark sightings occurred dangerously close to swimmers. Officials utilized drone technology to monitor the sharks' movements and ensure public safety, reopening the beaches after about an hour. New York Governor Kathy Hochul had previously announced enhanced shark surveillance measures for the holiday weekend across the state's beaches. The incidents highlight the increased use of technology to manage wildlife encounters and protect beachgoers during peak seasons.</p>

          <p>South Korea's new presidential administration is planning to revitalize its shipbuilding industry, which it describes as being in a "major crisis," as the US targets China's dominance in the sector. The government has outlined a policy guide focused on developing advanced, eco-friendly, and autonomous vessels through improved technology and better working conditions. This strategic push by South Korea, along with similar efforts in Japan, represents a move to reclaim market share and position themselves as leaders in next-generation ship manufacturing. The focus is on innovation and digitalization to compete globally.</p>

          <h2>Tiny Zooplankton Play Major Role in Carbon Sequestration, New Research Reveals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 19:10:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research highlights the crucial role of tiny marine animals called zooplankton in mitigating global warming through a process of seasonal migration. These creatures feast on carbon-rich phytoplankton at the ocean's surface in Antarctica, grow fat, and then sink deep into the ocean to burn this fat, effectively locking away vast amounts of carbon. Scientists estimate this process sequesters as much carbon as the annual emissions of 55 million cars, a far greater amount than previously understood. The findings underscore the importance of these overlooked organisms in regulating the planet's climate, even as they face growing threats.</p>

          <p>This article details the surprising story of Bishara Bahbah, a US-based economics professor who has become a key backchannel negotiator between Hamas and the Trump administration. After receiving an unsolicited call from a senior Hamas official in April, Dr. Bahbah has been working from Qatar to facilitate talks for a permanent ceasefire and hostage release. Leveraging connections made as president of "Arab-Americans for Trump," he helped build trust that contributed to the release of Israeli-American hostage Edan Alexander. His involvement showcases an unconventional diplomatic effort operating outside of official government channels to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>A pair of male Humboldt penguins, named Scampi and Flounder, are raising a chick at the Chester Zoo in the U.K. during a particularly successful breeding season. Zoo experts entrusted the pair with one of two eggs laid by another penguin couple to increase the chances of both chicks surviving. Same-sex pairings are not uncommon among penguins, and the new fathers are sharing parenting duties, including feeding the chick regurgitated fish. The event highlights the zoo's successful conservation program for the vulnerable Humboldt penguin species, with the colony now numbering 63.</p>

          <p>Germany started their Women's Euro 2025 campaign with a 2-0 victory against Poland, thanks to goals from Jule Brand and Lea Schüller. While the win was deserved, the team's performance was marred by an injury to captain Giulia Gwinn, who left the pitch in tears after a knee injury in the first half. Given her history of two previous ACL injuries, her availability for the rest of the tournament is in serious doubt. The victory provides a solid start for the eight-time champions, but the potential loss of their captain casts a significant shadow over their prospects.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist with over two decades of experience treating heart disease has shared a list of five "toxic" food types he avoids giving his own children. The list includes microwave popcorn due to chemicals in the lining, flavored yogurts for their high sugar content, and processed meats like hot dogs because of preservatives. He also advises against sugary cereals and drinks, as well as deep-fried foods, which can promote inflammation and poor metabolic health. The doctor advocates for alternatives like air-popped popcorn, plain yogurt with fruit, and unprocessed proteins to establish healthy eating habits from childhood.</p>
