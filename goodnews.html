          <p>Veteran actress Dyan Cannon, 88, was recently denied entry to the White House after Secret Service discovered she had lied about her age on her passport years ago. The incident was documented in a lighthearted social media video by her friends, who were with her for a planned tour. Cannon, known for her roles in films like "Heaven Can Wait," laughed off the situation and later reposted the video, stating she would do it again because age is just a number. The actress was in Washington, D.C., with co-hosts of her new podcast, "God's Table."</p>

          <p>Pop star Sabrina Carpenter has released her new album, "Man's Best Friend," which explores the frustrations of dating despite achieving superstardom. Following her successful 2024 album "Short n' Sweet," this new work finds the 26-year-old singer lampooning incompetent and emotionally unavailable men through a blend of 70s-era pop, disco, and country sounds. The album, created with producer Jack Antonoff, uses witty and sometimes provocative lyrics to comment on the social power dynamics of modern relationships. The article notes that while not every song is as sharp as her previous work, the album showcases her versatile vocal performance and clever songwriting.</p>

          <h2>Experts Offer Guidance on Safe Screen Time Limits for Children's Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Medical and psychological experts are providing consolidated advice on managing screen time for children, emphasizing that less is generally better, especially in early development. The consensus suggests a "screen-free until age three" approach, as toddlers need to explore the physical world to develop motor skills and attention control. For older children, the concern is that screen time displaces crucial social interaction and language development. While acknowledging the social necessity of digital platforms for adolescents, experts recommend that parents stay engaged with their children's online activities and prioritize real-world experiences and interactions over passive consumption.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump was seen in public for the first time since rumors of his death trended on social media, effectively dispelling the online hoax. The 79-year-old was photographed at the White House preparing for a family golf outing in Virginia. The speculation was fueled by recent comments from Vice President J.D. Vance about being prepared to step in should a "terrible tragedy" occur. Concerns about Trump's health have been a recurring topic, with recent attention drawn to bruising on his hand and a diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, though his physician maintains he is in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have officially declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been identified in three weeks. The outbreak resulted in 114 confirmed cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. An investigation traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at the city-run Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, both of which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling tower systems.</p>

          <p>Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports, recently stated that after a decade of work to earn his first million dollars, he has reached a point where he can now make as much as $5 million in a single week. Speaking on a podcast, Portnoy described a breakthrough moment after which earning money became significantly easier, illustrating the principle of compound growth. This comes after he repurchased Barstool from Penn Entertainment for $1, allowing him to regain control and secure new content deals, such as a recent partnership with Fox Sports for its college football coverage.

          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—within seconds. A UK-based research team found the device, which analyzes subtle heart sounds undetectable by the human ear and records an ECG, significantly improved detection rates in a trial involving over 12,000 patients at GP surgeries. Researchers believe the technology could be a "real game-changer," enabling earlier diagnosis and treatment for patients. Following the successful study, there are plans to roll out the AI stethoscopes to more practices across the UK.</p>
