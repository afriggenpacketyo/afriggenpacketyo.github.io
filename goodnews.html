The storm, spurred by a coronal mass ejection, may disrupt power systems, satellite operations, and radio communications. Despite the weakening of the coronal mass ejection, elevated solar wind conditions could still produce a significant cosmic event. The northern lights are best viewed in dark settings late at night or early in the morning.</p>

          <p>Former President Bill Clinton has strongly defended Joe Biden's cognitive health, dismissing claims of decline during an interview. Clinton stated that Biden was "on top" of things and that he never witnessed any signs of cognitive impairment. He also criticized those who blame Biden for Trump's reelection, suggesting that some are using the former president's health as a scapegoat. Clinton's remarks aim to counter concerns about Biden's fitness for office and highlight his positive view of Biden's presidency.</p>
