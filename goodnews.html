          <p>Zscaler's stock experienced a significant jump after the company released its third-quarter fiscal results, which exceeded expectations due to growth in artificial intelligence and the adoption of its zero-trust security platform. CEO Jay Chaudhry noted the increasing demand for AI security as businesses integrate AI into their operations, leading to increased investments in this area. The company's revenue grew by 23% to $678 million, surpassing estimates, with adjusted earnings per share also exceeding expectations. These results offer a positive outlook for the cybersecurity industry amidst a volatile macroeconomic environment, though this is (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>England's women's cricket team achieved a 108-run victory against the West Indies, highlighted by centuries from Amy Jones and Tammy Beaumont. The clear gameplan focused on preserving wickets early and accelerating in the final overs, which proved successful against an unthreatening West Indies attack. Jones and Beaumont's opening stand was the highest partnership for any wicket against the West Indies in this format, setting the stage for Sciver-Brunt's explosive performance. This victory demonstrates England's ability to execute a strategic approach as they prepare for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Tesla shares experienced a rally in May, gaining over 22%, despite recent reports of poor car sales numbers in China and Europe. This increase coincides with Elon Musk's transition from his role as a "special government employee" in the Trump administration, signaling a renewed focus on his businesses. Musk indicated that his time spent running DOGE would decrease significantly, though he plans to continue advising the president, maintaining his office at the White House.

          <p>Anthony Weiner asserted that female politicians like Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton are judged more harshly than men, contributing to their electoral losses, while politicians like himself and Donald Trump can survive scandals. Weiner, amidst his run for a New York City council seat, addressed his past sexting scandals and claimed to be in recovery. He argued that while he and others have paid a price for their actions, women face disproportionate scrutiny. Weiner's past scandals, including a sexting incident with a minor, led to his imprisonment and impacted Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
