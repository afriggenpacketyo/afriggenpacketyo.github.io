          <p>United Launch Alliance has successfully launched its new Vulcan rocket on its first operational mission for the U.S. Space Force, deploying two military satellites into geosynchronous orbit. The launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida, marks a significant milestone, as the Vulcan is set to replace ULA's legacy Atlas and Delta rockets, moving away from Russian-made engines. One of the payloads is an experimental satellite, NTS-3, designed to test advanced navigation technology for more accurate and jam-proof GPS data. The successful flight certifies the Vulcan for future high-value national security missions.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government has introduced a one-year plan to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support domestic demand. According to the plan, the government will cover one percentage point of the annual interest on qualifying loans for purchases like cars and education. The central government will fund 90% of the subsidy, with provincial governments covering the rest. This initiative is part of a larger policy push by Beijing to unlock consumer spending potential amid economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

Antonio recounts the total loss of their property and possessions but highlights his father's strength in the aftermath as a source of inspiration.

          <p>AI startup Perplexity has made an unsolicited $34.5 billion offer to purchase Google's Chrome web browser, a move that comes as Google faces a potential court-ordered divestiture of the browser following an antitrust ruling. Perplexity, known for its AI-powered search engine, recently launched its own browser and stated that several investors have agreed to back the deal. The bid is seen as an ambitious step in the competitive AI landscape, although Google has not indicated any plans to sell Chrome and has previously called the idea of a forced sale a "radical interventionist agenda."</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles DWP Lifts Boil Water Advisory for West San Fernando Valley Neighborhoods</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power (DWP) has lifted a weeklong "boil water" notice for approximately 9,200 households in the Granada Hills and Porter Ranch areas. The advisory was issued after a faulty, decades-old valve became stuck, severely impeding water flow to the communities. After resuming normal water flow, the DWP confirmed the water is now safe to drink but urged residents to flush all pipes and appliances to clear out any stagnant water or sediment. Affected customers will receive a $20 credit on their bills for the inconvenience.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has officially acknowledged that France used "repressive violence" in Cameroon during the West African nation's struggle for independence in the 1950s. In a letter to his Cameroonian counterpart, Macron accepted France's role and responsibility for actions that cost "tens of thousands of lives," including forced displacement and support for brutal militias. This admission follows a 2022 report commissioned by France that detailed the extent of the violence, which continued even after Cameroon's independence in 1960, and is part of Macron's broader effort to confront France's colonial history.</p>

          <p>In a significant act of cross-border cooperation, Mexico has extradited 26 inmates, described as key operatives of powerful drug cartels, to the United States to face charges. The group includes members of the notorious Jalisco New Generation (CJNG) and Sinaloa cartels, who are wanted in the U.S. for violent offenses and organized crime. This is the second major transfer of its kind this year, coming as the White House continues to pressure Mexico to intensify its crackdown on drug trafficking. The move is seen as proof of ongoing collaboration on security issues between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>UK Police Given New Guidance to Release Suspects' Nationality and Ethnicity in High-Profile Cases</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 19:08:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's National Police Chiefs' Council has issued new guidance encouraging police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects in sensitive and high-profile investigations. The policy change aims to combat misinformation and speculation that can arise in such cases, as seen following the 2024 Southport riots. While the decision to release such information will remain with individual forces, the move is intended to bring more consistency and transparency to police communications. The Home Office welcomed the guidance, stating that public trust requires transparency from authorities.</p>
