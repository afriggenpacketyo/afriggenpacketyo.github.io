          <p>Amazon has agreed to a $2.5 billion settlement with the Federal Trade Commission to resolve allegations of deceptive practices related to its Prime membership program. The FTC claimed the company misled millions of consumers into signing up and intentionally complicated the cancellation process. The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and allocates $1.5 billion for customer refunds, marking a significant enforcement action by the regulatory agency. Amazon admitted no wrongdoing but will be required to make its enrollment and cancellation processes more transparent.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt and interest rates remaining high, many Americans are considering debt relief options. Financial experts suggest that waiting for the Federal Reserve's rate cuts to lower credit card APRs is likely an ineffective strategy, as card issuers rarely pass on such savings to consumers. Instead, borrowers are encouraged to explore proactive solutions like debt consolidation, balance transfers, or formal debt management plans. Acting sooner can prevent interest from compounding daily and help individuals regain control of their finances more effectively. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers analyzing a million-year-old human skull, named Yunxian 2, discovered in China, propose that it could push back the emergence of our species, Homo sapiens, by half a million years. The skull is now believed to be an early form of Homo longi, a sister species to Homo sapiens and Neanderthals. This suggests that early versions of all three species may have co-existed far earlier than previously understood, potentially rewriting a key chapter of human evolutionary history. While the claim is significant, other experts urge caution, stating more evidence is needed to confirm the new timeline.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign off on a deal that would allow TikTok to continue operating in the United States under a new structure. The agreement involves creating a new US-based joint venture with Oracle as a key investor, while parent company ByteDance would retain a minority stake. Under the plan, Oracle will host American user data and review the app's code and algorithm to address national security concerns. The deal is structured as a "qualified divestiture" to comply with a bipartisan law requiring ByteDance to sever ties with its US operations.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is ending its 85-year practice of issuing paper checks, with all payments transitioning to electronic methods like direct deposit or prepaid debit cards starting September 30th. The agency states the move will improve efficiency, enhance security, and reduce costs, noting that electronic payments are significantly less likely to be lost or stolen. While the shift is mandatory for most of the nearly 70 million recipients, exceptions will be made for individuals who have no other way to receive their benefits. The transition follows a presidential executive order mandating the digitization of all federal payments.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, President Donald Trump urged Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to cease buying oil from Russia to help cut off Moscow's energy funding amid the war in Ukraine. The discussion took place as Erdogan seeks to persuade the U.S. to lift sanctions and approve the sale of F-35 fighter jets to Turkey. The U.S. expelled Turkey from the F-35 program in 2019 after it acquired a Russian S-400 missile defense system. Trump expressed optimism that a deal could be reached on both the sanctions and the fighter jets.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has endorsed buying Starbucks stock, viewing the company's plan to close stores and lay off corporate staff as a "very bullish" and necessary step. He argues that CEO Brian Niccol's strategy to eliminate underperforming locations and reinvest in successful ones is a sound approach to turning around same-store sales. The restructuring, part of a $1 billion plan to boost profitability, aims to address declining sales and operating margins that have lagged since before the pandemic. Cramer expressed confidence in Niccol's ability to restore the company's financial health. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Outline Considerations for Purchasing Long-Term Care Insurance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 13:15:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the costs of senior care rising faster than inflation, financial planners are advising individuals to consider long-term care insurance to protect their retirement savings. Experts point out that Medicare offers very limited coverage for long-term needs, primarily covering short-term skilled nursing after a hospital stay, not the custodial care most seniors require. Since eligibility for long-term care insurance is based on health, it becomes more difficult and expensive to obtain as one ages. Therefore, securing a policy while still in good health can be a crucial step in financial planning for later life. (not investment advice)</p>
