          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, the lowest annual increase in five years, according to analysts. This adjustment, which helps beneficiaries cope with inflation, may change based on upcoming inflation data. The COLA is calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year using the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The CPI-W has increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-13 15:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's recent imposition of large tariffs on global goods coincided with a slowdown in inflation, raising questions about the expected economic impact. While tariffs typically increase consumer prices, the article suggests that US companies may have stocked up on foreign goods earlier in the year, allowing them to maintain low prices by using existing inventories. However, experts predict that prices will eventually rise as companies exhaust these pre-tariff inventories. The article also notes that Trump's partial retreat from tariffs on China has reduced the risk of a severe economic crisis.</p>

          <p>The PGA of America has voiced strong opposition to the proposed rollback of the golf ball, joining the PGA Tour in disagreeing with the R&A and USGA's plan to modify golf balls for professional use starting in 2028. The PGA of America is concerned about the impact on recreational golfers and is requesting a delay to reassess research numbers. The organization suggests exploring modifications to drivers instead of golf balls. This dispute adds to the existing divisions in the golf world, already strained by the emergence of the Saudi-backed LIV tour.</p>
