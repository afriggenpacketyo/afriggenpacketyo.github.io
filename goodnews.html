          <p>Japanese markets experienced a significant rally following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's announcement that he will resign. The Nikkei 225 index rose 1.5%, and the Topix index reached a record high, as investors reacted to the political shift. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and government bond yields continued to climb amid persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts predict a period of extended political ambiguity for Japan heading into the final quarter of 2025 as the ruling party prepares to select a new leader. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title by defeating Jannik Sinner in a four-set match. The final was delayed due to enhanced security measures for President Donald Trump, who attended the event and sat in Rolex's luxury box, drawing a mixed reaction from the crowd. Many ticket holders were still in long lines outside the stadium when the match began. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly asked broadcasters to avoid showing off-court disruptions, though videos of the crowd's reaction to the president circulated on social media.</p>

          <p>In his debut with the Green Bay Packers, star edge rusher Micah Parsons recorded his first sack, contributing to a 27-13 victory over the Detroit Lions. The play at Lambeau Field prompted a reaction of disbelief from his former Dallas Cowboys teammate, Trevon Diggs, who posted on social media, "This can’t be real." Parsons was traded from the Cowboys in a bombshell move and subsequently signed a four-year, $188 million contract extension with Green Bay. The Packers' defense was dominant, sacking Lions quarterback Jared Goff four times during the game.</p>

          <p>A 29-year-old woman in Lowestoft, Suffolk, experienced a cryptic pregnancy, giving birth to a baby boy in a football club's toilet without any prior knowledge that she was expecting. Charlotte Robinson said she felt no fetal movement and attributed her hip pain to a pre-existing condition from her first child. The surprise arrival happened after a match attended by 600 people, where she felt a sudden urge to push while in a cubicle. Experts note that such cryptic pregnancies, where the mother is unaware of the baby, occur in about one in 2,500 births.</p>

          <p>Despite concerns over a back injury that sidelined him for most of the preseason, quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Los Angeles Rams to a 14-9 victory over the Houston Texans. Stafford passed for 245 yards and a touchdown, becoming the 10th quarterback in NFL history to surpass 60,000 career passing yards. The Rams' defense sealed the win in the final minutes when linebacker Nate Landman forced a fumble that was recovered by Braden Fiske. The performance marked a successful start for the Rams and ninth-year coach Sean McVay, who improved his record in season openers to 7-2.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of couples are choosing to live apart while remaining happily married, a lifestyle known as "living apart together" (LAT). One woman, Margaret, has lived in London for 15 years while her husband resides in Australia, a decision she made to pursue a new career after her children left home. While unconventional, this arrangement allows partners to pursue individual goals and maintain independence, which some, including high-profile couples, believe keeps the relationship fresh. Experts suggest that while not for everyone, it can provide valuable personal space and help maintain a strong sense of individual identity within a marriage.</p>

The merry-go-round, which famously inspired Walt Disney to create Disneyland, has been closed since 2022 following the death of its operator and legal disputes over its ownership. Built in 1926, the carousel is one of the oldest wooden merry-go-rounds in California and features horses carved by famed artist Charles Looff. The city plans to undertake significant repairs before reopening the attraction as part of a broader park restoration project.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, redirecting capital toward Asia to capitalize on the region's burgeoning artificial intelligence sector. According to Bank of America research, this shift is fueled by a weakening U.S. dollar and expectations of looser Federal Reserve monetary policy in 2025-2026. While U.S. stocks attracted $1.2 trillion from 2020 to 2024, inflows have slowed this year, with investors now seeing better valuations and opportunities in Asian markets. The global AI market is projected to quadruple to $1.2 trillion by 2030, with a significant portion deployed in the Asia-Pacific region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, as well as parts of Europe and Africa, were treated to a total lunar eclipse on Sunday, resulting in a phenomenon known as a "Blood Moon." This event occurs when the Earth passes directly between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that gives the lunar surface a distinct reddish hue. The color is caused by sunlight scattering through the Earth's atmosphere, which filters out blue light and allows red light to pass through and reflect off the moon. The eclipse was most visible in Asia, including India and China, while observers in the Americas missed the event.</p>

          <p>Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, asserts that globalisation is not dead but is instead becoming more regional and centered in Asia. He argues that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. In an interview, Goldin noted that while the U.S. appears to be withdrawing from certain aspects of global integration, Asia continues to thrive. He also emphasized that the benefits of globalisation are accompanied by growing risks, such as pandemics, which are also global in nature.</p>

The city's unique status under "one country, two systems" allows it to host events, like a recent Bitcoin conference featuring Eric Trump, that would be impossible on the mainland. To capitalize on this momentum, the author suggests Beijing should encourage more foreign dignitaries to visit and support the city as a base for international institutions.
