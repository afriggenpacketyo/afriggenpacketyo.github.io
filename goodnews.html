          <p>Comcast has announced that the new corporate name for the spinoff of its NBCUniversal cable network portfolio will be Versant. CEO Mark Lazarus stated that the name reflects the company's versatility and expertise across various subjects. Versant will encompass cable networks like USA, CNBC, MSNBC, and digital assets such as Fandango and Rotten Tomatoes. The company will focus on individual brand development rather than promoting the corporate name, and is expected to be spun off from Comcast before the end of 2025, potentially returning money to shareholders via dividends.

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, celebrating the Black dandy, saw women creatively interpreting the theme by exaggerating and twisting masculine fashion norms. Attendees like Zendaya and Doechii showcased elegant tailoring and bold, monogrammed suits, while others donned wide-shouldered suits reminiscent of church attire. Hats, like those worn by Whoopi Goldberg and Janelle Mon√°e, added to the subversive reappropriation of masculine symbols.

          <p>President Trump criticized the Obama Presidential Center in Chicago during a meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, calling it "a disaster" and blaming "woke" construction workers. Trump claimed the project is over budget due to a focus on DEI and politically correct hiring practices. The Obama Foundation refuted Trump's claims, stating that construction is progressing with union labor and that the center is expected to open in 2026. The center's website details the various components of the complex, including a museum, library, and athletic facilities.</p>

          <p>Debt collectors are not legally required to accept settlement offers, but a rejection does not necessarily mean the end of negotiations. Debt collectors may refuse offers that are too low, when the debt is fresh, or if they believe the debtor can pay more. To improve chances of settling, it is important to do homework, offer proof of hardship, and consider working with a debt relief expert. This article provides actionable advice for managing and potentially reducing collection debt. (not investment advice)</p>
