          <h2>China's Panda Diplomacy Faces Potential Pause in Japan Amidst Sino-U.S. Rivalry</h2>

          <p>China's "panda diplomacy" is gaining attention as Japan faces its first period without giant pandas in over half a century. With Sino-U.S. tensions rising, Beijing may use panda loans to stabilize relations with Tokyo. China's decisions on panda leases are often revealed during high-level bilateral talks. Experts suggest a new loan could be announced during a potential visit by a Chinese leader to Japan this fall, although its diplomatic impact may be less significant than in the past.</p>

          <h2>AI Models Need More Standards and Testing to Prevent Harmful Outputs, Say Researchers</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are calling for more standards and testing of AI models to prevent harmful outputs, including hate speech and copyright infringements. The increasing use of AI has led to the discovery of problematic responses, compounded by a lack of regulations. Red teaming, a practice involving testing AI systems to uncover potential harm, is one way to evaluate risks. Researchers suggest opening testing to third parties and adopting standardized 'AI flaw' reports to ensure a better understanding of the risks posed by AI tools.</p>

          <h2>Phrases to Avoid and What to Say Instead, According to Child Development Expert</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child development expert who has studied over 200 kids details five "toxic" phrases that parents should never use to get their child to listen. These phrases include "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine." Instead, the expert suggests using alternative phrases that honor a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries. By shifting to language that respects a child's feelings and encourages cooperation, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prescriptions for Mounjaro jabs, a weight loss medication, are now available at GP surgeries in England, but only for those who meet very strict criteria. NHS England is implementing a staggered approach to reach those most in need, manage GPs' workload, and conserve NHS resources. The first group eligible includes individuals with a BMI of 40 or over (or 37.5 for minority ethnic backgrounds) and four out of five specific health conditions. Some GP practices are warning patients who do not meet the criteria not to book appointments to discuss the jabs.</p>

          <h2>China's Rise to Electric Vehicle Mainstream</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:17:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs), with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This transformation is attributed to long-term government planning, substantial subsidies, and dominance in battery production. Chinese EV makers like BYD are now leading the global market and are looking to expand overseas. The Chinese government's support has fostered a competitive landscape and a culture of innovation in the EV sector.</p>
