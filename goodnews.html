        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers trapped in Burmese amber has shed light on the evolution of flight feathers, which were essential for birds to surpass their dinosaur relatives in conquering the skies. Researchers analyzed 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period to understand how feathers evolved during this era. The development of feathers that generate thrust and lift was a critical step in bird evolution. Scientists believe that most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flight capabilities as modern birds.</p>

          <p>A UK study has found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections, potentially halving the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from 1,082 newborns and tracked their health for two years. Bifidobacterium longum, an early inhabitant of the human body, appeared to have a protective effect. Babies with this species were less likely to be hospitalized with lung infections.</p>

          <p>A judge has sided with environmental groups, issuing a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., delaying the restart of offshore oil operations near Santa Barbara. The order halts work on the onshore pipeline system due to a major rupture and spill in 2015. Environmental groups argued that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without environmental review or public process. The ruling pushes back Sable's timeline for first sales to August 1, 2025.</p>

          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has requested that the FDA Commissioner review the latest data on mifepristone, the abortion pill, raising concerns about access to the medication. The review aims to closely monitor the drug's safety, but experts argue that concerns about its safety are misguided. Mifepristone was first approved by the FDA in 2000 and has been used by millions of patients since. This comes after the Supreme Court rejected a challenge targeting the availability of the pill in 2024.</p>
