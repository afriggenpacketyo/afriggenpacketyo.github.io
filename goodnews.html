          <p>Colorado is taking steps to establish autonomy in vaccine policy due to concerns that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is undermining public health science. The state legislature changed a law allowing the state to consider scientific sources beyond the federal government when setting school vaccine requirements. Colorado also issued a standing order to let pharmacists provide COVID shots without individual prescriptions, and is shoring up insurance coverage for preventive health services. These changes aim to protect Colorado from political upheaval and ensure continued access to vaccines for its residents. Optimism score has not been determined.</p>

          <p>Germany is cleaning up illegally dumped trash, including fiberglass debris and car batteries, found in the Czech municipality of Jirikov. The trash was initially presented as plastic waste for recycling, but the mayor discovered it was hazardous and stopped further dumping. A German waste management company CEO and a Czech truck driver are under investigation for illegally sending waste across borders. The cleanup is being funded by the state of Bavaria, as the waste management company has gone bust. Environmental damage is being assessed, with initial samples showing toxins in the waste and surrounding soil. Optimism score has not been determined.</p>
