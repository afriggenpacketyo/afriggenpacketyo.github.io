          <h2>California Governor Proposes Federal Film Tax Credit After Trump Calls for Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit in partnership with the Trump administration to support the entertainment industry after President Trump suggested tariffs on movies filmed overseas. This proposal would be the largest government subsidy for the industry in the United States, supplementing existing state incentives. The move follows Trump's call for a 100 percent tariff on films produced outside the U.S., which caused confusion in Hollywood. Senator Adam Schiff also indicated his office was working on a federal film incentive proposal.</p>

          <p>Columbia student activist Mohsen Mahdawi, a green card holder, spoke out in his first network interview since being detained during a citizenship interview, stating that President Trump "will not silence me." Mahdawi, who helped lead protests against the Israel-Hamas war, was detained under a rarely used law. He criticized the administration's rationale for detaining him, asserting his advocacy for justice and peace does not undermine U.S. policy. Mahdawi's release was ordered by a judge who cited substantial claims that his detention was retaliation for protected speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ordered the Trump administration to admit approximately 12,000 refugees into the United States, partially blocking the president's efforts to suspend the refugee admissions program. The order followed a federal appeals court ruling that narrowed an earlier decision. The judge dismissed the government's interpretation that it only needed to process 160 refugees, asserting the government was rewriting a judicial order. The ruling requires the administration to resume processing cases of refugees who had already been approved for travel to the U.S.</p>

          <p>Starbase, the South Texas home of Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket company, is on its way to becoming an official city after a vote approved its formal organization. Most of the voters are Musk's employees at SpaceX. Musk first proposed the idea in 2021. While SpaceX has generally received support from local officials, some critics are concerned that the creation of a company town will expand Musk's control over the area. SpaceX is seeking federal permission to increase the number of South Texas launches from five to 25 a year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin's efforts to discard thousands of votes. Judge Richard E. Myers II ruled that invalidating ballots retroactively would violate voters' due process rights. The decision, if upheld, would secure the victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs. The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation, and experts warn it could set a precedent for future efforts to overturn elections.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is promoting a dinner he‚Äôs set to attend later this month that‚Äôs open to almost anyone who buys enough of his meme coin. Since the coin was launched earlier this year, it has generated more than $320 million in fees for its creators, according to the blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis. Trump meme coins can be traded on a decentralized exchange, which is essentially a place where traders can swap goods without a middleman. Trump's meme coin has become one of the most high-profile ways the norm-breaking president has mixed politics and his personal finances.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the still unresolved 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count. This decision, if upheld, would result in an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs and others who argued it would be a violation of the U.S. Constitution to carry out recent decisions by state appeals courts that directed the removal of potentially thousands of voter ballots deemed ineligible. The judge ordered the State Board of Elections to certify results that after two recounts showed Riggs the winner.</p>
