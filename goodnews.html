          <p>Dozens of White South Africans arrived in the United States after the Trump administration granted them refugee status, alleging discrimination by South Africa's post-apartheid government, an allegation strongly denied by the South African government. This group, comprised of families with children, were greeted by U.S. officials upon arrival. The decision to resettle these individuals through the U.S. refugee program was made earlier in the year by President Trump.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the recent trade agreement signifies progress in the U.S. reducing its reliance on Chinese products, emphasizing strategic necessities rather than a generalized decoupling. Bessent highlighted the vulnerabilities exposed during the 2020 pandemic, when demand shifted towards goods, causing supply chain disruptions and inflation. The U.S. aims to secure domestic production of critical items like steel, medicines, and semiconductors, protected by tariffs. The agreement includes a 90-day pause on reciprocal duties, with the 10% tariff and 20% fentanyl-related charge remaining, and Bessent expressed optimism about China's commitment to assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>New images from the James Webb Space Telescope reveal Jupiter's auroras to be hundreds of times brighter than Earth's, showcasing striking dancing lights caused by high-energy particles colliding with atmospheric gas. An international team of scientists, led by Jonathan Nichols, analyzed photos taken on Christmas in 2023, noting the auroras' rapid changes in brightness, sometimes varying by the second. These observations will aid in understanding Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics. Comparisons with Hubble Space Telescope images have also raised new questions about the composition and energy levels of particles hitting Jupiter's atmosphere.</p>

          <p>The United States has temporarily halted live cattle imports from Mexico through southern border ports to reassess strategies against the screwworm parasite, which was detected in farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized that this action is crucial for protecting animal health and ensuring the safety of the nation's food supply. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum expressed disagreement but remained hopeful for a swift resolution, while Mexico's Agriculture Secretary, Julio Berdegu√©, said he had spoken with Rollins, who had informed him of the decision. The screwworm, a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly, can cause severe and potentially fatal damage to warm-blooded animals, including humans.</p>

Cuomo was denied over $600,000 in public matching funds for his mayoral campaign after the New York City Campaign Finance Board found evidence of illicit coordination with the super PAC, Fix the City. The board determined that the super PAC's ad mirrored detailed spending instructions posted on Cuomo's campaign website, a tactic known as red-boxing. While Cuomo's campaign denies any wrongdoing, the board withheld funds equivalent to the super PAC's ad expenditure.

          <p>Sharpe James, the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, who presided over a downtown resurgence but was later convicted of corruption, has died at the age of 89. James served as mayor for 20 years, from 1986 to 2006, during which he oversaw significant redevelopment projects. Despite his achievements, suspicions of corruption plagued his tenure, leading to a conviction in 2008 for conspiring to sell city-owned properties at a fraction of their value. His legacy is marked by both revitalization efforts and ethical controversies.</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order asking drugmakers to voluntarily reduce the prices of key medicines in the United States, but the order lacks clear legal authority to mandate lower prices. The administration said it would consider regulatory actions or importing drugs from other countries in the future if drugmakers do not comply. The executive order also called on federal agencies to investigate why European countries get lower prices and to push them to pay more. Pharmaceutical stocks rose Monday morning on the news.</p>
