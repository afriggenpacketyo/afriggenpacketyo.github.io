          <p>Johns Hopkins University's School of Nursing is providing a free "Birth Companions" program that pairs nursing students with expecting mothers in the Baltimore area. These student doulas offer emotional, informational, and physical support during labor and birth, acting as advocates for patients without replacing medical staff. The initiative, now in its 27th year, has become more accessible following a new Maryland law requiring hospitals to accommodate certified doulas. The program aims to create a more supportive and empowering birth experience for mothers.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis reflects on the often predictable and unexciting nature of England's World Cup qualifying matches, despite the team's consistent success. The article notes that while England has lost only four such games in 30 years, the matches against lower-ranked teams frequently lack jeopardy and fail to generate significant excitement among fans. Former players like Wayne Rooney describe these games as "horrible" to play in, serving merely as a procedural step before the real challenge of major tournaments. The piece suggests these routine victories offer little insight into the team's true capabilities against top-tier opponents.</p>

After previously postponing its plans due to market volatility, StubHub is now set to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB."

Andrew Feltwell caught a home run ball and gave it to his son, Lincoln, as a birthday gift, only to be confronted by a woman who claimed he took the ball from her. After Feltwell gave the ball to the woman to de-escalate the situation, both the Phillies and the visiting Miami Marlins stepped in to provide a better experience for the boy. The Marlins gave him a bag of merchandise, and the player who hit the home run, Harrison Bader, gifted him a signed bat.</p>

          <h2>Expert Advice on Securing Lower Mortgage Rates as 30-Year Fixed Average Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 13:27:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate approaching a one-year low, financial experts are offering strategies for potential homebuyers to secure even better loan terms. Key recommendations include improving one's credit score, as higher scores directly correlate with lower interest rates. Making a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, can also lead to more favorable terms and help avoid private mortgage insurance. Additionally, borrowers are encouraged to consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently offer lower initial rates.

          <p>Prince Harry has returned to the United Kingdom for a series of engagements, beginning with an appearance at the WellChild charity awards in London. Upon his arrival, he visited Windsor to pay respects at the late Queen Elizabeth II's burial site on the third anniversary of her death. As patron of WellChild, Harry met with children facing serious health issues. His visit has prompted speculation about a potential meeting with his father, King Charles, whom he has not seen in person since early 2024.</p>

          <p>A new mural attributed to the artist Banksy has appeared on an external wall of the Royal Courts of Justice in London. The artwork portrays a judge in traditional attire striking a protester on the ground, with the timing suggesting a commentary on recent mass arrests at a pro-Palestine demonstration. Court officials have covered the piece and stated it will be removed, as the building is a protected historic site. Banksy authenticated the work via an Instagram post, continuing his tradition of creating politically charged street art critical of authority.</p>

          <p>Organizers of the Great North Run have apologized after finisher medals and T-shirts for the 60,000 participants mistakenly featured an image of the wrong city. Instead of an aerial view of the race's route through Newcastle and across the River Tyne, the design showed the nearby city of Sunderland and the River Wear. In a lighthearted apology, the Great Run Company called the items "the most unique" in the event's history and a future keepsake. The founder, Sir Brendan Foster, admitted he also failed to spot the geographical error despite his long association with the region.</p>
