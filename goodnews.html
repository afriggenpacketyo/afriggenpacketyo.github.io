          <p>WNBA star Angel Reese voiced her apprehension about media interactions on her podcast, citing concerns that her words are often misinterpreted or twisted. Reese, known for her rivalry with Caitlin Clark, stated she would rather pay fines than engage with reporters due to the media's tendency to create controversy. She referenced a recent incident where comments she made about her team were taken out of context, leading to a suspension. Reese has previously accused Clark's fans of racism and claims they created explicit AI-generated images of her and sent them to her family members.</p>

          <p>President Trump commuted the prison sentence of former New York Congressman George Santos, who was serving a more than seven-year sentence for fraud. Trump stated that Santos had been "horribly mistreated" in prison and ordered his immediate release, with Santos' attorney expressing gratitude for the commutation. Santos, who was expelled from Congress after an Ethics Committee report found he violated the law, released a statement expressing gratitude to Trump and vowing to focus on prison reform. The commutation, however, does not erase Santos' record, and he will no longer have to pay restitution to his victims.</p>

          <p>Senator Mike Lee faced criticism after tweeting that "no decent person" should mock Senator Mitch McConnell's fall, despite having previously mocked President Joe Biden for tripping on the stairs to Air Force One. Lee shared a tweet defending McConnell's legacy and added his own comment condemning mockery of the 83-year-old's fall. However, social media users quickly pointed out Lee's previous tweet, highlighting the apparent hypocrisy. Lee has a history of controversial social media posts, including those seen as mocking targeted shootings of Democratic legislators.</p>

          <p>A container ship sailed from China to the United Kingdom via the Northern Sea Route, marking a shift in shipping industry practices due to melting Arctic sea ice. This voyage realizes a 2017 proposal between China and Russia to create the "Polar Silk Road," potentially halving travel time and carbon pollution compared to the Suez Canal route. Despite economic and geopolitical benefits for China, the route poses environmental risks, including potential oil spills and noise pollution. Western countries are wary of using the route due to its proximity to Russia and environmental concerns, while others pledge to avoid the fragile ecosystem.</p>

          <p>The town of Terrassa in Catalonia, Spain, has temporarily banned the adoption of black cats from animal shelters during Halloween to prevent potential harm or use in rituals. The ban, effective from October 6 to November 10, aims to protect the felines from any macabre practices, as adoption requests for black cats typically increase around Halloween. While there have been no recorded incidents in Terrassa, the decision was made following warnings from animal welfare groups. Exceptions will be assessed individually, and normal fostering requests will resume after Halloween.</p>

          <p>A BBC Scotland investigation exposed a £28m timeshare fraud, leading to the conviction of 14 people involved in defrauding over 3,500 timeshare owners. The company at the center of the fraud, Sell My Timeshare (SMT), lured victims with promises to exit their timeshare contracts, only to pressure them into investing in worthless "Monster Rewards." Secret filming by the BBC revealed the company's illegal business practices, leading to a police investigation and the arrest of 19 people. The end of the criminal process brings some closure to those who were ripped off.</p>

The change is most visible for Ferguson, who reverts to her maiden name, and her business ventures may be impacted more by her own Epstein scandal than the title change. Beatrice and Eugenie's positions in the line of succession remain unchanged, but they are unlikely to step up into royal duties.
