          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record, driven by technology and real estate sectors, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision to lower its benchmark interest rate. Other markets across the Asia-Pacific region had a mixed response, with South Korea's Kospi rising while indexes in Hong Kong, mainland China, and Australia saw declines. The Fed's move was framed as a "risk management cut," with indications of further reductions possible this year, influencing investor sentiment globally as the Bank of Japan is expected to maintain its current policy.

          <p>President Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom included a lavish state banquet at Windsor Castle, a meticulously planned event designed to showcase diplomatic hospitality. The guest list was notably heavy on political figures and technology executives, such as Apple's Tim Cook and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, rather than celebrities. The seating arrangement placed President Trump between King Charles and the Princess of Wales, with other prominent UK and US officials strategically positioned. The event blended historical grandeur with modern diplomacy, featuring music reportedly chosen from the president's own favorites.</p>

          <p>At the recent New York Fashion Week, music served as a vital element in conveying the mood and message of designers' collections. From original compositions featuring whispered poetry to DJ sets of new productions, soundtracks were carefully curated to evoke specific emotions like nostalgia, disorientation, or arousal. Designers collaborated with artists to create soundscapes that complemented their clothing, tapping into cultural memory and contemporary anxieties. The article highlights how the auditory experience is as crucial as the visual presentation in defining a fashion show's impact and memorability.</p>

          <p>Ohio State University has launched a new initiative called "AI Fluency," which will require all undergraduate students, starting with the class of 2029, to study artificial intelligence. The program mandates that all freshmen take a course in generative AI and participate in workshops to learn its real-world applications, regardless of their major. This move is a response to the rapidly growing demand for AI skills in the job market, where listings requiring such expertise have soared. The university aims to give its graduates a competitive edge by ensuring they are fluent in both their chosen field and AI technology.</p>

          <p>The Central Council of Jews in Germany has publicly urged Chancellor Friedrich Merz's government to maintain its "unconditional" support for Israel. Speaking at an event commemorating the council's 75th anniversary, President Josef Schuster called on the chancellor not to be dissuaded from this stance by other nations or individual lawmakers. Chancellor Merz, in his address, affirmed that criticism of the Israeli government is permissible but becomes unacceptable when it serves as a pretext for antisemitism. He emphasized Germany's commitment to protecting Jewish life and culture within the country.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters currently expect the system to remain over open water and pose no immediate threat to land, though it could strengthen into a low-grade hurricane over the weekend. The storm's projected path shows it tracking north of the Caribbean, but it may approach Bermuda next week as it continues to intensify. The 2025 season has been quieter than initially predicted by NOAA, which had forecast an above-average number of named storms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two alcoholic beverages per day through their diet of fermented fruit. Scientists measured the alcohol content in fruits commonly eaten by the primates and calculated their daily intake, which amounts to a steady, low dose of ethanol. This finding lends support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests that human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-based diets of our primate ancestors. The study provides the first direct chemical measurements of alcohol in fruits routinely consumed by wild chimps.</p>

The Education Select Committee's report calls for keeping the existing Education, Health and Care Plans (EHCPs) as a crucial accountability measure for parents. The report also urges the government to establish new national minimum standards for SEND support in all schools and to increase investment in teacher training and specialist schools. This comes as the government prepares to announce its own reforms to a system that has been described as financially unsustainable.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts widely anticipate that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee will hold interest rates at 4% during its upcoming meeting. This follows a rate cut from 4.25% in August, which brought the rate to its lowest level in over two years. With UK inflation still running at 3.8%, nearly double the official 2% target, policymakers are unlikely to risk another cut that could fuel further price rises. The decision comes after the U.S. Federal Reserve recently cut its own rates, highlighting differing economic conditions and policy approaches between the two countries.</p>
