          <p>Donald Trump's meme coin business has generated over $320 million in fees for its creators, highlighting the intersection of politics and personal finance. The coin's value jumped after Trump promoted a dinner event for top holders, showcasing the potential for financial gain and access to the former president. Critics argue the anonymity of cryptocurrency could allow undue influence on Trump through purchasing digital assets. Trump has dismissed concerns about profiting from his presidency, stating he shouldn't have to contribute his real estate if it appreciates because he's president. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must remain in the final count, effectively securing a victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers found that removing ballots after the election would violate due process and equal protection rights. He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify the results, which showed Riggs winning by a narrow margin. This decision comes after Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin filed protests seeking to disqualify ballots, arguing they were unlawfully cast, but the judge emphasized that election rules cannot be changed retroactively.</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is under scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to communicate strategic information to a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. This practice, known as red-boxing, involves publicly posting instructions for outside groups to circumvent coordination restrictions. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned campaigns about these rules, and Cuomo's opponent has requested an investigation. While Cuomo's team denies any violation, there is overlap between his messaging and that of the super PAC, raising concerns about potential illegal coordination.</p>
