          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has stated he will consider the "most appropriate" framework for governing following the crucial House of Councillors election in July. Securing a majority for his ruling coalition is a "must-attain" goal, though he acknowledged it will be a difficult task. This election is the first nationwide parliamentary test since his coalition lost its majority in the lower house last October. The statement comes as a recent poll indicates half of voters want the ruling bloc to lose its upper house majority.</p>

          <p>The UK government has made significant concessions on its planned welfare reforms to avert a major rebellion from over 120 of its own backbench MPs. Health Secretary Wes Streeting admitted the initial rollout was mishandled and that the government is now in a "better position" to pass the bill. The changes include limiting cuts to Personal Independence Payment (Pip) to new claimants and abandoning a freeze on the health-related component of Universal Credit. A review of the Pip assessment process, co-produced with disabled people, has also been announced.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted to advance the "One Big Beautiful Bill" late Saturday night after intense negotiations secured the support of four conservative holdouts. Senators Ron Johnson, Rick Scott, Cynthia Lummis, and Mike Lee flipped their votes after reportedly receiving promises for a future vote on an amendment related to Medicaid. President Trump celebrated the outcome on social media, praising the senators for their work. The bill now faces a lengthy reading process before a final vote is expected later in the week.</p>

          <p>Amid market uncertainties, some top-performing Wall Street analysts are recommending specific dividend-paying stocks as a way to potentially enhance returns. Jefferies analyst Andy Barish reiterated a buy rating for McDonald's (MCD), citing its brand power and potential for sales growth. Stifel's Simon Yarmak upgraded EPR Properties (EPR), a real estate trust focused on experiential venues, due to an improved cost of capital.

          <h2>Aviation Experts Explain Safety Reasons for Dimming Cabin Lights During Takeoff and Landing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The practice of dimming cabin lights during takeoff and landing is a standard safety procedure, according to pilots and flight attendants. The primary reason is to allow the eyes of passengers and crew to pre-adjust to darkness. This significantly reduces the time needed to adapt and see emergency exit paths in the event of a sudden power loss or an evacuation. Takeoff and landing are statistically the most critical phases of a flight, and this simple measure helps prepare everyone onboard for a potential emergency situation.</p>
