          <p>China is scaling up the use of artificial intelligence in urban management through its "smart cities" initiative. In Nanjing, drones patrol potentially problematic areas, guided by AI-planned routes, to deter crime. The Chinese leadership views AI as a tool for transforming the economy and refining governance, addressing challenges brought by rapid urbanization. Despite progress, China's AI governance faces challenges, including privacy protection and limited community involvement, similar to issues in other countries adopting the technology.</p>

          <p>Stephanie Case, an ultramarathon runner and new mother, breastfed her six-month-old daughter three times during a 100-kilometer race in Wales and still managed to win first place among female competitors. After a three-year break from competing and a challenging journey to motherhood, Case saw the race as a return to running. The response to her achievement has been overwhelmingly positive, challenging cultural ideas about what new moms should look like. Case consumed 80 to 100 grams of carbohydrates per hour during the race to fuel herself and her baby.</p>

          <h2>Key Inflation Gauge Shows Price Growth Cooled in April</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key U.S. inflation gauge slowed in April, with consumer prices rising 2.1% compared to a year earlier, down from 2.3% in March. Despite rising incomes, spending by Americans slowed, potentially reflecting an early reaction to higher prices on some imported goods. Economists and business executives have warned that prices will likely head higher as Trump's widespread tariffs take effect, although the timing and impact of those duties are now in doubt after they were struck down late Wednesday in court, only to be temporarily reinstated by a federal appeals court. The Federal Reserve is closely monitoring the impact of tariffs on inflation and jobs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Elon Musk concluded his four-month tenure leading the government efficiency initiative, Doge, with President Trump praising his work. Despite initial goals of significant cost savings, the program achieved far less than expected, saving only $175 billion. Musk defended the program, stating that it is on track to save a trillion dollars with Congressional support, while Trump presented Musk with a golden key to the White House, acknowledging his service. The departure follows reports of Musk's alleged drug use and criticisms of Doge's mass firings and unorthodox cost-cutting methods.</p>
