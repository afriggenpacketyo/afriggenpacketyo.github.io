          <p>Despite facing significant tariffs due to the closure of a trade loophole, e-commerce experts believe Temu and Shein will remain competitive in the U.S. market. These companies are shifting to localization strategies, onboarding American sellers, and utilizing local warehouses to mitigate tariff impacts. While prices have increased, experts argue that Temu and Shein's previously low prices allow them to absorb tariffs and still undercut competitors like Amazon. The article notes that Chinese companies are adept at operating on thin margins and finding ways to survive in adverse environments, suggesting they will continue to adapt and compete effectively.
