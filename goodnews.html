          <p>King Charles III and Queen Camilla attended a remembrance service marking the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, which signified the end of World War Two. The event, held at the National Memorial Arboretum, honored the courage and sacrifice of veterans who served in the Far East and Pacific, with 33 surviving veterans as guests of honor. In a message, the King acknowledged the immense suffering of the war, including that of prisoners of war and the victims of the atomic bombings, while celebrating the ultimate victory of liberty. The service included moving accounts from veterans, a two-minute silence, and a military flypast.</p>

          <p>FBI Director Kash Patel and his foundation have won a $250,000 default judgment in a defamation lawsuit against blogger Jim Stewartson. The lawsuit cited a series of posts where Stewartson accused Patel, a longtime Trump loyalist, of being a "Kremlin asset" and planning the January 6th Capitol attack. The judge issued the default judgment after Stewartson failed to respond to the lawsuit in court, stating that the blogger acted with malice. Stewartson claims he was never properly served with the lawsuit and described it as a frivolous attempt to intimidate him for his reporting.</p>

          <p>Carrie Wheeler, the CEO of online real estate company Opendoor, has announced her resignation following a pressure campaign from activist investors. The move comes after a recent earnings report failed to assure investors of a turnaround, despite the stock's recent surge from near-delisting prices. Activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson and co-founder Keith Rabois, had publicly called for her departure. In her announcement, Wheeler stated that stepping down would allow the company to focus on its future without the distraction of "intense outside interest." The company has named its technology chief as an interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO.</p>

          <p>Playboy Enterprises is moving its corporate headquarters from Los Angeles to Miami Beach, Florida, with CEO Ben Kohn citing California's "anti-business" environment and high operational costs. The relocation is part of a trend of major companies, including Tesla and Chevron, leaving California for states with more favorable business climates. Playboy plans to establish its new base in a luxury office building and open a new Playboy Club, restaurant, and multimedia studios. Miami Beach officials have welcomed the move, which represents a strategic return for the brand to South Florida, where it previously operated a club and hotel.</p>

          <p>After a six-month pause and a legal challenge from over a dozen states, the Trump administration has agreed to resume a federal program funding the installation of electric vehicle chargers along highways. The Department of Transportation froze the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) funds in February, prompting a lawsuit. While the administration is now releasing the funds, it has stripped several Biden-era requirements related to community engagement, labor standards, and environmental planning. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy stated that while he disagrees with subsidizing green energy, the administration will respect Congress's decision to fund the program.</p>

          <p>The market for technology initial public offerings (IPOs) is experiencing a significant resurgence after being effectively closed for three years due to inflation and high interest rates. Recent successful debuts, such as design software firm Figma and cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, have seen their stock prices soar on their first day of trading, signaling renewed investor appetite. This revival is encouraging a backlog of high-value private companies to prepare for public offerings, with Wall Street leaders expressing optimism for a busy second half of the year. However, some analysts caution that the market may be overheating, drawing comparisons to the dot-com bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a financial stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson argued that such a move is necessary to revitalize the struggling American chipmaker and reduce the nation's dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like TSMC. The intervention could be funded through the CHIPS Act, which has already allocated billions to Intel. The discussion comes as President Trump advocates for increasing domestic production of high-end technology to ensure the U.S. maintains a competitive edge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parenting self-help book titled "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library nearly 82 years after it was due back. The book, checked out in July 1943, was discovered by a person in Oregon among their late father's belongings. It was likely borrowed by their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for work at the U.S. Embassy shortly after checking it out. The book was returned with a letter hoping there would be no late fee, which the library confirmed, as it eliminated late fees in 2021.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is pitching a barebones, American-made electric pickup truck that it claims can sell for about half the average vehicle price in the U.S. The company's strategy is to minimize manufacturing costs by offering a simple, two-seat base model and allowing owners to customize it with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. Slate has already received over 100,000 reservations, banking on price as its main appeal. However, the expiration of federal EV tax credits may raise the truck's price, placing it in a more competitive market segment.</p>

          <p>Activist hedge fund Starboard Value has increased its stake in Salesforce by 47%, sparking a 4% rally in the company's stock and speculation that a new round of investor activism is imminent. Starboard led a successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed Salesforce to focus on profitability, resulting in a significant stock price increase. Analysts believe Starboard's renewed interest signals mounting pressure on management to improve growth in its core business and avoid dilutive acquisitions. The move comes as Salesforce's stock has struggled this year amid concerns about its AI strategy and a controversial acquisition plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against Jamie Marsicano, a protester involved in the movement against Atlanta's police training center, known as "Cop City." The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment for two and a half years. The defense argued that the state was purposefully delaying the case, a tactic described as "the process is the punishment." This marks a significant victory for opponents of the training center, who have faced sweeping charges, including Rico conspiracy indictments, from the state.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice cloves may offer several health benefits beyond their use in baking, according to various research studies. The spice contains eugenol, a compound with antimicrobial properties that can help control oral bacteria and reduce the risk of gum disease. Studies also suggest that eugenol may help lower blood sugar levels, with one study showing that clove extract significantly reduced post-meal blood sugar in participants. Cloves are also a source of essential minerals like calcium and magnesium and act as a natural antioxidant, which can help prevent cell damage.</p>

          <p>The new horror film "Weapons," from writer-director Zach Cregger, is being praised as a standout film for its compelling mystery and satisfying, yet thought-provoking, conclusion. The movie centers on the inexplicable disappearance of a third-grade class and the subsequent search by their families and community. Unlike many mystery-box films, "Weapons" provides clear answers, revealing a supernatural villain whose defeat offers a moment of cinematic triumph. However, the article argues that the film's brilliance lies in its refusal to erase the underlying tragedy, reminding the audience that vanquishing evil doesn't undo the grief and trauma it has already caused.</p>
