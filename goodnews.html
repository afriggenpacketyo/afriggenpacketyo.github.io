Although headline tariffs were reduced, these cuts primarily reversed measures that were inconsistent with WTO regulations.

Amendments being considered include ensuring no obligation for medical staff to participate and requiring a government assessment of palliative care availability. The debate comes as the government corrected its impact assessment on assisted deaths, leading to concerns about the process's chaotic nature.</p>
