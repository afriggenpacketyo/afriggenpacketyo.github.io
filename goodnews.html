          <p>AMC Entertainment's stock surged after the company announced better-than-expected second-quarter financial results. The movie theater chain reported revenue of nearly $1.4 million and a significantly narrowed net loss of $4.7 million, compared to $32.8 million in the previous year. CEO Adam Aron credited the performance to a recovering box office, increased attendance, and successful debt restructuring. The company also saw record-high revenue per patron, driven by growth in premium offerings, indicating a positive trajectory for the theater industry post-pandemic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market with high rates and low inventory, current mortgage rates remain elevated, though well-qualified buyers can still secure favorable terms. As of early August, average 30-year mortgage rates are around 6.75%, with 15-year loans near 5.99%, while refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts suggest that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could bring relief to borrowers. To secure the best rates, financial advisors recommend strengthening credit profiles, paying bills on time, and comparing offers from multiple lenders to minimize long-term costs.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Money psychology expert Morgan Housel argues that many investors, particularly those with high intelligence, mistakenly complicate their strategies, which often leads to poorer results. Instead, he advocates for a simple and consistent approach, such as periodically investing in low-cost index funds that track market averages like the S&P 500. This view is supported by historical data and echoed by Warren Buffett, who has long recommended passive investing for the average person. The core principle is that achieving average returns over a long period is more effective and less risky than attempting to outperform the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a ceremony to unveil his statue at Gillette Stadium, former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady took a playful jab at New York Jets fans. Brady, who won six Super Bowls with the Patriots, remarked that the statue would give Jets fans "something to throw their beers at" as they leave the stadium early in games. The comment references his dominant career record against the Jets, whom he defeated 30 times while throwing 60 touchdown passes. The ceremony celebrated his legacy with the team before his eventual induction into the Hall of Fame.</p>

Arriving in Britain as a child refugee before World War Two, she went on to break barriers for women in the tech industry. In 1962, she founded a software company that almost exclusively employed women with children, offering them flexible, remote work. After building a fortune, she became a dedicated philanthropist, donating nearly £70 million to causes related to autism and IT projects, leaving an inspirational legacy of innovation and social change.</p>

As of early August, the price of gold stood at approximately $3,395 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. Key factors influencing its price include supply and demand, global economic health, inflation rates, and geopolitical instability. Currency movements, particularly the strength of the U.S. dollar, and central bank policies on gold reserves also play a significant role in determining its market value. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady but market watchers anticipating a cut in September, financial experts advise savers to act quickly to lock in favorable rates. High-yield savings accounts are currently offering rates as high as 4.35%, though these are variable and will likely decrease if the Fed cuts rates. For those with a defined savings timeline, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer fixed rates, with some reaching 4.5%. U.S. Treasurys provide another safe, fixed-rate option, with the added benefit of being exempt from state and local taxes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In its first major move after merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. broadcasting rights for the UFC in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion, starting in 2026.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten years after China's surprising devaluation of the yuan sent shockwaves through global markets, its approach to managing its currency has significantly matured. Analysts note that Beijing has moved away from depleting its massive foreign reserves to defend the yuan, now employing a more diverse toolkit to handle volatility. This shift toward a market-based, yet still managed, exchange-rate system has helped stabilize its foreign reserves. The key challenge ahead is whether the yuan can achieve greater internationalization and market-driven pricing without causing destabilizing economic swings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese aerospace engineers have developed a new stealth launcher designed to capture space debris without creating light, smoke, or significant vibrations. Unveiled in a Chinese academic journal, the device uses a closed-gas, energy-absorbing mechanism to fire a capsule containing a net towards its target. This design ensures that the launch platform remains stable, allowing for precise targeting. While its stated purpose is to clean up orbital debris, the technology's stealthy and precise nature raises questions about its potential for dual-use as a space weapon.</p>
