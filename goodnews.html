          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's cabinet saw its approval rating increase to 37% in a recent Kyodo News survey.  A significant majority of respondents (88.5%) supported a policy shift to increase domestic rice production due to rising prices and shortages.  Despite the rise in approval, a substantial portion (56.9%) still viewed the government's response to rising rice prices as inadequate. The poll also revealed opposition to the ruling party's plan for cash handouts.</p>
