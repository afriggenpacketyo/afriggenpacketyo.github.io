          <p>The Murdoch family has finalized a deal to resolve the long-standing succession battle for control of its global media empire, which includes Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. Under the agreement, Lachlan Murdoch will secure control of the business, while his three older siblings—Prudence, Elisabeth, and James—will each receive $1.1 billion for their shares. This arrangement effectively ends the legal and personal conflicts over the future of the company following Rupert Murdoch's retirement. The deal ensures leadership continuity and solidifies the conservative direction of the media conglomerate under Lachlan's leadership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage approaching a one-year low, financial experts are offering guidance on how prospective homebuyers can secure even better terms. Key strategies include improving one's credit score, as higher FICO scores directly correlate with lower interest rates offered by lenders. Additionally, providing a larger down payment, ideally 20% or more, reduces the lender's risk and can lead to more favorable loan conditions. Homebuyers are also encouraged to consider alternatives to the traditional 30-year fixed loan, such as adjustable-rate mortgages, which may offer lower initial rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of the online brokerage Robinhood experienced a significant rally, jumping more than 15% after S&P Global announced its addition to the prestigious S&P 500 index. This inclusion, which will be effective September 22, is a major milestone for the company and typically triggers substantial buying from index funds that track the S&P 500. The move ends months of speculation on Wall Street about Robinhood's potential entry into the benchmark index.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While most seniors cannot completely avoid paying the monthly premium for Medicare Part B, there are specific circumstances that allow for delaying enrollment or receiving financial assistance. The most common scenario is for individuals who are still working past age 65 and are covered by a creditable employer health plan, which allows them to postpone Part B enrollment without penalty. For those with limited income and resources, state-run Medicare Savings Programs or qualifying for Medicaid can help cover or eliminate the monthly premiums. However, forgoing Part B can restrict access to supplemental coverage like Medigap and Medicare Advantage plans.</p>

          <p>For savers with a substantial amount like $40,000, choosing between a certificate of deposit (CD) and a high-yield savings account involves weighing key trade-offs. A CD offers a fixed interest rate for a set term, protecting earnings from future rate declines, but requires the money to remain untouched to avoid penalties. In contrast, a high-yield savings account provides more liquidity and easy access to funds, but its interest rate is variable and likely to fall if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. Savers should assess their long-term financial goals and need for access to their money before committing to either option. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Early projections from Norway's parliamentary election indicate that Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's center-left Labour Party is on track to secure a narrow victory. The ruling left-leaning alliance is expected to win a slim majority of seats in the parliament. The election campaign was dominated by domestic concerns such as inflation and the quality of public services, as well as the broader context of international instability. If the final results confirm the projections, Stoere will remain in power, likely continuing to lead a minority government and navigating a complex political landscape.</p>

          <p>England's national football team manager, Thomas Tuchel, has announced his intention to utilize the long throw-in as a key attacking tactic ahead of the World Cup. This strategy, famously employed by teams like Stoke City in the past, has seen a resurgence in the Premier League for its effectiveness in creating scoring chances. Experts and coaches, including Liverpool's former throw-in specialist Thomas Gronnemark, have noted the underestimated value of this set-piece. Tuchel believes that in the time-constrained preparations for a major tournament, focusing on such details can provide a competitive edge.</p>

Northern California and the Bay Area may receive light rain, which could help suppress wildfire activity in the region. While Southern California is not expected to get significant rainfall, a deep marine layer may bring some drizzle, though forecasters warn this cooler spell does not mark the end of fire season.</p>

          <p>As mortgage rates fall to an 11-month low, homeowners who purchased with higher rates are contemplating whether to refinance. Key questions to consider include if the current rate drop is substantial enough—typically a full percentage point—to justify the action and its associated closing costs. Homeowners must also weigh the risk of waiting for potentially lower rates against the possibility of rates rising unexpectedly. Finally, a homeowner's long-term plans for the property are crucial; refinancing may not be cost-effective if they plan to sell the home before breaking even on the closing costs.

          <p>Following a weak August jobs report, financial markets are now pricing in a near-certainty of a Federal Reserve interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. While a standard quarter-percentage-point reduction is the most likely outcome, traders see a small but non-zero chance of a more aggressive half-point cut. The disappointing labor data has intensified pressure on the central bank to ease monetary policy to support the slowing economy. However, with inflation still above the Fed's target, most analysts believe the bar for a larger cut remains high, making the smaller adjustment the probable course of action.
