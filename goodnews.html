          <p>After 37 years as editor-in-chief of American Vogue, Dame Anna Wintour is stepping back from the role. The 75-year-old fashion icon will not be leaving the company, instead continuing her duties as Vogue's global editorial director and as chief content officer for parent company Cond√© Nast. A new position, head of editorial content for American Vogue, will be created to manage the U.S. publication's daily operations. This move allows Wintour to focus on her broader global and corporate responsibilities while ushering in new leadership for the influential magazine.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers considering where to deposit a significant sum like $10,000, the choice between a short-term CD and a high-yield savings account presents a nuanced decision. While short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher fixed rates for terms like three or six months, high-yield savings accounts provide greater flexibility with comparable, albeit variable, rates. Calculations show that for shorter durations, CDs may yield marginally more interest, but for a nine-month period, a high-yield savings account could prove more profitable. The best option depends on an individual's outlook on future interest rate trends and their need for liquidity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mexico's Supreme Court has issued a landmark ruling in favor of singer Sasha Sokol, setting a precedent for civil cases involving child sexual abuse. The court upheld a civil conviction against artistic producer Luis de Llano for the abusive relationship he had with Sokol when she was 14 and he was 39. This decision establishes that the statute of limitations does not apply in such civil cases, opening a path for other victims to seek justice. Sokol celebrated the ruling as a crucial step toward repairing the harm, stating it transcends her personal case and validates the experiences of many others.</p>

The expert also stresses the importance of building strong professional relationships and cultivating comfort with constant change. These skills are critical as AI excels at logic but cannot replicate genuine emotional understanding or complex interpersonal dynamics.</p>

Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt explained that the president could choose to extend the pause on tariffs for countries engaged in good-faith trade negotiations with the U.S. This provides flexibility on the July 8 expiration of a reduced 10% tariff rate on most countries and a July 9 deadline regarding a potential 50% tariff on the European Union.

Experts identify several key warning signs, including guarantees of specific results, requests for large upfront fees, and a lack of transparency about the process and costs. A legitimate credit counseling agency will conduct a thorough review of your entire financial situation before making recommendations and will be honest about the potential impact on your credit score. They will also discuss all available options, rather than pushing their program as the only solution.</p>

          <p>Scientists have discovered that British ash woodlands are showing signs of naturally evolving greater resistance to ash dieback, a devastating fungal disease that has ravaged the countryside. A study revealed subtle genetic shifts in the trees over time, indicating that natural selection is at work, allowing new saplings to better fight the infection. While predictions once suggested up to 85% of ash trees could be lost, this discovery offers renewed hope for the species' survival. Experts say this provides fresh motivation to protect ash populations and allow nature's evolutionary process to continue.</p>
