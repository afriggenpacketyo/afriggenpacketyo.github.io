          <h2>Chinese Scientists Develop High-Speed Infrared Technology Inspired by Fire Beetles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 02:00:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new infrared sensing technology inspired by the fire beetle, an insect capable of detecting faint heat from forest fires hundreds of kilometers away. This new technology is reportedly 20,000 times faster than conventional methods, offering significant potential for military and industrial applications where clear detection is needed in obstructive conditions like smoke or dust. This biomimicry demonstrates how nature can inspire advanced optoelectronic devices for a variety of uses. The fire beetle's unique organ evolved for reproduction, using the heat from wildfires to create ideal conditions for its larvae.</p>

          <p>Despite engaging in multi-front wars and facing internal political turmoil, Israel's stock market has achieved record highs, outperforming other Middle Eastern markets since October 2023. After an initial drop following the war's outbreak, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rebounded, buoyed by strong foreign investment and a resilient high-tech sector, which constitutes 20% of the nation's GDP. Investor confidence has been bolstered by perceptions of reduced security risks and the country's economic dynamism, with the OECD forecasting significant growth for 2026. This economic buoyancy highlights the complex interplay between national security and market performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England's women's football team advanced to the Euro 2025 semi-finals after a dramatic comeback and penalty shootout victory against Sweden. After being down 2-0 at halftime, England scored two goals in two minutes, with key substitutions by manager Sarina Wiegman proving decisive in changing the game's momentum. The team demonstrated significant resilience, surviving multiple moments where they were on the brink of elimination during the shootout. The victory, sealed by a decisive penalty from veteran Lucy Bronze, showcased a familiar formula of toughness, tactical changes, and a degree of luck.</p>

          <p>Tom Lynagh, son of Australian rugby icon Michael Lynagh, is set to make his first start for the Wallabies against the British and Irish Lions, a pivotal moment in his young career. Having grown up in England and played for Harlequins' youth system, Lynagh made the difficult choice to move to Australia to pursue his international ambitions with the Queensland Reds. Despite his famous lineage, he has carved his own path, impressing coaches with his composure and toughness. His selection comes at a critical time due to an injury to the first-choice fly-half, placing the 22-year-old in a high-pressure debut.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the author reflects on turning 35 and the realization that adulthood does not come with a clear set of answers or a feeling of complete self-assuredness. Instead, the author has learned that most people are simply "winging it" through a continuous process of becoming. Using the French comedy show "Bref" as a bookend to his own journey as an American immigrant in France, he explores themes of regret, identity, and the unexpected paths life takes. The essay concludes that while life is often uncertain and the world faces immense challenges, there is value in embracing the journey and building a life from the experiences gathered along the way.</p>

          <p>A farmer in China's Anhui province has captured local attention by building and successfully operating his own seven-meter-long submarine. Zhang, who had managed a small riverside dock for years, was inspired by a television program in 2014 and decided to pursue his lifelong dream of invention. Using 5,000 yuan (US$700) of his own money, he secretly purchased steel plates, an engine, and a battery to construct the vessel. His creation, a sleek black submarine, has been seen navigating a local river, demonstrating a remarkable feat of personal ingenuity and determination.</p>

          <p>In a personal account, a man details his harrowing journey with Extramammary Paget’s disease (EMPD), a very rare and often misdiagnosed form of cancer. What began as a persistent itch in his groin was dismissed for over a year as a simple fungal infection until he finally asked his doctor for a biopsy. The diagnosis led to multiple extensive surgeries and a difficult recovery, compounded by the isolation of battling a little-known disease. His experience drove him to create an online support group, which has since become the largest international resource for EMPD patients, emphasizing the critical need for patient self-advocacy and greater medical awareness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate, which excludes fresh food, cooled to 3.3% in June, down from a 29-month high, largely due to easing rice prices after the government released stockpiles. Despite this moderation, inflation has remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for 39 consecutive months. Economists remain cautious, pointing to persistent inflationary pressures and the potential impact of yen depreciation. The economic outlook is further complicated by concerns over potential U.S. tariffs and slowing GDP growth, creating uncertainty for both the central bank's monetary policy and the country's economic stability.

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has acknowledged that European nations have historically been "free-riders" on U.S. defense and security spending. In an interview with the BBC, Merz stated that Europe understands it must contribute more to its own defense, a message he says has been clearly received from the Trump administration. His comments came as he visited the UK to sign a historic friendship and defense treaty, part of a broader effort to strengthen European security in response to the threat from Russia. Merz emphasized that Germany is now significantly increasing its defense budget to build a stronger military.</p>

          <p>China has unveiled a new military drone that takes off and lands vertically on its tail, similar to a rocket. Developed by the state-owned Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) demonstrated its reconnaissance and autonomous control capabilities in a recent drill in a mountainous region. Its design, which resembles the U.S. military's MQ-35 V-BAT, allows for high-speed flight combined with the flexibility of not needing a runway for deployment or retrieval. The drone's intelligent control system also showcased advanced features like autonomous route planning and threat avoidance, crucial for potential swarm operations.</p>
