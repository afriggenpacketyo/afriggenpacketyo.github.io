          <p>Five suspects broke into a Cheviot Hills home in West Los Angeles, tied up the occupants, and abducted a man before releasing him in Glendale, according to the LAPD. The suspects, wearing masks and black clothing, stole an iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch during the home invasion early Saturday morning. A pregnant woman at the residence suffered an anxiety attack and required medical attention. Police are investigating the incident, searching for the suspects who fled in a black pickup truck, and are asking anyone with information to contact the authorities.</p>

          <p>The UK Prime Minister has announced plans to overhaul the immigration system by tightening English tests for visa applicants and extending the wait time for settlement from five to ten years. The proposed changes also include a fast-track settlement for skilled workers in sectors like nursing and AI. Critics warn that stricter language requirements could split families, while supporters argue that integration is essential. The move aims to reduce net migration and ensure that settlement is earned, not a right, as the article reports.</p>
