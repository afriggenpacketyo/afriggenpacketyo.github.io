          <p>President Trump lauded Nippon Steel's partnership with U.S. Steel, emphasizing the Japanese company's $14 billion investment and the preservation of U.S. Steel's control by the USA. During a speech at a U.S. Steel plant in Pennsylvania, Trump highlighted the creation of at least 70,000 jobs and the $14 billion boost to the American economy. He also mentioned raising tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent, effective Wednesday, while stating that U.S. Steel will maintain its operating blast furnaces at full capacity for at least ten years. Trump indicated he still needs to approve the final deal between the two steelmakers. Optimism centers around potential economic benefits and job preservation for the American steel industry.

          <p>The Japanese government has started releasing cheaper stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers to combat soaring rice prices. Consumers are flocking to purchase the discounted rice, with major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. among the first to sell it. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo, 500 bags of rice sold out in just 30 minutes, highlighting the high demand. This effort aims to alleviate the financial burden on households struggling with rising food costs, as the government sells 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022.</p>
