          <p>NFL Hall of Fame quarterback Peyton Manning provided entertainment for PGA champion Scottie Scheffler at the 2025 Memorial Tournament Pro-Am when Manning's tee shot went awry and reportedly hit a house.

          <p>Olympic gold medalist Imane Khelif from Algeria must undergo a newly mandated genetic sex test by World Boxing before competing again. The organization will introduce mandatory sex testing to determine the eligibility of male and female boxers, prompted partly by controversy surrounding Khelif's gold medal win at the Paris Olympics. The decision follows claims from the International Boxing Association that Khelif and another boxer failed unspecified eligibility tests for the women's competition at last year's world championships. The testing, involving a PCR genetic test, will determine the presence of the Y chromosome to confirm biological sex, with mandatory testing procedures beginning July 1, 2025.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Corporate buzzwords are criticized for impeding trust and creating insecurity among employees, particularly Gen Zers who rely on instant answers and may cling to jargon as corporate life rafts. Studies show that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon, and new buzzwords constantly emerge, often serving as metaphors that distract from the primary goal of making money. The article suggests that people should simply use real, human language and embrace genuine poetry instead of relying on corporate jargon. The author advocates for radical candor and clear communication in the workplace.</p>

          <p>The stock market experienced volatility due to President Donald Trump's accusations against China regarding trade agreement violations, although it still managed to close the week and month of May with gains. Tariffs, Nvidia's strong earnings, and inflation data were significant factors influencing market performance. Nvidia's positive results and guidance led to an increased price target, while Salesforce faced scrutiny over its focus on AI. The Federal Reserve's inflation gauge indicated easing price pressures, but concerns remain about the potential for tariffs to reignite inflation.
