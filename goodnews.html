          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:11:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion purchase of Hess Corporation, a move aimed at securing access to Guyana's extensive offshore oil reserves. The acquisition proceeded after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's stake in the lucrative Stabroek Block oil project. While Chevron's CEO celebrated the decision as an affirmation of standard industry practices for corporate mergers, the company anticipates some job reductions as it integrates Hess's operations. The outcome resolves significant market uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Reverse Mortgages as a Supplement to Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 11:08:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines how reverse mortgages can serve as a financial tool for retirees, particularly those who are "house rich but cash poor." It details three primary ways this can work: by converting home equity into a steady monthly income stream, providing access to a lump sum or line of credit for unexpected costs like healthcare, and enabling retirees to delay claiming Social Security to receive larger future benefits. The text emphasizes that while a reverse mortgage can offer financial flexibility, it's a significant decision that requires careful consideration to ensure it aligns with an individual's long-term retirement goals.

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Delta and United Airlines Are Outperforming Competitors</h2>

          <p>Delta and United Airlines are increasingly separating themselves from the rest of the U.S. airline industry, accounting for over 86% of the sector's profits last year. Analysts suggest their success stems from strong brand loyalty, extensive international networks, and a strategic focus on premium travel, which better insulates them from market challenges like falling domestic airfares. While both carriers have trimmed their 2025 forecasts, they are capitalizing on revenue from premium cabins and lucrative loyalty programs. This strategy contrasts with other airlines that are struggling to remain profitable even during peak travel seasons. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's new biography, "Mark Twain," describes the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, a place that symbolized freedom in his youth. Traveling to gather material for his book "Life on the Mississippi," Twain, whose real name was Samuel Clemens, found a changed landscape where towns had moved and the once-bustling steamboat culture was in decline. Despite these changes, being back in a pilot house brought him immense joy, making him feel as if the intervening years had disappeared. The experience highlighted the deep connection he felt to his past as a riverboat pilot.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A July survey from the University of Michigan indicates that consumer fears about inflation have significantly decreased, with expectations falling to their lowest point since before new tariff announcements. The one-year inflation outlook dropped to 4.4% from 5.0% in June, while the five-year forecast also declined. Despite this improvement, overall consumer sentiment remains well below its levels from before the recent period of economic uncertainty. The data suggests that while the worst anxieties about tariff-induced price hikes have subsided, consumers still perceive a risk of future inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in President Trump's new "big beautiful bill" introduces a tax break for tipped workers, but its implementation details remain unclear. The "no tax on tips" measure is not a full exemption but a deduction of up to $25,000 on federal income tax, available from 2025 through 2028. However, tips are still subject to payroll and state taxes, and the IRS has yet to clarify which specific occupations will qualify for the deduction. Further uncertainty exists around reporting requirements, especially as the income thresholds for tax forms like the 1099-K and 1099-NEC have been changed.</p>

          <p>Avon and Somerset Police have announced that no further action will be taken against the Irish language rap trio Kneecap following a criminal investigation into their Glastonbury performance. The inquiry was launched after comments the group made on stage, which had been preceded by weeks of controversy over their pro-Palestinian stance. The police stated that after consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, they determined there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction." Kneecap had previously described the investigation as an act of "political policing intimidation."</p>

Speaking at an expo in China, the deputy commercial counsellor suggested that the upcoming review of the trade deal will likely focus on tightening rules-of-origin requirements rather than targeting companies from specific nations. This would mean products might need a higher percentage of local content to qualify for benefits. The statement comes amid ongoing trade rivalry between the U.S. and China.</p>

Egan recounts experiences with investors who demand weekend calls to test commitment, a practice she finds problematic.

Industry experts note that kids' content is highly effective at reducing churn because children watch shows repeatedly, providing consistent engagement at a lower production cost than adult-oriented content. This strategy is vital as services like Netflix, Disney+, and Paramount+ focus on profitability. Even as they build their own libraries, these companies are also partnering with YouTube, the dominant platform for youth viewership, to ensure they are reaching young audiences where they are.</p>
