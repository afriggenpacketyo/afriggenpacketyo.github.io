        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value soared to a new record, briefly exceeding $118,000, driven by the largest single-day inflow into bitcoin ETFs this year, totaling $1.18 billion. The rally was also supported by a broader tech stock surge and speculation about future dovish Federal Reserve policies. This price movement triggered over $550 million in short liquidations, further fueling the upward trend. Analysts suggest that while institutional interest remains strong, the market's short-term trajectory could be influenced by macroeconomic factors and the Fed's upcoming decisions.

          <p>Jannik Sinner has advanced to his first Wimbledon final after decisively defeating seven-time champion Novak Djokovic in straight sets. The 23-year-old Italian dominated the match, winning 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 against an aging Djokovic, who admitted to feeling the effects of wear and tear. Sinner's victory sets up a highly anticipated final against defending champion Carlos Alcaraz, a rematch of their recent five-set classic at the French Open. This marks Djokovic's first semi-final loss at Wimbledon since 2012, raising questions about his future chances of securing a record 25th Grand Slam title.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order prohibiting the Los Angeles Police Department from using rubber bullets and other less-lethal munitions against journalists covering protests. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera came in response to a lawsuit filed by press rights organizations, which argued that journalists were being unconstitutionally targeted during demonstrations. The order specifically bars the use of such crowd-control tools against reporters who do not pose an imminent threat. The judge cited instances where officers appeared to deliberately aim at clearly identifiable members of the press.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have unveiled a new bobblehead featuring the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant, which will be given to the first 40,000 fans at their August 8 game. The design appears to be inspired by a 2009 press day where Bryant, dressed in his full Lakers uniform, posed with a baseball bat. This giveaway continues the Dodgers' tradition of honoring Bryant, who, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, died in a 2020 helicopter crash. The team has previously held tribute nights and given away special Bryant-themed jerseys to commemorate his legacy.</p>

          <p>Delta Air Lines is considering introducing more fare options within its premium cabins, such as business and first class, mirroring the segmentation strategy it applied to its main economy cabin. The airline's president, Glen Hauenstein, noted that premium seating has been a key driver of margin expansion, and the goal is to offer different products to meet varying customer needs. While details are not finalized, possibilities could include cheaper premium fares with fewer perks or enhanced seats with more amenities. This focus on premium cabin segmentation reflects a broader industry trend where high-end travel demand remains robust.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:54:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. government recorded an unexpected budget surplus of $27 billion in June, a rare occurrence largely fueled by a significant increase in tariff collections. Customs duties for the month were over 300% higher than the previous year, contributing to a 13% overall rise in government receipts compared to June 2024. Despite this monthly surplus, the fiscal year-to-date deficit stands at $1.34 trillion. Persistently high interest payments on the national debt remain a major fiscal challenge, totaling $84 billion for the month alone. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Three Potential Ways for Seniors to Supplement Social Security Income</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 14:24:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid concerns about the future solvency of Social Security, seniors have several options to generate supplemental income. One method is a reverse mortgage, which allows homeowners aged 62 and older to receive monthly payments from their home equity without immediate repayment. Another option is purchasing an annuity, where a lump-sum payment to an insurer guarantees a reliable income stream for life. For more immediate needs, a personal loan can provide a financial buffer, though it involves taking on new debt and interest payments. (not investment advice)</p>

It was discovered by a couple in Ireland who are part of a local conservation group, and they were able to connect with the Squires after their discovery went viral on social media.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article posits that the current season of "Love Island USA" serves as an insightful, if unintentional, portrait of Gen Z's dating culture, characterized by emotional guardedness and a lack of relationship experience. The author observes that contestants seem to be going through the motions of romance without forming deep connections, a phenomenon they term "Situationship Island." This behavior is linked to the generation's anxiety about vulnerability and direct communication, which may have been exacerbated by growing up online and during the pandemic. The popularity of contestants who do show genuine emotion suggests viewers are hungry for the very vulnerability the cast seems to avoid.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has announced a new program to provide direct cash assistance to individuals and families affected by the Trump administration's recent immigration raids. The aid, funded by philanthropic partners rather than city funds, will be distributed via cash cards containing a few hundred dollars. The initiative aims to help those who are unable to work or are facing financial hardship due to a family member's detention. This program is part of a broader city response that includes reinforcing sanctuary city policies and seeking more information from federal authorities about the raids.</p>
