        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainty drives more investors toward gold, experts are highlighting the importance of secure storage for physical assets like coins and bars. The primary risks for home storage are theft and natural disasters, making off-site options like professional depositories or bank safety deposit boxes preferable for many. When using a third-party facility, it is crucial to ensure the gold is fully allocated in the owner's name and insured to protect against institutional failure. These storage methods come with annual fees, typically a small percentage of the gold's total value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The National Symphony Orchestra will begin every performance of its 2025–2026 season at the Kennedy Center by playing "The Star-Spangled Banner." This decision is intended to honor the 250th anniversary of the United States. Kennedy Center President Richard Grenell stated that it is appropriate for the nation's premier symphony to perform the anthem regularly. In addition to this patriotic gesture, the Kennedy Center is also expanding its outreach to military veterans by partnering with the nonprofit Vet Tix to provide thousands of free tickets to performances for service members and their families.</p>

          <p>Turkey has played a significant, albeit late, role in the negotiations for the Gaza peace deal between Israel and Hamas, leveraging its close relationship with the Palestinian group. President Erdoğan was reportedly asked by President Trump to help persuade Hamas to agree to the terms, with Turkey's intelligence chief later joining talks in Egypt. As part of the implementation, Turkey is expected to contribute to a task force, potentially assisting in locating the remains of Israeli hostages. This involvement marks a strategic diplomatic move for Ankara, positioning it as an influential mediator in the region.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has secured a deal with pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca to reduce the cost of its drugs for U.S. patients, following a similar agreement made with Pfizer. Under the arrangement, AstraZeneca will offer its medicines to Medicaid patients at the lowest price available in other developed nations, a concept President Trump refers to as "most-favored nation" pricing. This initiative is part of the administration's broader effort to pressure drugmakers to lower costs and increase manufacturing in the U.S. The deals have been reached under the threat of significant tariffs on the pharmaceutical sector.</p>

          <p>Chicha music, a uniquely Peruvian genre, represents a complex fusion of cultural influences that mirrors the nation's history of migration and identity. Originating in the 1960s, it blends the sounds of Colombian cumbia, Andean folk music (huayno), and psychedelic rock, with the electric guitar as its centerpiece. The music became an anthem for marginalized Andean migrants in Lima, with artists like Chacalón and the band Los Shapis rising to superstar status. Decades later, chicha remains a vibrant and essential part of Peru's cultural soundscape, celebrated as a symbol of popular art and resilience.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Trump's Personal Intervention Was Key to Securing Initial Gaza Ceasefire</h2>

          <p>After months of stalled negotiations, President Trump's direct pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly a critical factor in achieving the first phase of a new Gaza peace plan. The agreement includes a hostage-prisoner exchange and a partial Israeli withdrawal, marking a significant development in the two-year conflict. According to reports, Trump's frustration with Netanyahu's perceived intransigence grew, especially after an Israeli strike in Qatar nearly derailed talks, leading to a tense phone call where Trump pushed the Israeli leader to accept the deal. The durability of the ceasefire may now depend on Trump's continued personal engagement.</p>

          <h2>Retirees Advised to Weigh Benefits and Risks of Investing in Precious Metals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees considering precious metals, experts advise balancing the benefits of inflation hedging and portfolio diversification against the inherent risks. Gold is often seen as a stable store of value during economic turmoil but does not generate income like dividends or interest, which can be a drawback for those needing regular cash flow. Furthermore, physical gold incurs storage and insurance costs and is subject to a higher capital gains tax rate than stocks in the U.S. Financial planners typically suggest allocating a modest portion, around 5% to 10%, of a retirement portfolio to precious metals.

          <p>Global central banks are increasingly buying gold to diversify their reserves and reduce reliance on single currencies like the U.S. dollar, according to financial experts. Gold serves as a stable store of value, a hedge against inflation, and an asset with no counterparty risk, making it crucial during times of geopolitical tension or financial crisis. This historical trust in gold provides financial security and allows central banks to manage monetary policy with greater flexibility. The consistent demand from these major institutions underscores gold's enduring role as a foundational asset in the global financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With interest rates showing signs of softening, individuals with certificates of deposit (CDs) maturing soon are advised to plan their next steps proactively. It is important to review the bank's maturity notice to understand the grace period and automatic renewal terms, as rolling over could result in a lower yield. Savers should shop around for the best available rates on new CDs or consider high-yield savings accounts, which currently offer competitive returns with greater liquidity. Acting before the maturity date allows investors to lock in a favorable rate before potential further declines. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a recent cut in the Federal Reserve's benchmark rate, homeowners with high mortgage rates are exploring refinancing options to lower their monthly payments. A "good" refinance rate is subjective, but experts suggest that even a half-percentage point reduction can provide significant savings over the life of a loan. Current average rates for 30-year and 15-year fixed mortgages have fallen, and options like adjustable-rate mortgages or buying mortgage points can secure even lower initial rates. With more Fed rate cuts anticipated, the refinancing landscape may become even more favorable for homeowners in the coming months. (not investment advice)</p>
