          <h2>Researchers Identify Smoke-Dried Human Remains in Asia as Potentially World's Oldest Mummies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered what may be the world's oldest known mummies, dating back up to 12,000 years, across various sites in Southeast Asia. A new study suggests that hunter-gatherer communities practiced smoke-drying bodies over fires, a form of mummification that predates previously known examples from Egypt and the Chinchorro people of South America. This practice, evidenced by cut and burn marks on remains found in crouched positions, likely allowed ancient peoples to maintain physical and spiritual connections with their deceased ancestors. The findings indicate that this tradition was widespread and connects ancient funerary practices with those still found in some Indigenous communities today.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to introduce its latest AI-powered smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its upcoming Connect conference, marking a strategic shift from virtual reality headsets to a more mass-market product. The new device, expected to cost around $800, will feature a small display and be controlled by hand gestures via a wristband using neural technology. This launch comes as the company's Reality Labs division continues to post significant financial losses, prompting a focus on more accessible consumer hardware. The success of these glasses is seen as crucial for Meta to build a new computing platform and ecosystem to compete with Apple and Google.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:39:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures show that the number of recipients of the UK's winter fuel payment dropped by 9.3 million, to just 1.3 million, after the government controversially introduced means-testing. The payment, designed to help pensioners with energy bills, was restricted to those on low-income benefits. Following widespread public and political backlash, the Treasury has reversed the policy. Now, pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will be eligible again, restoring the benefit for more than three-quarters of pensioners for the upcoming winter. The initial cuts had a disproportionate impact on different regions of the country.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Solve Mystery of Blue Pigment in Famous 1948 Jackson Pollock Painting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:31:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have successfully identified the specific blue pigment used by artist Jackson Pollock in his iconic 1948 painting, "Number 1A, 1948." Through chemical analysis involving laser light scattering, scientists confirmed for the first time that the vibrant turquoise color is manganese blue, a synthetic pigment that was phased out in the 1990s due to environmental concerns. This discovery provides new insight into the materials used by the abstract expressionist and aids in the conservation of his work.

          <p>The Mt. Juliet police department in Tennessee is preparing to move into a new, larger headquarters, setting off a chain reaction of relocations and expansions for other community organizations. The current 14,500-square-foot police station will be renovated to become the new home for the city's Senior Activity Center, providing much-needed space for its growing membership. In turn, the senior center's current building is in discussions to be sold to the adjacent Mt. Juliet Church of Christ, which is looking to expand its own campus. The new police headquarters features enhanced security, a community tornado shelter, and ample room for future growth.</p>

          <h2>Mathematicians Celebrate Rare 'Pythagorean Triple Square Day' on 9/16/25</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Today's date, 9/16/25, holds a special significance for mathematicians as a rare 'Pythagorean Triple Square Day,' an occurrence that happens only once a century. The date is unique because each number (9, 16, and 25) is a perfect square of consecutive integers (3, 4, and 5). Furthermore, these base numbers form a Pythagorean triple, where 3 squared plus 4 squared equals 5 squared (9 + 16 = 25), representing the famous theorem for right triangles. Experts note this beautiful mathematical coincidence offers a moment to appreciate the hidden patterns and elegance within numbers, providing a source of comfort and wonder.</p>

          <h2>Doctor Weighs the Pros and Cons of Telehealth Versus In-Person Medical Care</h2>

          <p>A primary care physician addresses the growing prevalence of telehealth, explaining its benefits and drawbacks for patients. While telehealth offers undeniable convenience, especially for straightforward issues like prescription refills or for patients in rural areas, it has significant limitations. It cannot replace in-person visits for conditions requiring a physical exam, and using an unfamiliar online doctor might lead to more cautious, less personalized care and potentially higher costs if further evaluation is needed. The article suggests that the ideal approach is to use telehealth as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, a long-term relationship with a regular doctor.</p>

          <p>The South Coast Botanic Garden in Palos Verdes Estates will host a traveling exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Around the World' this holiday season, featuring 13 lifelike animatronic dinosaurs. The figures, including a nearly 30-foot-long Tyrannosaurus rex, will be displayed along two walking trails from November through January. The exhibit aims to merge the wonder of a theme park with the natural beauty of the 87-acre garden, highlighting the connection between the prehistoric reptiles and the garden's collection of 'living fossils' like Ginkgo trees and Dawn Redwoods. A separately ticketed tram tour will also be available on weekends.</p>

          <p>As more consumers abandon traditional pay TV, news organizations are increasingly turning to free ad-supported streaming television (FAST) channels to retain and attract viewers. Major networks like ABC, NBC, and CNN, along with local station groups, are launching FAST channels on platforms such as Roku and Tubi, offering a mix of repeated newscasts and original streaming content. This strategy aims to reach a younger demographic that primarily consumes information online. While still reliant on cable revenue, outlets see these free channels as essential for their future, providing a more informal and accessible news experience.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues for the Power of Awe to Counter Political Division and Despair</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the face of rising political extremism and the 'dark passions' fueling attacks on liberal democracy, this essay posits that cultivating the emotion of awe is an essential countermeasure. Drawing on psychology and theology, the author explains that awe—the feeling evoked by greatness, beauty, or the sublime—can reduce anxiety, quiet the ego, and foster pro-social behaviors like generosity and empathy. By shifting focus from the self to something larger, awe helps expand one's moral circle and encourages humility. The article suggests that intentionally seeking out experiences of awe in nature, art, and human connection can reawaken our higher aspirations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite viral social media videos portraying Germany as overrun by crime, criminologists assert that the country remains very safe by international standards. While certain urban districts, like Frankfurt's Bahnhofsviertel, have long-standing issues with drug-related crime, overall crime has decreased significantly since the 1990s. Germany's murder rate is substantially lower than that of many other nations, including the United States. Experts note that while there has been a recent uptick in violent offenses, this is often linked to socioeconomic factors like unemployment and trauma among specific demographics, rather than a person's country of origin.</p>

          <p>The athletic rivalry between Indian javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra and Pakistan's Arshad Nadeem is set to resume at the World Athletics Championships, drawing immense interest from both nations. Chopra won gold at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, while Nadeem took the top spot at the 2024 Paris Olympics, making them both national heroes in countries with limited Olympic success. Despite the intense political tensions between India and Pakistan, the two athletes share a mutual respect, and their families have expressed sentiments of brotherhood. However, geopolitical events have previously impacted their relationship, leading to a canceled invitation for Nadeem to compete in India.</p>
