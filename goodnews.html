          <p>Musician John Fogerty reflects on his career and the emotional journey of re-recording his classic Creedence Clearwater Revival songs for a new album, "Legacy." After losing control of his music catalog following the band's breakup in 1972, Fogerty endured years of legal and personal struggles, which he compares to a form of death for an artist. Encouraged by his wife Julie, he eventually repurchased the rights and recorded the new versions with his sons, an experience he describes as both a family affair and a deeply personal process of revisiting the feelings from when he first created the iconic tracks.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has secured its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence stated the contract will support approximately 4,000 UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 anti-submarine frigates to operate in northern Europe, representing a significant win for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, a student explains the decision to turn down an admission offer from Yale University in favor of attending a small Bible college. The author argues that elite institutions like Yale have shifted from promoting intellectual rigor to enforcing ideological conformity, which stifles dissenting views. The choice was framed not as a rejection of academic challenge, but as an embrace of a different kind of formation focused on character, faith, and wrestling with eternal questions. The author contends that this path offers a more genuine intellectual freedom and a deeper sense of purpose than the prestige associated with an Ivy League degree.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Sanjay Gupta's new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," delves into the complexities of chronic pain, revealing that its source often lies within the brain rather than the site of a physical injury. The article highlights the case of a musician with complex regional pain syndrome whose debilitating pain was traced to his brain memorizing an old injury incorrectly. Through an experimental deep brain stimulation treatment, doctors were able to predict and interrupt his pain signals before he consciously felt them. This research suggests a revolutionary approach to managing pain, framing it as a neurological condition that can potentially be retrained or controlled.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed painter Alex Katz, known for his distinctive figurative art and landscapes, is now focusing on championing the work of other artists at the age of 98. He has gifted a collection of over 100 paintings to Maine's Portland Museum of Art for an exhibition titled "Painting Energy." Katz, who initially struggled for recognition in a world dominated by abstract art, says he wants to help other artists who face similar difficulties.

          <p>In a personal essay, a self-described liberal writer makes the case for hunting as an honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat, challenging the reflexive disdain for the practice often found on the left. The author recounts the emotional and physical experience of hunting, arguing that it fosters a profound connection to nature and a direct responsibility for one's food, unlike the detached consumption of factory-farmed products. The piece also explores how hunting in the U.S. is a diverse activity that directly funds wildlife conservation through taxes on firearms and ammunition, suggesting that hunters and environmentalists share common ground.</p>

          <p>Actor Jeremy Allen White is portraying Bruce Springsteen in the film "Deliver Me From Nowhere," which focuses on the creation of Springsteen's stark 1982 album, "Nebraska." In an interview, White discusses the daunting task of playing the rock icon, particularly during a time when Springsteen was battling depression and feelings of fraudulence. White found a connection with the character's inability to form real connections off-stage, drawing parallels to his role in "The Bear." With Springsteen's direct involvement and approval, the film aims to be an "antibiopic," exploring a specific, vulnerable slice of the musician's life.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the fall season, specifically for adults aged 65 and older and for younger individuals with medical conditions that place them at high risk for severe illness.

The list of high-risk conditions is extensive, including common ailments like asthma, diabetes, and obesity, making an estimated 100 to 200 million people eligible under the new framework.</p>

          <p>A new museum exhibition in Santa Cruz, California, commemorates the 140th anniversary of three Hawaiian princes introducing surfing to the American mainland. In 1885, teenage royals David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui were studying at a nearby military school when they fashioned surfboards from local redwood and rode the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. Their demonstration of what was then a royal Hawaiian sport captivated locals and planted the seed for surfing culture in the United States. The exhibition aims to shed light on these little-known origins of the now-popular sport.</p>

          <p>As part of a broader initiative to combat plastic pollution, the Australian state of South Australia has banned single-use, fish-shaped soy sauce containers. The small, pre-filled plastic containers are a staple in many Asian restaurants but are difficult to recycle due to their size, often ending up as environmental waste. The ban is an extension of previous legislation that targeted other single-use plastics like straws and carrier bags. Officials hope the policy will help reduce plastic flow into the ocean and protect marine life, though consumers will still have access to soy sauce from larger bottles and sachets.</p>

          <p>New Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh has ambitious goals for quarterback Justin Herbert, stating he wants to help him win Super Bowls and reach the Hall of Fame. Entering his sixth season, Herbert is considered a top talent but has yet to win a playoff game, raising questions about his elite status among AFC quarterbacks like Patrick Mahomes and Josh Allen. The team's offensive strategy under Harbaugh and coordinator Greg Roman is expected to feature a more physical running game to support the passing attack. However, a significant challenge emerged with a season-ending injury to star left tackle Rashawn Slater.</p>
