          <p>Naomi Osaka has reached the third round of the US Open after a convincing 6-3, 6-1 victory over Hailey Baptiste, continuing her strong performance since returning from maternity leave. This win helps move past a recent controversy in Montreal, where she was criticized for her runner-up speech, an event she described as causing her "shame." Now having won eight of her last nine matches, Osaka is set to face either Daria Kasatkina or Kamilla Rakhimova as she aims for her first Grand Slam fourth-round appearance since 2021.</p>

          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival, with some critics lauding it as a "midlife crisis masterpiece." In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney plays an aging movie star grappling with his life choices and legacy, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film, which also stars Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, explores themes of identity and self-reflection, and Clooney's nuanced performance is already generating awards season buzz.</p>

          <h2>Expiring Federal Tax Credit Makes Labor Day an Ideal Time to Lease Electric Vehicles</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-28 18:25:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to automotive research firm Edmunds, this Labor Day weekend presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. A $7,500 federal tax credit for new EV leases is set to expire on September 30, making leasing a particularly attractive option. With EV prices already declining due to softer demand, the expiring credit provides an additional incentive for potential buyers to consider leasing, which experts suggest is a good way to test the technology without a long-term commitment.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that Kari Lake, a Trump administration official, cannot legally fire Michael Abramowitz, the director of Voice of America. The judge stated that such a removal requires the backing of a congressionally mandated advisory panel, which is currently non-functional as President Trump has not filled its vacant seats. The ruling is a setback for Lake's efforts to reshape the international broadcaster, which the judge noted have been contrary to statutory requirements designed to protect the agency from political pressure.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the end of World War II, the relationship between China and Japan is marked by a significant paradox. A new Chinese film depicting the 1937 Nanking massacre has become a box office hit, tapping into deep-seated historical trauma and nationalist sentiment. Simultaneously, Chinese tourism to Japan is surging, with over 970,000 visitors in July alone, making China the top source of tourists. This dynamic illustrates a complex "love-hate" relationship shaped by historical wounds, geopolitical rivalry, and strong economic and cultural ties.</p>
