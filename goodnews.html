          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has predicted an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, forecasting 13 to 19 named storms between June 1 and November 30.

The Navy's initial search terms identified 381 titles, but the new review found only two or three requiring removal, pending further evaluation by a DOD panel.

However, critics point out that the plan does not address the needs of the 17 million children currently excluded from the existing $2,000 credit. The bill also requires both parents to have a Social Security number when filing jointly, potentially excluding 4.5 million children who are U.S. citizens or lawfully present.

Anthropic has shifted its focus from chatbots to improving Claude's ability to handle complex tasks like research and coding. The company aims to address the risk of models going off the rails when performing more complex tasks.</p>

          <p>The US Treasury Department has confirmed that one cent coins will stop being produced in the US next year, marking the phasing out of the coins, commonly known as pennies, which have been in circulation for more than two centuries. The penny was one of the first coins made by the US Mint, entering circulation in 1793. The Mint estimates that stopping production will result in an immediate annual saving of $56m in reduced material costs.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the evolving role of WAGs (wives and girlfriends of athletes) from tabloid targets to social media influencers. The rise of reality shows like "WAGS" and social media has allowed these women to craft their own narratives and build careers. While some are independently successful, the article questions why these women are often defined by their relationships and whether they receive more attention than female athletes. The piece notes that WAGs often reinforce traditional gender roles and heteronormativity.</p>
