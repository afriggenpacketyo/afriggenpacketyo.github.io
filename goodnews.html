          <p>The Kremlin has announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed to a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, which is expected to take place in the coming days. According to a Putin adviser, preparations for the summit have already begun, although a specific date and location have not yet been disclosed. The adviser mentioned that a trilateral meeting including Ukrainian President Zelenskyy had been suggested but confirmed the upcoming talks would be exclusively between the U.S. and Russian leaders. This development follows a meeting between Putin and a U.S. special envoy aimed at finding a resolution to the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery announced strong second-quarter financial results, largely propelled by the success of its film studios. Theatrical hits like "A Minecraft Movie" and "Sinners" helped the studios segment achieve a 55% increase in revenue to $3.8 billion. CEO David Zaslav highlighted the significant turnaround for the motion picture division, which has been a focus of rebuilding efforts since the 2022 merger. The company expressed confidence in continued momentum, projecting at least $2.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA for the full year for the studios segment and noting the strong opening of "Superman" will boost third-quarter results.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate to 4%, a move that will have varied effects on UK households. For homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, this will likely lead to lower monthly payments, though those on fixed rates will see no immediate change. Conversely, the rate cut is unfavorable for savers, as interest paid on savings accounts is expected to fall further, diminishing returns, especially with inflation forecast to rise. The central bank's decision aims to stimulate the economy and support the jobs market, but it creates a challenging environment for those relying on savings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International, the parent company of Burger King, Tim Hortons, and Popeyes, reported mixed second-quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share falling short of analyst expectations. While overall revenue beat forecasts, driven by strong 4.2% same-store sales growth in its international division and a solid performance from Tim Hortons, the Popeyes brand was a weak point with a 1.4% decline in same-store sales. CEO Josh Kobza noted a modest improvement in the consumer environment compared to the first quarter. The company is continuing its turnaround efforts at Burger King's U.S. division, where over half of restaurants have now been renovated.</p>

The test, conducted at a site simulating the lunar surface, verified the lander's ascent and descent systems under complex operational conditions. This progress comes as the space race between the U.S. and China intensifies, with NASA's Artemis program also aiming for a crewed lunar landing in the coming years. A successful Chinese mission would advance its plans for a permanent International Lunar Research Station, a joint project with Russia.</p>

          <p>India has sent its first official delegation to Damascus to engage with Syria's new provisional government, which took power after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime. The visit, led by a senior official from India's Ministry of External Affairs, aimed to understand the interim government's priorities and discuss cooperation in health, education, and humanitarian aid. Analysts suggest this outreach is part of India's non-aligned foreign policy, allowing it to engage with diverse regimes to promote regional stability and secure its own strategic interests. The move is seen as a pragmatic step to ensure India is not sidelined in Syria's future reconstruction and political landscape.</p>

          <p>Ant Digital, an affiliate of Chinese fintech giant Ant Group, is actively promoting its blockchain platform in Hong Kong for the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). The push comes just a week after the city implemented its new regulatory framework for stablecoins. The company is positioning its self-developed Jovay blockchain as a bridge between traditional finance (Web2) and the decentralized digital economy (Web3). Ant Digital plans to officially launch Jovay in September, at which point the platform will be capable of handling transactions with real currency, marking a significant step in the integration of blockchain technology into mainstream finance.</p>

          <p>U.S. companies are increasingly tracking and enforcing office attendance policies, with monitoring rates reaching their highest level since the pandemic began, according to a new CBRE report. Nearly 70% of surveyed companies now monitor attendance, a significant jump from 45% last year, as they push for employees to be in the office an average of 3.2 days a week. Despite high overall office vacancy rates, a majority of companies expect to maintain or expand their office space over the next three years. This trend reflects a growing corporate desire for a return to in-person collaboration, even as hybrid work models remain prevalent.</p>

          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order directing the Labor Department to review guidance on including alternative assets in 401(k) plans. This move would allow investments such as private equity, real estate, and cryptocurrencies within these defined-contribution retirement accounts. The action is seen as a significant victory for the alternative asset industry, which has advocated for broader access to the trillions of dollars held in American retirement funds. Proponents believe it could expand investment opportunities, while critics raise concerns about the higher risks and fees associated with these assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly has raised its full-year financial outlook after reporting second-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street estimates, driven by soaring demand for its diabetes and weight loss drugs. Sales for Mounjaro and Zepbound reached nearly $5.2 billion and $3.38 billion respectively, both beating expectations. The pharmaceutical giant now projects 2025 sales between $60 billion and $62 billion. However, the company's stock dipped in premarket trading after late-stage trial data for its experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron, showed weight loss results that were below what some investors had hoped for, tempering the otherwise strong report.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's proposed 100% tariff on imported semiconductors, major global chipmakers are highlighting their significant investments in the United States. Companies may avoid the levy if they are building or have committed to building manufacturing facilities in the U.S. Taiwan's TSMC has pledged $165 billion in U.S. investments, while South Korea's Samsung and SK Hynix also have substantial American operations and commitments. U.S.-based GlobalFoundries and AI-chip designer Nvidia are also positioned to benefit, as the policy is designed to onshore the semiconductor supply chain and reduce reliance on foreign manufacturing, particularly from Asia.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is looking to acquire two Tesla Cybertrucks for use in "live missile fire testing," according to government contracting documents. A justification for the purchase states that adversaries are "likely" to begin using the durable, stainless-steel-clad vehicles on the battlefield. The document notes that Cybertrucks have been found to not sustain the normal extent of damage expected from major impacts, making them relevant targets for munitions testing. The Air Force requires the vehicles to be towable but not functional, with their batteries removed, for the tests at White Sands Missile Range.</p>
