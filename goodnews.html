          <p>A federal appeals court has extended the order allowing President Trump to deploy the National Guard to Los Angeles, rejecting a lower court's ruling that favored California Governor Gavin Newsom. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals sided with the Trump administration, stating that the president likely acted within his statutory authority under Title 10, which allows federalizing the Guard in cases of rebellion or inability to enforce U.S. laws. The court found that the administration presented sufficient facts to suggest a "colorable basis" for invoking Title 10, citing instances of protesters interfering with immigration agents, with the panel composed of two Trump appointees and one Biden appointee. The ruling allows roughly 4,000 National Guard troops to continue protecting federal property and assisting immigration agents in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The Indiana Pacers delivered a decisive 108-91 victory over the Oklahoma City Thunder, forcing a Game 7 in the NBA Finals. With their backs against the wall, the Pacers showcased stellar depth and stifling defense, led by Obi Toppin's 20 points off the bench and Andrew Nembhard's 17 points. The Thunder struggled with turnovers, committing 21 in total, with MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander accounting for eight of them, as the Pacers capitalized with 22 fast-break points. The series now shifts back to Oklahoma City for a decisive Game 7 to determine the NBA champion; the Pacers' depth and Haliburton's performance proved crucial in extending the series.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has maintained its benchmark lending rates, following recent monetary easing measures and progress in trade relations with the U.S. The 1-year loan prime rate (LPR) remains at 3.0%, while the 5-year LPR is steady at 3.5%, aligning with market expectations. This decision comes after China reduced lending rates for the first time since October, aiming to mitigate trade tensions with the U.S. Recent agreements between U.S. and Chinese trade representatives have eased trade-war fears, allowing for tech and rare earth trade while suspending tariffs, giving Beijing room to support its currency and potentially reduce the need for aggressive fiscal stimulus.

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile retrial in Massachusetts; however, she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read struck O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed in an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. Key events included O'Keefe's death in January 2022, Read's arrest, and a mistrial in the first trial due to a hung jury, with the second trial culminating in the acquittal on major charges. The timeline includes conflicting accounts of events, such as the timing of a Google search about how long it takes to die in the cold and allegations of a coverup by law enforcement officials.</p>

          <p>An explosion occurred outside the Norwegian ambassador's residence in Tel Aviv on Thursday after a grenade was thrown into the yard; fortunately, no injuries were reported. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar spoke with Norway's Ambassador to Israel, Per Egil Selvaag, condemning the attack as a "serious and dangerous crime." The motive behind the attack remains unclear, and authorities are investigating the incident to determine the perpetrators and their reasons. This incident follows Norway's symbolic recognition of a Palestinian state last year, along with Spain and Ireland, and criticism of Israel's actions during the Gaza war, which adds a layer of complexity to potential motives.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Trump administration retains authority over National Guard troops deployed in Los Angeles, while California's legal challenge proceeds. The court found that the president has broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, though this authority is not "unreviewable." The ruling allows federal troops to remain in Los Angeles while the case is litigated, returning the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer. The appellate panel questioned both sides, and the ruling focused on the limits of presidential power, while leaving unresolved the allegation that the administration violated the Posse Comitatus Act.</p>

The ruling blocks the Department of Transportation from imposing conditions on funding related to immigration enforcement and diversity programs, finding no plausible connection between cooperating with ICE and the congressionally approved purposes of transportation funding. The judge determined that the public interest favored an injunction to prevent disruptions in transportation services and projects.</p>

The surge in rice prices coincides with Japan's core inflation rate climbing to 3.7% in May, its highest level since January 2023, with the so-called "core-core" inflation rate also rising.

          <h2>Chinese Provinces Employ Special-Purpose Bonds to Alleviate Debt Burdens</h2>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to utilize special-purpose bond proceeds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment to the annual fiscal budget marks a shift from using these bonds for revenue-generating construction projects to covering government arrears. The funds will be distributed based on eligible outstanding debts from existing investment projects, prioritizing completion of construction, clearing obligations, and reducing fiscal risk. While seen as a step in the right direction, some analysts caution that the allocated sum may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt.</p>
