          <h2>UK Government to Establish New Water Ombudsman to Address Consumer Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:30:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has announced the creation of a new water ombudsman to handle consumer issues like leaks and incorrect billing. This initiative is part of a larger overhaul of the water industry, which faces public anger over rising bills and record sewage discharges into waterways. The announcement comes as the sector's regulator, Ofwat, is under scrutiny for being ineffective, with the Environment Secretary describing the industry as "broken." While the plan is intended to empower consumers, critics question if it will be sufficient to solve deep-rooted problems of under-investment and pollution.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 17:12:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new mural honoring the late Fernando Valenzuela was unveiled at Dodger Stadium, immortalizing the iconic pitcher who passed away nine months ago. Created by Mexican-American artist Robert Vargas, the artwork depicts Valenzuela in his famous wind-up pose and is intended to symbolize unity within the Latino community. Valenzuela, a beloved figure who sparked "Fernandomania" in the 1980s, was a cultural icon for Latino fans and helped connect the community to the Dodgers. Fans at the unveiling expressed deep emotional connections to the player, whose story of rising from a small town in Mexico represented hope and triumph over adversity.</p>

          <p>Following his decisive win at The Open, Scottie Scheffler is drawing comparisons to golf legends like Tiger Woods from his fellow competitors. Peers including Xander Schauffele and Rory McIlroy praised his sustained dominance over the past two to three years, a run they described as historically significant. Shane Lowry noted that Scheffler's unconventional swing might mask his true level of mastery, suggesting that if his form looked more conventional, the comparisons to Woods would be even more prevalent. The consensus among players is that Scheffler is currently in a league of his own, setting a new standard of excellence in the sport.</p>
