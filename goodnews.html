          <h2>Scottie Scheffler Establishes Dominant Four-Shot Lead Ahead of The Open's Final Round</h2>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler appears poised to win his first Open Championship, holding a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final day at Royal Portrush. His performance has created an air of inevitability, with bookmakers giving him extremely short odds to secure what would be his fourth major title. Scheffler's unflappable demeanor and consistent play, including crucial par saves and a key birdie on the 16th hole, have left competitors like Matt Fitzpatrick and Li Haotong with a significant challenge. His mindset of focusing on one shot at a time underscores his relentless and dominant presence in the sport.</p>

          <p>Germany, under Chancellor Friedrich Merz, is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on a strengthened security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, known as the "E3." This move is driven by the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty surrounding the United States' commitment to European defense. The new German-UK treaty enhances security and arms cooperation, complementing the existing Franco-German partnership. While this trilateral cooperation is significant, Merz has emphasized that it is intended to supplement, not replace, the US defense guarantee, acknowledging Europe's need to increase its own defense spending and take more responsibility for its security.</p>

          <h2>Scottie Scheffler Holds Four-Shot Lead After Third Round of The Open</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 15:08:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>World number one Scottie Scheffler is four shots clear of the field heading into the final round of the Open Championship at Royal Portrush. After a solid, bogey-free round of 67, he sits at 14 under par, with China's Li Haotong as his closest competitor. A victory would mark Scheffler's third major of his career and put him three-quarters of the way to a career Grand Slam. Despite an early charge from Rory McIlroy, who delighted the home crowd with a 66, Scheffler's consistent and error-free play has made him the overwhelming favorite to lift the Claret Jug.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Why Barcelona is Pursuing Manchester United's Marcus Rashford</h2>

          <p>Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford is reportedly nearing a loan move to Barcelona, a transfer that raises questions given his recent form. After being sidelined at United by manager Ruben Amorim for a perceived lack of effort, Rashford is seeking a fresh start. For Barcelona, the move is a strategic one after failing to sign other targets like Nico Williams and Luis Diaz. The loan deal, with an option to buy, presents a low-financial-risk opportunity for the Spanish club to acquire a talented, experienced player who could be a major asset if he rediscovers his top form.</p>

          <p>According to a regulatory filing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold an additional 75,000 shares of company stock on Friday, valued at approximately $12.94 million. This transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan established in March, which allows Huang to sell up to 6 million shares. The sale follows another significant divestment earlier in the week. The surge in demand for Nvidia's AI-powering chips has dramatically increased the company's market capitalization and Huang's personal net worth, recently making Nvidia the world's most valuable company.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a 27-19 victory over Australia in their first Test, with flankers Tom Curry and Tadhg Beirne delivering "immense" performances. Coach Andy Farrell lauded the pair, who were instrumental in the win with their physicality and key turnovers, setting a dominant tone from the start. Curry, in particular, responded to recent criticism of his form with a relentless and aggressive display, though he was notably taciturn with the media afterward. The victory gives the Lions a crucial 1-0 lead in the series ahead of the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>The article profiles Generation Life, a Pennsylvania-based Christian group of young adults who travel to the Jersey Shore to advocate for "chastity before marriage." Facing a largely unreceptive audience, the activists attempt to connect with their peers by discussing modern relationship challenges, such as the negative impacts of social media, before introducing their message. The group defines chastity not just as abstinence but as a "countercultural" way of life focused on seeing people with dignity beyond their physical bodies. Their mission aims to provide an alternative path in an era of widespread secularism and changing sexual norms.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers third baseman Max Muncy is recovering from his left knee bone bruise ahead of schedule and could return sooner than the initially anticipated six weeks. Muncy described himself as lucky, as doctors told him a slight difference in the timing of the injury-causing slide could have resulted in surgery. He has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings without significant discomfort. His return is highly anticipated by the Dodgers, whose offense has struggled significantly since the slugger was placed on the injured list at the beginning of July.</p>

          <p>Twenty-eight years after the event, Great Britain's 1997 men's 4x400m relay team has finally been presented with their world championship gold medals. The team, which finished second in Athens, was upgraded from silver after the US team was disqualified due to a doping admission by member Antonio Pettigrew in 2008. The belated ceremony took place at the London Diamond League meeting, where Roger Black, Iwan Thomas, Jamie Baulch, Mark Richardson, and Mark Hylton received their medals in front of a large home crowd. The moment was described as a chance to recognize their talent and values.</p>
