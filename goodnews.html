          <p>President Donald Trump's administration, spearheaded by Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, played a pivotal role in orchestrating the initial Israel-Hamas ceasefire and hostage exchange deal. The article details the complex negotiations, including a tense Israeli cabinet meeting where hard-line minister Itamar Ben-Gvir initially resisted the terms. Trump reportedly leveraged his strong ties with Israel and Arab nations, expressing humanitarian concerns over Gaza's suffering, to push through a comprehensive 20-point peace plan. This breakthrough, which includes a vision for post-war governance and an international stabilization force, comes after previous attempts failed, showcasing a unique, business-like approach to diplomacy.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly in advanced discussions to acquire key talent and technology from computer vision startup Prompt AI, a move that would bolster its artificial intelligence capabilities. The 11-person company, which had also drawn interest from Elon Musk's xAI and Neuralink, informed its employees of the impending transaction. Prompt AI's flagship app, Seemour, offered sophisticated home security camera features but ultimately failed as a business model, leading to its retirement. This acquisition aligns with Apple's strategy of integrating smaller teams to enhance its product lines, particularly within its HomeKit smart home division and its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, despite recent stock underperformance.

          <p>Disney's "Tron" franchise returns with "Tron: Ares," a film that, according to the article, continues its legacy of visually spectacular but narratively convoluted storytelling. The movie is praised for its dazzling CGI and techno-futuristic aesthetic but criticized for a "rock-brained screenplay" and superficial engagement with artificial intelligence concepts. "Ares" attempts to ground the series by bringing sentient computer programs into the physical world, focusing on a "permanence code" that could manifest digital entities into concrete forms. Despite thrilling crossover sequences and a pulsating Nine Inch Nails score, the article notes a lack of charisma in Jared Leto's protagonist, leaving many scientific and philosophical questions unanswered.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its 15th five-year plan, the comprehensive blueprint is expected to signify a crucial shift in the nation's foreign investment strategy, moving from a focus on "quantity to quality."

          <p>A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has officially come into effect, initiating a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops from parts of Gaza and commencing a crucial hostage release process. Under the US-brokered agreement, Hamas is expected to release all Israeli hostages by Monday, while Israel will free Palestinian prisoners. Humanitarian aid lorries are anticipated to deliver desperately needed supplies to Gaza, where a famine was declared in August. Thousands of Palestinians are now making their way north, many on foot, towards heavily damaged areas of Gaza City, as Hamas concurrently rejects any foreign guardianship over the territory's future governance.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, effectively blocking the Trump administration from imposing specific conditions on grants funding domestic violence efforts. These conditions aimed to prevent recipient groups from promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion or providing abortion resources. The ruling is crucial for ensuring that vital services to victims of homelessness and domestic and sexual assault are not disrupted by political agendas. The judge's decision applies broadly to all applicants for funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, reinforcing the principle that federal grants should serve people in need.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump visited Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a "routine yearly checkup," an unusual occurrence given it's just six months after his last annual physical exam. The White House did not provide an explanation for the timing of this second checkup, which took place before a planned trip to the Middle East following the announcement of a Gaza peace deal. Trump, 79, characterized the visit as a "semi-annual physical" and affirmed he feels "very good" both physically and mentally. His previous April physical results indicated no major abnormalities, although later reports mentioned chronic venous insufficiency. Presidents typically utilize Walter Reed for comprehensive medical evaluations beyond basic White House care.</p>
