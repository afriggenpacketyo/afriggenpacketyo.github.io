          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 00:42:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google is hiring Varun Mohan, CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff, in a significant move amid the escalating AI talent competition. The deal involves Google paying $2.4 billion for non-exclusive licensing of Windsurf's technology and for employee compensation, though it is not an acquisition of the company itself. This strategic hiring follows similar talent acquisitions by competitors like Microsoft and Meta and underscores the high value placed on specialized AI expertise in the tech industry. Windsurf will continue to operate independently under a new interim CEO.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's value surged to a new record, briefly exceeding $121,000, driven by substantial inflows into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). On a single day last week, these ETFs saw inflows of $1.18 billion, indicating strong institutional interest. Analysts suggest this momentum from long-term institutional buyers could propel the cryptocurrency's price even higher in the near future. The rally is also supported by the anticipation of clearer U.S. regulatory frameworks for digital assets, with Congress set to deliberate on new crypto-related bills. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's Export Growth in June Exceeds Expectations Amid Shifting Trade Dynamics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 00:15:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, surpassing forecasts, largely due to strong demand from non-U.S. markets like Southeast Asia and the European Union. A temporary tariff truce with the United States also helped slow the decline in shipments to America. While imports saw a modest 1.1% increase, this marked the first import growth of the year, signaling a potential shift in domestic demand. These figures highlight China's ongoing efforts to diversify its trade partners in response to U.S. tariff policies and ongoing economic negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew by 1.4% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession after contracting in the previous quarter. This growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, beating economists' expectations. However, Singapore's Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, highlighting significant uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy for the latter half of the year due to unclear U.S. tariff policies. The positive data comes ahead of an upcoming monetary policy decision by the nation's central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Kwon Ping Ho, founder of the Banyan Group luxury hotel chain, the modern tourist is vastly different from those of 30 years ago. He observes that younger travelers, already jaded with conventional tourism, are seeking deeper, more authentic experiences that involve interaction with local communities rather than just sightseeing. Ho also notes a shift toward "rainbow tourism," with a more diverse, multi-directional flow of travelers from developing nations.
