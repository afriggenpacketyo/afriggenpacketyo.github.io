        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK High Court has granted Palestine Action permission to challenge its proscription under terrorism legislation, citing potential conflicts with free speech rights and a lack of prior consultation by the Home Secretary. This decision marks a significant legal development for the group, which has engaged in direct actions against defense firms linked to Israel, causing an estimated £7 million in damages. The judge highlighted the public interest in a swift, authoritative determination of the ban's legality to prevent widespread challenges in criminal proceedings. Internal government documents revealed extensive deliberations, with police advocating for the ban to address "high-level offenses" and the Foreign Office warning of perceptions of bias and social cohesion challenges.</p>

          <p>An 8.8 magnitude earthquake near Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered widespread tsunami warnings across the Pacific, impacting Hawaii, the U.S. West Coast, and Japan. Hawaii's warning was subsequently downgraded to an advisory after only minor flooding and small waves were observed, with no major damage reported across the islands. Experts cautioned that tsunami effects, characterized by a series of waves, could persist for several hours. While evacuation orders were lifted, officials urged continued vigilance regarding potentially dangerous currents, emphasizing the need for public safety protocols in earthquake-prone regions.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's urgent calls for interest rate reductions, economists widely predict the Federal Reserve will maintain its benchmark rate today, which has been stable since December 2024. The central bank's policy aims to control inflation, currently at 2.7%, exceeding its 2% target. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has consistently asserted that monetary policy decisions are driven by economic data, not political influence, particularly as new tariffs could potentially reignite inflation. The Federal Open Market Committee is expected to hold off on cuts until at least September, prioritizing economic stability amidst evolving conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy grew at a better-than-expected 3% annual rate in the second quarter, largely propelled by an improved trade balance and stronger consumer spending. This rebound follows a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter, which was partly attributed to businesses stockpiling imports ahead of President Trump's tariffs. Despite ongoing trade policy uncertainties, the economic report indicated resilience. Consumer spending rose, and core inflation, a key Federal Reserve metric, eased to 2.5%. President Trump responded by urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, though the Fed is anticipated to maintain its current stance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent slight declines, Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remain appealing, with many banks offering yields above 4%. Financial experts recommend several strategies to maximize returns amidst ongoing economic uncertainties and potential Federal Reserve actions.

Employing CD laddering across various maturities can hedge against future rate shifts, while choosing shorter terms often yields higher returns currently. Additionally, investors should avoid automatic CD renewals and consider flexible options like no-penalty or bump-up CDs for greater control. (not investment advice)</p>
