          <p>Dodgers star Mookie Betts missed games against the New York Yankees due to a fractured toe sustained while walking to the bathroom in the dark. Manager Dave Roberts expects Betts to be day-to-day and avoid the injured list, though wearing a shoe was difficult. Betts is currently having a down year relative to his career numbers, batting .254 with eight home runs and 31 RBIs. This injury follows a similar incident where Freddie Freeman missed games after slipping in the shower, adding to the Dodgers' list of unexpected setbacks this season. The team hopes to navigate these challenges as they continue their series against the Yankees.</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie defeated Jacob Fearnley in the French Open third round, overcoming distractions from loud fireworks outside Paris St-Germain's stadium, where fans gathered for the Champions League final. Norrie won 6-3, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2, with the match interrupted by bangs and noises throughout. He acknowledged the difficulty in managing the external disturbances, using his experience to control the match against Fearnley, who appeared to sustain an injury in the second set. Norrie now advances to the last 16, potentially facing Novak Djokovic, after a three-hour match played in unusual circumstances.</p>

          <p>This article provides guidance on delaying Medicare enrollment and its impact on health savings account (HSA) contributions. Delaying Medicare can lead to penalties unless you or your spouse is working for an employer with 20 or more employees, allowing you to opt for employer-provided insurance. Delaying also allows continued HSA contributions, which are disallowed upon Medicare enrollment; in 2025, HSA contribution limits are $4,300 for self-only and $8,550 for family coverage, plus a $1,000 catch-up for those 55 and older. The article also clarifies the differences between the home sale exemption and 1031 exchanges for capital gains taxes on real estate sales.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees, but later corrected the figure. The public was advised to avoid the area, while beekeepers worked to recover the hives and save as many bees as possible. The road was closed for about 24 hours during the rescue operation, and most bees are expected to return to their hives. The incident raised concerns about bee safety and public health.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article humorously explores the overuse and impact of corporate buzzwords in the workplace. It suggests that jargon, intended to create inclusion, often impedes trust and can make employees feel insecure. Gen Zers, accustomed to instant answers, may find workplace culture and jargon particularly challenging. The piece argues that buzzwords are often used to distract from the primary goal of making money, and encourages real, human communication instead. The author playfully advises readers to replace corporate jargon with poetry.</p>
