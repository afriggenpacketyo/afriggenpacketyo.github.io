          <p>Many newspapers are leading with images from the 80th anniversary of VE Day celebrations at Buckingham Palace, featuring the Royal Family and quotes from Winston Churchill's 1945 VE Day speech. The Daily Telegraph focuses on government efforts to revamp contingency plans in case of a Russian military attack on the UK, citing experts who warn of vulnerabilities in national infrastructure like gas terminals and undersea cables. The Guardian reports the government is rethinking cuts to winter fuel payments following warnings from Labour activists and a cabinet minister regarding voter concerns in local elections. The i newspaper covers the potential impact of Donald Trump's proposed film tariffs on the UK's film and TV industry, while the Financial Times leads with European criticism of Trump's plans to cut federal funding to US universities.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A newly declassified memo confirms that U.S. intelligence agencies rejected President Trump's claim that the Maduro regime in Venezuela controls the Tren de Aragua gang, which he used to justify invoking the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans to a prison in El Salvador. The memo states that while Venezuela's environment allows the gang to operate, the Maduro regime likely does not cooperate with or direct the gang's movement to the United States. The release of the memo further undercuts the Trump administration's rationale for using the Alien Enemies Act, which has been used only three times before in American history, all during declared wars, and calls into question its criticism of media coverage on the matter. The administration has sent planeloads of Venezuelans to a high-security prison in El Salvador with no due process.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the unresolved 2024 North Carolina Supreme Court race must remain in the final count, potentially securing an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers agreed with Riggs' argument that removing ballots would violate the U.S. Constitution, damaging due process and equal protection rights. He ordered the State Board of Elections to certify results showing Riggs winning by 734 votes over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, but delayed the decision for seven days in case of an appeal. Griffin's legal team is evaluating the next steps.</p>

The new structure will allow the nonprofit to be OpenAI's largest shareholder, though the specifics of the nonprofit's stake and board member selection are still being negotiated. The company's chairman stated that the decision was made after engaging in constructive dialogue with the attorney general offices of Delaware and California.</p>

The site, which allowed users to upload and view AI-generated porn videos, was described as the most prominent marketplace for deepfake porn. The shutdown follows the passage of the "Take It Down Act," which criminalizes posting nonconsensual sexual imagery, including explicit deepfakes. Experts view the closure as a positive step in combating deepfake abuse, although they acknowledge the issue will likely persist on less mainstream platforms.</p>
