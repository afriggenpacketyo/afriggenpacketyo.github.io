          <p>Chinese smartphone company Honor has taken a significant step towards an initial public offering (IPO) on a mainland Chinese stock exchange by completing its pre-listing guidance filing with the country's securities regulator. This move indicates the company's intent to list its A-shares, a process that comes as China's A-share market shows signs of recovery in the second quarter. According to consultancy firm Deloitte, this renewed market activity reflects the success of regulatory efforts to boost confidence and improve the quality of companies going public. Honor's potential listing is seen as a positive development in the recovering market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo will remain on the November ballot for New York City mayor, running on the independent "Fight and Deliver" line. This decision comes after he conceded the Democratic primary to state assemblymember Zohran Mamdani. A source close to the campaign confirmed Cuomo will not withdraw from the independent line, though it is unclear if he will actively campaign. Cuomo stated he is analyzing the primary results and the general election landscape before making further decisions.

This powerful new tool provides an unprecedentedly detailed look into how a single fertilized egg differentiates into the hundreds of cell types that form various tissues and organs. Published in the journal Cell, the research aims to decode the intricate processes of early organogenesis, a critical period where developmental defects are most likely to occur.

The experts called for structural reforms, such as making consumption a key metric for local government success, to increase internal demand.

Investor optimism was further bolstered by gains in the U.S. Nasdaq index, which lifted Japanese semiconductor stocks, and by a seemingly stable cease-fire in the Middle East.

          <p>Shares of Chinese tech giant Xiaomi surged to a record high after the successful launch of its second electric vehicle, the YU7 SUV. The company priced the new model aggressively, starting at 10,000 yuan cheaper than Tesla's competing Model Y in China, and reported receiving over 200,000 orders within three minutes of launch. This follows the success of its SU7 sedan, which also undercut Tesla's pricing. CEO Lei Jun highlighted the YU7's competitive features, including a superior driving range, though he acknowledged it still lags in driver-assist technology compared to Tesla.
