          <p>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth has ordered a rare, large-scale meeting of generals and admirals in Quantico, Virginia, on short notice. The purpose of the meeting is not fully disclosed, but it follows Hegseth's earlier proposals to reduce the number of high-ranking officers. Speculation suggests he might address the National Defense Strategy, which is expected to emphasize homeland defense more heavily. This unusual gathering highlights ongoing shifts within the military leadership under the current administration.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have experienced an unexpected boost, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 forecast to 16.1 million vehicles. This surge is attributed to consumers accelerating purchases due to fears of impending tariffs and higher prices, along with the imminent expiration of federal EV tax credits. While beneficial for the auto industry in the short term, analysts anticipate a slowdown in the fourth quarter and next year as these factors dissipate. Major automakers like General Motors, Toyota, and Hyundai have seen market share gains, while smaller brands and Tesla have experienced declines. (not investment advice)</p>

The decision to lead with these experienced and successful partnerships underscores Europe's strategy to establish an early lead on American soil, where they seek their first away win since 2012.</p>

          <p>New architectural renderings provide further details on the White House ballroom currently under construction in the East Wing. This 90,000-square-foot facility, designed to accommodate 650 seated guests, will be significantly larger than the main White House building. The Trump administration announced the project would be funded by private donors and the president himself, with nearly $200 million already pledged from corporate and individual contributors. The construction, which began earlier this month on the South Lawn, aims to enhance the executive mansion's event capacity.</p>

          <h2>HELOC Interest Rates Drop Below 8%, Offering New Borrowing Opportunities for Homeowners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 16:03:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average interest rate on a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%, a 17-basis-point drop in one week. This makes HELOCs one of the most affordable borrowing options currently available, especially for homeowners with substantial equity. Experts suggest it's a good time to open a HELOC because rates could fall further, and the variable rate allows borrowers to benefit from future cuts without refinancing. Additionally, the option for interest-only payments during the initial draw period offers financial flexibility. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reduces Animal Testing Grants, Fuels Debate on Research Alternatives</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has cut nearly $28 million in federal grants for animal testing, with major health agencies gradually phasing out live animal research in favor of alternatives. This shift, driven by an unlikely coalition of animal rights activists and bipartisan lawmakers, aims to reduce the estimated $20 billion annual federal spending on animal experiments. While proponents highlight ethical concerns and potential for new technologies like AI modeling, some medical experts and patient advocates express concern. They emphasize that animal testing has been crucial for developing life-saving treatments, arguing that alternatives are not yet fully ready to ensure human safety and efficacy.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made MLB history by hitting his 60th home run of the season, becoming only the seventh player to achieve this feat. The milestone occurred during the Mariners' win over the Colorado Rockies, a game that also saw the team clinch its first AL West title since 2001. In a heartwarming moment, the fan who caught the historic ball reportedly gave it to a young boy nearby, a gesture that garnered widespread appreciation despite the ball's potential high value. This act of kindness contrasted with previous incidents of fan disputes over game memorabilia.</p>

Additionally, Amazon will pay a $1 billion civil penalty, the largest in FTC history for a rule violation. As part of the agreement, Amazon must simplify its Prime enrollment and cancellation processes, including adding a clear "decline" button and an easy cancellation method.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Ryder Cup at Bethpage Black is set to be a fiercely contested event, with analysts predicting key factors will determine the winner. European captain Luke Donald's calm approach and experienced team, including players like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, are seen as strengths. A fast start in the opening foursomes is crucial for Europe to counter the notoriously boisterous New York crowds, which American captain Keegan Bradley hopes to leverage. The "Trump effect," with the former president's planned attendance, also adds a unique political dimension to the already intense competition, potentially influencing crowd dynamics.</p>

          <p>Starting September 30, the Social Security Administration (SSA) will transition to electronic payments exclusively, ending 85 years of paper checks for its nearly 70 million recipients. This modernization effort, mandated by a Trump administration executive order, aims to improve efficiency, security, and reduce fraud, as paper checks are 16 times more likely to be lost or stolen. Benefits will now be issued via direct deposit or prepaid debit cards.

This inclusion is particularly significant for lower-income countries, where stigma and denial often hinder recognition and support for the condition.

          <p>With recent Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, the monthly cost of a $75,000 home equity loan has decreased, making it a more attractive borrowing option. For example, a 10-year loan at 8.34% would cost $923.49 per month, while a 15-year loan at 8.21% would be $725.86. These rates are lower than earlier in the year and last fall, providing homeowners with significant equity a cheaper way to finance various expenses. Homeowners are advised to compare these fixed-rate costs with variable-rate HELOCs to choose the best option for their specific needs. (not investment advice)</p>
