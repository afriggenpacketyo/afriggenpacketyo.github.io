          <p>A decision coach who works with clients on major life choices, such as moving abroad or changing careers, suggests that prolonged deliberation can actually worsen decision-making. The coach notes that clients often spend excessive time mulling over options, leading to an unwieldy mass of details and increased awareness of potential sacrifices. This analysis paralysis drains energy and mental space, making life demonstrably worse, as clients become exhausted from constant overthinking. The coach advocates for a more streamlined approach to decision-making to avoid this common trap.</p>

          <p>Saving money in the current economy can be aided by certificates of deposit (CDs), as leading accounts offer higher returns than the current inflation rate.

As of June 2, 2025, the national average for a 1-year CD yield is 2.01% APY, while some banks offer rates as high as 4.41% APY for a 6-month CD.

          <p>Certified financial planner Nathan Sebesta identifies a common pitfall for young adults in their 20s: increasing their lifestyle expenses proportionally or more than their income increases. Sebesta advises a more conservative approach, suggesting maintaining the same standard of living or increasing it slightly, rather than spending all or more of the raise. Saving for retirement requires discipline, and this strategy helps ensure a healthy amount of money is allocated towards savings (not investment advice).
