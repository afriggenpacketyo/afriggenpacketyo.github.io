          <p>The Senior Citizens League, a retiree advocacy group, estimates that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be 2.7%. This projection, based on recent inflation data, suggests a slight increase from this year's 2.5% boost. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall using inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists express concern that a modest adjustment may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to factors like tariffs.

The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, has predicted a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement. This is partly because universities are showing more flexibility, understanding that this cohort received lower GCSE grades due to the planned deflation of pandemic-era grade inflation. This year marks the second year of a return to pre-pandemic grading standards.</p>

His incredible streak of 14,642 consecutive days, which began in 1975 and ended in 2015, earned him a Guinness World Record. Webster's dedication required him to ride at least three waves a day in the cold and often challenging waters off Northern California, regardless of weather, illness, or personal tragedy.

          <p>UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy has acknowledged that he did not possess a valid rod license while fishing with U.S. Vice President JD Vance at the Chevening House estate. Lammy attributed the oversight to an "administrative error" and has since purchased a license and notified the Environment Agency. The diplomatic fishing trip, which occurred during Vance's family holiday, resulted in no catches for the foreign secretary. Failing to have a license can result in a fine of up to £2,500, though it is unclear if any penalty will be issued in this case.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating a list of 11 potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair, according to administration sources. The list includes Jefferies' David Zervos, former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder, alongside known contenders like Michelle Bowman and Chris Waller. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is expected to interview all candidates before presenting a shorter list to the president. The extensive list and deliberative process suggest a decision is not imminent, providing some stability to markets concerned about a sudden transition. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's announcement of its expanded same-day fresh grocery delivery service sent ripples through the market, causing shares of competitors like Kroger and Albertsons to fall. While Costco's stock also saw a slight dip, analysis from CNBC's Jim Cramer suggests its business model is not in direct competition with Amazon's delivery-focused strategy. Costco's appeal is rooted in its in-person, bulk-purchasing experience and value proposition, which differs fundamentally from the convenience of online delivery. The market reaction highlights the increasing pressure Amazon is placing on the traditional grocery sector. (not investment advice)</p>

The firm, led by former NYSE President Tom Farley, raised $1.1 billion in the offering, which was expanded due to high investor demand. This successful IPO is seen as another sign of renewed vigor in the crypto capital markets, potentially influenced by a more favorable regulatory attitude from the Trump administration.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated and the potential for future rate cuts, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time for retirees to consider annuities for guaranteed income. The ideal amount to invest depends on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, rather than a universal percentage. A common approach is to calculate the gap between essential monthly expenses and current guaranteed income, then use an annuity to cover that shortfall. This strategy helps secure a stable income floor while balancing portfolio growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The price of gold continues to be a key indicator for investors navigating economic uncertainty, with the precious metal often viewed as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against inflation. As of August 11, 2025, the price stood at $3,353.44 per ounce, reflecting its sustained value. The price of gold is influenced by numerous factors, including global supply and demand, inflation rates, geopolitical instability, and central bank policies.

While the humanitarian world has welcomed its return, experts express caution, questioning if the revived system will have the same rigor and if governments will act on its warnings, especially amid recent cuts to humanitarian aid.</p>

Bodhana, who only began playing during the COVID-19 pandemic, has shown remarkable talent, representing England internationally and breaking records previously held for years.
