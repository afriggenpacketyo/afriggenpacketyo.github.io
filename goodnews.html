        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Mike Tomlin used a bizarre metaphor to praise his kicker, Chris Boswell, following a key victory over the New York Jets. After Boswell successfully kicked a 60-yard field goal, Tomlin described him as a "serial killer" due to his calm demeanor and ability to perform under pressure. Boswell was perfect in the game, making two field goals and four extra points, which were crucial for the team's win. The comment highlights the veteran kicker's reputation for reliability and clutch performance, which has made him a vital asset for the Steelers.</p>

          <p>An astronomical event captivated stargazers as a total lunar eclipse occurred, creating a "Blood Moon." The phenomenon, visible across large parts of the world including Asia and parts of Europe and Africa, happens when the Earth passes between the sun and moon. The moon appears red because the only sunlight reaching it is scattered through Earth's atmosphere, a process that filters out blue light wavelengths. This stunning visual event has fascinated humanity for many centuries.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Ian Goldin, a professor of globalisation and development at the University of Oxford, globalisation is far from dead and is currently thriving in Asia. He asserts that the region's rapid economic growth and poverty reduction are direct results of its integration into the global economy. Goldin notes that while globalisation is becoming more fragmented and regional, its center of gravity is shifting towards Asia as the U.S. partially withdraws. He also cautions that the interconnectedness of globalisation brings not only benefits but also growing risks, such as pandemics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz has won his second US Open championship, defeating his rival Jannik Sinner in a compelling four-set final. The victory marks Alcaraz's sixth Grand Slam title overall and allows him to reclaim the world No. 1 ranking from Sinner. After a dominant first set, Alcaraz weathered a comeback from the Italian in the second before reasserting control to close out the match. The final, which was delayed due to security for President Trump's attendance, capped a spectacular summer for Alcaraz and evened the Grand Slam final record between the two rivals for the year.</p>

The plan includes five new "Defence Growth Deals" in specific regions across the UK to build on local strengths in areas like marine autonomy, advanced materials, and cybersecurity. The government anticipates that this investment could create up to 50,000 new skilled jobs by 2035.

          <p>This opinion article argues that as Hong Kong shows signs of economic recovery, it must act quickly to reinforce its status as a unique international financial hub. The city is experiencing a resurgence in tourism and business, with its IPO market expected to rank first globally in 2025. The author suggests Hong Kong is benefiting from its "in-between" status, balancing integration with mainland China while maintaining a capitalist system. To secure its future, the article recommends Beijing encourage more foreign engagement and support the city as a base for multilateral institutions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California is experiencing an unusual drop in temperatures, with coastal areas expecting weather 5 to 15 degrees below normal for this time of year. This shift brings cooler breezes, fog, and a chance of light showers, providing relief for Southern California after recent heat waves but disappointment for the Bay Area after a cold summer. The forecast is atypical, as September and October are often the hottest months for the state's coast. While the cool-down affects most of the state, far northern regions continue to face monsoonal conditions that have sparked wildfires.</p>

          <p>Germany's national soccer team earned a much-needed 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifying match, providing some relief for coach Julian Nagelsmann.

          <p>Young English cricketer Jacob Bethell has scored his first professional century in a one-day international against South Africa, a significant milestone for the highly-rated batter. At 21, Bethell has been part of the England setup based on his talent but had lacked a century, a point of discussion for critics. This performance may strengthen his case for a spot in the upcoming Ashes Test series in Australia, as his playing style is well-suited for the conditions there. While some commentators remain unconvinced about his red-ball readiness, England's coaches continue to show strong faith in his future potential.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1 title fight between McLaren teammates Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri remained amicable during the Italian Grand Prix, even after a controversial strategy call from the team. When a pit stop issue caused Norris to emerge behind Piastri, the team instructed Piastri to let his teammate pass to restore the original order, citing fairness. Team Principal Andrea Stella defended the decision as consistent with McLaren's "racing principles," which prioritize the team's values over individual race outcomes. This approach is noted as a key factor in the team's recent success.</p>
