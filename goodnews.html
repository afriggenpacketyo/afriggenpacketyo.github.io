          <p>The European Union has lifted economic sanctions on Syria, excluding those related to security concerns, to facilitate reconstruction efforts in the war-torn nation. This decision allows the Syrian Central Bank and other lenders to regain access to the European financial market, aiming to support Syria's recovery and political transition. EU diplomat Kaja Kallas emphasized that this move is intended to help the Syrian people reunite and rebuild an inclusive, peaceful Syria. However, sanctions against individuals and organizations linked to the al-Assad regime, as well as export restrictions on weapons and technologies used for internal repression, will remain in effect.</p>
