          <p>According to a TechInsights report, Huawei Technologies is still struggling to advance to the 5-nanometer chip manufacturing process, which highlights the impact of U.S. sanctions. The MateBook Fold Ultimate Design laptop features Huawei‚Äôs Kirin X90 system-on-a-chip (SoC), manufactured by SMIC using its 7-nm process node. This finding refutes speculation that Huawei had made the leap to SMIC‚Äôs 5-nm process, which faces scaling challenges due to U.S. sanctions. Huawei's slow progress in securing 5-nm chips means the company is several generations behind its U.S. rivals, such as Apple, whose M-series chips have been using TSMC‚Äôs 3-nm process for two years.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has committed the UK to spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target. Of this, 3.5% will be allocated to core defense, and 1.5% to defense-related areas, such as resilience and security. This split target aims to accommodate US President Donald Trump's call for increased defense spending while providing flexibility for EU countries. The Conservative party has criticized the plan as unfunded and distant, while Sir Keir emphasized the need for agility and a clear national interest in navigating an era of radical uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes autonomous vehicles represent a trillion-dollar opportunity, with the company's Drive platform gaining traction among major car manufacturers. Nvidia's automotive revenue could triple in fiscal 2026, driven by demand for its Thor chip and AI software. Car makers are also investing in Nvidia's DGX data center systems and Cosmos foundation model to customize their self-driving offerings. Despite the potential, the data center business remains the dominant contributor to Nvidia's revenue.</p>

          <p>B-2 stealth bomber missions, such as those recently conducted against Iranian nuclear sites, demand extraordinary endurance from their two-person crews. Pilots undergo careful diet planning and sleep studies to optimize performance during multi-day flights. Mid-air refueling, a dangerous aspect of these missions, requires pilots to rely on visual cues and memorized reference points. The Air Force plans to replace the B-2 fleet with B-21 Raiders in the coming decades.</p>

          <p>BYD, the world‚Äôs largest electric vehicle (EV) maker, has expanded its car-carrying ship fleet to bolster export growth amid intense domestic competition. The company has taken delivery of two new carriers, the BYD Changsha and Xi‚Äôan, each capable of transporting 9,200 vehicles. This move reflects BYD's strategy to increase sales in overseas markets, where it can achieve higher profit margins. The Xi‚Äôan has already set sail for Europe, carrying 7,000 EVs.</p>
