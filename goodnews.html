          <p>President Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will stop purchasing oil from Russia, a move Washington has been pressuring New Delhi to make. Trump stated that the halt would not be immediate and described it as "a little bit of a process," without providing a specific timeline. India is one of the largest buyers of Russian crude, and its continued trade has been a point of friction with the U.S. amid efforts to limit Moscow's revenue following the invasion of Ukraine. India's government has not yet commented on the claim.</p>

          <p>President Trump hosted a dinner for dozens of corporate executives and business leaders to raise funds for a new $200 million ballroom at the White House. The guest list included representatives from major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google, as well as figures from the finance and energy sectors. The administration states the 90,000-square-foot expansion will be financed entirely by private donations rather than taxpayer money. The fundraising effort has drawn criticism from some who question the appropriateness of corporations funding such a project, viewing it as a way to curry favor.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani took the unusual step of taking batting practice on the field in an effort to break out of a significant postseason slump. The two-way phenom has struggled at the plate, striking out 12 times in 25 at-bats since the start of the playoffs. Manager Dave Roberts has stressed the team's need for Ohtani's offensive production to win the World Series. While Ohtani acknowledged his frustration, he also downplayed the idea that his return to pitching this season has negatively impacted his hitting, stating he feels no physical connection between the two roles.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from firing federal workers during the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came after more than 4,000 employees received reduction-in-force notifications. The judge stated the administration's actions appear to be unlawful and politically motivated, citing President Trump's own social media posts about targeting "Democrat Agencies." The order, which came on the 15th day of the shutdown, blocks any further terminations of employees represented by the unions that filed the lawsuit, pending a future hearing.</p>

          <p>Bookmakers have positioned Irish singer CMAT and iconic band Pulp as the leading contenders to win this year's Mercury Prize for album of the year. The 2025 ceremony marks a significant change, as it will be held in Newcastle, the first time the event has taken place outside of London since its inception in 1992. This move is part of a broader industry effort to decentralize major cultural events and recognize talent from across the UK and Ireland. Other notable nominees include Fontaines DC, PinkPantheress, and 84-year-old folk musician Martin Carthy, the prize's oldest-ever nominee.</p>

          <p>South Korea's benchmark Kospi index surged to an all-time high, driven by positive economic indicators and diplomatic developments. The rally was fueled by the International Monetary Fund raising the country's 2025 growth forecast and growing optimism about the finalization of a trade deal with the United States. Gains were led by major firms in the electronics and automotive sectors, with Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor seeing significant share price increases. The strong market performance provides a boost to investor confidence amid broader global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A UK housing association chief has proposed a new solution to the costly and controversial use of hotels to house asylum seekers. The plan suggests the government provide funds to councils and housing associations to purchase properties, adding to the nation's social housing stock for both local residents and asylum seekers. The proponent claims this approach could cut the cost per asylum seeker from £54,000 to just £4,000 a year. The idea is being discussed with government departments as a potential way to meet the pledge to empty all asylum hotels by 2029 amid rising community tensions.</p>

          <p>U.S. Senator Marsha Blackburn has stated that federal regulation of artificial intelligence is imperative to avoid a patchwork of differing state laws. As states like California, Utah, and Texas begin to implement their own AI safeguards, Blackburn argues that Congress must step in to create a national standard. Her focus is on consumer privacy protection, preventing the unauthorized use of personal data to train AI models, and protecting children from harmful content generated by chatbots. She advocates for a legislative framework that regulates the end uses of AI rather than the technology itself.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after being almost completely destroyed by an EF-5 tornado, the town of Greensburg, Kansas, has become a showcase for sustainable renewal. After the 2007 disaster, the community chose to rebuild using green technology, and today, 100% of its electricity is generated by wind energy. This focus on sustainability has provided long-term economic benefits, including remarkably stable electricity costs that have risen only once in the last decade. The town's story is one of a resilient rural community that turned a devastating tragedy into an opportunity for innovation and strength.</p>

          <p>Young American forward Alyssa Thompson delivered a standout performance for Chelsea, scoring her first goal for the club in a dominant Champions League victory over Paris FC. The 20-year-old, who also provided an assist, was described by manager Sonia Bompastor as a "real bright spark" whose best is still to come. The goal is expected to ease the pressure on Thompson, who arrived at the club with high expectations after a record transfer fee. The decisive win helps Chelsea regain momentum after a series of unconvincing results in domestic and European competition.</p>
