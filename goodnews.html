          <p>A 28-year-old spearfisherman in Florida experienced a bull shark attack just minutes after telling his visiting family not to worry about the marine predators. The shark bit his leg while attempting to steal a fish he had just speared at a depth of 65 feet. Fortunately, the shark's teeth missed major arteries and ligaments, allowing him to make a swift recovery after receiving numerous stitches. The man remains in good spirits and plans to return to diving, hoping the incident raises awareness about the abundance of sharks in Florida waters.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The horror film "Weapons," from writer-director Zach Cregger, is being praised for its daring narrative that provides definitive answers to its central mystery about a group of children who mysteriously vanish. The article explores how the movie reveals a witch as the villain and delivers a satisfying, albeit brutal, comeuppance at the hands of her child victims. However, the review notes that this cathartic victory does not erase the underlying trauma and grief experienced by the community. This dual nature makes "Weapons" a uniquely compelling "feel-bad, feel-good" film that offers genre thrills while acknowledging that true resolution from tragedy is complex.</p>

          <p>The health care sector emerged as the top performer in the stock market this week, buoyed by positive developments for major companies like Eli Lilly and UnitedHealth Group. Eli Lilly's stock recovered after insider buying activity, while UnitedHealth saw a boost after a filing revealed a new investment from Berkshire Hathaway. In contrast, the technology, consumer staples, and utilities sectors all posted negative returns for the week as momentum-based stocks faltered. Looking ahead, investors are focused on upcoming retail earnings reports and Federal Reserve commentary from the Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new film "East of Wall" is a docu-fiction neo-western that centers on a South Dakota ranch matriarch and her daughter, who play versions of themselves in a story drawn from their own lives. The article praises the film for its authentic depiction of resilience and hardship as the family navigates financial uncertainty while rescuing and selling horses. While the review suggests the film's narrative framing can feel thin at times, it highlights the compelling, lived-in performances of its first-time actors, Tabatha and Porshia Zimiga. The film successfully captures the grit and independence of women forging their own path in a challenging heartland environment.</p>

          <p>A fact-check of President Trump's recent statements used to justify federalizing the Washington, D.C. police force reveals his claims about crime rates are misleading. While D.C. did have a high murder rate compared to U.S. states in 2023, it was not the highest among major cities, and the rate has fallen significantly in 2024. According to the city's police department, violent crime has seen a 26% reduction in the current year compared to the same period in 2024. This downward trend aligns with national FBI statistics showing a decrease in violent crime across the U.S., contradicting the administration's narrative of a current crisis.</p>

          <p>Following a report that the Trump administration is considering taking a government stake in Intel, a technology analyst has described the potential intervention as essential for national security. The analyst, Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson, stated that such a move is necessary to revive the struggling chipmaker and reduce U.S. reliance on foreign semiconductor manufacturing. The news caused Intel's stock to rise over 6%, with shares on track for their best week in decades. The administration is reportedly considering using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the investment, reflecting a broader push for domestic production of critical technologies.

          <p>The U.K. supermarket chain Iceland is introducing a new initiative to combat rising retail theft by offering customers a financial incentive to report shoplifters. Shoppers who alert staff to a theft in progress will receive a £1 credit on their Iceland Bonus Card. The company's executive chairman, Richard Walker, stated that shoplifting costs the business approximately £20 million annually, impacting its ability to lower prices and invest in staff. The move comes as police-recorded shoplifting offenses in England and Wales have reached their highest levels since current recording practices began, increasing 20% in the last year.</p>

          <p>A series of more than 130 small earthquakes has been recorded in Northern California, concentrated in the Geysers geothermal steam field across Sonoma and Lake counties. The largest tremor in the swarm registered a magnitude of 4.0, though most were much smaller. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, such minor seismic activity is common in this area, which is home to a major geothermal power facility. The earthquakes are believed to be induced by the power generation process, which involves withdrawing steam from the volcanic field and injecting cool water, causing the surrounding rock to contract and shift.</p>

This stance appears designed to reassure European allies who were concerned about potential concessions to Moscow. Trump also expressed support for U.S. security guarantees for Ukraine, short of full NATO membership, in a future peace deal, framing the summit as a precursor to direct talks involving Ukraine.</p>
