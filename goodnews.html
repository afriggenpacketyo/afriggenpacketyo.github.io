          <p>This opinion article recounts a personal experience of a flight cancellation at a tense airport, contrasting the author's and other passengers' frustration with the tranquility of a nursing baby. The author uses this observation as a metaphor for finding spiritual peace amidst life's challenges, suggesting that true calm comes not from favorable circumstances but from faith in a higher power. The piece posits that just as the infant felt secure in its mother's arms, people can find unwavering peace by trusting in God, regardless of external turmoil or uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. As of early Sunday, the hurricane was located north of Puerto Rico with maximum sustained winds of 125 mph, moving west-northwest. While the storm is not currently forecast to directly impact the mainland United States, a tropical storm warning is in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Forecasters note the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which could lead to fluctuations in its strength over the coming days.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flights after the Canadian government ordered an end to a strike by more than 10,000 of its flight attendants, which had caused hundreds of cancellations. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board mandated that staff return to work and extended the previous collective agreement until a new one is reached through binding arbitration. While the airline works to stabilize its schedule over the next week, the union has accused the government of violating workers' rights by forcing an end to the dispute over pay and working conditions.</p>

          <p>A derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party and event space now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and undertook a challenging five-year renovation to make it habitable, installing modern amenities like running water and electricity. The historic fort, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, is now equipped with 40 beds and a nightclub, reviving its more recent history as a unique party destination with no neighbors to disturb.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County. While rappelling down a series of falls known as the Seven Teacups, extreme water hydraulics pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. A search operation was launched when he failed to return, and rescuers located him by flying a drone behind the waterfall. Wardwell was hoisted to safety by a California Highway Patrol helicopter, suffering only minor injuries and dehydration in what authorities called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some institutions, a small number of U.S. colleges provide a completely tuition-free experience for all admitted students. These nine schools, including Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and federal service academies like West Point and the Naval Academy, have high academic standards and often require a significant commitment in return. For instance, some require students to participate in work programs, while the military academies mandate several years of active duty service upon graduation, offering a unique path to a debt-free degree.</p>

          <p>Through a program facilitated by officials in Zacatecas, Mexico, an undocumented carpenter living in California was able to reunite with his elderly parents for the first time in 24 years. José Antonio Rodríguez, who left home at 20, had not seen his parents since, as he could not travel back and they lacked visas. The emotional reunion in East Los Angeles was one of only a few approved this year, highlighting the difficulties families face due to immigration barriers. The story captures decades of separation, the longing for family, and the profound joy of a long-awaited embrace.</p>

          <p>A wildlife photographer in Lithuania was stunned to discover that his trail camera had captured footage of a brown bear, a species once thought to be locally extinct. This sighting, along with another recent one of a bear cub, suggests the large mammal may be returning to the nation's ecosystem. Brown bears play a vital ecological role, and their reappearance is being hailed as a positive sign of a thriving natural environment. The event has prompted calls for the species to be added to Lithuania's Red Book of protected animals to support its recovery.</p>

          <p>Australia has granted political asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong. Hui fled the city in 2020 after facing multiple criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists with a police bounty placed on them. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government for providing protection for him and his family. He also used the opportunity to urge Australia to do more to help other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned for their political activities.</p>

          <p>The New Zealand All Blacks have returned to the number one position in the world rugby rankings for the first time in four years after a 41-24 victory over Argentina. The match, which was the Rugby Championship opener for both teams, saw the All Blacks build a strong first-half lead before holding off a spirited second-half comeback from the Pumas. The win, combined with South Africa's loss to Australia, was enough to push New Zealand back to the top spot. The two teams are set to face each other again next Saturday in Buenos Aires.</p>

          <h2>Personal Essay Reflects on How Life Experience Unlocks a Deeper Appreciation for Renaissance Art</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-17 03:00:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this personal essay, the author recounts her journey from being a student who found Renaissance art cold and unrelatable to an adult who now sees its profound power. She argues that her initial inability to connect with masterpieces like Piero della Francesca's "Madonna del Parto" was due to a lack of life experience, not a lack of intellect. Events like trauma, pregnancy, and motherhood opened up new emotional pathways, allowing her to understand the deep human stories within the art. The piece suggests that aging and experience can make one less cynical and more willing to be moved by art and the shared human condition it represents.</p>

          <p>After finishing second for three consecutive seasons, Arsenal is entering what is considered a pivotal year for manager Mikel Arteta, with high expectations of winning the Premier League. The club has invested heavily over the summer, spending £190 million to sign key players like midfielder Martin Zubimendi and striker Viktor Gyokeres to strengthen the team's core. The strategy has been to add depth and eliminate any drop-off in quality between starters and reserves. With an emphasis on a more direct and potent attacking style, the club believes it now has all the necessary components to secure its first league title in 21 years.</p>
