        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-anticipated decline in August, falling just 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% drop in July. This resilience was largely driven by a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe, which helped offset a steep 13.8% decline in exports to the United States. Despite the softer contraction, this marks the fourth consecutive month of negative growth for the world's fourth-largest economy. The data provides a mixed economic picture as the nation also navigates political uncertainty with the impending resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that Hong Kong presents a unique and strategic option for hosting China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging Shanghai's front-runner status. While Shanghai offers robust AI infrastructure and strong government backing, Hong Kong's distinct "one country, two systems" framework and independent judiciary could help reassure international partners and mitigate Western skepticism. The article suggests that choosing Hong Kong would be a nuanced move by Beijing to navigate US-China tech tensions. This would position the city at the center of China's AI diplomacy and influence on global standards.</p>

          <p>A 39-year-old man from Norfolk has waived his anonymity to share his story after his attacker was sentenced to eight years in prison, twenty years after the crime occurred. Dan Cooper was motivated to re-report the 2004 assault to police after his experience serving on a jury in 2018 made him realize he needed to pursue justice for himself. The article details the attack, his subsequent diagnosis with complex PTSD, and the long journey to see his assailant, Shaun Gilder, convicted.

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has issued a strong rebuttal to accusations from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who claimed the agency was covering up dysfunction and lacked transparency. In a letter, SSA Commissioner Frank J. Bisignano asserted that the agency reports nearly three times more performance data under the Trump administration than its predecessor and has made significant service improvements. According to SSA data, key metrics such as phone wait times and disability claim backlogs have been reduced. Bisignano urged Warren to cease what he termed "fearmongering" and work with the agency to preserve Social Security.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old in Chino Hills, California, successfully defended herself against an armed robber by throwing her recently purchased tea at him. The assailant, who brandished a knife, had reportedly demanded she hand over her beverage. The unexpected act of flinging the drink gave the teenager enough time to escape and call for help. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived shortly after and arrested 29-year-old Rashawn Lee at the shopping center. Lee was booked on one count of robbery and was later released after posting bail, with no injuries reported from the incident.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that artificial intelligence could boost the UK's economy by as much as 10% within the next five years, potentially faster than previous technological shifts. His comments coincide with the announcement of a new $30 billion investment by Microsoft in the UK's AI sector, its largest outside the US. This is part of a broader £31 billion agreement between the UK government and several US tech giants, including Nvidia and Google, to build AI-supporting infrastructure like data centers. The investment aims to create skilled jobs and drive significant GDP growth.</p>

This pricing falls in the middle of the company's previously expected range. The shares are set to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "STUB." After several delays, StubHub's public debut comes amid a recent resurgence in the IPO market, which had been slow due to high inflation and rising interest rates. The company reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue to $397.6 million. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, who consistently challenged his all-American movie star image to explore more complex and critical roles. While he could have easily built a career on simple, heroic characters, Redford often chose parts that questioned American ideals, such as in "The Candidate" and "The Great Gatsby." The piece highlights his willingness to portray flawed protagonists and his commitment to films that examined the underbelly of success and power. His work, both as an actor and a director, is remembered for its frustrated idealism and its incisive commentary on American society.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Attorney's office has announced that five partially built, illegal homes in Laurel Canyon will be demolished as part of a plea agreement with the developers. The structures have been the subject of legal disputes for over two decades, after a 2002 moratorium halted the original 21-home project pending an environmental review that never occurred. Despite a demolition order in 2003, a series of owners attempted to restart construction on the dilapidated properties. The current owners pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders and must now tear down the homes by August 2026.</p>

          <p>New data reveals a significant shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. According to the Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency, this represents a dramatic increase from just over 6% a decade ago. The trend is largely attributed to the growing popularity of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics are often easier for learners, allowing them to focus more on road safety.</p>

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted to a more pragmatic and defensive style, a stark contrast to the attack-focused approach of the previous season. This change was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, which marked their fourth clean sheet in five games. Players and analysts note the team's new emphasis on a "clean sheet mentality" and strong defensive structure. While effective in securing results, this cautious strategy has resulted in fewer shots on target and less of the free-flowing offensive football that fans were previously accustomed to seeing.</p>
