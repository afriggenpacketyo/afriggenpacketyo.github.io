          <p>Third-seeded player Amanda Anisimova delivered a commanding performance to defeat defending champion Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-2 in the China Open semifinal. The match, which lasted just 58 minutes, saw the 24-year-old Wimbledon and US Open finalist dominate her compatriot from the start, winning the first five games. Anisimova's powerful and precise play, particularly on her first serve where she lost only five points, secured her place in the final. She will now face either Jessica Pegula or Linda Noskova for the championship title in Beijing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly instructed the military to cease all offensive operations in Gaza, permitting only defensive actions, according to Israeli sources. This move follows Hamas's expressed willingness to engage with a US-proposed ceasefire plan, which includes the release of all hostages. While Israeli forces maintain their positions around Gaza City, warning residents not to return to the northern combat zone, preparations are underway to send a negotiating team to continue talks. Other Palestinian militant groups have also voiced support for Hamas's response, signaling potential progress toward ending the conflict.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Have Originated in Tang Dynasty China</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Italian researchers have proposed a new theory that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice was originally a tomb guardian from Tang dynasty China. A study published in the journal *Antiquity* combines stylistic analysis and lead isotope testing to support the claim, noting similarities to mythical Chinese beasts and tracing the bronze to ore from the Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate that the 2.8-tonne statue may have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form. However, this theory is being disputed by some scholars in China.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. A staunch conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish security stance and opposition to progressive social policies like same-sex marriage. Her election comes after the LDP suffered significant election losses, and she now faces the challenge of uniting a fractured party and addressing pressing economic issues. While her leadership is historic for a woman in Japan, her conservative views have drawn criticism and may not appeal to a broader electorate.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons. This full moon will be the largest and brightest of the year so far because its orbit will bring it to its closest point to Earth, known as the perigee. The term 'Harvest Moon' is given to the full moon nearest the autumn equinox, as it traditionally provided extra light for farmers. Stargazers are advised to check local weather forecasts for clear skies to get the best view of the celestial event.</p>
