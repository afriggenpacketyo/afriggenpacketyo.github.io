          <p>Sir Geoff Palmer, Scotland's first black professor, has died at the age of 85. Palmer, who moved to the UK from Jamaica as a teenager, was known for his academic achievements and his advocacy for human rights. Tributes have poured in from Scottish leaders, including First Minister John Swinney and Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar, recognizing Palmer as a pioneer and intellectual giant. Palmer's work included the invention of the barley abrasion process, earning him the American Society of Brewing Chemists Award of Distinction, and he also led Edinburgh's Slavery and Colonialism Legacy Review Group. His impact on education and equality will be remembered.</p>

          <p>The People's Bank of China set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months, reaching 7.1772 per US dollar. This move followed a drop in the US dollar index after the May producer price index fell below expectations, leading traders to anticipate more interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policies and debt sustainability have also contributed to the dollar's weakness. Despite a recent trade talk truce between China and the US, some analysts remain cautious about future economic relations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Economists Attribute Decline in 'White Collar' Jobs to Structural Issues, Not AI Disruption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-13 05:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists are suggesting that the recent decline in "white collar" job openings is due to structural issues within the economy, rather than artificial intelligence taking over these roles. The professional and business services sector has experienced a decrease in hiring activity over the past two years, while industries like healthcare and construction have seen growth. Experts emphasize that AI technology is still in its early stages and cannot execute key skills without human intervention. While AI may transform jobs in the future, it is not currently the primary driver behind the decline in white-collar job creation. The technology has a ways to go before it poses a serious threat to the job market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite heightened tensions following Israeli strikes on Iran, experts believe it is unlikely that Tehran will block the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. The strait sees roughly 20 million barrels per day of oil and oil products pass through, accounting for nearly one-fifth of global oil shipments. Analysts argue that impeding oil passage would not benefit Iran, especially given that its oil infrastructure has not been directly targeted, and it could trigger further retaliation. Additionally, China, Iran's largest oil customer, would likely oppose such a move, as it relies on the Strait for its oil imports. The action could be more of a bane than a boon for Tehran.</p>

          <p>India is seeking to tap into its rare earth reserves to become an alternative to China, which currently dominates the global supply. The move comes as many countries grapple with Beijing's restrictions on rare earth element exports. Experts say India could become an important alternative to China in the sector, but will require much more public and private investment. India has the world's third-largest share of rare earth reserves, but it lacks advanced separation and refining technology. The report comes just days after India's Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal called China's pause in exports of rare earth elements a "wake-up call" for the world and an opportunity for India to provide an alternative.</p>

The report calls for institutionalized dialogue mechanisms focused on regional security architecture, maritime legal order and law enforcement norms, and crisis response protocols.
