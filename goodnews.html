          <p>Workers installing a water pipeline in Dubrovnik, Croatia, a city known as a filming location for "Game of Thrones," have uncovered the remains of an 18th-century wooden boat. The vessel was found embedded about 30 inches beneath the seabed in the city's Old Town harbor. A marine archaeologist confirmed the boat's age through radiocarbon analysis, dating it to the late 1700s. The remains are now being protected for further examination, adding to a series of recent maritime archaeological finds across Europe.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging business climate in China, some five-star hotels are adopting unconventional strategies to survive, including selling budget-friendly street food. For instance, the Zhongwu Hotel in Changzhou has started offering affordable boxed meals, featuring items like spicy crayfish and dim sum, prepared by its high-end catering team. This move reflects a broader trend of luxury establishments pivoting to mass-market offerings to maintain revenue as consumer spending habits shift and the high-end banquet market softens.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the Live Aid concert is remembered as a monumental moment in music and charity, uniting billions to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure, the event showcased an unprecedented lineup of rock royalty. However, modern analysis of its legacy is more complex, raising questions about its lack of African performers and female representation, and fueling debates over the "white savior" narrative. Despite the criticisms, the article notes its undeniable impact on fundraising and political lobbying for debt relief.</p>

          <p>A campaign in the UK is calling for cosmetic and skincare products to list ingredients in English, in addition to the currently required Latin-based scientific names. Proponents, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue that Latin names are unrecognizable to most consumers, putting those with allergies at serious risk of accidental exposure and life-threatening reactions. While some brands voluntarily provide English translations, the campaign seeks to make it a mandatory standard, similar to food allergen labeling, to improve safety and transparency for all consumers.</p>

          <p>A new scientific study offers a surprising perspective on the potential impact of China's planned mega dam in Tibet on the Brahmaputra River. Contrary to widespread fears in India that the dam would cause droughts, the research suggests it could actually increase water flow during the dry season. By analyzing data from two existing upstream dams, the study found that regulated water release significantly boosted downstream river levels in drier months. These findings could help ease geopolitical tensions between the two nations over shared water resources.</p>
