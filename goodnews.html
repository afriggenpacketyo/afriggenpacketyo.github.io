          <p>Sinclair announced it will resume airing "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" on its ABC-affiliated stations, ending a preemption of the late-night program. The decision to pull the show was made in response to remarks host Jimmy Kimmel made following the shooting death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In its statement, Sinclair emphasized its goal to ensure programming is accurate and engaging for the widest possible audience. The company stated it takes its responsibility as a local broadcaster seriously while also honoring its network programming obligations.</p>

          <p>Former shadow chancellor John McDonnell and MP Apsana Begum have been readmitted to the Labour Party after a year-long suspension. They were among seven left-wing MPs who defied the party line by voting with the SNP to scrap the two-child benefit cap shortly after Labour's 2024 election victory. Their return comes as the Labour government faces increasing internal and external pressure to abolish the controversial policy. Recently, Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson signaled a potential shift, stating that removing the cap is now "on the table."</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Timeline and Consequences of Late Credit Card Payments</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-26 14:17:25 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As credit card delinquencies rise amid economic pressures, understanding the consequences of late payments is crucial for consumers. While a payment is technically late the day after its due date, most card issuers offer an unofficial grace period of a few days before charging a fee. The first major threshold is at 30 days past due, when the late payment is typically reported to credit bureaus, damaging one's credit score. After 60 days, penalty interest rates may be applied, and by 90 days, more aggressive collection efforts often begin, highlighting the importance of proactive communication with lenders.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration announced it will now permit Boeing to issue its own airworthiness certificates for certain 737 MAX and 787 Dreamliner aircraft, a significant step in restoring the manufacturer's autonomy. This authority was revoked in 2019 for the MAX and 2022 for the Dreamliner following fatal crashes and production defects. The FAA stated the decision follows a thorough review of Boeing's quality control and will allow its inspectors to focus on other areas of the production process. This move signals growing regulatory confidence in Boeing's safety improvements after years of intense scrutiny.</p>

          <p>Despite an explosive start from Bryson DeChambeau, Team USA faltered in the opening foursomes session of the Ryder Cup, allowing Europe to establish a dominant 3-1 lead. The day began with a raucous, pro-American crowd at Bethpage Black, energized when DeChambeau nearly drove the first green to secure an early lead. However, the European pairs demonstrated steady and precise play, systematically quieting the home fans. Europe won three of the four morning matches decisively, with only Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay managing to salvage a point for the U.S. team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, the monthly cost of a $150,000 home equity loan has slightly decreased, making it a more affordable option for homeowners. For a 10-year term, the average monthly payment is now around $1,847, while a 15-year term costs about $1,452. These figures represent a modest saving of approximately $16 per month compared to rates earlier in the year. While the savings are not dramatic, potential future rate cuts could further enhance the appeal of using home equity for large borrowing needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Dutch government has announced it will return a significant collection of over 28,000 fossils to Indonesia, including parts of the historic "Java Man." These fossils, the first known remains of Homo erectus, were excavated in the 1890s by Dutch anthropologist Eugene Dubois when Indonesia was a Dutch colony. The decision follows a recommendation from a committee which concluded the items were likely removed against the will of the local people. This repatriation is part of a broader effort by the Netherlands to reckon with its colonial past and return cultural artifacts to their countries of origin.</p>

The Coast Guard released images showing bales of cocaine being offloaded and one of the intercepted smuggling boats on fire.

          <p>The Ryder Cup's arrival at Bethpage Black, a public course near New York City, has created an intensely loud and partisan environment, testing the composure of both American and European golfers. The biennial event is already known for its tribal atmosphere, but the New York setting has amplified the noise and heckling, which players like Rory McIlroy anticipated. This unique setting pits the traditional quiet etiquette of golf against a boisterous, stadium-like crowd. The article suggests this environment makes the home-field advantage particularly potent and poses a significant mental challenge for the visiting European team.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The "rule of thirds" is a retirement income strategy gaining traction among those concerned about outliving their savings. It involves converting one-third of one's retirement portfolio into a guaranteed lifetime income product, such as a fixed annuity, to cover essential expenses. The remaining two-thirds of the savings can then be invested for growth, used for discretionary spending, or kept as a reserve for unexpected costs. This approach aims to create a balanced financial foundation by blending the security of a pension-like income stream with the flexibility and growth potential of market investments.

Immigration attorneys report that the new price point makes it highly competitive with other countries' "golden visa" programs and has already attracted inquiries from high-net-worth families.
