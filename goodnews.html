          <p>The Tall Ships Races, described as Scotland's largest tourist event of the year, has begun in Aberdeen, with organizers expecting hundreds of thousands of visitors. The four-day festival features nearly 50 impressive vessels from around the world and includes a variety of family-friendly entertainment, concerts, and food stalls. Despite a yellow weather warning for heavy rain, the event aims to create a "party city" atmosphere and foster international friendship and sailing training for young people. The ships, including the 62.5m tall Dar Mlodziezy from Poland, will be open to the public before setting sail for Norway on Tuesday.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are escalating efforts to combat the smuggling of strategic minerals, labeling the situation as "severe" and vowing to strengthen export controls. A special operation launched in May has led to multiple arrests as officials target offenders who collude with foreign entities for personal gain. The government plans to establish a joint enforcement center to oversee exports of dual-use items, which have both civilian and military applications. Smugglers are reportedly using increasingly covert tactics, such as false declarations and transshipment through third countries, to evade detection. This crackdown aims to prevent the illegal outflow of critical resources and related technologies from the country.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently visited China, marking his third trip in a year and signaling a potential easing of Sino-US trade tensions. During his visit as a guest of honor at a major supply chain expo, Huang announced that Washington had approved the export of Nvidia's H20 AI chip, a model specifically designed for the Chinese market. His presence, along with a 15% increase in participation from US firms at the expo, underscores a moment of cautious optimism in the tech sector. Despite the positive gestures, concerns about the underlying trade war and long-term technology competition between the two nations continue to persist beneath the surface.</p>

          <h2>Americans Cite Needing $839,000 Net Worth for Financial Comfort, But Experts Advise a Broader View</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 09:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that, on average, Americans believe they would need a net worth of $839,000 to feel financially comfortable. However, financial experts caution against fixating on this single metric, arguing that it can be a misleading indicator of one's financial reality. Net worth, calculated by subtracting liabilities from assets, provides only a snapshot in time and doesn't capture the full picture of cash flow or lifestyle goals. Financial planners suggest that true financial comfort is achieved when money management aligns with personal values, such as security or freedom, rather than reaching an arbitrary numerical target.

          <h2>Fact Check Debunks Claims that Sunscreen Increases Skin Cancer Risk</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 08:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to claims circulating on social media, there is no scientific evidence supporting the assertion that sunscreen use increases the risk of skin cancer. Health officials and scientific studies affirm that sunscreen is a crucial tool for filtering harmful UV radiation, the primary cause of melanomas. The rising incidence of skin cancer globally is attributed to factors like increased sun exposure, better detection and reporting, and the historical use of less effective sunscreen products. Experts emphasize that while sunscreen is effective, it must be used correctly and consistently to provide protection, and they warn against false conclusions drawn from a lack of specific data correlating sunscreen use with cancer rates.</p>

          <h2>Activist Investor Elliott Management Takes Stake in Global Payments Amid Post-Acquisition Stock Slump</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 08:40:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a stake in Global Payments, a payment processing company whose stock has fallen significantly since its major acquisition of Worldpay. The market reacted negatively to the deal due to its high price, management's poor track record with integrations, and general skepticism about large-scale consolidation in the payments sector. Elliott's involvement is seen as a potential catalyst for change, as the firm could push for a reconstituted board to enhance oversight, restore investor confidence, and improve execution of the Worldpay integration. This intervention could help unlock value if the company can achieve its projected synergies. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the team's performance faltered in the final 30 minutes, allowing the Wallabies to narrow the gap with late tries, which tempered the post-match celebrations. While the Lions secured a 1-0 series lead, the lapse in intensity and discipline in the latter part of the game has given the team much to work on before the next match in Melbourne.</p>

          <p>In a story of resilience following the deadly Texas floods, a massive volunteer effort has enabled a summer camp for youth with disabilities to reopen. Camp Camp, located downstream from the area of the worst devastation, suffered significant damage from the floodwaters. A plea on social media for "money, manpower, and machines" drew hundreds of volunteers from across Texas and beyond, who worked to clear debris and restore the 55-acre property. This colossal community cleanup allowed the camp, which serves over 800 campers with a 1:1 counselor ratio, to welcome visitors again, providing a vital space of celebration and understanding for its families.</p>

          <p>A 50-year-old woman, who was in peak physical condition, discovered she had late-stage metastatic melanoma after initially dismissing a lump in her groin as a workout injury. The cancer, which is unusual for not presenting with a visible mole, had already spread to her lungs and brain by the time of diagnosis. Despite the grim prognosis, she underwent an aggressive treatment combining gamma knife radiation and immunotherapy. After enduring severe side effects, the treatment has proven remarkably effective, with scans showing major improvement. Her doctors now consider her a "Stage IV miracle" with an excellent chance for long-term survival.</p>

          <p>Over the 25 years since the establishment of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), ties between China and African nations have expanded dramatically in both economic and security spheres. Chinese officials highlighted that trade has surged nearly 30-fold and investment has grown 100-fold since 2000. In parallel, security cooperation has deepened, with China now training approximately 2,000 African military officers annually and becoming a leading arms supplier to the continent. This strategic partnership has allowed China to significantly increase its influence in Africa, in many cases outpacing traditional powers like the US, Russia, and France.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army has announced plans to significantly reduce its Military Working Equid program, with 141 of its 236 horses, donkeys, and mules being made available for adoption. These animals primarily serve in ceremonial roles, such as honor guards and funeral processions at Arlington National Cemetery, providing a living connection to American military heritage. While the Army has not used equids in combat since 1942, their stately presence in rituals honoring fallen soldiers is a deeply respected tradition. The move is expected to save approximately $2 million annually, and the Army will retain some animals for key ceremonial duties.</p>

A victory would be historic, making him one of the oldest champions in boxing history. While critics question his ability to compete at this level after a long hiatus, Pacquiao and his long-time trainer Freddie Roach are confident that his disciplined training regimen will overcome the challenge of facing a younger, taller opponent in his prime.</p>

This "agreement to principles" is a significant step toward ending decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, a crisis that has displaced over seven million people. The deal calls for a halt to hate propaganda and any attempts to seize new territory by force.

Led by Republican Thomas Massie and Democrat Ro Khanna, the group is using a discharge petition to try and force a vote on a resolution demanding full transparency. This alliance, which includes figures like Marjorie Taylor Greene and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has found common ground on the issue, creating a political headache for both party leadership and the White House.
