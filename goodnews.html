          <p>The World Bank announced it has cleared Syria's $15.5 million debt after Saudi Arabia and Qatar made the payments, enabling the country to receive grants for reconstruction and economic recovery. This move follows President Trump's decision to lift sanctions on Syria and a meeting with Syria's new president, Ahmed al-Shara, signaling a shift in U.S. policy and easing Syria's diplomatic isolation. DP World has also signed an $800-million agreement to develop the port of Tartus, reflecting growing confidence in Syria's stability. However, sectarian violence, infrastructure damage, and displaced populations continue to pose challenges for the war-torn nation.</p>

Despite his assassination of a top Japanese official, his captors preserved his calligraphy, reflecting the complex cultural and political dynamics of early 20th-century East Asia. The auctioned piece, symbolizing integrity, was purchased by the family of South Korea's LS Group, with plans to share it with the public.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve will reduce its headcount by 10% over the next couple of years, according to a memo from Chair Jerome Powell. The reduction will involve consolidating functions, modernizing practices, and offering a voluntary deferred resignation program to eligible employees. This move comes as the Trump administration pushes for cost cuts across civil service agencies, although Powell's memo did not explicitly cite this as a factor. The central bank had just under 24,000 employees in 2023, so a 10% reduction would bring that number below 22,000.</p>
