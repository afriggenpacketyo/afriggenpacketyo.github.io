          <p>A power cut, suspected to be caused by sabotage, disrupted screenings on the final day of the Cannes Film Festival, affecting approximately 160,000 homes in Cannes and surrounding areas. According to officials, an electricity substation was set on fire and a pylon at another location was damaged, leading to the outage. Despite the disruption, organizers confirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned due to an alternative power supply. The power outage also impacted local shops and restaurants, causing operational difficulties, but electricity was fully restored by late afternoon.</p>

Fetterman expresses frustration over constant questions about his mental health, saying he is showing up because the media has portrayed his absenteeism as a sign of mental unfitness.

          <h2>Norris Takes Pole Position from Leclerc at Monaco Grand Prix</h2>

          <p>Lando Norris secured pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix, outperforming Charles Leclerc. It was an important statement for Norris, who has been overshadowed by Piastri this season. Leclerc, disappointed to miss out on pole, rued traffic on his first lap of final qualifying. Hamilton's fourth place, 0.319secs off Leclerc, was his best qualifying result of the season apart from taking pole for the sprint in China, but the penalty - caused by a confusion with his engineer, who told him Verstappen was on a slow lap when in fact he was on a flying lap - undoes the good work.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's six-wicket haul broke Zimbabwe's resistance and led England to victory by an innings and 45 runs inside three days of the one-off Test. Bashir claimed 6-81 at Trent Bridge, his best figures in Test cricket, to dismiss the tourists for 255 in their second innings. Despite lacking penetration at times, England's seam bowling and Bashir's performance secured the win. Bashir became the youngest England bowler to 50 Test wickets and only the fourth to have three five-wicket hauls before the age of 22.</p>

          <p>Iran and the United States made modest progress during talks in Rome over the future of Iran‚Äôs nuclear program, but a core disagreement over uranium enrichment was not resolved. Washington demands that Iran halt all uranium enrichment and dismantle its centrifuges, while Iran insists on the right to enrich uranium at lower levels. Negotiators are trying to break the deadlock to outline an agreement for technical teams to fill out. A possible interim arrangement could involve Iran halting enrichment in return for some sanctions relief.</p>
