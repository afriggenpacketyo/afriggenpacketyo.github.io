          <p>Johann Wadephul of the CDU has been appointed Germany's new foreign minister, succeeding Annalena Baerbock and marking the first time in decades that both the Chancellery and Foreign Ministry are held by the same party. Wadephul, a foreign policy expert and confidant of likely Chancellor Friedrich Merz, aims to prioritize transatlantic relations, NATO, and relations with China and Russia. He also intends to involve the US in a potential peace solution for Ukraine and has stated that he will not continue Baerbock's feminist foreign policy, instead setting his own priorities. This article underscores Germany's commitment to supporting Ukraine and strengthening European partnerships.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice David Souter passed away at 85 in New Hampshire, having been appointed by President George H.W. Bush in 1990 and retiring in 2009. Souter, often aligned with liberal justices, notably upheld the constitutional right to abortion in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, a decision later overturned in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. His relatively early retirement allowed President Barack Obama to appoint Justice Sonia Sotomayor, shifting the court's ideological balance. This article highlights Souter's unexpected alignment with liberal causes despite his Republican roots.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled.

          <p>Social Security recipients may see a delayed payment schedule in May, with traditional payments starting to go out on the 14th, which is later than in other months, due to the way the payment schedule falls on the calendar.
