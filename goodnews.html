          <p>Sir John Curtice analyzes Reform's significant gains in recent local council elections, noting their success goes beyond a mere protest vote. The Reform party secured the most votes and seats, gaining control of multiple councils, outperforming the Conservatives, Liberal Democrats, and Labour. The article highlights that Reform's appeal is particularly strong among those who voted for Brexit and feel left behind by globalization. This success poses a challenge for both Conservative and Labour parties, which must address the concerns of this segment of the electorate to regain their support.</p>
