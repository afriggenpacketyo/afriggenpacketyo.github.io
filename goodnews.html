        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup has sparked debate over its place in an already crowded football calendar. Critics point to player burnout, profit-driven motives, and the tournament providing a platform for figures like Donald Trump and Gianni Infantino. However, proponents highlight the positive aspects, such as bringing together diverse fanbases from around the globe and providing a stage for underdog teams to achieve stunning victories. The article reflects on whether the tournament, despite its flaws, could eventually win over skeptics, much like the World Cup and European Cup did in their early days.</p>

          <p>Despite a slump in Tesla sales across much of Europe and backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, the company continues to thrive in Norway. New Tesla sales in the country jumped 54% year-on-year in June, largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y. Experts attribute this success to the vehicle's competitive pricing and features that suit Norwegian needs, such as large luggage space and all-wheel drive. While a recent survey showed many Norwegians would not buy a Tesla for political reasons, the brand's strong market performance indicates its practical value currently outweighs these concerns.</p>

          <p>The UK government is putting a hold on its widely expected plans to cut the tax-free allowance for cash Individual Savings Accounts (ISAs), which currently stands at £20,000 per year. Chancellor Rachel Reeves had been considering the reduction to encourage more investment in stocks and shares. However, following discussions with banks and building societies, the Treasury has decided to pause for further consultation. A Treasury spokesperson stated the ambition remains to ensure savings deliver better returns and drive investment into the UK economy, indicating that reforms are still being considered.

          <p>A coalition of European nations, with U.S. officials present for the first time, has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a future stabilization force in Ukraine.

While no specific troop commitments were made, the move signals unified Western planning for Ukraine's long-term security and deterrence against future Russian aggression.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. This action aims to save the habitats of rare and endemic fish species in the river's upper reaches, which ecologists consider a last refuge. For decades, the dense network of dams has blocked water flow and migratory routes for fish, drastically reducing their spawning grounds and suitable habitats. The project reflects a growing focus in China on mitigating the ecological damage caused by past industrial and energy development.</p>
