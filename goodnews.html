          <p>Pakistan has taken on the rotating one-month presidency of the United Nations Security Council, a position it holds for the eighth time. This role comes as Pakistan serves its two-year term as a non-permanent member of the 15-nation body. The presidency is largely symbolic but provides a platform for Islamabad to address key issues amid significant global instability. Pakistan's UN Ambassador stated a commitment to peaceful conflict resolution, while observers anticipate the country will raise its ongoing conflict with India over the Kashmir territory, adding another layer to the council's agenda.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Questions Why French Cinema Avoids Depicting Its Own History of Slavery and Colonialism</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article explores the significant absence of France's colonial and slave-trading history in its national cinema, contrasting it with the prevalence of American films on the subject. The author notes that despite France having the second-largest colonial empire, French audiences often learn about slavery through Hollywood productions. The piece highlights recent, though marginalized, French films like "No Chains No Masters" and a biopic on Frantz Fanon that are beginning to address this historical blind spot. It argues that while these films are finding an audience, they remain on the periphery of a film industry not yet ready to fully confront these compelling narratives.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has reached its strongest level against the US dollar since November, and analysts predict this upward trend will continue into 2025. The People's Bank of China has been setting a stronger daily reference rate, reflecting a less bearish outlook on China's domestic growth and resilient economic data. Concurrently, growing concerns about the sustainability of US government debt and fiscal policies are contributing to an expected depreciation of the dollar. Investment bank Goldman Sachs forecasts the yuan will strengthen past 7 per dollar within six months and reach 6.9 in a year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a recent tech conference, panelists emphasized the need for emerging economies to develop "sovereign AI"‚Äîthe ability to control their own AI technologies, data, and infrastructure. This approach counters the dominance of English-based models from companies like OpenAI, allowing nations to create systems tailored to their specific languages and cultures. Experts suggested that the ASEAN region is well-positioned for this, and that utilizing open-source AI models and accessible cloud computing services can democratize AI development. This strategy aims to foster local talent and ensure the economic benefits of AI are distributed more inclusively, rather than being concentrated in a few nations.</p>

          <h2>Private Survey Shows Unexpected Expansion in China's June Factory Activity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-30 23:44:53 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A private survey has indicated that China's factory activity among export-oriented manufacturers unexpectedly grew in June, contrasting with official data that showed a third consecutive month of contraction. The Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing PMI rose to 50.4, beating estimates and suggesting improving market conditions. This divergence is attributed to differences in survey timing and company coverage, with the Caixin survey potentially reflecting a delayed response to a mid-May U.S.-China tariff reduction. Despite the expansion in production, new export orders declined and employment remained weak, signaling potential headwinds for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

The incident occurred as the Disney Dream was returning to Florida from the Bahamas. Witnesses reported seeing the two in the water before the ship's crew launched a rescue boat and swiftly brought them back aboard, a recovery that took approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Disney Cruise Lines commended the crew for their prompt and skillful actions, which ensured the safe return of both guests to the vessel.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has successfully pushed major housing reform legislation through the California Legislature, aimed at speeding up construction by easing environmental review standards. The new laws, Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131, exempt most urban housing projects from the lengthy California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) process. To ensure passage, Newsom tied the legislation to the state budget with a "poison pill" provision, forcing lawmakers to approve it. Experts believe the reforms could be the most significant changes to CEQA in its 55-year history, potentially unblocking numerous housing projects across the state.</p>

          <p>A top U.S. military commander has proposed reassigning some of the California National Guard troops currently deployed in Los Angeles to help prepare for the state's wildfire season. The deployment of roughly 4,000 Guard members was ordered by the Trump administration to handle protests, a move contested by state officials who warned it could impede wildfire response. The proposal suggests moving 200 members from Los Angeles to wildfire duty, acknowledging the state's need for firefighting resources during an expected "early and active" season. The request highlights the ongoing tension between federal and state priorities for the Guard's use.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has discovered that betaine, a compound naturally produced in the kidneys during long-term exercise, can help slow down the aging process. Their research, published in the journal Cell, reveals that betaine acts as a messenger that prevents inflammation and aging in multiple organs. It achieves this by inhibiting a specific enzyme associated with the body's aging pathways. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the anti-aging benefits of exercise and suggest potential new strategies for promoting longevity by simulating exercise's effects at a cellular level.</p>
