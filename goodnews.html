          <p>Shares of Novo Nordisk experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of the year, anticipating a reduction in competition from copycat compounded drugs. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter net profit rise, but also a lower-than-expected sales of its flagship obesity drug due to alternative versions impacting its U.S. market share. The FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling is expected to eliminate compounded versions, allowing sales to pick up again. The company is also partnering with telehealth providers to lower Wegovy costs and provide a trusted alternative for patients.</p>

          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed analyst expectations, but the company's revenue fell short of anticipated growth, causing shares to decline. The ride-sharing company reported a 14% increase in revenue compared to the same period last year, along with a net income of $1.78 billion. Uber's largest business segments, including ride-hailing and food delivery, experienced growth in bookings. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi emphasized the company's focus on autonomous vehicles, noting the successful launch of robotaxi services in Austin, Texas, and partnerships with various AV companies for ride-hailing and freight services.</p>

          <p>The UK government has lowered the minimum age for train drivers from 20 to 18 in an effort to combat driver shortages that frequently disrupt rail services. This change aims to attract younger recruits and replace a growing number of retiring drivers. Union Aslef supports the move, stating it will provide opportunities for school and college leavers, while the Rail Safety and Standards Board assures that 18-year-olds are capable of safely becoming train drivers. The government anticipates that new job and apprenticeship opportunities for 18-year-olds could be available as early as December.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have discovered genetic secrets in the roots of upland rice that are linked to drought resistance. They have identified a gene, HMGB1, that obstructs the development of deeper, thicker roots, which are crucial for drought resistance. By removing this gene, irrigated rice developed longer roots and greater drought tolerance, similar to upland rice. This discovery could transform widely cultivated irrigated rice into drought-tolerant varieties, enabling it to thrive in water-scarce environments.</p>
