          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron announced that 26 nations have formally committed to providing postwar security guarantees for Ukraine, including a "reassurance force" on land, sea, and air to prevent future aggression. This development follows a summit aimed at securing US backing for such guarantees, with US contributions expected to be finalized soon. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy hailed the move as a significant step, while the Kremlin dismissed the guarantees as unsuitable. The coalition's efforts also include a breakthrough in European countries purchasing US arms for Ukraine, with a recent delivery of long-range cruise missiles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order formalizing a trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% baseline tariff on most Japanese goods, including automobiles. As part of the agreement, Japan pledged $550 billion in investments in US projects and committed to increased purchases of American agricultural products, commercial aircraft, and defense equipment. The deal, which also offers "breakthrough openings" in various sectors, is expected to retroactively apply lower tariffs. However, the article highlights the significant financial hit Trump's tariffs have had on major auto manufacturers like Toyota, Ford, and GM. Domestically, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces mounting political pressure and potential leadership challenges within his party. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump reiterated his intent to impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not relocate production to the United States. Speaking at a White House dinner with tech leaders, including Apple CEO Tim Cook, Trump indicated that firms like Apple, which have pledged significant domestic investments, would likely be exempt. The US has been actively working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with major companies like TSMC and Samsung committing billions to build plants in the US. While the specifics of the tariffs and exemptions remain unclear, the policy aims to boost domestic manufacturing in the critical chip sector.</p>

          <p>A new study by Lightcast reveals a significant surge in demand for AI skills across the labor market, with employers willing to pay substantial salary premiums for workers possessing them. Job postings mentioning at least one AI skill offered 28% higher salaries, increasing to 43% for those with two or more. The demand is particularly high in non-tech sectors like marketing and public relations, rather than solely in IT. While some roles require deep technical expertise, general AI literacy, such as proficiency with ChatGPT, is becoming increasingly prevalent and accessible, signaling a widespread integration of AI across all job functions.</p>

          <p>A US bankruptcy attorney named Mark S. Zuckerberg is suing Facebook's parent company, Meta, alleging his account has been repeatedly suspended over the past eight years due to false accusations of "impersonating a celebrity." The lawyer, who has practiced for 38 years, claims these shutdowns have cost him thousands in lost business and that he has submitted multiple forms of identification to prove his authentic name. Meta has since reinstated his account and stated they are taking steps to prevent future errors. Zuckerberg has even created a website to track instances of mistaken identity.</p>

          <p>Nikesh Arora, CEO of Palo Alto Networks, expressed skepticism about the enterprise adoption of agentic artificial intelligence browsers without robust security controls. While acknowledging their consumer appeal for automating tasks like booking flights, Arora emphasized that businesses would require stringent credential and enterprise security measures. He predicted that such browsers, despite significant investment by major tech companies, would not be permitted in enterprise environments within 24 months unless these controls are integrated. Arora highlighted his company's acquisition of CyberArk to enhance identity security, citing credential theft as a primary cause of breaches and underscoring the need to protect privileged information.</p>

          <p>Hunan province in China is exploring a novel application for its digital yuan, or e-CNY, by using it to clear persistent payment defaults and "chain debts." This initiative aims to broaden the digital currency's utility beyond its current use cases since its 2019 launch. Analysts suggest that employing the digital yuan could enhance the traceability and transparency of often opaque payment relationships, allowing funds to reach the end of the payment chain directly. This move could significantly improve real-time visibility and control over economic transactions, potentially addressing long-standing issues of debt default. (not investment advice)</p>
