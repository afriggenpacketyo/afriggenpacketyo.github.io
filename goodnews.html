          <p>England forward Alessia Russo expressed her preference to avoid social media during major tournaments due to the potential harm from online abuse, citing personal experiences and the importance of focusing on team goals. Her comments align with similar sentiments from other Lionesses teammates, including Grace Clinton and Lauren James, who have also faced online abuse. Russo emphasized that the opinions of teammates, coaches, and family are the most important, and staying away from social media helps her maintain focus, and she aims to support younger players in dealing with online negativity. Other players like Kiera Walsh and Lucy Bronze also shared their experiences with social media's negative aspects, highlighting the balance between its benefits and drawbacks.</p>

          <p>New York Liberty coach Sandy Brondello acknowledged the significance of increased viewership following a game against the Indiana Fever, driven by Caitlin Clark's performance, despite the Liberty's loss. The game garnered an average of 2.2 million viewers on ABC, marking the third most-watched WNBA game ever on the network and a 76% increase from last season's regular-season average. Brondello emphasized that reaching a larger audience is a goal the league has been striving for since its inception. The WNBA has experienced a surge in popularity, correlating with Clark's debut, with last season seeing the most-watched regular season in 24 years and the highest attendance in 22 years.</p>

          <p>Michigan Congresswoman Hillary Scholten reported that she was on a target list of a suspect accused of killing Minnesota State Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, describing the experience as "truly chilling." Scholten stated that she received the news from state police during a Sunday evening at home with her children, and local law enforcement has provided around-the-clock protection. The suspect, Vance Boelter, allegedly maintained detailed surveillance notes on his intended victims, including Democratic politicians and abortion-rights advocates. Scholten emphasized that she will not be intimidated and called for bipartisan condemnation of political violence, while also criticizing Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee for posting insensitive images about the suspect.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, establishing federal guardrails for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a regulated pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill, which passed with a 68-30 vote, is considered a major legislative win for the crypto industry, which invested heavily in electing a pro-crypto Congress. The GENIUS Act sets requirements for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance, while also granting broad authority to the Treasury Secretary. The bill now heads to the House, where it faces reconciliation with its own version of a stablecoin bill. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New Yorkers will use ranked-choice voting in the upcoming Democratic mayoral primary, allowing them to rank their top five candidates. If no candidate receives over 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and subsequent rounds count voters' second-choice votes. This system has led to unusual alliances, with some candidates cross-endorsing each other to prevent former Gov. Andrew Cuomo from winning. The election board expects to provide preliminary totals for first-choice votes on June 24, with fuller results reported on July 1 due to the complexity of tabulating ranked-choice ballots.</p>

The show received two Tony nominations, including best original score and best featured actress in a musical, but did not win either award. The musical, adapted from Josefina L√≥pez‚Äôs play and the 2002 HBO film, centers on a driven teen in a garment factory in Boyle Heights, addressing themes of immigration and the American Dream.</p>

The feature, a refined version of the failed Tinder Social, allows users to select up to three friends to create a pair, browse and like other paired users, and open a group chat when both pairs like each other. Tinder said the feature helped bring new and returning users to the platform, and the company is rolling out AI features to help users create better profiles and reduce dating anxiety through humor. Match Group Inc., Tinder's parent company, is facing mounting pressure on its business, with a 5% decline in paying subscribers across all its apps in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
