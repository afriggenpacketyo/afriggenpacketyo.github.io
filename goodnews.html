          <h2>Analysis Reveals Why Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 10:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to a significant spike in U.S. consumer prices, with inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several short-term factors, including companies pre-ordering large amounts of inventory to avoid duties, a practice known as front-loading. Additionally, some businesses are absorbing the initial costs or using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments, waiting for more clarity on U.S. trade policy. However, experts warn that these are temporary buffers and expect prices to rise in the latter half of the year as these strategies become unsustainable. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To determine a company's true values beyond corporate platitudes, NYU professor and author Suzy Welch recommends a specific question for job interviews. Instead of asking about a company's values directly, she suggests asking, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" Welch argues this question often catches managers off guard and elicits more honest and revealing answers about the actual work environment and expectations. She advises asking this question late in the interview process, after an offer has been made, to gauge whether the company's real culture is a good fit for the candidate.</p>

          <p>A review of Brittany Newell's second novel, "Soft Core," explores its place in the growing genre of literature centered on sex work and kink. The book follows a 27-year-old protagonist named Ruth who works as a stripper and dominatrix in San Francisco, navigating the emotional and psychological complexities of her profession while dealing with the mysterious disappearance of her ex-boyfriend. The article praises the novel for its believable characters, sensory details, and nuanced exploration of the intersection between fantasy, reality, and identity. It positions "Soft Core" as a significant work that moves beyond simple titillation to examine the deeper psychology of its subject matter.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the third quarter in a row, public companies have acquired more bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a growing corporate trend to use the cryptocurrency as a treasury reserve asset. In the second quarter, public firms added approximately 131,000 BTC, an 18% increase, compared to the 111,000 BTC added by ETFs. This strategy, pioneered by MicroStrategy (now rebranded as Strategy), is being adopted by more companies like GameStop in a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment. Analysts suggest corporations are buying to increase shareholder value, a different motivation than institutional ETF investors seeking general exposure. (not investment advice)</p>

He is emphasizing his military background, which includes serving as a military aide to President Obama, to challenge Barrett, a former Army pilot. The district, which includes Lansing, was previously held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin and is considered a critical battleground for control of the House in the 2026 midterms.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at the career of Claire McCardell, a pioneering American fashion designer who transformed women's clothing in the mid-20th century. McCardell championed the idea that women deserved to be comfortable, introducing practical innovations like pockets, side fasteners, ballet flats, and washable denim to women's wear. Once a household name, she is credited with creating the "American Look" by rejecting restrictive European styles in favor of casual, functional, and elegant apparel. The piece explores her lasting but often overlooked legacy, arguing she was a pragmatic revolutionary who fundamentally changed what hangs in modern closets.</p>

Out of nearly 600,000 live births, 1,076 had fathers in this age group. The data also reflects a continuing trend of people waiting longer to have children, with a decrease in births to mothers under 30. Overall, the total number of births in England saw a slight increase for the first time since 2021, bucking a recent trend of decline.</p>
