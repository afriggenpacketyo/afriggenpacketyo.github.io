          <p>A package of three cryptocurrency regulation bills has advanced in the U.S. House of Representatives following a record-setting 10-hour vote. The legislation faced significant hurdles, with opposition from both conservative and moderate Republicans creating a two-day stalemate that raised doubts about the party's ability to unify on the issue. Despite last-minute negotiations and an intervention from President Trump, the process highlighted deep divisions over the future of digital asset regulation. The bills include the GENIUS Act, the CLARITY Act, and a measure to prevent the Federal Reserve from creating a central bank digital currency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prince Harry visited Angola to support the landmine-clearing efforts of the Halo Trust, continuing the humanitarian work famously championed by his mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. As a patron of the charity, the Duke of Sussex walked near a minefield and met with children being educated on how to avoid the unexploded ordnance that still litters the country. The visit aimed to highlight the ongoing danger posed by mines left from the civil war, which have killed or injured an estimated 60,000 people since 2008. The Halo Trust has cleared 120,000 landmines in Angola, turning former danger zones into thriving communities.</p>

          <h2>Australia and China Prioritize Trade Deals During Prime Minister's Visit, Sidestepping Port Dispute</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's visit to China, both nations have focused on securing trade and investment agreements, deliberately setting aside contentious issues like the Darwin Port dispute. The discussions have reportedly centered on expanding Chinese market access for Australian agricultural products, financial sector cooperation, and potential tariff reductions. Analysts suggest this approach is a strategic effort by Beijing to find common ground with Canberra amid its broader trade tensions with the United States. The move signals a pragmatic shift in diplomacy, prioritizing economic benefits over ongoing geopolitical disagreements.</p>

          <p>A tsunami advisory for Alaska's southern peninsula was canceled after being briefly issued in response to a 7.3 magnitude earthquake. The quake struck about 50 miles south of Sand Point, initially prompting a more severe tsunami warning and causing some coastal residents to evacuate to higher ground. However, officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration later downgraded the alert, stating that large, widespread waves were not expected as the event occurred in shallow water. The region is part of the seismically active Pacific "Ring of Fire," and the event caused no major damage or injuries.</p>

          <p>A specialized search and rescue team from the Czech Republic has arrived in Texas to assist the National Guard with ongoing flood recovery efforts, as about 100 people remain missing. The international support is part of the National Guard's State Partnership Program, a long-standing military relationship between Texas, Nebraska, and the Czech Republic. The collaboration follows assistance the Texas Air National Guard provided to the Czech Republic during its own severe floods in 2024. The Texas National Guard has rescued over 500 people since the devastating floods began, utilizing helicopters to evacuate those stranded by the rapidly rising waters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Companies are now using second-life electric vehicle batteries to power energy-intensive AI data centers, offering a more sustainable solution to the industry's growing electricity demand. In Nevada, AI firm Crusoe is using recycled battery packs from Redwood Materials to store solar power and ensure its data centers run continuously. This innovative approach addresses the challenge of powering the AI boom, which is projected to consume a rapidly increasing share of the U.S. electrical grid. By repurposing batteries that are no longer optimal for cars but still retain significant storage capacity, the system provides a renewable power alternative to building new gas-fired plants.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Bill Passed by Congress Aims to Prevent Foreclosures for Veterans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 20:24:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress has passed a bipartisan bill to help thousands of U.S. veterans avoid foreclosure, addressing a gap left by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The legislation creates a new program allowing veterans who have fallen behind on mortgage payments to move their missed payments to the end of their loan term, thus making their loans current. This action was necessary after the VA ended a previous assistance program, leaving veterans with fewer affordable options to catch up on payments than most other homeowners. The new law is expected to provide a crucial safety net and has been praised by mortgage industry and veterans' advocacy groups.</p>

          <p>A mother and her 9-year-old son who were lost in a remote California forest were successfully rescued after she left a trail of handwritten notes for searchers to follow. The pair became stranded after their vehicle's GPS led them down a remote road in Stanislaus National Forest where they lost their signal. The mother posted notes asking for help, while her son used a whistle to signal their distress. A volunteer search-and-rescue team discovered the notes and located the pair unharmed. Authorities praised the mother for her resourcefulness and for notifying someone of their travel plans beforehand.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has launched a new "everything app" called the Base App, aiming to attract a broader consumer base beyond just crypto traders. The app, which replaces Coinbase Wallet, integrates trading, payments, social media, and messaging functions on the company's Base blockchain network. A key feature is Base Pay, a one-click checkout system for USDC stablecoin payments developed with Shopify, which will be available to all Shopify merchants by year's end. This strategic move is designed to diversify Coinbase's revenue and drive mainstream utility for crypto by creating a user-friendly ecosystem for everyday transactions and content creation.

          <p>President Trump announced that Coca-Cola has agreed to replace high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar in its beverages sold in the United States. While the company did not explicitly confirm the change, a spokesperson acknowledged the president's enthusiasm and said details on new offerings would be shared soon. The move follows advocacy from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to remove certain ingredients from food products. The potential switch has drawn criticism from the Corn Refiners Association, which warned it could harm American farm income and manufacturing jobs while offering no nutritional benefit.</p>
