          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a critical flaw in hyperloop technology, addressing ride comfort issues that could make the experience "extremely unpleasant." Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) found that minor track imperfections and electromagnetic resonance can cause violent vibrations at high speeds. They developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort. The study used supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests to analyze and mitigate the effects of track irregularities on passenger experience.</p>

The act would expand occupational safety coverage, recognize incarcerated firefighters as employees entitled to wage protections and provide $20 million annually for states to adopt safety and wage compliance. The act offers incentives for other states to start their own versions of fire camps.</p>
