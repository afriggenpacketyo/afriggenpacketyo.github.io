          <p>Nike co-founder Phil Knight and his wife, Penny, are donating $2 billion to Oregon Health and Science University's Knight Cancer Institute. This contribution, the largest single gift to a U.S. health or academic institution, aims to revolutionize cancer research, treatment, and patient care. The donation builds upon a previous challenge where the Knights matched $500 million in fundraising, continuing their partnership with cancer research pioneer Dr. Brian Druker. The Knights are renowned philanthropists, with lifetime giving estimated in the billions.</p>

As part of the honor, run in partnership with Lego, Young was also featured as a Lego mini-figure on a digital cover of the magazine.</p>

          <h2>The Evolving Concept of 'Genius' Throughout History</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:25:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article from The Atlantic's archives explores the shifting definition of "genius," from an innate spiritual force to a scientifically quantifiable and heritable trait. It traces the term's history, noting how 19th-century thought, influenced by figures like Francis Galton, linked exceptional ability to heredity, which later fueled the eugenics movement. The discussion highlights that while intelligence may be partially heritable, genius also depends on social conditions and timing, acknowledging the complex interplay of talent, hard work, and luck. The piece reflects on how the concept has been used both to celebrate and classify humanity.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin is on a path to intensify into the Atlantic season's first hurricane by Saturday and potentially a major Category 3 storm by Sunday as it moves north of Puerto Rico. While the storm is not expected to make a direct landfall in the United States, its outer bands will bring rain and dangerous surf to Puerto Rico. The current forecast track shows Erin remaining over the ocean between Bermuda and the U.S. East Coast, though it is expected to generate a high risk of rip currents along the Eastern seaboard next week.</p>

          <p>Data analytics company Palantir has experienced a remarkable surge since its 2020 public listing, with its stock growing over 1,700% and its valuation surpassing $430 billion. A significant driver of this growth has been government contracts, particularly with the U.S. military, which accounted for 55% of its revenue last quarter. While its U.S. commercial revenue is also growing rapidly, the company's high valuation has raised questions, as its forward price-to-earnings ratio of over 280 far exceeds that of tech giants with much larger revenues. Investors are paying a high premium based on the company's strong position in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Military Academy's Class of 2025 has honored Peter Wang, a 15-year-old Junior ROTC cadet who was killed in the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting. Wang, who died while holding a door open for others to escape, had dreamed of attending West Point and was posthumously accepted into the class. Following nominations from his would-be classmates, he was recognized with an Honorary Graduate Award, with the certificate being sent to his parents. His story of sacrifice is now considered part of the class's shared identity as they begin their service as Army officers.</p>

          <h2>Opinion Piece Highlights New Department of Energy Climate Report as a Moderate Voice</h2>

          <p>A contributor for the Los Angeles Times discusses a new Department of Energy report that presents a nuanced view on climate change, acknowledging human contribution without predicting imminent catastrophe. The author praises the report for charting a middle course in a polarized debate, arguing it injects hard evidence and encourages open discussion. The report suggests that the economic damage from warming may be less than commonly claimed and that drastic emission-reduction policies could cause more harm than good. The author views this as a positive step toward crafting climate policy based on facts rather than fear.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Choosing Between Debt Forgiveness and Debt Management</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-14 13:03:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains the key differences between two major debt relief strategies: debt forgiveness and debt management. Debt forgiveness involves negotiating with creditors to settle debts for less than the full amount owed, which can significantly reduce the principal but often damages credit scores and can have tax implications. Debt management, typically arranged through a credit counseling agency, focuses on creating a structured repayment plan with lower interest rates, allowing the borrower to repay the full amount more affordably while preserving their credit. The best choice depends on an individual's financial situation, income stability, and long-term credit goals. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article contrasts the different approaches of leading plant-based meat companies, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods, as they navigate a stagnant market and criticism over their products being "ultra-processed." Beyond Meat is simplifying its ingredient lists, launching less meat-like products, and rebranding to "Beyond" to appeal to health-conscious consumers seeking "natural" foods. In contrast, Impossible Foods is doubling down on mimicking meat, launching more "indulgent" products and emphasizing taste as the primary driver for consumers. The success of these divergent strategies will likely shape the future of the alternative protein industry.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has abandoned its plan to introduce higher fees for wider burial plots at one of its cemeteries following criticism from residents and a funeral director who labeled it a "fat tax." The proposal would have increased the cost of a 6-foot-wide plot by 20% compared to a standard 5-foot grave. The council had initially defended the move by citing increased demand and higher obesity rates in the city. However, after a BBC investigation and public outcry, the local authority announced it would not proceed with the plans.</p>

The statement comes as some major US and UK banks have withdrawn from the Net-Zero Banking Alliance, highlighting a growing schism in the financial sector over green commitments.

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has declined to 6.58%, its lowest point since October of the previous year. This marks the fourth consecutive week of falling rates, providing some relief and increased purchasing power for potential homebuyers in a housing market that has been sluggish due to high borrowing costs. The drop is partly linked to a decrease in the 10-year Treasury yield, fueled by speculation that the Federal Reserve may cut its key interest rate next month. However, economists still anticipate rates will remain above 6% for the rest of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

His stance on monetary policy aligns with President Trump's repeated calls for the Fed to ease rates.
