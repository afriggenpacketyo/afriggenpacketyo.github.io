          <p>Taylor Swift is no longer required to testify in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, as Baldoni's team withdrew the subpoena. Lively's representatives expressed approval, affirming their support against unjust harassment of third parties. The dispute centers around Lively's lawsuit against Baldoni for sexual harassment, retaliation, and emotional distress during the production of "It Ends With Us." Baldoni counter-sued, alleging extortion and defamation, claiming Lively leveraged her friendship with Swift to pressure him during filming. Swift's spokesperson previously stated she had minimal involvement with the film beyond licensing a song.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, approaching $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, coupled with Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have also contributed to the cryptocurrency's rise. Despite a recent drop in U.S. equities, Bitcoin's price has continued to climb, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. The cryptocurrency is up more than 19% this year, supported by steady inflows into Bitcoin ETFs and a pro-crypto agenda from President Trump.</p>

          <p>This Atlantic article discusses the importance of defending academic freedom, even when controversial or unpopular ideas are presented. Referencing Joseph Alsop's 1953 defense of academic freedom during the McCarthy era, the article draws parallels to current challenges, including the Trump administration's actions against foreign students and the cancellation of visas for viewpoints deemed "bad". It highlights the need to uphold unrestricted freedom of thought and due process, emphasizing that suppressing ideas can lead to broader purges. The piece argues that modern threats to academic freedom may surpass those of the 1950s, and that defending these principles is essential for intellectual progress.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from terminating the legal status of thousands of international students, finding that the action likely violated their due process rights. The ruling, issued by Judge Jeffrey White, prevents immigration officials from arresting, jailing, or deporting affected students. The case arose after the administration terminated the SEVIS records of students identified under the "Student Criminal Alien Initiative." The judge found the administration's actions to be unlawful and a cause for concern, as they tried to put future SEVIS terminations beyond judicial review.</p>

          <p>With gold prices reaching record highs, it's crucial to understand common misconceptions about this precious metal. This article debunks three myths: that gold's price always rises, that inflation always causes its price to rise, and that it's always worth waiting for a price drop before investing. The price of gold can fluctuate, it doesn't always rise with inflation, and waiting for a significant price drop may not be the best strategy. Recognizing these realities can help investors make more informed decisions about gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>
