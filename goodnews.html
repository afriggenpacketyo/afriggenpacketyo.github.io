          <p>Coca-Cola's second-quarter earnings and revenue exceeded Wall Street predictions, largely driven by strong performance in its Europe, Middle East, and Africa division. However, the company experienced a 1% decrease in global unit case volume, with declines in North America, Latin America, and Asia-Pacific markets. CEO James Quincey noted that while some markets showed sequential improvement, economic uncertainty continues to affect consumer confidence. The company narrowed its full-year earnings growth forecast to the top end of its previous range, projecting 3% growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Coca-Cola has announced it will launch a version of its namesake soda sweetened with U.S.-produced cane sugar this fall, complementing its existing high-fructose corn syrup formula. The move follows a social media post by President Donald Trump advocating for the change, which the company acknowledged. While "Mexican Coke," made with cane sugar, has long been popular in the U.S., this new product will be an official domestic offering. The decision comes despite long-standing U.S. tariffs that make cane sugar a more expensive ingredient than domestically subsidized corn syrup.</p>

          <p>Lenders are increasingly offering promotional introductory rates on home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) to attract borrowers amid a high-interest-rate environment. While these low initial rates can be appealing, financial experts urge homeowners to be cautious and read the fine print carefully. Borrowers should understand when the promotional period ends and how significantly the rate will increase afterward. The article advises evaluating the long-term costs, potential prepayment penalties, and any hidden requirements, such as opening other accounts, to determine if the offer aligns with their financial goals.

          <p>Following Coca-Cola's announcement to offer a cane sugar-sweetened soda, health experts are clarifying the nutritional differences between it and high-fructose corn syrup. While cane sugar (sucrose) and high-fructose corn syrup have slightly different compositions of fructose and glucose, dietitians state their overall health impacts are very similar when consumed in excess. Both are considered "empty calories" and contribute to the same health risks, such as weight gain and Type 2 diabetes. Experts emphasize that moderation is key and limiting intake of all added sugars is more important than choosing one type over the other.</p>
