          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued via helicopter after spending two days trapped behind the Seven Teacups waterfalls in California. The man became stuck when the powerful hydraulics of the water forced him off his rappelling lines during a descent. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office initiated an extensive search after he was reported missing, eventually locating him with a drone before a California Highway Patrol helicopter was called in to perform the technical hoist rescue and bring him to safety.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Guatemala have successfully freed nine prison guards who were held hostage by rioting inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang for three days. The riots, which also involved the rival Barrio 18 gang across two separate prisons, began in demand for the return of transferred gang leaders. The release follows a separate incident where 11 other guards were also freed, though the wider unrest resulted in the death of one prison official from a gunshot wound.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding internationally, offering authentic regional cuisines that go far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein and sweet-and-sour chicken. Using the diverse market of Singapore as a launchpad, these brands are introducing diverse flavors from regions like Hunan and Zhejiang, challenging old stereotypes about Chinese food. This culinary expansion is seen by some analysts as a form of soft power or "ping-pong diplomacy," potentially softening China's global image and boosting its cultural influence abroad.</p>

          <p>Samsung is regaining significant ground against Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its share of shipments rising from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined. This market shift is partly driven by the growing consumer interest in Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone design. The trend has put pressure on Apple, which is now widely expected to release its own slimmer and potentially foldable iPhones in the coming years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are strongly advising adults over the age of 60 to incorporate more salmon into their regular diets in order to better support their cardiovascular health. Salmon is a high-quality protein that is exceptionally rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which scientific studies have shown can help lower "bad" LDL cholesterol, reduce chronic inflammation, and support healthy blood vessel function. As the risk of heart disease increases significantly with age, experts emphasize that dietary choices, including the source of protein, play a crucial role in mitigating risk factors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Erin's explosive growth from a tropical storm to a Category 5 hurricane is a textbook example of "rapid intensification," a process fueled by specific atmospheric and oceanic conditions. The storm's development was aided by low wind shear and its path over exceptionally warm ocean waters, with sea surface temperatures exceeding 85 degrees Fahrenheit. This phenomenon, which scientific consensus suggests climate change is making more common, allows storms to gain strength very quickly, complicating forecasting models and shortening timelines for emergency preparations on the ground.</p>
