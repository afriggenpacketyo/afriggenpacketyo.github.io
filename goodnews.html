          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition for qualifying students. The bill provides $10,000 per year for most students attending accredited private schools, up to $30,000 for students with disabilities, and $2,000 a year for home-schooled students. Supporters of the bill call it a historic step in ensuring educational freedom, while Democrats argue that it will harm public schools by siphoning funds to wealthier students already in private schools. The article discusses the potential impact of the new law on Texas education.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the North Carolina Board of Elections to certify the results of a contentious State Supreme Court race, rejecting Republican efforts to throw out thousands of votes. The ruling is a significant victory for Democratic incumbent Justice Allison Riggs, who won by 734 votes. The judge stated that retroactively invalidating ballots would violate voters' due process rights. The case has tested the boundaries of post-election litigation, and election experts warn that the challenges could create a blueprint for future attempts to overturn elections.</p>
