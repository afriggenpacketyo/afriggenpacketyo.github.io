          <h2>Parenting Expert Shares Phrases to Encourage Children's Cooperation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 19:56:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests using specific phrases to foster cooperation in children rather than resorting to threats or bribes. These phrases focus on respecting a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries, validating their emotions, and inviting problem-solving. Examples include explaining decisions instead of saying 'Because I said so,' and framing requests positively rather than issuing threats. By creating conditions where cooperation feels natural, parents can reduce power struggles and raise emotionally resilient children.</p>

          <p>Prescriptions for the weight loss drug Mounjaro will be available through NHS GPs in England starting today, but only for individuals meeting specific criteria, including a BMI of 40 or over and several related health conditions. NHS England is implementing a phased approach to manage resources and GP workload, prioritizing those most in need. Some GP practices are advising ineligible patients not to book appointments to discuss the drug, and pharmacy organizations are concerned about potential supply shortages. The treatment includes wrap-around care, such as support for exercise and healthy eating.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has become the world's leader in electric vehicle (EV) adoption, with almost half of all cars sold in the country last year being electric. This success is attributed to long-term planning, substantial government subsidies, and dominance in battery production and supply chains. The Chinese government has invested billions in developing the EV industry, encouraging companies like BYD to switch from smartphone batteries to EVs. China also boasts the world's largest public charging network, making EV ownership convenient for consumers.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist in NHS Lothian is hoping to establish a clinic that offers ketamine as an alternative treatment for severe depression, particularly for patients who have not responded to traditional treatments like antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy. Ketamine, though illegal for recreational use, has shown promise in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on ketamine later this year.</p>
