          <h2>Semaglutide Shows Promise in Reversing Liver Disease in Clinical Trial</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 05:00:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial published in The New England Journal of Medicine reveals that semaglutide injections can reverse life-threatening cases of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The study, involving 800 participants across 37 countries, showed that 62.9% of those treated with semaglutide experienced less inflammation and fat accumulation in their livers, compared to 34.3% in the placebo group. Semaglutide, traditionally used for type 2 diabetes, also led to improvements in liver fibrosis and weight loss. The researchers are planning a larger, longer-term study to further assess semaglutide's impact on liver complications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Teaching Union Initiates Legal Action Against Ofsted Over Inspection Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-03 04:46:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) is launching legal action against Ofsted, the education watchdog in England, over proposed changes to school inspections. The NAHT argues that the new school report cards, intended to replace one or two-word judgements, are simply "another crude grading system." This decision follows criticism from the sister of Ruth Perry, a head teacher who died by suicide after an Ofsted inspection, who called for a delay in implementing the new system. Ofsted maintains that the changes aim to support mental health and considers the union's claims untenable.</p>

          <p>Five people survived for 36 hours in an alligator-infested swamp in Bolivia after their plane made an emergency landing due to engine failure. The pilot, Andres Velarde, managed to land the plane near the Itanomas River, where the survivors remained on top of the aircraft surrounded by alligators and an anaconda. They sustained themselves on cassava flour brought by one of the passengers while awaiting rescue. Local fishermen eventually discovered the crash site, leading to a helicopter rescue operation.</p>

          <p>South Korea and Turkey are poised to become the newest entrants in the exclusive club of nations producing 5th-generation fighter jets. South Korea's KF-21, while currently a 4.5 generation fighter, is slated for upgrades to achieve full stealth capabilities by the late 2030s or early 2040s. Turkey's TAI TF Kaan is claimed to be a fully fledged stealth fighter, although its stealth capabilities are still under question. The KF-21 and Kaan will offer countries previously unable to acquire stealth fighters a more feasible option, potentially altering the balance of power in global air forces.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding its general election amidst concerns over potential tariffs and global trade uncertainties. Prime Minister Lawrence Wong faces his first major test against a rejuvenated opposition, with the vote serving as a bellwether for the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). The election is taking place against a backdrop of potential tariffs on Singapore-made goods by the U.S. and broader concerns about the impact of global trade tensions on the city-state's economy. The PAP, which has ruled since 1965, is being challenged by a younger electorate focused on issues such as the cost of living and housing availability.</p>

          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antivenom has shown effectiveness against fatal doses from various venomous snakes in animal tests. Friede's motivation was to develop better therapies for snakebite victims, inspired by his own near-fatal experiences. The current antivenom is made by injecting small doses of snake venom into animals, such as horses, and harvesting their antibodies.</p>

          <p>The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) intervened in the financial market to manage the local currency, which had risen above its trading band against the U.S. dollar. The intervention was prompted by a recent influx of capital into the city's bourse. The HKMA bought US$6.005 billion and sold HK$46.539 billion worth of local currency. This action comes ahead of a U.S. Federal Reserve meeting where interest rate cuts may be discussed, potentially leading to further capital inflow to Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Vietnam is undergoing significant administrative reforms aimed at modernizing the state, boosting economic growth, and consolidating political power. The reforms involve merging ministries, shuttering state-run media outlets, and eliminating approximately 100,000 public sector jobs. These changes are intended to streamline bureaucracy, redirect resources towards economic growth, and address dysfunction caused by the anti-corruption campaign. The reforms are also seen as a way for the new party chief, To Lam, to strengthen his position ahead of the Communist Party's 14th National Congress.</p>
