          <p>Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced that travelers without a Real ID, passport, or other federally recognized document will face additional screening at U.S. airports starting Wednesday, but will still be allowed to fly. This measure enforces the Real ID law passed in 2005 in response to the 9/11 attacks, with the Biden administration setting May 7, 2025, as the enforcement deadline after multiple extensions. According to Ms. Noem, 81% of travelers already have compliant identification, but travelers with standard state-issued driver‚Äôs licenses should allow extra time for security. The TSA assures that alternative verification methods exist, but the process may take longer.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick's new book, "The Art of Winning," features a comparison of Tom Brady and Patrick Mahomes, arguing that both quarterbacks are "really good" and excel at handling success. Belichick highlighted Mahomes' focus on missed opportunities after a narrow victory as an example of elite leadership, similar to Brady's constant pursuit of perfection. He also praised Brady's preparation and dependability, noting the challenges and rewards of coaching him. The article also mentions Belichick's relationship with Jordon Hudson, referred to as his "creative muse" in the book's acknowledgments.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, plans to shut down the direct communications channel between U.S. diplomats in Jerusalem working on Palestinian issues and agencies in Washington. This move will effectively end the special status of the Office of Palestinian Affairs, which had been sending cables to Washington without prior approval from embassy leaders. The decision came after consultations with Secretary of State Marco Rubio, with the State Department asserting that the change does not reflect a reduction in outreach to the West Bank or Gaza. This office is responsible for maintaining contact with senior Palestinian officials and reporting on Palestinian issues.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met with President Trump, aiming to assert Canada's independence while avoiding conflict, especially after campaigning on an anti-Trump platform. Despite Trump's pre-meeting criticisms of Canada, the meeting was cordial, with Trump praising Carney's electoral victory. Carney emphasized that Canada is "not for sale" in response to Trump's suggestions of annexation, but Trump responded with "never say never." The leaders discussed trade and foreign affairs, including tariffs and the Russia-Ukraine situation, but no major breakthroughs were achieved, though both sides expressed cautious optimism for future relations.</p>

          <p>A same-sex couple visiting Boston claims they were wrongly accused of being in the same stall in a women's restroom at the Liberty Hotel and were subsequently asked to leave. The hotel initially stated that security was alerted to two adults sharing a stall, which is not permitted, and that one member of the couple physically contacted security, leading to their removal. However, following an investigation, the hotel suspended the security officer involved, initiated mandatory retraining for staff on inclusive practices, and made a donation to a local LGBTQ+ organization, reaffirming its commitment to the LGBTQ+ community.</p>

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported first fiscal-quarter earnings that exceeded expectations and provided a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter, however they will take a $1.5 billion hit to revenue from chip restrictions to China.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom is seeking a $7.5 billion federal tax incentive to keep film and television productions in the U.S., aiming to counter the impact of tariffs on overseas productions. This proposal faces challenges due to political optics and competing national priorities, though Hollywood unions and industry groups support the initiative. A federal tax incentive could help the entertainment industry recover from recent setbacks, including the pandemic and strikes, and maintain its position as a global leader. The incentive would add to individual state programs and Section 181 of the federal tax code.</p>

          <p>With Mother's Day approaching, flower prices may increase due to tariffs enacted by President Trump, which includes a 10% baseline tariff on all U.S. imports. Since about 80% of flowers bought in the United States are grown elsewhere, this is expected to cause prices to rise. Some florists say they'll try not to pass on costs to customers, while others may source more local flowers to avoid the tariffs. Consumers may need to be more flexible about the types of flowers they buy.</p>
