          <p>Elon Musk expressed regret over some of his social media posts about President Donald Trump after a public dispute, which had led to market concerns over Tesla and SpaceX. The conflict stemmed from Musk's opposition to the Trump-backed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" tax and spending bill, which Musk claimed undermined the work of the Department of Government Efficiency. Musk also deleted posts referencing Trump's alleged connection to Jeffrey Epstein and supporting Trump's impeachment, while Trump suggested terminating government contracts with Musk's companies. Trump has since stated he plans to retain Starlink technology at the White House. The relative tone of the article is optimistic.</p>

          <p>German start-up Proxima Fusion has raised $148 million in a record funding round, aimed at developing the world's first commercial nuclear fusion power plant. The Series A financing round was co-led by Cherry Ventures and Balderton Capital, marking the largest private fusion investment round in Europe to date. Advocates say nuclear fusion, the process that powers the sun and stars, can play a pivotal role in the energy transition by providing virtually limitless clean, safe, and affordable energy. While some remain skeptical about the technology's readiness for commercial use, Proxima Fusion aims to bring the first European fusion power plant online within the next decade. The article is generally optimistic about technological advancement.</p>

Masaaki Okawara, president of Ohkawara Kakohki Co., and two others will receive about 166 million yen ($1.15 million) in damages. The case involved the export of spray-drying apparatus that investigators suspected could be used in making biological weapons, but prosecutors withdrew the indictment in July 2021. The Metropolitan Police Department will review its investigation of the case, after a Tokyo police investigator testified that the case was "fabricated".</p>
