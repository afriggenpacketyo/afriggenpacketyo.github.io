          <p>Following a single-medal performance at the Paris Olympics, Japan's national swimming team is implementing a new strategy to prepare for the 2028 Los Angeles Games. Athletes are living together in a "virtual athletes' village" to simulate Olympic conditions and build resilience to unfamiliar environments and unexpected challenges, such as travel delays. The initiative aims to foster team unity and improve morale by having athletes live and train in close quarters. Early results from a metropolitan championship suggest the approach is helping swimmers perform well even under less-than-ideal circumstances.</p>

          <p>A new pilot program in Kent, England, is teaching primary school children as young as five about sun safety to help reduce future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, educates pupils on reading UV indexes and applying sunscreen correctly. Health experts emphasize that sunburn in childhood significantly increases the risk of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer, later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, charities and dermatologists hope that instilling good habits early will help "grow skin cancer out of the next generation."</p>

          <p>Japan has successfully completed the 50th and final launch of its H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year era for the country's space program. The rocket, which lifted off from Tanegashima Island, deployed a government satellite designed to monitor greenhouse gases and climate change. The H2A series, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, has had a 98% success rate since its debut in 2001, playing a crucial role in Japan's space exploration. It is now being succeeded by the more cost-effective H3 rocket, aimed at making Japan more competitive in the global satellite-launch market.</p>

          <p>An estimated crowd of over 100,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, sending a clear message of defiance to Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which had sought to ban the event. The turnout was significantly larger than in previous years, with many attendees motivated by the government's opposition. The march, which celebrated human rights and solidarity, was addressed by Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, who framed the event as a peaceful show of freedom against a "hateful power." The government had tried to use a controversial 2021 "Child Protection" law to justify the ban.</p>

          <p>Japan's professional women's football competition, the WE League, concluded its fourth season with a record-breaking total attendance of over 337,000 spectators. This success is attributed to innovative promotional strategies and a new partnership with the men's J-League, which included a doubleheader event that drew over 26,000 fans. Individual clubs also saw success with player-led campaigns, such as one that attracted over 20,000 to a single match. While still behind top global leagues, the WE League is focused on using data and marketing tools to continue its growth and attract new fans.</p>

In two innings of work, Ohtani threw a 101.7-mph fastball, the fastest of his MLB career, and effectively attacked the strike zone with a mix of high-velocity heat and sharp breaking balls. Although his workload remains limited as part of his recovery, the outing was a significant positive for the team.

          <p>According to renowned computer scientist Harry Shum, former head of AI at Microsoft, China is rapidly catching up to the United States in the field of AI algorithms, despite still lagging significantly in chip technology. Speaking at an economic summit, Shum noted that while the U.S. maintains a clear lead in AI chips, a gap that will take years to close, China is making major strides in algorithm engineering. He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek as an example, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI using a fraction of the computing power.</p>

          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile shark while swimming at Jones Beach State Park on Long Island, New York. The woman, who was in waist-deep water, suffered minor cuts to her leg and foot and was treated for non-life-threatening injuries. While she did not see what bit her, state parks officials and experts analyzed photos of the wounds and believe they were most likely from a juvenile sand tiger shark. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended, but it resumed the next day after drone and lifeguard checks of the water found no further threats.</p>
