          <p>China's latest stimulus measures, including interest rate cuts and liquidity injections, have failed to significantly boost its stock market, as investors remain concerned about the economic impact of ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. The stimulus package, while aligned with economic priorities, is seen as a stopgap rather than a comprehensive solution. Unlike previous measures, this round is targeted at industrial and social needs rather than direct market support. Investors are awaiting more fiscal measures to boost consumer sentiment and support the real estate sector, which would lead to a meaningful rally.</p>

          <p>An Arizona court allowed the use of an A.I.-generated likeness of a deceased man, Christopher Pelkey, during the sentencing of his killer, sparking widespread debate about the ethics and implications of A.I. in legal proceedings.

While the judge praised the video's message, critics argue that such technology could open the door to manipulation and deception in courtrooms.

          <p>Analysts are offering mixed reviews of the US-UK trade deal, noting its limited scope and potential impact. While the deal includes tariff rollbacks on strategic sectors like cars and steel, a 10% import tax on most UK goods remains in place. The agreement expands opportunities for American agricultural products in the UK, but some analysts see it as a political victory for Trump with limited substantive benefits. American carmakers have expressed concern that the plans make UK-made cars less expensive to import than those made by their companies in Mexico and Canada.</p>
