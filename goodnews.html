          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp has officially endorsed former football coach Derek Dooley for the 2026 U.S. Senate race, aiming to unseat Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff. The announcement, made outside Dooley Field at Sanford Stadium, highlighted Dooley's background in law and extensive coaching career, portraying him as a "true political outsider" who could flip Ossoff's seat. Kemp emphasized that Ossoff's voting record does not align with Georgia's values, creating an opportunity for an upset. Dooley's campaign immediately gained significant momentum from this high-profile support, though it has already drawn criticism from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee regarding his past coaching career and policy stances, setting the stage for a contentious election.</p>

          <p>Mark Knoller, a legendary CBS News White House correspondent, has passed away at 73 in Washington, D.C., after a period of ill health. Renowned as the unofficial presidential historian and statistician, Knoller meticulously documented every presidential action, movement, and utterance across eight administrations, single-handedly filling a critical void in American history. Despite his demanding role, he generously shared his vast knowledge with colleagues and historians, believing in the public's right to know. Knoller, who began his career in radio and later became a prolific presence on social media, was deeply admired by his peers for his dedication, tenacity, and kindness, leaving an indelible mark on journalism.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-30 20:59:51 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Germany is experiencing a significant shift in drinking habits, with non-alcoholic beer sales more than doubling since 2013, while overall beer sales have fallen to their lowest in over 30 years. The Destatis federal statistics office reports a 6.3% slump in traditional beer sales in the first half of 2025. Brewers like Erdinger are adapting, with non-alcoholic varieties now making up a quarter of their production and being promoted at sporting events. This trend reflects a growing health consciousness among younger Germans, though full-strength beer remains a deeply ingrained part of Bavarian culture and festivals.</p>

          <p>A decade after its creator Hideo Kojima's acrimonious split from Konami, the iconic Metal Gear Solid series returns with a remake of its third installment, "Metal Gear Solid Delta." The original series pioneered cinematic gaming and explored complex themes, but its future was uncertain after Kojima's departure in 2015, reportedly due to spiraling development costs for Metal Gear Solid V. This remake leverages modern graphics and design, following a trend of successful remakes in the gaming industry, and aims to introduce the acclaimed prequel to new audiences while remaining faithful to Kojima's original vision, despite his non-involvement.</p>

          <p>The BBC is launching a new dating reality show, "Stranded on Honeymoon Island," hosted by Davina McCall, which combines elements of "Love Island" and "Survivor." Couples, matched by experts after a brief speed date, are immediately "married" and then stranded on a remote tropical island, living in beach huts and facing harsh conditions like mosquitoes, extreme heat, and lack of amenities. The show aims to strip away superficiality and test if genuine love can develop under adversity, with contestants, typically older than those on similar shows, seeking a more authentic and challenging path to finding a partner.</p>

          <h2>UK Deploys Advanced Techniques to Combat Invasive Spruce Bark Beetle Threatening Forests</h2>

          <p>The UK is employing an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs, drones, and nuclear waste models, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating pest threatening the nation's forests. This beetle, which has ravaged European spruce trees, was found to be arriving in the UK via wind currents, not just imported wood, prompting a multi-pronged response. UK government scientists claim success in eradicating the beetle from high-risk areas in the east and southeast. However, rising populations in Europe due to climate change, leading to stressed trees, pose an increasing risk of future incursions, necessitating continued vigilance and support for woodland recovery.</p>

          <p>New government data in England indicates that pupils who are partially absent during the first week of September are significantly more likely to become "persistently absent" throughout the school year, missing at least 10% of classes. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson urged schools and parents to prioritize full attendance at the start of the 2025 term, emphasizing that every missed day impacts a child's future. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic's peak, it remains a greater problem than pre-Covid levels. Headteachers highlight challenges like unauthorized holidays and medical treatments abroad, advocating for more support beyond school gates to boost attendance.</p>

          <p>Iowa Republican Senator Joni Ernst plans to announce she will not seek a third term in the U.S. Senate in 2026, according to a senior Republican official. Ernst, who was the first woman from Iowa to serve in the Senate and the chamber's first female combat veteran, won her second term in 2020. Her decision is expected to open up a competitive Senate race, with Representative Ashley Hinson (R-Iowa) already reportedly eyeing the seat. Ernst has served in leadership positions and been a vocal advocate for federal budget cuts, though she drew attention for her vote on Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's confirmation despite her record as a military sexual assault prevention advocate.</p>

          <p>Indonesian leader Prabowo is positioned to introduce a new, pragmatic roadmap for global diplomacy, advocating for cooperation over confrontation in an increasingly complex international landscape. With the United Nations often paralyzed by vetoes and competing national agendas, a "next world order" framework is urgently needed. Indonesia, as an economic powerhouse and a bridge between competing ideologies, holds a unique position as a growing middle power unaligned with any single ideological camp. Prabowo's philosophy of "constructive pragmatism" offers a potential corrective model for the current dysfunctional international system, focusing on practical actions to foster stability and collaboration globally.</p>

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting China for the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, as both nations face the impact of increased US tariffs. With India's goods now subject to 50% tariffs and China grappling with a sluggish economy and high US levies, both leaders are seeking a reset in their often-mistrustful relationship. Experts suggest this visit could be a turning point for the world's second and fifth-largest economies, aiming to improve trade, visa policies, and regional stability. Despite long-standing border disputes and other fault lines, a stronger China-India partnership could reshape global trade flows and reduce dependence on the United States.</p>

The council, which recently spent £55,000 restoring the clock, stated the chimes are part of the town's "character." Hotel co-owner Huw Morgan expressed dissatisfaction with the council's handling of the issue, noting the need to move guests due to noise. While some residents consider the chimes "background noise," the decision highlights a conflict between local tradition and modern commercial concerns, with the hotel planning to gather public opinion for a future proposal.</p>

Its controversial cover art, depicting Carpenter kneeling before a man, sparked debate but is defended by the artist as a lampooning of prudish instincts. Produced with a tight crew, the album blends '70s pop, country, and dance music, showcasing Carpenter's versatile vocals and offering a sharp, albeit occasionally less incisive, commentary on modern dating.</p>
