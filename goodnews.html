          <h2>Criminals Skipping Sentencing Could Face Additional Jail Time Under Proposed Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 04:24:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill being introduced in Parliament in England and Wales aims to add up to two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This legislative change comes in response to the distress experienced by victims' families when offenders avoid facing the consequences of their actions in court. The bill seeks to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice, ensuring they cannot evade hearing victim impact statements or being present for their sentencing. While some concerns are raised about the practicalities of compelling attendance, the bill is viewed as a symbolic step towards rebalancing power in favor of victims and their families, especially in cases of sexual assault or murder.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to escalating trade tensions with the United States, China's central bank has implemented a series of measures to stimulate its economy. The People's Bank of China cut interest rates and lowered reserve requirements for banks, aiming to increase lending and inject liquidity into the market. These actions are intended to mitigate the impact of tariffs and trade uncertainties on Chinese businesses and consumers. While analysts anticipate a modest positive effect, concerns remain about lackluster demand from borrowers despite increased lending capacity. The timing of these measures is seen as a strategic buffer ahead of trade talks with the U.S., signaling China's concern about meeting its economic growth targets.</p>

          <p>U.S. and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet in Geneva, signaling a potential thaw in the ongoing trade war between the two countries. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will engage with Beijing's lead economic representative, He Lifeng, in what could pave the way for broader trade negotiations. Both sides have imposed hefty tariffs on each other's goods, impacting global trade and threatening a global recession. While China emphasizes its willingness to negotiate, it asserts it will not compromise its principles for any agreement. Some analysts predict a swift trade deal involving the removal of steep tariffs, though maintaining some duties on Chinese goods.</p>

The company's chief commercial officer, BS Teh, said the new drive would have about three times the capacity of Seagate's top-of-the-line hard drives. He emphasized that this is a key enabler for the industry to meet the growing storage capacity needs of the market.
