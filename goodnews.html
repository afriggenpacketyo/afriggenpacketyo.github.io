          <p>Elon Musk concluded his tenure as a special government employee, with President Trump praising his work in the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). While Musk's initial promise was to cut $1 trillion from the federal budget, the White House reports savings of roughly $170 billion. However, an analysis suggests DOGE's actions could cost the government $135 billion due to lost productivity. Musk defended DOGE's work, expressing confidence in achieving the $1 trillion goal over time, while also noting his disappointment with a recent spending bill that increases the budget deficit. The article presents a balanced view of Musk's contributions and the criticisms surrounding DOGE's initiatives.</p>
