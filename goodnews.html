          <p>Representative Brittany Pettersen brought her 5-month-old son, Sam, to a House Committee on Financial Services hearing, where she questioned Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell about monetary policy. Pettersen, who is on the waitlist for childcare, balanced her congressional duties with caring for her son, who was dressed in a yellow onesie. Powell acknowledged Sam at the end of Pettersen's questioning, thanking him along with the congresswoman. Pettersen has been advocating for parental privileges for members of Congress, stating that the institution was not designed for women, as she is only the 13th House member to give birth while in office.</p>

Bayern, having already secured a spot in the next round, fielded a rotated lineup that lacked urgency, though they improved in the second half, a Kimmich goal was disallowed due to an offside.</p>

          <p>Anthropic, an AI company, won a legal victory in a copyright case regarding the use of copyrighted books to train its chatbot, Claude. A judge ruled that using legally purchased books for training was "quintessentially transformative" and did not violate copyright law's "fair use" doctrine. However, Anthropic still faces a separate trial in December over allegations that it downloaded millions of pirated books, despite internal concerns about the legality of using pirate sites. The ruling sets a precedent for similar disputes involving AI companies and copyrighted material.</p>
