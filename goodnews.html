          <p>A grassroots campaign called "Adopt a Corner" has emerged in Southern California, with local residents stationing themselves at Home Depot locations to monitor U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) activities. Volunteers, who describe themselves as regular citizens, aim to protect vulnerable day laborers by providing information and documenting potential raids, which they say have become more frequent. The effort reflects a broader shift in protests against federal immigration policies, moving from large urban rallies to smaller, community-based actions in suburban areas. The National Day Laborer Organizing Network is supporting the campaign by providing training to participants.</p>

          <p>The Ford Transit van, a vehicle that revolutionized commercial transport and became a cultural icon, is marking its 60th anniversary. First launched in 1965, its practical design and versatility made it a favorite not only for tradespeople but also for rock bands and, infamously, as a getaway vehicle for bank robbers. Despite production moving from the UK to Turkey in 2013, Ford's British division continues to lead its design and engineering. As the brand adapts to an electric future, it faces a more competitive market where its historic brand loyalty is being tested.</p>

The new venture, managed by The Brand House Collective, aims to recapture its former customer base by promising to honor the company's iconic legacy coupons. The new stores will feature a more focused inventory centered on home decor, bedroom, bath, and laundry products. This brick-and-mortar relaunch represents a significant step in the brand's turnaround effort after its previous online-only revival under the ownership of Overstock.com.</p>

          <p>After a 148-day mission, the four members of ISS Crew 10 have undocked from the International Space Station and are heading for a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean. Commander Anne McClain and her crewmates departed aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, marking the end of their scientific work and stay in orbit. Their departure followed a handover ceremony with the newly arrived Crew 11. The return journey will take over 17 hours, culminating in the first NASA-sponsored crew landing in the Pacific, a change made by SpaceX to ensure any debris falls harmlessly away from populated areas.</p>

          <p>Despite their starkly different political ideologies, US Vice President JD Vance and UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy have forged a notable personal bond, highlighted by Vance's family holiday visit to Lammy's official residence. Commentators suggest the friendship is rooted in shared experiences of difficult childhoods, strong Christian faith, and attendance at prestigious US universities. This personal relationship is seen as potentially significant in navigating UK-US relations, especially given both men's past criticisms of Donald Trump. The article notes that such personal diplomacy could be crucial in an administration that often personalizes international affairs.</p>

          <p>Director Antonio Negret's new horror film, "Shaman," delves into themes of demonic possession through an Andean lens, telling the story of American missionaries in Ecuador whose son is afflicted by a malevolent entity. A co-production between the U.S. and Ecuador, the film is described by Negret as having a distinctly Ecuadorian soul, drawing on local indigenous culture and the Kichwa language. To ensure authenticity, the production team collaborated closely with the local community near the Chimborazo volcano, who advised on traditional rituals and participated in the film. The story centers on the clash between the missionaries' beliefs and the ancient spiritual traditions of the region.</p>

          <p>A viral social media claim, allegedly from a retired pilot, stating that Donald Trump's plane flew to Jeffrey Epstein's private island 37 times has been found to be without evidence. An investigation revealed that the island, Little St. James, does not have an airstrip, making such flights impossible; visitors typically arrived by helicopter or boat. The Facebook user who originated the claim could not be verified as a former pilot and appeared to be wearing a costume in his profile picture. Trump has publicly denied ever visiting the island, and no credible evidence has emerged to contradict his statement.</p>

When play was stopped due to lightning, American Collin Morikawa and others were tied for second place at nine under.

          <p>To combat rising loneliness and social isolation, the city of Seoul has launched an innovative program called "warm-hearted convenience stores." These centers offer a welcoming, cafe-like space where visitors can receive free food, such as ramen noodles, and connect with social workers and other people. The initiative was prompted by an increase in "lonely deaths" and a study showing nearly 40% of households in the capital are single-person. The stores are designed to be accessible and remove the stigma of seeking help, attracting thousands of visitors, from the elderly to isolated young people.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The new documentary "It's Never Over, Jeff Buckley," directed by Amy Berg, provides a rich and honest look at the life of the gifted musician who died tragically in 1997. The film moves beyond the narrative of a doomed artist, instead focusing on his complex personality through interviews with his mother, former partners, and bandmates. It explores his creative blossoming in New York, his ambivalent feelings toward fame following the release of his acclaimed album "Grace," and the circumstances of his death, which loved ones maintain was an accident. The documentary is praised for its intimate and dimensional portrayal of Buckley.</p>

This article reflects on the legacies of these remaining pioneers, including Buzz Aldrin and Charles Duke, who are among only four men still alive to have walked on the lunar surface. As NASA's Artemis program aims to return humans to the Moon, the piece contrasts the Apollo era's achievements with the current challenges facing space agencies and private companies.

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the Norfolk coast as "illegal migrants" in a social media post. Lowe had urgently alerted authorities about a "dinghy" near Great Yarmouth and vowed to ensure the individuals were deported. It was later confirmed by the coastguard that the boat contained a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his error, the MP apologized for the false alarm and pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause.</p>

          <p>The Canadian government has announced it will lower the price cap on seaborne Russian crude oil from $60 to $47.60 per barrel, joining allies like the European Union and the United Kingdom. This coordinated action is intended to further restrict a key source of revenue funding Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine. Canada's finance minister stated that the move is designed to increase economic pressure on Moscow. The G7's price cap mechanism allows countries to purchase Russian oil using Western shipping and insurance services only if they adhere to the set price limit. (not investment advice)</p>

The surge followed CEO Tim Cook's appearance at the White House, where he announced plans to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts. President Trump indicated that this commitment to U.S. manufacturing would exempt Apple from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviating a major investor concern that had been weighing on the stock. The positive market performance also comes after a strong quarterly earnings report from the tech giant. (not investment advice)</p>
