          <p>England's women's rugby team, the Red Roses, advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals with a 47-7 victory over Australia, extending their winning streak to 30 matches. Despite the wide margin of victory, the team's performance was marked by uncharacteristic errors, particularly in the first half where Australia's intensity disrupted their set-piece plays. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the untidy aspects of their attack but praised their defensive strength, which kept the Wallaroos scoreless after the interval. The match highlights areas for improvement as England heads into the knockout stages of the tournament.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Kiko, a Category 4 storm, has shifted its trajectory northward, significantly diminishing the threat of strong winds and heavy rainfall for Hawaii. While the storm is still expected to bring large swells and potentially dangerous surf to east-facing shores, widespread damaging weather is no longer anticipated. Acting Governor Sylvia Luke had previously issued a state of emergency proclamation as a precautionary measure. Meteorologists are now more confident in the storm's altered path but continue to monitor for any potential changes.</p>

          <p>Oliver Laxe's new film, "Sirât," is gaining critical acclaim for its unique portrayal of an apocalyptic rave in the desert. The movie is described as a sensorial experience, driven by a powerful electronic dance music score and visceral imagery, rather than a conventional narrative. Laxe, who spent over a decade living in Morocco, developed the film organically by collaborating with attendees of "free parties." The film explores themes of community, crisis, and catharsis, and has resonated with audiences for its bold, unconventional approach to filmmaking.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen achieved pole position at the Italian Grand Prix by setting a new all-time Formula 1 speed record, surpassing the previous benchmark set in 2020. Both Verstappen and McLaren's Lando Norris broke the record, with Verstappen's lap averaging 164.466 mph. The new record is attributed to a combination of the current cars' lower drag, higher straight-line speed, and a recently resurfaced, higher-grip track at Monza. This achievement marks a significant performance milestone in the sport, beating even the revered V10-era cars on this historic circuit.</p>

          <p>The UK government is conducting its second nationwide test of the emergency alert system, which will send a message, siren sound, and vibration to all compatible mobile phones. The system is designed to warn citizens of life-threatening situations like extreme weather or terror attacks. Officials have urged the public to "keep their cool," emphasizing that it is only a test to ensure functionality. This follows a previous test over two years ago that revealed several technical issues, which the government hopes to have resolved for this trial.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order authorizing the U.S. government to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, similar to the existing terrorism sponsor list, which can trigger economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the measure is an "unprecedented action" designed to create new consequences for any nation or non-state actor that uses an American as a bargaining chip. The move aims to enhance protections for U.S. nationals abroad.</p>

Other notable moves include promoting Anna Turley to Labour Party Chair and bringing business executive Jason Stockwood into the House of Lords as a business minister. The reshuffle aims to reset the government's agenda after a tumultuous week.</p>
