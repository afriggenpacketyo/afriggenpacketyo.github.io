          <p>A Kyodo News survey reveals a rise in Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Cabinet approval rating to 37%, up from 31.7% in May.  The majority of respondents support a policy shift to increase domestic rice production due to record-high prices and shortages. However, a significant portion still deem the government's response to rising rice prices as insufficient. The disapproval rating for the Ishiba Cabinet decreased to 48.4%.</p>

          <p>A Welsh MP, Ruth Jones, introduced a bill to Parliament aiming to ban the import and sale of new fur products in the UK.  While fur farming is already banned in England and Wales, the bill seeks to address the continued import and sale of fur, raising concerns about animal welfare and the ethics of the industry. The British Fur Trade Association opposes the bill, citing potential trade agreement issues.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that Buddhist and Taoist temples across China have acted as unexpected sanctuaries for tens of thousands of ancient trees for over 2,000 years.  These trees, often over 100 years old, have been protected within temple grounds, highlighting the unique role of religious sites in preserving biodiversity in a landscape heavily impacted by human activity. The research emphasizes the importance of these temple-protected forests.</p>
