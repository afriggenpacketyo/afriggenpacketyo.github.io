          <p>Senate Majority Leader John Thune indicated he believes Republicans have secured the necessary votes to pass President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill." As the marathon voting session neared its end, Trump signaled flexibility on his self-imposed July 4 deadline, acknowledging the legislative complexities. The president also responded to criticism from Elon Musk, suggesting Musk's opposition stems from the bill's removal of EV tax credits and warning of potential consequences. The developments suggest a final vote is imminent after intense negotiations to secure support.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Explores Why Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Major Price Hikes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 10:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not significantly increased consumer prices in the U.S., with inflation remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering goods to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and utilizing loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. The ongoing uncertainty and frequent changes in trade policy have also made businesses hesitant to immediately pass on costs. However, experts warn that these are short-term buffers and price increases could still materialize later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Business Professor Recommends Asking 'What Kind of Person Should Not Work Here?' in Job Interviews</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to NYU professor and author Suzy Welch, asking "What kind of person should not work at this company?" is a highly effective way for job candidates to uncover a company's true values. This disarming question often elicits more honest and less rehearsed answers than direct inquiries about company culture, revealing potential misalignments in work-life balance or collaboration styles. Welch advises asking this question late in the interview process, ideally after an offer is made, to gauge the authentic work environment. The strategy helps candidates assess if a company is the right fit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A review of Brittany Newell's novel "Soft Core" examines the growing genre of literary kink and its shift from a taboo subject to a more mainstream category. The article discusses how nonfiction works aim to demystify BDSM, while fiction like Newell's explores the complex psychology and emotional landscapes of sex work and kink with literary depth. Newell's novel, set in San Francisco's sex industry, is praised for its sensory detail and nuanced portrayal of a protagonist navigating identity and loneliness. It reflects a broader cultural trend of redefining and destigmatizing once-forbidden sexual behaviors.</p>

          <p>A new biography, "Claire McCardell: The Designer Who Set Women Free," revisits the legacy of a once-famous American fashion designer who prioritized comfort and practicality. McCardell revolutionized womenswear in the mid-20th century by introducing innovations like functional pockets, ballet flats, side fasteners, and mix-and-match separates. She rejected the restrictive, Paris-centric styles of her era, instead creating an "American Look" that was casual, elegant, and liberating for the modern woman. The article suggests her design philosophy is still present in nearly every woman's wardrobe today.</p>
