          <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have announced a new 20-point peace plan for Gaza, pressuring Hamas to accept its terms or face continued Israeli military operations. The proposal mandates an immediate cessation of hostilities, the release of 20 living Israeli hostages and the remains of 24 deceased ones in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans, and explicitly excludes Hamas from future Gaza governance. This article highlights the plan's focus on an economic development initiative to rebuild Gaza, its provision for an eventual Palestinian state, and the significant international support it has garnered from various Arab nations and European leaders, who welcome Trump's efforts towards peace.</p>

Qian pleaded guilty to illegally acquiring and possessing the bitcoin, which originated from a large-scale scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims between 2014 and 2017. This article details the seven-year global money laundering investigation by the Metropolitan Police, noting Qian fled China using false documents and attempted to launder funds by buying property in the UK.

          <p>YouTube has agreed to pay $24.5 million to settle a lawsuit initiated by former US President Donald Trump, who alleged wrongful censorship after his account was suspended following the January 6, 2020 Capitol Hill riot. The settlement allocates $22 million to a White House State Ballroom construction project through a non-profit, and an additional $2.5 million to various pro-Trump organizations. This article notes that the agreement, which explicitly does not constitute an admission of liability, mirrors similar settlements Trump reached with Meta and X (formerly Twitter). The move reflects ongoing interactions and efforts by tech leaders to engage with the Trump administration following his second inauguration.</p>

          <p>Two mountain lion cubs, discovered malnourished and orphaned earlier this year, have been successfully rehabilitated and released into the San Diego County wilderness. They received specialized care at the San Diego Humane Society’s Ramona Wildlife Center, where human interaction was deliberately minimized to foster natural hunting behaviors and reduce future human-wildlife conflict. This article highlights the constant threats wild mountain lions face, such as vehicles, wildfires, and habitat encroachment, noting the species' "near-threatened" classification and a revised, significantly lower population estimate in California. The successful return of these cubs represents a hopeful stride in conservation efforts to protect this vulnerable population.</p>

This article highlights the team's strong starting rotation, featuring Blake Snell, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Shohei Ohtani, as a key difference from last year, while acknowledging the bullpen remains a significant question mark. The team aims to maintain recent offensive momentum and overcome injuries as they begin their wild-card round against the Cincinnati Reds.</p>

In a speech expected to be his "clearest statement yet of his political creed," Starmer will contrast Labour's path of "renewal" and "decency" against an alternative of decline and division, which he attributes to Nigel Farage's Reform UK Party. This article highlights Starmer's appeal to voters beyond Labour, his commitment to rebuilding Britain, and the difficult decisions ahead, including potential tax raises in the upcoming budget.</p>

          <p>An opinion article suggests Hong Kong could serve as China’s gateway to the United Nations, potentially bolstering global governance and reinforcing Beijing’s vision of international leadership. With its common law tradition, English as an official language, and low corporate taxes, Hong Kong is uniquely positioned to become a major UN hub in Asia, a continent currently underrepresented by UN offices. This article argues that leveraging Hong Kong, exemplified by the International Organisation for Mediation, would allow China to enhance its engagement with the UN, to which it is the second-largest donor, by bringing the world to China rather than solely telling China’s story.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily suspended the Trump administration's plan to eliminate 532 jobs at the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), the parent agency of Voice of America (VOA). The judge, Royce Lamberth, accused the administration of "concerning disrespect" for previously issued orders to restore VOA programming and operations. This article details how President Trump had signed an executive order effectively shutting down the broadcaster, which he labeled "radical propaganda," and how VOA had stopped broadcasting for the first time in 83 years. The ruling preserves the status quo, preventing the job cuts that critics argued would further hamper VOA's mission to project American values.</p>

          <p>Mumbai's long-delayed Navi Mumbai International Airport (NMIA) is set to open, aiming to ease congestion and become India's first fully digital hub airport, eventually handling 90 million passengers annually. While it represents a significant step for India's booming aviation market, the airport faces major challenges, particularly its distance from the old commercial center and current lack of direct metro connectivity. This article highlights that until "last mile connectivity" is fixed, NMIA's ambition to compete with global hubs like Singapore and Dubai for connecting flights will be hampered. Regulatory reforms and airlines' willingness to expand long-haul destinations are also crucial for its success.</p>
