          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares experienced a surge after the company projected improved sales for its Wegovy weight loss drug in the latter half of 2025, anticipating a decline in the availability of compounded alternatives. The Danish pharmaceutical firm reported first-quarter sales below expectations due to competition from these alternative versions in the U.S. market. CEO Lars Fruergaard J√∏rgensen stated that the FDA's end to a drug shortage ruling would enable sales to recover, as compounded drugs lose their market foothold. The company is also launching a direct-to-consumer online pharmacy and telehealth partnerships to lower Wegovy costs and offer a safer alternative to compounders.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's Taobao and Tmall Group (TTG) are collaborating with social media platform RedNote to enhance their domestic e-commerce presence. This cross-platform collaboration allows merchants to embed product links directly in social media posts, redirecting users to the Taobao app for purchases. The initiative aims to tap into RedNote's extensive user base of over 300 million monthly active users, amid increasing competition from platforms like ByteDance's Douyin.

          <p>A new study from UCSF indicates that psilocybin, found in "magic mushrooms," may improve mood, cognition, and motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients. The small study involved 12 participants with mild to moderate Parkinson's who experienced depression and/or anxiety. They received two doses of psilocybin, and follow-ups revealed clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function. Researchers emphasize that this pilot study lacks a control group, and larger trials are underway to rigorously test psilocybin's effectiveness and understand its mechanisms of action, while cautioning patients against self-medicating with psychedelics.</p>

          <p>German firms operating in China are experiencing a decline in their economic outlook due to the tariff war between the United States and China. A recent survey indicates that Washington‚Äôs tariffs on goods from China have had the most significant impact on these firms. However, their investment plans in China remain largely unaffected due to their focus on serving the Chinese domestic market, a strategy referred to as "in China for China." This deep localization has shielded their operations from direct exposure to the U.S. market.</p>
