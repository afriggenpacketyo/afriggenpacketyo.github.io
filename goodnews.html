        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that subsidizing men's participation in household chores and childcare could help reverse declining birth rates in countries like China. The study, co-authored by researchers from Fudan University and the University of Hong Kong, argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains compared to solely subsidizing mothers. This proposal comes as China faces a rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The article highlights the need for innovative policies to address the demographic challenges and promote economic stability.</p>

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's "996" work culture, which involves working from 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week. They argue that overwork leads to decreased retention and a revolving door of talent, emphasizing the need for sustainable innovation cultures. Founders insist that instead of increasing working hours, startups need more funding and resources to compete globally. They highlight that Europe's most successful companies achieved dominance through innovation rather than overwork, contrasting with the "move fast and break things" ethos often associated with Silicon Valley. </p>

          <p>UK doctors are testing "poo pills," containing freeze-dried faeces from healthy donors, to combat dangerous superbug infections. The stool samples are packed with beneficial bacteria aimed at flushing out antibiotic-resistant superbugs from the gut. Early data suggests that the pills can replace harmful bacteria with a healthy gut microbiome. This innovative approach targets the bowels, which are a significant reservoir of antibiotic resistance in humans, offering a new strategy to tackle infections that resist antibiotics.</p>
