          <p>Dutch cyclist Mathieu van der Poel secured victory in the second stage of the Tour de France, narrowly defeating Tadej Pogacar in a thrilling sprint finish. The win on the 209.1km route from Lauwin-Planque to Boulogne-sur-Mer also earned him the coveted yellow jersey as the overall race leader. The stage remained relatively calm until the final 40km, where a series of climbs and attacks fractured the peloton. Van der Poel, who last won a Tour stage in 2021, successfully capitalized on the challenging finale to claim the win.</p>

          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was disrupted when the electronic line-calling system failed on a crucial point. The system did not make a call on a long shot from Kartal, forcing the umpire to order a replay of the point, which Kartal then won. Pavlyuchenkova expressed frustration, stating the game was "stolen" from her, and questioned why the umpire didn't overrule the technology. The All England Club later attributed the malfunction to operator error, highlighting a rare but significant issue with the new automated system.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has introduced an autonomous version of its ID. Buzz electric van, designed for commercial and public transit fleet operations. The vehicle is equipped with SAE Level 4 autonomy, meaning it can operate without a driver in specific conditions, thanks to a suite of 27 sensors including cameras, LiDAR, and radar. Developed in partnership with Mobileye, the van is part of a comprehensive service that includes fleet management and real-time monitoring. The autonomous shuttle is set to launch in Hamburg and Los Angeles in 2026, aiming to address driver shortages and improve transit accessibility.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal was downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with maximum sustained winds decreasing to 35 mph. The National Hurricane Center has discontinued all tropical storm warnings as the system moves inland and is expected to dissipate. While the storm has weakened, its outer bands continue to bring scattered showers and thunderstorms to parts of North and South Carolina. Flood watches remain in effect for some areas, as the system is still forecast to produce heavy rain that could cause localized flash flooding.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" reflect on the famously difficult production that created a cinematic masterpiece and the first summer blockbuster. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls turning down the role initially, fearing a difficult shoot on the open Atlantic, a prediction that proved correct as the mechanical shark frequently failed. Director Steven Spielberg, then only 27, skillfully turned these setbacks into opportunities, building suspense by showing less of the shark. The article details the on-set ad-libbing, tensions between actors, and the creative decisions that turned a troubled production into an enduring classic.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow has released a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the man who redefined American literature. The article highlights Twain's journey from a boy in Hannibal, Missouri, to a global literary icon whose sardonic humor was often rooted in personal pain and a fear of poverty. Chernow discusses how themes in Twain's work—such as politics, race, and money—remain highly relevant today.

          <p>A 3,500-year-old ancient city named Peñico has been discovered in Peru's northern Barranca province. Researchers believe the city served as a crucial trading hub connecting early coastal communities with those in the Andes and the Amazon basin. The site, which contains 18 structures including ceremonial temples and residential complexes, sheds new light on the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization. The discovery is significant for understanding the continuation of the Caral society after it was impacted by climate change, highlighting the region's rich archaeological heritage.</p>

          <p>A communication expert and executive coach warns that certain common phrases can unintentionally make a person sound judgmental, potentially damaging relationships and trust. Phrases like "Why don't you just..." and "Actually..." can come across as dismissive or condescending, even when the speaker's intent is to be helpful or correct. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking "What have you tried so far?" instead of offering an immediate solution. By being more mindful of language, individuals can avoid putting others on the defensive and foster more positive communication.</p>
