          <p>Lando Norris secured his third victory of the season at the Austrian Grand Prix, leading a one-two finish for McLaren ahead of teammate Oscar Piastri. The win significantly narrows the championship points gap between the two drivers to just 15. The race was dominated by the McLarens, with Ferrari's Charles Leclerc finishing a distant third. A first-lap incident involving Max Verstappen and Kimi Antonelli resulted in Verstappen being taken out of the race, further impacting the championship standings and marking a difficult day for Red Bull at their home track.</p>

          <p>Located in the papal summer residence of Castel Gandolfo, the Vatican Observatory has served for over a century as a bridge between faith and scientific inquiry.

Scientists and students at the observatory view their work observing the heavens as a way to unite people across different faiths and backgrounds. The facility stands as a testament to the long and sometimes complex history between the Catholic Church and astronomical science, aiming to foster dialogue.</p>

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," explores the influential career of William F. Buckley Jr., the founder of the National Review. The book argues that Buckley was a pivotal figure who catalyzed the modern conservative movement, paving the way for political figures from Barry Goldwater to Donald Trump. Through his intellectualism, television presence on "Firing Line," and political activism, Buckley sought to make conservatism a dominant force in American politics. The biography analyzes his complex legacy, including his controversial stances on civil rights.</p>

          <p>The upcoming film "Superman," directed by James Gunn, presents a new take on the iconic hero, with actor David Corenswet in the lead role. Gunn explains his vision was for a more vulnerable superhero who is not indestructible and is more relatable to audiences. Corenswet, who follows in the footsteps of Christopher Reeve, discusses the challenge of portraying Superman's loneliness as an alien who desperately wants to be part of humanity.

          <p>British sports car maker Lotus has assured the UK's business secretary that it has no plans to close its factory in Hethel, Norfolk, following rumors of a potential production move to the US. The concerns, which could have jeopardized 1,300 jobs, arose after the company's Chinese owner, Geely, was reportedly exploring options to avoid US tariffs. Production at the Hethel plant was paused in May due to these tariffs but is expected to resume as they are reduced. The government expressed its commitment to supporting the UK automotive sector to ensure its global competitiveness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced a new plan to partner with major food retailers and manufacturers to encourage consumers to make healthier food choices and tackle obesity. Rather than imposing mandatory targets, the voluntary strategy will ask businesses to find their own ways to promote healthy food, such as through special offers or loyalty point incentives. The initiative, part of a forthcoming 10-year plan for the NHS, aims to make healthy eating more accessible and relieve pressure on the health service. Critics from the opposition have described the plans as a "nanny state" approach.</p>

The election is seen as a verdict on Ishiba's government amid public frustration with inflation and economic uncertainty.

          <p>An article argues that while statistics show Gen Z is having less sex than previous generations, they are not uninterested in it but are instead redefining it with a progressive, political lens. This generation, the most diverse in terms of identity and orientation, is challenging traditional definitions of sex, virginity, and gender roles. Having grown up amidst mass protests and the fall of Roe v. Wade, they view sexual freedom as a political battleground. The author contends that this shift represents a new sexual revolution, focused on dismantling old expectations and creating more inclusive concepts of sex and desire.</p>
