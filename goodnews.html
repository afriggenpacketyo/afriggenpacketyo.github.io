          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen and Tufts University student whose visa was canceled amid President Trump's crackdown on higher education, was released from federal custody after a federal judge's order. Ozturk, a Fulbright scholar, had written an opinion piece critical of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands. Supporters claimed her detention was retaliation for her speech and a violation of the First Amendment. The New York Times article highlights the judge's concern that her detention could chill the speech of non-citizens in the country, as the government had not presented sufficient evidence against Ozturk other than her pro-Palestinian essay.</p>

The New York Times article highlights that the case was solved through the use of an upgraded F.B.I. fingerprint search algorithm, which matched Sims' thumbprint found on a cigarette carton at the crime scene. The investigation revealed Sims was an Army private stationed nearby in 1977 and had a prior conviction for attempted murder and robbery.
