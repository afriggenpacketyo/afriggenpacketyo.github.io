          <p>China's most powerful destroyer, the Type 055, has extended its strike range by integrating with an airborne early warning system, according to CCTV. This allows the destroyer to engage targets beyond visual range with precision, similar to technology used by the Pakistan Air Force. The Lhasa destroyer participated in a live-fire exercise, using data links to synchronize with airborne platforms, enabling long-range anti-ship and air-defense strikes. This networked capability represents a major advance in operational coordination, ensuring complete interoperability and seamless information sharing across domains, according to military commentator Song Zhongping.</p>

          <p>The government has announced that two major new reservoir projects in East Anglia and south Lincolnshire will be fast-tracked to secure England's water supplies. These projects have been declared "nationally significant," allowing them to bypass local objections and speed through the planning process. However, the reservoirs could still be more than a decade away from opening. Scientists warn that household consumption of water may also need to decrease to secure supplies amid rising temperatures and a growing population. The government intends to pass legislation to automatically make the other seven proposed reservoirs "nationally significant" as well.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Golden eagles are venturing back into England from southern Scotland after years of absence, raising hopes they might nest. The resurgence is due to the South of Scotland Golden Eagle Project (SSGEP), which translocated 28 juveniles and 15 sub-adult golden eagles from the Scottish Highlands. These eagles have been spotted in Northumberland, the North Pennines, the Lake District, and as far as Lancashire and Yorkshire. Golden eagles were wiped out in England and Wales by the mid-19th Century, mainly due to persecution. The SSGEP is tracking the birds' movements and hopes they will establish a population in England.</p>

          <p>S. Jack Hu, former provost at the University of Georgia, has been appointed as the new chancellor of UC Riverside, succeeding Kim A. Wilcox. Hu's appointment comes at a crucial time for higher education, facing federal funding cuts and investigations. He will oversee a diverse campus grappling with challenges including cuts to federal funding grants and a UC-wide hiring freeze. Hu plans to diversify funding sources and prioritize student success, research, and community support. He also acknowledged that ‚Äúfederal funding cuts are a tremendous challenge‚Äù and that universities need to work with the federal government to sustain the partnership that universities in the country have built with the federal government.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to take steps to comply with a court order to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man, known as O.C.G., who was deported to Mexico and then sent to Guatemala. O.C.G. had been deported despite telling U.S. authorities that he had experienced violence in Mexico and was afraid to go back. Immigration authorities made contact with O.C.G.‚Äôs legal team and were working to bring him back to the United States on a charter flight. This represents a de-escalation in a case that is shaping up to be one of the key courtroom battles over President Trump‚Äôs attempts to conduct mass deportations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause it imposed on various immigration applications, saying it was not in the public interest for hundreds of thousands of immigrants to lose their legal status in the U.S. The ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Indira Talwani is a reprieve for many immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, Ukraine, and other parts of the world. The programs at the center of Talwani's order rely on a legal immigration authority known as parole. Talwani directed the Trump administration to end a pause it enacted in February to suspend the processing of immigration benefit applications.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is working to secure a charter flight to return a migrant to the United States after a judge ruled that necessary due process steps in his removal proceedings were "ignored." The migrant, known as O.C.G., was deported to Mexico despite an immigration judge's order barring deportation to his home country, Guatemala. Judge Brian Murphy found that O.C.G.'s pleas for help were ignored, and that his removal lacked any semblance of due process. The Justice Department admitted that a declaration stating O.C.G. had no fear of being sent to Mexico was made in error.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance touted the Trump administration's ties with the cryptocurrency industry, stating that crypto finally has a champion and an ally in the White House. Vance, speaking at the Bitcoin 2025 Conference in Las Vegas, emphasized that crypto and digital assets are part of the mainstream economy and are here to stay. Vance urged Congress to pass the GENIUS Act, which would create a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The Trump administration has leaned into cryptocurrency, looking to ease regulations, promote growth in the industry, and bring it into the mainstream. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security Administration Commissioner Frank Bisignano said that the agency plans to incorporate artificial intelligence into its phone systems to improve customer service. The agency receives approximately 390,000 calls per day, with an average wait time of 68 minutes as of April. Bisignano argues that technology and process engineering can increase efficiency despite plans to cut staffing levels. The SSA announced in March that it would require in-person identity checks, but the White House later backed off that requirement, allowing seniors to verify identities over the phone. Bisignano is seeking to reassure Americans that they will receive their full benefits, not just a portion of them, when they plan to file for Social Security.</p>

The Panamanian maestro has a vast repertoire, but his shows are limited by time and his tendency to engage in lengthy monologues. The Peacock Theater was not full, and security was strict, preventing people from dancing. The concert included new songs from his album ‚ÄúFotograf√≠as,‚Äù addressing themes of urgent actuality. Despite these challenges, Blades displayed remarkable vocal power and versatility, supported by the masterful Roberto Delgado & Orquesta.</p>
