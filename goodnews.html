          <p>Meta CTO Andrew Bosworth revealed that OpenAI countered Meta's lucrative job offers, including signing bonuses potentially reaching $100 million, to retain its AI talent. This revelation highlights the intense competition for AI expertise, as Meta invests heavily in superintelligence and related technologies. Meta's recent moves include investing over $14 billion in Scale AI for a 49% stake, hiring Daniel Gross and Nat Friedman from Safe Superintelligence, and approaching Perplexity AI for a possible acquisition. Bosworth emphasizes Meta's belief in AI's potential to assist humans, justifying the significant investments in personnel and compute power.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22, offering select individuals rides in its Model Y vehicles within a geofenced area. The pilot program, accessible via a Robotaxi App, will include a 'Tesla Safety Monitor' in the passenger seat and remote monitoring for safety. Elon Musk anticipates scaling the service rapidly, potentially expanding to 25 U.S. cities within the next year. The launch follows scrutiny from regulators and safety advocates regarding autonomous vehicle safety, as well as Tesla's recent financial results and Musk's involvement in the Trump administration's DOGE.</p>

          <p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court's decision supports civil liberties groups' argument that the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. The Louisiana Attorney General disagrees with the ruling's scope and intends to appeal, while legal experts anticipate the case will reach the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>An insurance firm has been ordered to pay nearly $44 million in a lawsuit filed by Ryan Ferguson, who was exonerated after being wrongly convicted of murder. Ferguson had previously won $11 million against police officers, but the insurance company, St. Paul Fire and Marine Insurance Co., resisted paying most of it. The company argued that its coverage didn't apply because the actions leading to Ferguson's arrest occurred before its coverage began. A jury concluded that St. Paul acted in bad faith and engaged in a 'vexatious refusal' to pay, resulting in the substantial punitive damages.</p>

          <p>Jia Zhangke's 'Caught by the Tides' is a reflexive remix of his preoccupations, drawing from nearly 25 years of footage to create a poignant story. The film follows Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) and Bin (Li Zhubin) through three chapters, exploring themes of globalization, alienation, and the weight of time. The film richly rewards viewers familiar with Jia's filmography with scenes and outtakes from his earlier movies. The director's fans may feel a bittersweet sense of d√©j√† vu, reminded of his earlier characters who similarly struggled to find love and purpose.</p>
