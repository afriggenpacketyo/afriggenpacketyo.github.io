          <h2>China's Chang'e-6 Lunar Samples Suggest Far Side of the Moon is Colder</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 06:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative study by scientists in China and Britain has revealed that the far side of the moon may be colder than its near side. This discovery was made by analyzing the first-ever rock samples returned from the lunar far side by China’s Chang’e-6 mission. The minerals in these samples appear to have formed in lava temperatures approximately 100 degrees Celsius lower than those from the near side. Published in Nature Geoscience, the research provides crucial new insights into the moon's thermal asymmetry and its formation, helping to explain the long-observed differences in topography and volcanic activity between the two hemispheres.</p>

          <p>A new Buc-ee's billboard has been erected on Interstate 95 near the planned location of one of its massive travel centers in St. Lucie County, Florida, sparking local interest. This is the second such sign in the area, though the first promotes a location 131 miles away, fueling speculation about the new site's progress. The Texas-based company, famous for its large stores and quirky marketing, proposed its southernmost Florida location in the county in 2023. County officials anticipate Buc-ee's will submit a new site plan soon, with construction typically taking 12 to 15 months once all approvals are secured.</p>

          <p>With the Securities and Exchange Commission streamlining its approval process, a wave of new cryptocurrency Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) is expected to enter the market. This article advises investors on how to assess these products, emphasizing the importance of examining the fund's underlying assets, whether it's a spot or futures ETF, and its expense ratio. It also suggests considering the reputation of the ETF issuer, the security of the asset custodian, and the fund's liquidity. While ETFs make crypto more accessible, the article warns that SEC approval does not eliminate the inherent volatility and risks associated with digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). The theory, published in the journal Antiquity, is based on stylistic similarities to mythical Chinese beasts and lead isotope testing that traces the copper to ore sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers suggest the massive statue could have been transported to Venice by the family of explorer Marco Polo before being altered into its current form. However, this claim is being disputed by some scholars in China, sparking a debate about the true origins of the famous symbol.</p>

          <p>The new film 'The Smashing Machine' chronicles the tumultuous life of Mark Kerr, once the world's top MMA heavyweight, who battled a severe addiction to opioids during his fighting career. The movie, starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, is based on a 2002 documentary of the same name that unflinchingly captured Kerr's struggles. Johnson, who had a chance encounter with Kerr in 1997, remained fascinated by his story and is now bringing it to a wider audience with Benny Safdie directing and Emily Blunt co-starring. For Kerr, now 56 and sober, the film represents a second chance at recognition and a reflection on a life of extreme highs and lows.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The aviation industry is banking on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to achieve its goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, but faces significant hurdles related to supply and cost. New mandates in the UK and EU require a growing percentage of jet fuel to be sustainable, yet production is lagging, and some airline executives like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary are deeply skeptical about meeting these targets. While some major airlines are investing in SAF, the high cost and limited availability of feedstocks, especially for next-generation fuels made from waste, pose major challenges. Despite the bumpy transition, government incentives and investor interest suggest a slow but ongoing shift toward greener aviation.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed his "States of Elevation" project, summiting the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States in just 31 days. The endeavor involved cycling over 3,000 miles between six states and running up each peak, a daily feat comparable to running a marathon and riding a Tour de France stage. Jornet, often regarded as the greatest mountain athlete of all time, undertook the challenge not for records but to explore new landscapes and push the limits of human endurance. His journey emphasized an "aesthetic line," choosing more challenging and beautiful routes to connect the peaks, reflecting his artistic and minimalist approach to the mountains.</p>

          <p>Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected staunch conservative Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, setting her up to become the nation's first female prime minister. A protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish security stance, her goal to revise Japan's pacifist constitution, and her opposition to progressive social policies like same-sex marriage. She faces the immediate challenges of a sluggish economy, uniting a fractured party after recent election losses, and navigating a difficult relationship with the U.S. Her confirmation by parliament is likely, though the LDP's weakened position means it is not automatic.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, will be visible in the UK on the night of October 7th. This event will be the largest and brightest full moon of the year so far and will kick off a series of three consecutive supermoons. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This year's Harvest Moon is notable for its late appearance in October, as it is defined as the full moon closest to the autumn equinox.</p>
