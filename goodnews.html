          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase, dubbed "PARC"—that he believes are poised for continued growth driven by strong retail investor enthusiasm. He notes that while these trendy names are not bound by traditional metrics, they possess solid earnings and analyst attention, distinguishing them from more speculative plays. Cramer suggests that investors can profit from these stocks but advises exercising discipline by securing gains when they occur, as he anticipates their rally will persist absent a significant market shift.

          <p>Southwest Airlines has announced it will end its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seats becoming available for flights beginning on January 27, 2026. This major shift, part of a broader strategy to boost revenue, will allow customers to choose from different fare bundles, including seats with extra legroom. The airline is also overhauling its boarding process to group passengers by seat location, marking a significant departure from the unique operational model that has defined the carrier for decades.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. marines who were deployed to Los Angeles over a month ago amid protests against federal immigration sweeps. The deployment, which was ordered by the Trump administration, had been strongly opposed by state and city officials who called it unnecessary and provocative. A Pentagon spokesperson stated that the marines' presence had sent a clear message that lawlessness would not be tolerated and that their redeployment was ordered as stability has returned to the city.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it is easing visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a move seen as a significant diplomatic overture to Beijing. Under the new policy, Chinese citizens holding valid visas for the United States or the European Union will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business. This policy change comes as President Javier Milei seeks to recalibrate his foreign policy, particularly as trade negotiations with the U.S. have faced delays, highlighting the delicate balance Argentina is striking between the two global superpowers.</p>

          <p>Players in the WNBA All-Star Game wore warm-up shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us" to publicly pressure the league for a new collective bargaining agreement. The demonstration follows stalled negotiations where players are seeking a more equitable revenue-sharing model, higher salaries, and better benefits, reflecting the league's rapid growth in viewership and value. Players argue that their compensation, which is currently less than 10% of league revenue, should grow in proportion to the business they have helped build, a stark contrast to the roughly 50-50 split in the NBA.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners seeking $20,000 in financing, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 2025, the average rates for both products are nearly identical, making their monthly payments virtually the same. However, the article advises caution with HELOCs, as their variable rates are subject to change with market conditions, which can alter future payment amounts. In contrast, home equity loans offer a fixed rate, providing more certainty for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>
