          <p>Elon Musk's artificial intelligence company, xAI, has successfully raised $10 billion through a combination of debt and equity financing, as announced by Morgan Stanley. The new capital is intended to fuel the development of its AI models, including the Grok chatbot, and expand its infrastructure with the construction of massive data centers. This funding intensifies the competitive landscape in the AI sector, positioning xAI to better challenge rivals like OpenAI and Anthropic in the race for AI supremacy. The article notes this move comes amid growing competition and significant investments across the American AI industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a marathon "vote-a-rama" session, the Senate voted on numerous amendments to President Trump's major spending bill, with several key proposals failing to pass. Unsuccessful amendments included efforts to increase funding for rural hospitals and another to implement deeper cuts to Medicaid, highlighting divisions within the Republican party. However, one amendment did pass with overwhelming bipartisan support, which removed a controversial provision from the bill that would have placed a moratorium on state-level AI regulations. The outcome of these votes shapes the final version of the legislation as it moves closer to a full Senate vote. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock surged to an all-time high after the company announced it would offer tokenized shares of private companies OpenAI and SpaceX to its users in the European Union. This move, part of a broader global crypto expansion, makes equity in these unlisted tech giants accessible to retail investors on the blockchain for the first time through the platform. The tokenized assets will be available 24/5 on Robinhood's EU crypto app, a market with more flexible regulations than the U.S. The company is also launching crypto staking for U.S. users, signaling a renewed push into digital asset services.

          <p>The U.S. Senate voted 99-1 to remove a controversial provision from a major Republican bill that would have deterred states from regulating artificial intelligence for a decade. The measure faced strong bipartisan opposition from state officials, including a majority of GOP governors, who argued it was a gift to the tech industry that would prevent them from protecting citizens. The proposal initially sought a ban on state AI laws but was later modified to tie compliance to federal broadband funding. The successful amendment to strike the provision was co-sponsored by Republican Marsha Blackburn and Democrat Maria Cantwell.</p>

          <p>While U.S. consumer spending on most luxury goods has fallen in early 2025, the jewelry category has proven to be a resilient bright spot, according to a Citigroup report. Data shows that spending on luxury jewelry surged over 10% in May compared to the previous year, consistently outperforming categories like handbags and apparel. Analysts suggest this trend is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment, especially with rising gold prices, and its sentimental value as a gift. In contrast, other luxury sectors have struggled, with price hikes on items like handbags not being matched by product innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

This sentiment echoes across the tech industry, with other leaders claiming AI is already handling a significant percentage of work.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice announced it has dismantled a series of healthcare fraud schemes that attempted to steal $14.6 billion from federal programs like Medicare and Medicaid. The operation, described as the largest in the department's history, resulted in criminal charges against 324 defendants, including 93 medical professionals. Officials said some complex schemes were run by transnational criminal organizations that used stolen American identities to submit fraudulent claims for medical supplies. The enforcement action led to the seizure of over $245 million in cash and assets, with actual government losses estimated at $2.9 billion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As heatwaves become more common, it is crucial to understand the difference between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke. Heat exhaustion occurs when the body overheats, causing symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and should be treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. If left untreated, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation system fails, sweat production stops, and body temperature can rise rapidly. Recognizing the signs and taking immediate action, including seeking emergency medical help for heat stroke, can be life-saving.</p>

          <p>A long-lost novel written in 1932 by Sebastian Haffner, a German journalist and author known for his anti-Nazi writings, has become a bestseller in Germany nearly a century later. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was discovered by the author's son after his death but was only recently published. Written just before the Nazis rose to power, the book captures a final moment of hope and freedom in the Weimar Republic, contrasting with the grim historical analysis of his later, more famous works. The novel's success reveals a previously unknown fictional talent and offers a lighter, more personal glimpse into a dark period of history.</p>

The image actually depicts an Iranian missile base in Tabriz that was damaged by an Israeli strike, not the other way around. By using reverse image search and cross-referencing with satellite data from Maxar Technologies and Google Maps, the report confirms the true location and context of the photograph.
