          <p>Angel investor Carles Reina recounts his decision to invest in the AI voice startup ElevenLabs in 2022 after just a 30-minute meeting with co-founder Mati Staniszewski. At the time, voice AI was an overlooked market, but Reina was convinced by Staniszewski's technical expertise and deep understanding of the industry's core problems, such as the need for non-robotic-sounding voices. Founded in 2022, ElevenLabs specializes in advanced text-to-speech and voice cloning technology and has since achieved a valuation of over $3 billion. Reina's investment strategy focuses on identifying technically proficient founders in industries not yet considered popular or "sexy" by other venture capitalists.</p>

          <p>As he embarks on a five-day diplomatic tour of Asia, former President Donald Trump has indicated he is open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The trip includes stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where he is scheduled to hold high-stakes trade negotiations with Chinese President Xi Jinping to de-escalate their ongoing trade war. While U.S. officials have downplayed the possibility of a meeting with Kim, Trump's comments have fueled speculation. The tour's agenda also includes signing a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia and meeting with Japan's new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, highlighting a period of intense diplomatic activity.</p>

Tarling secured the nation's first gold of the event in the men's points race, strategically gaining a lap on his competitors to finish with 750 points. Shortly after, 22-year-old Charlton dominated the individual pursuit, becoming the first British man to win the world title in that event since Bradley Wiggins in 2008. The wins, along with a bronze medal for Joe Truman in the 1km time trial, brought Great Britain's total medal count to seven after three days of competition.</p>

          <p>Herbie Farnworth, who plays for the Dolphins in Australia's NRL, is being highlighted as a crucial player for England in the upcoming Ashes series against Australia. Regarded as one of the world's best centres, Farnworth's skill and power are expected to provide England with a significant advantage as they seek their first series victory since 1970. His teammates and captain describe him as a "cheat code" capable of creating opportunities from nothing, a reputation he earned with standout performances for both his club and the national team. Having grown up in Lancashire before moving to Australia to pursue his career, Farnworth is now a central figure for England's hopes.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays secured a commanding 11-4 victory over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first game of the World Series. The game's turning point was a massive nine-run rally in the sixth inning, highlighted by a historic pinch-hit grand slam from Addison Barger, the first in World Series history. Despite an early 2-0 lead for the Dodgers and a two-run homer from superstar Shohei Ohtani in the seventh inning, Toronto's offensive explosion proved insurmountable. The Blue Jays' dominant performance at home gives them an early advantage in the best-of-seven championship series, which continues with Game 2 in Toronto.</p>

          <p>The upcoming ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is set to tackle major regional security issues, including the Thailand-Cambodia border dispute and the ongoing civil war in Myanmar. U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend and oversee the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, a deal brokered with significant Malaysian and U.S. diplomatic involvement. However, resolving the crisis in Myanmar remains a challenge, as ASEAN's diplomatic efforts have been largely ineffective and the bloc is divided on how to engage with the military junta. On a more positive note, the summit will formally welcome Timor-Leste as the organization's 11th member state.</p>

          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has officially endorsed Democratic assemblyman Zohran Mamdani in the New York City mayoral race, providing a significant boost to the frontrunner's campaign just before early voting begins. Jeffries cited Mamdani's focus on the city's affordability crisis and his commitment to being a mayor for all New Yorkers as reasons for his support. The endorsement consolidates Democratic establishment backing for Mamdani, who is running against former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cuomo recently secured the endorsement of outgoing Mayor Eric Adams, setting the stage for a competitive general election.</p>

          <p>President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to South Korea for the APEC summit is being interpreted by experts as a symbolic and carefully planned step toward repairing strained bilateral relations. While immediate major breakthroughs are not anticipated, the visit marks a crucial opportunity for dialogue and resetting ties, which have been tense. This will be Xi's first visit since 2014, a time considered a high point in Beijing-Seoul relations that led to a free-trade agreement. The discussions are expected to be a key indicator of the future direction of diplomatic and economic cooperation between the two neighboring countries.</p>

          <p>A new report from the Pew Research Center highlights the dramatic growth of the Latino population in the United States, which has nearly doubled from 35.3 million in 2000 to 68 million today. Latinos now constitute one in five Americans and accounted for over half of the nation's total population growth in that period. The report also notes key demographic shifts: the population is young, with a median age of 31, and a large majority (79%) are U.S. citizens. People of Mexican origin remain the largest subgroup, while California and Texas are home to the largest Latino populations, where they are the largest ethnic group in each state.</p>
