          <h2>Trump Considers Tax Hike on Wealthy Americans to Protect Medicaid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 20:15:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has reportedly asked House Speaker Mike Johnson to include a tax increase on wealthy Americans in the upcoming fiscal package, proposing a new top income bracket for those making over $2.5 million per year with a 39.6% tax rate. This move would partially reverse the tax cuts enacted in 2017, which reduced the top rate to 37%. The proposed tax hike aims to offset the costs of continuing the 2017 tax cuts and to protect Medicaid spending, addressing concerns about the optics of cutting benefits for the poor while providing tax benefits to the rich. Republicans are also considering other tax hikes with a populist appeal, such as raising taxes on stock buybacks.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect a mixed reception to the U.S.-UK trade deal, with some highlighting its role in saving the British car industry and others noting the limited concessions achieved. The Financial Times reports the UK secured concessions on car and steel exports but failed to reverse a flat levy on most goods, while the Daily Telegraph claims the US can object to Chinese firms investing in the UK. Meanwhile, coverage of Cardinal Prevost's election as the first American Pope focuses on his message of building bridges and his previous criticism of the Trump administration's refugee policies.</p>

          <p>India is reportedly considering eliminating tariffs on imports of steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals from the U.S. on a reciprocal basis to boost economic growth and attract foreign investment. This potential shift signals a departure from India's protectionist policies, which have historically relied on high import duties. Experts suggest that while this move could benefit logistics companies and certain sectors, India will likely ensure that any deal does not harm domestic businesses. The U.S. remains India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Police Department arrested 44-year-old Samuel Patrick Groft, suspected of cutting down 13 trees in downtown Los Angeles over a week. The crime spree gained public attention after several trees were found felled on South Grand Avenue, leading to a surge of tips and surveillance footage. Groft, found in possession of an electric chainsaw, has pleaded not guilty to felony vandalism charges. The investigation involved multiple LAPD divisions and community assistance, with detectives linking Groft to the cuttings through surveillance footage and a hardware store receipt.</p>

          <p>Director Alex Ross Perry explores the story of the indie-rock band Pavement through an experimental documentary that combines tour footage, a staged musical, an art gallery, and a faux-Hollywood biopic. The film seeks to capture the band's essence by imagining them as a platinum-selling cultural force, despite their unconventional rise to fame. Perry uses a variety of techniques to layer the band's history and legacy, including behind-the-scenes clips of the musical and a parody of Method acting for the biopic. The film's unique approach aims to preserve the band's enigmatic allure through irony and misdirection.</p>

          <p>Texas Roadhouse reported a disappointing first quarter due to inclement weather affecting comparable store sales, but positive trends in April and May are giving investors hope. The company's revenue exceeded expectations, but earnings per share fell short of estimates. Despite the earnings miss, the company's average weekly sales in March hit all-time highs, and comparable sales increased by 5% year-over-year in the first five weeks of the second quarter. However, an increased outlook for commodity cost inflation is expected to squeeze margins for the rest of the year.</p>

          <p>The enforced skort rule in camogie, a Gaelic sport, has ignited a debate over sexism, with former player Jane Adams calling for the Camogie Association to allow players the choice between skorts and shorts. This comes after teams were forced to change into skorts before a championship game. A Gaelic Players Association survey revealed that 70% of players experienced discomfort while wearing skorts, and 83% desired the option to wear shorts. The Camogie Association has scheduled a Special Congress to vote on the issue.</p>
