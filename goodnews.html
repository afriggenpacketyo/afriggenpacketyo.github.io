          <h2>Gut Microbes May Help Remove 'Forever Chemicals' from the Body, Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 08:08:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the University of Cambridge indicates that certain species of human gut bacteria can absorb and store toxic PFAS, commonly known as "forever chemicals." In a study on mice, scientists found these microbes could effectively remove the harmful substances, potentially protecting the body from their long-term toxic effects. Researchers are now exploring the development of probiotic supplements to enhance this natural defense mechanism. The findings offer a potential new avenue for mitigating the health risks associated with widespread PFAS exposure from food and water.</p>

          <p>Robinhood has expanded its cryptocurrency offerings in the European Union, introducing tokenized shares of private companies, including OpenAI and SpaceX. This move, which caused Robinhood's stock to hit an all-time high, allows European users to trade these assets 24/5 with no commission. The initiative makes equity in these high-profile, unlisted companies accessible to a broader audience for the first time, leveraging the EU's more flexible regulatory environment. However, similar access for U.S. users is not expected soon due to regulatory hurdles like accredited investor rules. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a major economic meeting, Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the importance of creating a "unified national market" to bolster the country's economy. The policy aims to prioritize domestic demand and consumption amid growing uncertainty in the global landscape. The commission also called for better integration of domestic and foreign trade, making it easier for export-oriented goods to be sold within China. This focus signals a strategic shift towards strengthening internal economic circulation as a buffer against external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 08:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While U.S. consumer spending on most luxury goods fell in the first five months of the year, the jewelry category has proven to be a resilient bright spot. According to a Citigroup report, spending on luxury jewelry surged over 10% in May compared to the previous year, and it was the only category to see an increase in the number of individual customers. Analysts suggest this outperformance is driven by the perception of jewelry as a tangible investment and its sentimental value. In contrast, categories like handbags have seen significant price hikes without a corresponding increase in value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged 324 individuals in what it calls its largest-ever healthcare fraud enforcement action, targeting schemes that attempted to defraud federal programs of $14.6 billion. The operation involved 93 doctors and other medical professionals accused of submitting false claims to programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Officials noted the increasing complexity of these operations, with some run by transnational criminal organizations that used stolen American identities to bill for unnecessary medical supplies.

Headley, who was 34 at the time of the crime, was told by the judge he would die in prison.

        </div>

          <p>As temperatures rise, it is crucial to distinguish between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke. Heat exhaustion involves symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and dizziness, and is treated by moving to a cool place and rehydrating. However, if not managed, it can progress to heat stroke, a life-threatening emergency where the body's temperature regulation system fails and core temperature can rise rapidly. Signs of heat stroke include confusion, seizures, and loss of consciousness, requiring immediate emergency medical attention and rapid cooling efforts.</p>

          <p>A forgotten novel written in 1932 by a young Sebastian Haffner, who would later become a renowned historian of the Nazi era, has posthumously topped Germany's bestseller list. Titled "Parting," the autobiographical love story was discovered by the author's son after his death in 1999 but was only published this year. Written as the Weimar Republic was collapsing, the book captures a final moment of hope and youthful freedom against the backdrop of rising fascism. The manuscript was found alongside Haffner's famous memoir, "Defying Hitler," offering a lighter glimpse into his early life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis explains that a key, often overlooked, function of political protest is to combat the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where people mistakenly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Research shows that people often inaccurately estimate public opinion on major issues like climate change and abortion rights. Public demonstrations, like those following the Dobbs Supreme Court decision, serve as a powerful signal that can correct these misperceptions and build "common knowledge" about what a society truly believes. This function makes protest a crucial tool for social change.</p>

          <p>Denmark has officially changed its laws to include women in its military conscription system, requiring them to register for service upon turning 18. Women will now be part of the same lottery system as men that could call them up for an extended 11-month period of service. The move, which follows the lead of neighbors Norway and Sweden, is part of a broader effort to bolster Denmark's defense capabilities. The policy change comes in response to heightened security concerns in Europe and aims to increase military personnel.</p>
