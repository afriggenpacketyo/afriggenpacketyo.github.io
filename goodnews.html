          <p>A U.S. District Judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze nearly $2 billion in federal grants to Harvard University was a violation of the school's First Amendment rights and federal law. The judge found that the administration used allegations of antisemitism as a pretext for an ideologically motivated action against the university, jeopardizing significant research. The ruling blocks officials from enforcing the funding freeze, though the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, criticizing the judge's verdict as biased. Harvard's president praised the ruling as a defense of academic freedom.</p>

          <p>China is advancing in the field of artificial intelligence with the development of "agentic frameworks," which are platforms for building autonomous AI agents capable of performing complex tasks. Tech giant Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, following similar moves by ByteDance and Alibaba earlier in the year. This progress positions Chinese companies to compete with U.S. counterparts like OpenAI in the race to create sophisticated AI agents that can plan and execute a series of subtasks for users. The development is a key part of the ongoing technological competition between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II and had been missing for 80 years. The artwork was discovered after it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of a fugitive Nazi officer who had stolen it. The recovery followed an investigation prompted by Dutch journalists, thrilling the heirs of the original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker. The officer's daughter and her husband have been placed under house arrest pending a hearing on charges of concealment and obstruction of justice.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, tracking a rally in technology stocks on Wall Street that lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all saw gains in early trading. The positive momentum came after a U.S. federal court decision in an Alphabet antitrust case fueled investor optimism about the resilience of major tech companies against regulatory threats. Meanwhile, global bond markets remain a key focus for investors, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield briefly rising above 5% amid questions over future tariff revenues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle Outfitters soared by 25% after the company announced that successful marketing collaborations with actress Sydney Sweeney and athlete Travis Kelce are driving strong sales projections. The company's performance in the second quarter exceeded expectations, with executives crediting the high-profile campaigns for a notable increase in customer awareness and engagement. An advertisement for the brand's denim line featuring Sweeney generated significant public debate and media attention, which appears to have positively impacted the company's market performance. The fall season has reportedly started on a positive note for the fashion retailer. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Appeals Court Blocks Trump Administration from Using 18th Century Law to Deport Venezuelan Migrants</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, stating that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion" as required by the law. The administration had used the obscure wartime statute to remove hundreds of individuals accused of being gang members. The court's decision marks a significant legal setback for the strategy, granting a preliminary injunction for the migrants who sued. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling for reining in the administration's expansive claims of executive power in immigration matters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, a city in China, has introduced a new stimulus measure offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan to individuals who host banquets of five or more tables. This policy is part of a broader effort to invigorate local consumption and support economic growth, with catering being a key focus alongside sectors like housing and retail. The initiative reflects the challenge local officials face in balancing the national priority of boosting spending with Beijing's ongoing anti-corruption campaign, which discourages extravagance. Shaoxing officials expect the new measures to generate significant additional consumer spending this year.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, ranchers are challenging the conventional food system by embracing regenerative agriculture and selling their products directly to consumers. The Mannix family, who has worked their land for over 140 years, co-founded the Old Salt Co-op with other local ranches to counter the thin margins and existential threats posed by industrial agriculture and climate change. By processing a portion of their livestock locally and selling through their own butcher shop and restaurants, they aim to create a more resilient and secure food model. This approach focuses on improving soil health and ecosystem vitality, which they see as essential for long-term survival.</p>

          <p>The Democratic National Committee and voting rights groups successfully negotiated an agreement to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being removed from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had demanded the state deny ballots to voters who registered without providing a driver's license or partial Social Security number. Under the new agreement, these voters will be allowed to provide the necessary information while casting a provisional ballot, curing the issue at the polling place. The outcome is seen as a victory for voting rights advocates against the DOJ's recent focus on voter fraud.</p>

          <p>C-SPAN, the nonprofit public affairs network, has reached agreements to be carried by major streaming services YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, significantly expanding its audience. The move comes after the organization faced financial deficits due to the shrinking number of traditional pay-TV households, which prompted a U.S. Senate resolution urging streaming providers to carry the network. These new deals will provide millions of subscribers with C-SPAN's unfiltered, gavel-to-gavel coverage of Congress and other government proceedings. The expansion is seen as crucial for the network's mission to provide civic programming in the modern media landscape.</p>
