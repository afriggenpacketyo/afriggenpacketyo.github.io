          <p>In a Carabao Cup match against Huddersfield, Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola brought on brothers Reigan and Jaden Heskey, sons of former England striker Emile Heskey. The 17-year-old winger Reigan and 19-year-old midfielder Jaden both made their senior team debuts after progressing through City's youth academy since the age of eight. Guardiola expressed pride in the academy's contribution, noting that six academy players started the match. The event highlights a legacy of footballing families in the Premier League.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests AI Has Changed How Students Cheat, But Not Necessarily the Overall Rate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 06:05:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An education researcher analyzing student survey data argues that while generative AI has introduced new methods for academic dishonesty, it may not have significantly increased the overall prevalence of cheating. Historical data shows high rates of cheating long before AI tools like ChatGPT became available, driven by factors like anxiety and academic pressure. Recent studies indicate that while a percentage of students now use AI to complete entire assignments, this may simply be a shift from previous methods like copying from online sources. The article suggests the focus should be on understanding why students cheat and adapting educational practices for an AI-integrated world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has secured a commitment from Ticketmaster to provide clearer information about ticket prices. The investigation was prompted by fan complaints over the pricing for Oasis's reunion tour, where some tickets were sold at significantly higher prices without clear explanation. Ticketmaster will now have to disclose 24 hours in advance if a tiered pricing system is used and provide more price details during online queues. The CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing" but noted the need for more accurate labeling to avoid misleading consumers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is strategically using soccer to connect with voters and highlight his progressive agenda. He recently launched a petition against FIFA's dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, advocating for affordable tickets for local residents, which aligns with his broader campaign theme of affordability. This move is seen as a shrewd way for the left to re-engage with sports, a domain often leveraged by conservative politicians. The article suggests that soccer, with its global appeal and issues of corporate greed, provides an ideal platform for Mamdani's populist messaging.</p>

          <p>Millions of Californians will see a credit on their October electricity bills as part of the state's California Climate Credit program. The refund, which varies by utility provider but can be over $50 for many customers, is funded by the state's cap-and-invest program that requires large polluters to buy allowances for their greenhouse gas emissions. These credits are distributed to residential and small-business customers twice a year, in April and October. Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed legislation extending the program through 2045, which is expected to increase the size of future refunds for ratepayers.</p>

          <p>England's Premiership Rugby is in discussions to stage a regular season league match at the iconic Wrigley Field in Chicago, home of the Chicago Cubs baseball team. The potential move, targeted for the 2026-27 season, would be a significant effort to boost the sport's profile in the United States ahead of the country hosting the 2031 Rugby World Cup. The plan is supported by the league's title sponsor, Gallagher, a Chicago-based company that also has a commercial partnership with the Cubs. This initiative is part of a broader strategy by Premiership Rugby to attract American investment and expand its international audience.</p>

          <p>Residents in southern China are cleaning up after Super Typhoon Ragasa, which was the world's strongest typhoon of the year, made landfall with sustained winds up to 265km/h (165mph). Despite the storm's record intensity, provincial officials in Guangdong reported no typhoon-related casualties as of Thursday afternoon. The immediate priority is restoring essential services and infrastructure, as some areas in the city of Yangjiang experienced power and water outages. The storm also caused significant flooding and brought down over 50,000 trees, with damage assessments currently underway.</p>

          <h2>The 'Lavender Marriage': From a Historical LGBTQ+ Survival Tactic to a Modern TikTok Trend</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The term "lavender marriage," historically used to describe a marriage of convenience between a man and a woman to conceal the homosexuality of one or both partners, is being repurposed by Gen Z on platforms like TikTok. Originally a survival tactic in eras when being openly queer was dangerous, such as in early Hollywood, the concept is now trending among young people seeking platonic partnerships for financial stability and companionship, separate from romance or sex. While the modern trend reflects shifting views on relationships, some critics argue it overlooks the oppressive history that made such arrangements necessary for LGBTQ+ individuals.</p>

          <p>Utah is undergoing a rare mid-decade redrawing of its congressional districts after a judge ruled that the map used in 2022 was an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander. The state's Republican supermajority is complying with the court order "under protest," considering various new maps that could potentially give Democrats a better chance of winning one of the state's four U.S. House seats. The process was initiated by a local lawsuit that successfully challenged the legislature's repeal of a voter-approved initiative that had created an independent redistricting commission. The new map must be approved by both lawmakers and the court by November 10.</p>

          <p>To improve safety, transportation experts recommend that pedestrians and cyclists practice "defensive walking and cycling," which involves maintaining constant awareness of one's surroundings to anticipate hazards. Key tips include looking in all directions before crossing a street, as turning cars can be a major threat, and ensuring you are visible and predictable to drivers, especially at night. The article advises against distractions like headphones and phones, and stresses the importance of using designated sidewalks, bike paths, and crosswalks whenever possible. Ultimately, while drivers have a responsibility to be safe, individuals can significantly reduce their risk by taking ownership of their own safety.</p>
