          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at San Diego beaches following a federal appeals court ruling that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional. The court found that teaching yoga is "protected speech," overruling a previous decision. The city argued the rule targeted commercial activity, as instructors received donations for the classes, but the court sided with the instructors, stating the ordinance violated their First Amendment rights. Supporters of the classes see this as a victory for the community, allowing accessible yoga to those who cannot afford it elsewhere.</p>

This decision follows criticism of the initial selection of Hagerty over AECOM, with the latter expected to expedite the process of getting families back into their homes.</p>

          <p>Analysts are questioning Apple's AI strategy as the company's response to generative AI, Apple Intelligence, has been underwhelming. Despite advantages like a large installed base and custom chips, Apple has struggled to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Investors are urging Apple to make major advancements in AI, especially as some executives suggest AI could replace the iPhone. The initial rollout of Apple Intelligence features was rocky, and a key improvement to Siri has been delayed, leading to class-action suits. The company is facing renewed competition from OpenAI and Meta in the AI space.</p>
