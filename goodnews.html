          <p>OpenAI has officially announced a new artificial intelligence-powered web browser named ChatGPT Atlas, which led to a drop in the stock value of Google's parent company, Alphabet. The browser is designed to integrate the company's popular ChatGPT chatbot directly into the web navigation experience. This allows users to generate summaries, ask questions, and perform tasks on any webpage. CEO Sam Altman stated that AI presents a rare opportunity to fundamentally rethink the functionality and purpose of a web browser.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has ruled that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg must take the witness stand in an upcoming trial concerning the alleged harmful effects of social media on young users. The judge also ordered Snap CEO Evan Spiegel and Instagram head Adam Mosseri to testify, stating their testimony is "uniquely relevant" to the case. The lawsuit alleges that social media companies knowingly designed addictive features that drive compulsive behavior in minors without adequate warnings. This trial is one of several legal challenges social media firms are facing over their platforms' impact on youth mental health.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat surged over 90% on Tuesday, continuing a massive rally that began after it was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF. The addition appears to have triggered a significant short squeeze, forcing investors who had bet against the struggling company to buy shares to cover their positions. The company also announced an expanded distribution deal with Walmart, further fueling the rally. This marks a dramatic reversal for the former penny stock, which had seen its value decline for five consecutive years since its 2019 IPO. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock price soar by over 15% after the automaker reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and raised its financial forecast for 2025. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on revenue of $48.59 billion, beating analyst estimates. GM also increased its full-year guidance for adjusted earnings and free cash flow, signaling confidence in its performance for the remainder of the year. The positive results came despite a $1.6 billion charge related to its pullback from certain all-electric vehicle plans, which significantly reduced its net income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An American Airlines flight headed to Los Angeles was diverted back to Omaha shortly after takeoff due to a misunderstanding caused by a faulty internal communication system. The pilots, unable to reach the cabin crew via the plane's phone and hearing knocking, believed someone was attempting to breach the cockpit door and declared an emergency. It was later determined that the knocking was from the cabin crew who were trying to communicate with the pilots. Airport officials confirmed that the incident was not security-related and was solely the result of the technical communication issue.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors are offering guidance on how investors can adjust their portfolios. In the current economic environment, some experts suggest locking in yields on intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds with maturities of three to seven years. Others recommend a defensive approach with bond ladders while maintaining a well-diversified stock portfolio across various asset classes. The consensus is that while rate cuts can create opportunities, investors should balance optimism with caution due to underlying economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>
