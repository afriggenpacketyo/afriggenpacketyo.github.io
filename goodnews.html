          <h2>Hong Kong's Future Beyond 2047: An Examination of Legal Systems</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-18 04:30:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system post-2047, following discussions initiated by activist investor David Webb. Webb questioned whether Hong Kong law students should continue studying the current system or transition to mainland law, particularly regarding contract law and land leases. The article urges calm, drawing parallels with anxieties before 1997, and suggests focusing on maintaining the existing system rather than prematurely shifting to mainland law. It highlights the importance of addressing these concerns to ensure stability and confidence in Hong Kong's future legal framework.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a high-stakes presidential election between pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski and nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski supports abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki champions conservative values and national sovereignty. The election occurs amid political gridlock between the Polish prime minister and the outgoing conservative president, Andrzej Duda. The outcome will significantly shape Poland's political direction and its relationship with the European Union, with potential implications for policy reforms and the balance of power within the country.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent internal survey by the Bundeswehr Center of Military History and Social Sciences indicates that "systemic" extremism is not prevalent within the German military. The study found that less than 1% of soldiers harbor right-wing extremist attitudes, though problematic chauvinist and xenophobic views were observed among a small percentage. Despite these findings, some researchers remain skeptical, citing past incidents of far-right networks and potential influence from the timing of the surveys. The ongoing debate underscores the challenges of monitoring and addressing extremism within the armed forces.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dan Richards compares the contrasting futures of night trains in Europe and the United States. Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns. In contrast, the U.S. continues to prioritize cars and air travel, neglecting public infrastructure and rail systems. Richards argues that America's car dependence negatively impacts happiness and mental health. He advocates for investment in rail networks to offer a sustainable and community-oriented alternative to car-centric transportation.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to finance infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans.

The company reported strong fiscal fourth-quarter sales, driven by 11% growth in its Jewellery Maisons division.
