          <h2>Psychiatrist Argues Imperfection is Key to Good Mothering</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 01:00:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a guest essay, Dr. Mathilde Ross, a psychiatrist at Boston University Health Services, argues that the pursuit of perfect mothering is harmful, as children need to learn that flaws are acceptable. She notes that mothers are often blamed for their children's problems, a holdover from a time when the field of psychiatry was dominated by men. Dr. Ross encourages mothers to cut themselves some slack and recognize that their imperfections are part of raising well-adjusted children. She also includes a humorous quiz to help mothers acknowledge their imperfections and embrace their good-enough status.</p>

          <p>South Korea's ruling People Power Party (PPP) has reinstated Kim Moon-soo as its presidential candidate after an attempt to replace him with former Prime Minister Han Duck-soo failed. The party leadership had sought to replace Kim, believing Han had a better chance of winning the upcoming elections. Kim denounced the attempt as a political coup, and PPP members voted against the motion, reinstating him as the candidate. The PPP has been in turmoil since the impeachment of former President Yoon Suk Yeol, with the opposition Democratic Party's candidate currently leading in the polls.</p>

          <p>President Trump's suggestion to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf has drawn condemnation from Iranians across the political spectrum, who view the name as a core part of their national identity. The proposal has seemingly united Iranians of all political, ideological, and religious factions, sparking outrage on social media and in official statements. While Trump has the power to order changes to geographical names within the United States, other countries are not obligated to honor those changes, and the move could negatively impact ongoing Iran-U.S. nuclear talks.</p>

          <p>European officials are standing firm on their food safety standards, creating a potential sticking point in trade negotiations with the Trump administration, which wants Europe to import more American farm products. The EU's strict regulations, including a ban on hormones in beef, are deemed non-negotiable, with officials emphasizing that food, health, and safety standards are a red line. While the US already exports hormone-free beef to the EU without tariffs, further concessions on food standards are unlikely due to European concerns about food culture, smaller family farms, and consumer preferences.</p>
