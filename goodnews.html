        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is gradually introducing its new digital border system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), which will affect non-EU travelers, including those from the UK. The system requires passengers to register biometric data, such as fingerprints and a facial image, upon their first entry into the 29-country Schengen Area. This registration, valid for three years, will eventually replace manual passport stamping, aiming to enhance security and streamline travel. While the rollout is phased, with full implementation expected by 2026, there are concerns about potential delays as travelers adapt to the new procedures at ports, airports, and train terminals.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the upcoming World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the team's failure to reach the 2022 tournament. Clarke, who has successfully led Scotland to two consecutive European Championships, still feels the sting of the 3-1 playoff defeat to Ukraine that ended their hopes for a place in Qatar. He acknowledges that the buildup to that match was unusual due to its postponement and key player injuries. A victory in their upcoming game against Belarus would significantly boost their chances for qualification and secure a play-off spot.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein allowing Muslim employees and students to request unpaid leave for two major Islamic holidays has sparked a public debate fueled by misleading media headlines. Contrary to claims of "extra holidays," officials clarified that the regulation merely formalizes an existing practice rooted in Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom. This policy is consistent with allowances made for other religious groups, such as Catholics in Protestant-majority states, who can also request unpaid leave for their significant holidays. The controversy highlights broader national conversations in Germany about integration, equality, and cultural identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the mechanism that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into a complete new plant. Their research, published in the journal *Cell*, identifies two specific genetic switches that can reprogram a differentiated somatic cell—any cell other than a sperm or egg—to behave like a fertilized egg. This process, known as somatic embryogenesis, was previously a biological mystery. The breakthrough provides fundamental insights into one of the most profound processes in biology and could have significant implications for agriculture and plant biotechnology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An evaluation of nine major striker signings from the summer transfer window shows a range of outcomes for Premier League clubs that invested heavily in their attacking lineups. While some players, like Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres and Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike, have made an immediate positive impact by scoring crucial goals, others have struggled to find their form. For instance, Everton's Thierno Barry is yet to score, and Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak has had a slow start after a protracted transfer saga. The article reviews the early-season statistics for each player, highlighting the pressures faced by these high-cost forwards.</p>

          <p>Despite being the all-time leading goalscorer for both England's national team and Tottenham Hotspur, and continuing his prolific form at Bayern Munich, questions persist about whether striker Harry Kane is fully appreciated. The article explores the perception of Kane, noting that while his statistics are historic, criticism sometimes arises from England's lack of major tournament victories. Pundits argue that his all-around game, including his ability to create plays from deep positions, combined with his relentless goalscoring, places him among the world's elite. His understated personality may contribute to him being undervalued compared to other global superstars.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted its US$5 billion Chinese railway loans from U.S. dollars to Chinese yuan, a move expected to save the country approximately US$215 million in annual debt-servicing costs. The original loans were taken from the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the Standard Gauge Railway project. This currency swap is anticipated to significantly reduce the interest rate on the remaining debt, providing financial relief to the debt-stressed African nation. Analysts suggest this decision could set a precedent for other African countries with significant Chinese debt, potentially deepening their economic ties with Beijing.</p>
