          <p>Turkey is exploring new regulations to curb significant food waste, particularly from all-you-can-eat hotel buffets and traditional large breakfasts, which currently see 8.7 million tons of food discarded annually. Advisors to President Erdogan are working on proposals, with one expert suggesting guests should customize their breakfasts rather than receiving standard large spreads. This initiative aims to address both economic problems and environmental damage caused by waste, even though private households remain the largest contributors globally. The potential changes have garnered international attention, especially from countries whose citizens frequently visit Turkey.</p>

Guo, who attributes her success to relentless work ethic and optimizing her time, believes work-life balance can be achieved by eliminating time-wasting activities like "doom scrolling." While her approach aligns with Silicon Valley's "996" work culture, some critics argue such an always-on environment can decrease talent retention.

          <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has resumed erupting, shooting lava 100 feet into the air from its summit crater, marking its 31st display of molten rock since December. This highly active volcano is contained within the summit, posing no threat to homes, and offers spectacular views for visitors at Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Scientists explain that magma is continuously supplied from the earth's interior, leading to these frequent, powerful eruptions. The current pattern, with lava fountains, is the fourth of its kind in 200 years, and while the duration is uncertain, it provides a unique opportunity to observe geological processes and cultural traditions related to the volcano goddess Pele.</p>

          <p>A U.S. District Judge in San Francisco has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from denying federal funding to Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and 30 other "sanctuary" jurisdictions. These cities and counties have policies limiting cooperation with federal immigration enforcement efforts. The judge deemed the administration's executive orders, which aimed to withhold billions of dollars, an unconstitutional "coercive threat."

          <p>Malaysia has enacted a ban on unprocessed rare earth metal exports, aiming to retain these globally prized raw materials for investment in its downstream industries. The move signals Malaysia's strategic intent to develop its own processing capacity and attract foreign investors willing to engage in local mineral processing and technology transfers. This policy comes as the US actively seeks non-Chinese sources for rare earth metals, critical for electronic hardware, amidst strained trade relations with China, the dominant supplier. Analysts suggest Malaysia's existing capabilities position it well to integrate into global supply chains, exercising its economic agency.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong has emerged as the preferred initial public offering (IPO) venue for mainland Chinese companies, surpassing the US in the first eight months of 2025, marking a significant shift in global capital markets. Chinese firms raised $16.5 billion in Hong Kong compared to $740.9 million in the US, driven by Hong Kong's more active market and higher average debut share jumps. This trend is largely attributed to growing US-China rivalry and lingering delisting risks for Chinese stocks in the US, prompting mainland companies to favor the more stable regulatory prospects of the Hong Kong market. The article highlights a strategic pivot for Chinese start-ups.</p>
