          <p>Chinese customs authorities have been intercepting smugglers of Pop Mart toys, including the Labubu and Molly series, as prices for these dolls have soared. Customs agents have confiscated undeclared toys from passengers allegedly seeking to profit from resales. Travelers are reportedly buying the toys overseas and bringing them back into China, where they can be sold at higher prices due to currency fluctuations and local discounts. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, is rapidly expanding internationally, with over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of energy customers are set to receive payouts of up to ¬£1,000 each, with potential debt write-offs, due to the scandal over forced prepayment meter installations. Energy companies are allocating over ¬£70m in compensation and financial support to affected customers. The move follows a review by Ofgem, the energy regulator, into suppliers switching vulnerable customers to prepayment methods without their consent. Eligible customers will receive payments based on how they were treated by their energy supplier, and some may have their debts written off.</p>

          <p>Stellantis has appointed Antonio Filosa, North American chief operating officer, as its new chief executive, filling a leadership void after Carlos Tavares' unexpected resignation. Filosa will assume the role effective June 23, following a shareholder meeting. A 25-year veteran of the company, Filosa previously served as Jeep brand CEO and chief quality officer. Stellantis recently reported a downturn in first-quarter net revenues and withdrew its full-year financial guidance due to uncertainties regarding the impact of U.S. President Donald Trump's trade policy.</p>

          <p>Antony's impactful loan spell at Real Betis from Manchester United has led to the Spanish club's players jokingly suggesting extreme measures to keep him. Betis captain Isco and former winger Joaquin have playfully expressed their desire to "kidnap" Antony to ensure he stays with the club. Since joining in January, Antony has helped transform Betis' season, moving them from ninth to sixth in La Liga and securing a spot in the Europa League. He has also been instrumental in their journey to their first European final.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to deliver lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas in response to surging rice prices. After suspending orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller businesses, the government plans to allocate 100,000 tons of reserve rice to smaller supermarkets and rice shops, with the government covering transport costs. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the government will ensure reserve rice reaches people in rural areas as much as possible, imposing purchase limits for big retailers. Retail rice prices have doubled from a year earlier, prompting the government to intervene.</p>
