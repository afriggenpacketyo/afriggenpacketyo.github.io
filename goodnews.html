          <p>OpenAI has announced the launch of its new AI-powered web browser, ChatGPT Atlas, directly challenging Google's long-standing dominance in the search and browser market. Initially available for Apple's macOS, the company plans to expand access to Windows, iOS, and Android platforms in the near future. CEO Sam Altman described Atlas as a browser built around ChatGPT, enabling users to have conversational interactions with web pages. This move intensifies the competition in the AI space, pitting OpenAI's growing user base against Google's established Chrome browser, which has been integrating its own Gemini AI technology.</p>

President Trump confirmed the project, which he stated is being fully funded by $250 million in private contributions from business and tech companies. The new addition is intended to host large events and state visits for up to 999 guests and will feature bulletproof glass windows. The President assured that the new structure will pay respect to the existing historic building and will not directly interfere with it, despite the visible demolition work.</p>

          <p>A family-medicine clinic in Aurora, Colorado, known as Mango House, has developed a successful and profitable model by primarily serving Medicaid patients, a group often considered financially challenging for healthcare providers. Founded by Dr. P. J. Parmar, the clinic maximizes efficiency by eliminating scheduled appointments in favor of a walk-in system, which keeps wait times short and allows providers to see more patients. By focusing almost exclusively on Medicaid, the clinic streamlines its billing processes and maintains financial stability through high volume, challenging the conventional wisdom that Medicaid is an unsustainable payer.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance reported that the U.S.-brokered ceasefire in Gaza is progressing "better than I expected," despite recent outbreaks of violence between Israel and Hamas. Speaking from Israel, Vance acknowledged the fragility of the peace plan but expressed confidence in the process, urging patience as efforts continue to secure the remains of all hostages. The agreement has seen some progress, with hostage remains and Palestinian bodies being exchanged, but skepticism remains among some former Israeli officials about the long-term viability and commitment from both sides.</p>

          <h2>Beyond Meat Stock Surges Over 90% After Addition to Meme Stock ETF</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 13:17:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat surged dramatically, jumping over 90% on Tuesday after a more than 127% rise the previous day. The rally was triggered after the stock was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, which appears to have initiated a massive short squeeze, as over 63% of its available shares had been bet against. This marks a significant reversal for the former penny stock, which also benefited from an announcement of expanded distribution with Walmart. The sudden revival is seen by some as a sign of speculative froth in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>General Motors saw its stock soar over 15% after the automaker significantly beat Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations and raised its financial guidance for 2025. The company reported adjusted earnings of $2.80 per share on $48.59 billion in revenue, exceeding forecasts. GM now projects full-year adjusted earnings between $12 billion and $13 billion, signaling strong performance heading into the end of the year. However, the results were tempered by a $1.6 billion charge related to its pullback in electric vehicle production, which cut its net income by more than half compared to the previous year.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting its benchmark interest rate, financial advisors are recommending strategies for investors to adapt their portfolios. Some experts suggest locking in intermediate-range U.S. Treasury bonds to capture current higher yields while managing risk in a relatively strong but uncertain economy. For equities, maintaining a well-diversified portfolio across various asset classes is emphasized over chasing high-performing sectors, ensuring investors are positioned for unpredictable market shifts.

          <p>Despite the federal government shutdown, student loan borrowers can still access key services and assistance. The Department of Education's website, Studentaid.gov, remains operational for tasks like applying for repayment plans or loan consolidation, as do some call centers staffed by contractors. Additionally, loan servicers, which are government contractors, continue to operate normally for billing, payments, and processing deferment requests. Experts advise borrowers to utilize these resources, as well as nonprofit organizations and state ombudsman offices, for support during this period of uncertainty.</p>

          <p>Indonesia has agreed to repatriate Lindsay Sandiford, a British grandmother who has been on death row for over a decade after a 2013 drug trafficking conviction. The agreement, signed with the British foreign minister, will allow for the transfer of Sandiford, now in her late 60s and seriously ill, back to the U.K. Sandiford was arrested in Bali in 2012 with cocaine valued at over $2 million, but she claimed she was coerced by a syndicate that threatened her son. This repatriation is part of a recent trend by Indonesia to release several high-profile foreign detainees.</p>
