          <p>COVID-19 metrics are increasing across the United States, with hospitalization rates and test positivity percentages rising as the fall season approaches. Despite this uptick, current figures remain significantly lower than at the same time last year, indicating a less severe wave. Health officials attribute the increase to waning immunity and the circulation of new Omicron subvariants, such as XFG, which is now dominant. Experts advise vigilance and vaccination for eligible groups but do not anticipate the same level of impact as seen in previous years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to a Senate investigation and public criticism, Meta is implementing temporary changes to how its AI chatbots interact with teenage users. The company is training its AI to avoid engaging in inappropriate or romantic conversations and to refrain from discussing sensitive topics like self-harm, instead directing users to expert resources. This move follows reports that internal documents permitted "sensual" conversations with minors and a risk assessment from Common Sense Media that deemed the AI unsafe for anyone under 18. Meta stated these changes are part of a broader, long-term effort to enhance teen safety on its platforms.</p>

          <p>During a White House cabinet meeting, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio humorously suggested that President Trump should issue an executive order to ban weddings on Saturdays during the fall. Rubio described the scheduling conflict as a "scourge" on college football season that is "dividing families." The lighthearted comment provided a moment of levity, pivoting away from typical policy discussions to a widely relatable cultural grievance among sports fans. He noted that there are seven other months in the year available for people to get married.</p>

          <p>A baby girl was born at the Burning Man festival in Nevada to a mother who was reportedly unaware she was pregnant until she went into labor. The surprise delivery, which occurred early Wednesday morning, was assisted by a nearby obstetrician and a pediatric trauma nurse who were also attending the event. The mother and newborn were later airlifted to a hospital, where the baby is receiving care in the NICU due to being born premature. Family members have started a GoFundMe campaign to cover medical expenses and baby supplies, as the unexpected birth left the new parents completely unprepared.</p>

          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm jumped 10% following a fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. The company reported significant growth in revenue and a shift from a net loss to a net income of $69.2 million compared to the previous year. CEO Max Levchin highlighted strong consumer transaction frequency and growth in merchant partnerships, including with Amazon and Shopify, as key drivers. Despite concerns over losing Walmart as a partner, Affirm's gross merchandise volume grew substantially, signaling robust performance and consumer spending. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba's U.S.-listed shares climbed nearly 13% after the company reported better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter. The strong performance was largely driven by a 26% year-over-year revenue increase in its cloud computing division, fueled by robust demand for artificial intelligence services. While overall revenue slightly missed forecasts, the accelerated growth in the cloud unit and a revival in its e-commerce business have bolstered investor confidence. The company noted that AI-related product revenue has maintained triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 16:03:25 EDT</div>

          <p>A California administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can investigate State Farm's claims-handling practices as part of the insurer's rate increase hearing. The decision is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. State Farm is seeking an 11% rate hike on top of a 17% emergency increase granted in May. The ruling combines the issues of rate setting and claims conduct, allowing for scrutiny of whether the company's service justifies higher premiums.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for the permanent transfer of Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old spent the latter half of last season on loan at Betis, where he found success after a difficult period at United. The move marks the end of a disappointing tenure for Antony at Old Trafford, who was the club's second-most expensive signing at £81.3 million in 2022 but failed to consistently perform. The transfer is part of a broader squad overhaul at Manchester United, which has seen several high-profile players depart.</p>

Her announcement came with a strong list of endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and five current members of Congress.

Profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a mixed reaction to Nvidia's strong earnings report contributed to the downturn.

          <p>Paleontologists have uncovered new details about Spicomellus, the world's oldest known ankylosaur, describing it as one of the "strangest" dinosaurs ever found. Living 165 million years ago, this herbivore was covered in an elaborate armory of long bony spikes that were uniquely fused directly to its rib bones. This feature has never been seen in any other known vertebrate, living or extinct, leading researchers to dub it the "punk rocker" of its era. The discovery in Morocco is so unusual that it may force scientists to reassess their theories on how this group of "tank-like" dinosaurs evolved.</p>

The lawsuit challenged the town's "hand-me-down governance," where mayors were appointed rather than elected, resulting in a white-led government in a majority-Black town.

          <p>Southwest Airlines is set to fly its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 equipped with a secondary cockpit barrier, a safety feature designed to prevent intrusions into the flight deck. This marks a significant milestone in aviation safety, as these barriers have been advocated for by pilots' unions since the September 11, 2001 attacks. A new federal regulation requires aircraft manufacturers to install these barriers on all new commercial planes. While the FAA has given airlines an extension until 2026 to implement them, Southwest has chosen to begin complying immediately as it receives new aircraft.</p>
