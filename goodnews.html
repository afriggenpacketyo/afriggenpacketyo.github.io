          <h2>Analyst Outlines Ten Factors Supporting Stock Market Amid Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-20 20:14:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues against conventional wisdom suggesting market fragility due to looming tariff deadlines, presenting ten factors that support a strong market. These include excellent corporate earnings, a major tax relief bill benefiting consumers and businesses, and significant private and public investment in data centers, the electric grid, and aerospace. The author contends that pro-business policies, increased bank lending capacity, and a potential U.S. energy renaissance create a robust economic environment, dismissing fears that trade disputes will derail highly valued stocks.

          <p>Shenzhen-based company SpinQ, a developer of quantum computing technology, projects that the field will cross a critical threshold of practical usefulness within the next five years. Founded in 2018, the company produces both small-scale educational quantum computers and more powerful industrial-grade superconducting systems. The founder compares the current state of quantum technology to the semiconductor industry in the 1950s, acknowledging that significant development is still required before it achieves widespread, practical application and becomes more accessible.</p>

          <p>Officials in Texas have significantly lowered the number of people considered missing after the devastating Hill Country floods, from approximately 100 down to just three. The Kerr County Flood Disaster Joint Information Center announced the revised figure after extensive follow-up work by local and state agencies verified that many individuals initially reported missing were safe. Recovery efforts are still ongoing along the Guadalupe River watershed, where the historic flash floods killed at least 135 people earlier in the month.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert and researcher argues that the single most important skill to teach a child is self-connection—the ability to understand and trust their own emotions and needs. The article explains that this skill fosters emotional resilience, healthy boundaries, and authentic confidence, which can protect a child's mental health. Parents are advised to build this skill through small but significant shifts, such as validating their child's feelings, avoiding micromanagement, and modeling their own emotional awareness, rather than inadvertently teaching them to suppress their inner voice.</p>
