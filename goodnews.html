          <p>Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks announced a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger, leading to a surge in both companies' stock prices. The merger will establish a new Sydney-listed company acquiring all outstanding shares of both firms, creating an entity with approximately $9 billion in value and holdings across real estate, private equity, and credit totaling A$13.1 billion. The deal aims to simplify the existing structure, increase scale, and enhance the company's investment appeal, while also unwinding a 56-year mutual ownership designed to prevent hostile takeovers. The merger is expected to provide Brickworks shareholders with an implied value of A$30.28 per share, representing a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price last Friday.</p>
