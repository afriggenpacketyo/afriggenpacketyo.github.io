          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously decided the case of Ames v. Ohio, involving a heterosexual woman who claimed she was discriminated against due to her sexual orientation. Marlean Ames sued the Ohio Department of Youth Services after she was denied a promotion and later demoted, with her positions filled by a lesbian and a gay man, respectively. The court's decision underscores the principle of treating individuals as individuals rather than as members of a group. Justice Jackson's authorship of the opinion was notable, given the case's relevance to diversity, equity, and inclusion debates.</p>

He played 43 games for Sunderland in the 2024-25 season, showcasing his ability to contribute both defensively and offensively. His move to the Bundesliga is seen as a positive step, offering a balance between the Championship and the Premier League, with former Sunderland striker Marco Gabbiadini noting the financial advantages of playing abroad.</p>

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common sources of conflict in relationships, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. A sour tone signals contempt, a key predictor of divorce, while family disagreements often stem from unmet needs and differing values. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication further contribute to relationship strain. The article suggests strategies for resolving these conflicts, such as naming the effect of condescension, reassuring partners, acknowledging the invisible load of chores, and using a designated word to signal the need for a time-out.</p>

However, online safety campaigners criticize the government for delaying the implementation of new laws to protect children, with Ian Russell emphasizing the need for stronger legislation to prioritize safety over engagement.
