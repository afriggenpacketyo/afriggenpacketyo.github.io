Besides stagehands, cleaners are equally important to keep the stage spotless for dancers and overhead shots.

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, a former Islamist militant, after announcing the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. Al-Sharaa, who previously led an al-Qaeda-linked rebel group, now heads a government presenting itself as democratic. Trump urged al-Sharaa to normalize ties with Israel and counter terrorism. The meeting marks a significant shift in U.S. policy towards Syria, despite al-Sharaa's extremist past. Some U.S. allies, like Israel, remain wary of Sharaa, while others, like Saudi Arabia, have started building a relationship with Sharaa's government.</p>
