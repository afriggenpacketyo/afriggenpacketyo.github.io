          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and Palestinian rights activist, has been reunited with his family in New Jersey after being released from ICE detention. Khalil, a legal permanent resident, was held for over 100 days as the Trump administration sought his deportation for his role in campus protests against Israel. He was released after a judge ruled his detention unconstitutional and found no evidence he was a flight risk or danger to the public. Khalil vowed to continue advocating for Palestinian rights, while Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez condemned his detainment as a violation of First Amendment rights. This event follows a series of similar arrests of international students who have spoken out about Israel, raising concerns about freedom of speech. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 14:20:34 EDT</div>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from making drastic cuts to research funding provided by the National Science Foundation (NSF). The ruling prevents the administration from capping indirect costs for universities at 15%, a move that could have stripped institutions of millions of dollars in research funding. The judge deemed the policy change arbitrary and contrary to law, siding with universities that argued the cuts would threaten critical work in fields like artificial intelligence and cybersecurity. Similar caps placed on grants by the Energy Department and the National Institutes of Health have also been blocked by judges. The context of this article involves the ongoing debate over federal funding for scientific research. </p>

The team also asked federal agents to leave stadium grounds after they gathered near one of the gates. This action has been praised by local officials, including Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass. </p>

          <p>Warren Buffett, known for his value-oriented investment approach, has been a net seller of stocks in recent quarters, building up a record level of cash at Berkshire Hathaway. He has even cut positions in some of his favorites, such as Apple and Bank of America over the past year. This caution may have shielded his portfolio from market turbulence. However, Buffett recently made a significant investment in a particular stock, suggesting he may anticipate a future market shift. He noted in a recent shareholder letter that opportunities are rare, implying a selective approach to current market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House Rose Garden is undergoing renovations initiated by President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump. The grass center square has been removed and replaced with gravel, with bulldozers and construction equipment on site.

The White House official described the new construction as a "restoration" to preserve the beauty of the space and enhance practical use.
