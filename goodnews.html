          <p>Following five days of deadly border clashes that killed at least 35 people and displaced over 260,000, Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an unconditional ceasefire. The agreement was reached during talks in Malaysia, hosted by the ASEAN chair, and attended by U.S. and Chinese observers. The conflict, which escalated after a landmine incident, had drawn international pressure, including from the United States, which threatened to halt trade deals if hostilities continued. The violence represents a rare military confrontation between members of the ASEAN bloc, which prioritizes peaceful dialogue.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri's victory at the Belgian Grand Prix highlighted the narrow margins in the Formula 1 championship battle against his McLaren teammate, Lando Norris. The race turned on key moments, including Piastri's bold move to take the lead at the start in wet conditions and his careful management of medium-compound tires. While Norris fought back, a few small errors and a strategic tire choice difference ultimately cost him a chance to challenge for the win. The article also discusses the debate among drivers about the race's delayed start due to weather, balancing safety concerns with the desire to race.</p>

          <p>An Iowa baby named Nash Keen, officially recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's most premature baby to survive, has celebrated his first birthday. Born 133 days early at just 21 weeks gestation, he weighed only 10 ounces. His survival defied incredible odds, requiring 198 days in the neonatal intensive care unit at Stead Family Children’s Hospital. Despite ongoing health challenges like a minor heart defect and the need for a feeding tube, Nash is reportedly getting stronger with therapy, offering a story of hope and medical advancement.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese jewelry company Laopu Gold fell despite the company forecasting a nearly 280% increase in net profit for the first half of 2025. The stock, which has seen a massive surge of over 2,000% since its listing last year, appeared to be undergoing a correction as investors took profits. Analysts suggest the decline is due to a reset in market expectations, though some believe the company's growth story remains intact. Laopu, popular with younger consumers for its unique designs, attributed its strong revenue to brand expansion both online and through new physical stores. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Skywatchers are encouraged to look for meteors this week, as the Southern Delta Aquariids and Alpha Capricornids showers are set to peak on the night of July 29-30. This presents a better viewing opportunity than the more famous Perseid meteor shower in August, which will be largely obscured by a bright moon this year. Astronomers suggest finding a dark location away from city lights after midnight for the best chance to see the combined 20-30 meteors per hour. The Alpha Capricornids are noted for producing infrequent but spectacular "slow fireballs" across the sky.</p>

          <p>"Jeopardy!" host and trivia icon Ken Jennings is releasing a new book, "The Complete Kennections," a collection of his puzzle quizzes. In a recent interview, he discussed his belief that trivia is a "universal social good" that fosters cultural literacy and brings people together, rather than just a way to show off knowledge. Jennings, a former computer science major, also expressed serious concerns about the rise of AI, worrying that it could lead to an over-reliance on biased information and diminish natural curiosity. He champions the idea of being a generalist in an increasingly specialized world.</p>

          <p>The book "The Carpool Detectives" details the true story of four Los Angeles mothers who, with no law enforcement experience, solved a cold case murder during the COVID-19 pandemic. The women investigated the mysterious disappearance and death of an older couple from two decades prior, a case that had stalled with the police. Over two and a half years, they navigated dead ends and earned the respect of law enforcement by identifying the perpetrator. The success has given the women a new sense of purpose, and they are now tackling an even larger case involving a potential serial killer.</p>

          <p>With over one in ten Americans having used a GLP-1 drug like Ozempic, and cheaper pill versions on the horizon, society is entering a new era of widespread use for weight loss and potentially other conditions. These drugs work by affecting digestion and, crucially, by crossing into the brain to suppress cravings and the dopamine reward system. While this shows promise for treating addiction and compulsive behaviors, it raises a major unanswered question: What are the long-term consequences of modulating human desire? Experts are cautiously exploring whether we can suppress harmful compulsions without compromising productive drives and our fundamental experience of joy.</p>

The species, native to the eastern Himalayas and China, is on the decline due to threats like poaching and deforestation. The zoo announced it is "over the moon" and is monitoring the new cubs, which will remain in their nest box for about three months.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, former presidential contender Pete Buttigieg warned that the Democratic party's goal should not be to simply restore the institutions and policies that existed before the Trump administration. He argued that Democrats have been "too attached to a status quo that has been failing us for a long time," and that this contributed to their 2024 defeat. Buttigieg suggested that while it is wrong for the current administration to dismantle agencies, it is also a mistake to assume they were working perfectly, advocating for a future-oriented vision of reform rather than restoration.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has become the first state to require social media platforms to display a warning label to users before they log on, a law set to take effect in July 2026. The pop-up will ask users to acknowledge that prolonged use can be hazardous to their mental health, similar to warnings on tobacco or alcohol. The legislation, sponsored by Democratic state Rep. Zack Stephenson, aims to make users, especially young people, more mindful of their online habits. Tech industry group NetChoice opposes the law, arguing it unconstitutionally compels private companies to deliver the state's message, and may challenge it in court.</p>

          <p>Psychologists are recognizing that not all children respond to ultra-processed foods in the same way, with some having a naturally strong "food reward drive" that makes them more susceptible to overeating. For these children, who feel hungry more often and don't easily feel full, standard advice may not work. Experts suggest that instead of trying to moderate intake of these foods, a more effective strategy is to limit their presence in the home environment. By making whole or minimally processed foods the default and treating ultra-processed items as occasional exceptions, parents can help these children regulate their eating habits more successfully.</p>
