        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Attorney for Maryland has informed Department of Justice superiors that there is insufficient evidence to indict California Senator Adam Schiff on mortgage fraud charges, as reported by MSNBC. This assessment comes despite President Donald Trump's public calls for criminal charges against Schiff, a prominent critic who served as a prosecutor in Trump's first impeachment trial. Maryland U.S. Attorney Kelly Hayes met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to update him on her investigation, conveying her belief that the case against Schiff was not strong. Schiff's lawyer, Preet Bharara, emphasized that career prosecutors found the politically motivated allegations baseless and unsupported by evidence, asserting that the transparently vindictive effort should now conclude, hoping for justice within the Justice Department.</p>

          <p>Industry experts at the 11th Global Blockchain Summit in Shanghai anticipate significant advancements in the cryptocurrency sector through increased collaboration between Hong Kong and mainland China. Despite the mainland's years-long ban on various crypto activities, Hong Kong leads in crypto regulation, while mainland developers excel in digital payments and artificial intelligence. Rachel Lee of Cyberport and Lily Liu of the Solana Foundation expressed desires to deepen this cooperation, leveraging Hong Kong's status as a major international financial hub and China's massive developer ecosystem. This synergy is expected to foster development in areas like virtual asset trading, decentralized payments, and the broader Web3 industry.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers exhibit a remarkably composed approach to championship pressure, treating deep postseason runs as routine while aiming for a modern-day dynasty. Players like Miguel Rojas note the absence of frenzied celebrations for a pennant, underscoring the team's singular focus on winning the World Series. Manager Dave Roberts emphasizes a "one day at a time" mentality, deflecting "legacy" and "dynasty" discussions to external observers. This culture, cultivated through consistent star acquisitions and sustained success, allows the team to embrace historical opportunities without succumbing to overwhelming expectations, making their pursuit of a third title in six seasons feel natural.</p>

This significant engagement will take place during Trump's broader trip to Asia, which includes visits to Malaysia and Japan, culminating at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea. The highly anticipated "crunch talks" between the two leaders are expected to cover a range of pressing geopolitical and economic issues. This signals continued high-level engagement between the United States and China on the international stage, with potential implications for global stability.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest has embarked on a new era under manager Sean Dyche, who secured a Europa League win against Porto in his opening game, marking the club's first victory in several matches. Dyche, a former Forest player, expressed deep satisfaction in returning as manager, soaking in the fervent atmosphere at the City Ground. The team's shift to a pragmatic back-four formation and increased fight resulted in their first clean sheet in 21 games. This early success has significantly boosted team morale and established a crucial connection with the supporters, who have endured a difficult period of changes and poor performances.</p>

          <p>Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman has publicly stated the company will not develop artificial intelligence services that provide "simulated erotica," clearly distinguishing its ethical stance from that of longtime partner OpenAI. Suleyman underscored the inherent dangers of creating "seemingly conscious" AI and leaning into "sexbot erotica," referencing OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments on allowing verified adults to use ChatGPT for such content. This decision reflects Microsoft's commitment to responsible AI development, prioritizing a framework where AI is built "for people; not to be a person," and avoiding potential societal divisions arising from these applications.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer asserts that bullish investors typically triumph in the long run, urging market participants to maintain an optimistic investment strategy. He encourages investors to stay in the market, dismissing common fears surrounding government shutdowns and U.S.-China tensions as often overblown, noting historical data shows minimal long-term market impact from such events. Cramer highlights positive early earnings reports, suggesting tariffs are already factored into company valuations. He argues that the market is a collection of investable companies, not a gamble, reinforcing his long-standing belief in market resilience and the ultimate reward for patient investors.

          <p>A panel of U.S. judges unanimously rejected the Trump administration's request to delay court rulings on claims by veterans seeking disability benefits during the government shutdown. The 9-0 decision, led by Chief Judge Michael Allen, deemed the request by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs as "significant and extreme." Veterans groups vehemently opposed the delay, arguing it was a pretext to deny veterans their day in court, with some having waited decades for their claims. This ruling marks a notable instance of the federal judiciary pushing back against the administration, ensuring that veterans' legal processes continue despite federal funding lapses.</p>

          <p>Intel reported better-than-expected third-quarter revenue, indicating a recovery in demand for its core x86 processors for PCs, which led to a 6% jump in its stock. The company received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, which became a top shareholder through an $8.9 billion investment negotiated by the Trump administration. Intel also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate its CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to revive growth in its data center business. Despite accounting complexities due to the government's stake and the ongoing shutdown, Intel anticipates continued strong chip demand through next year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles issued a tentative ruling ordering the government to ensure immigrant detainees at a downtown processing center have access to legal counsel, extending a previous temporary restraining order. Public Counsel, which brought the lawsuit, argued detainees faced inhumane conditions, emphasizing the critical need for unfettered legal access. While the government claimed compliance, the judge noted past violations, expressing concern. This significant ruling aims to uphold detainees' Fifth Amendment rights to counsel, despite a recent Supreme Court decision lifting a separate order against racial profiling. Advocates remain vigilant to ensure the government adheres to constitutional requirements.</p>

This volume, which details Trump's document handling, was withheld due to ongoing cases that have since been dismissed. Smith seeks to address numerous "mischaracterizations" of his investigations, which led to two criminal cases against the former president.</p>

          <p>Apple has lost a landmark lawsuit in the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal, which ruled the tech giant abused its dominant position by charging "excessive and unfair prices" for App Store commissions. This decision could entitle approximately 36 million iPhone and iPad users in the UK to an estimated £1.5 billion in damages accumulated over the past decade. Lawyers argue Apple's practices illegally excluded competition and stifled innovation, with the tribunal set to determine compensation amounts next month. Apple plans to appeal the ruling, while other major tech companies like Google and Amazon face similar regulatory scrutiny over their app store fees and market dominance.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor surpassed Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but adjusted its 2025 guidance downward due to a supplier fire disrupting production of its highly profitable large trucks and SUVs. The fire at an aluminum supplier is projected to cost Ford between $1.5 billion and $2 billion, though the company plans to mitigate much of this by significantly increasing U.S. pickup truck production and adding 1,000 workers. Ford also reduced its expected tariff costs by $1 billion following changes by the Trump administration. Despite these challenges, Ford's Q3 revenue reached a record $50.5 billion, driven by its commercial business, demonstrating progress in its Ford+ turnaround plan.</p>
