          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey anticipates the UK's defence spending will reach 3% of GDP by 2034, a target underpinning the government's upcoming strategic defence review. This review, scheduled for release on Monday, will outline military and security spending priorities for the coming years, assuming the 3% target is met. The review will address emerging threats like drones and AI, recommending the deployment of digital experts alongside troops, while also warning of immediate dangers posed by Russia, and describing China as a persistent challenge. The OBR estimates meeting the 3% target would require an additional ¬£17.3 billion in 2029-30. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A lawsuit has been filed against a Kansas law that nullifies advance medical directives for pregnant women regarding end-of-life treatment. Three women and two physicians are challenging the law's constitutionality, arguing it violates rights to personal autonomy, privacy, equal treatment, and freedom of speech. The plaintiffs claim the law denies pregnant women the option to make advance directives to accept or refuse healthcare if incapacitated or terminally ill. The physicians argue the law forces them to provide a lower standard of care to pregnant patients, potentially leading to legal repercussions. </p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are cracking down on scams that falsely claim artificial intelligence can predict questions on the upcoming national college entrance examination (gaokao). The Ministry of Education, the Cyberspace Administration of China, and the Ministry of Public Security have launched a joint campaign to investigate and eliminate illegal and harmful information related to the exams. Mock papers and private tutors are reportedly using AI as a gimmick to attract students and parents, selling simulated test questions at inflated prices. More than 13.3 million people are expected to take the gaokao this year, making it a high-stakes event. </p>

          <p>After 23 years of construction and congestion, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2 billion upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce travel times between west Wales and the Midlands. The project, initially drawn up in 1990, involved building almost 70 structures, including over 40 new bridges and a dozen new junctions, while planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's benefits, critics cite the project's extensive delays and high cost. </p>
