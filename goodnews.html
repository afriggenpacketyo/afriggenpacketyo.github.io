          <p>Despite an overall cooling of inflation following President Trump's "Liberation Day" levies, certain everyday items like coffee and beef are experiencing significant price increases. Coffee prices have surged due to droughts in Vietnam and Brazil, restricting global output, while beef prices have risen due to a reduced national beef herd following a drought in 2022. Car repair costs are also up due to the increasing complexity of car technology and a shortage of skilled technicians, while prices for men's and women's outerwear have climbed due to shifting consumer tastes.

President Trump indicated that the U.S. was nearing a long-term peace deal with Iran, which could lead to increased Iranian crude oil exports. The potential deal could be price negative but its impact will possibly be mitigated by OPEC+ rolling back on its plan to release barrels back to the market faster than originally planned.

          <p>The all-female free divers of Jeju Island, known as Haenyeo, have unique physiological and genetic adaptations that allow them to endure an extreme lifestyle of diving in cold waters for extended periods. Research comparing the Haenyeo to other women on the island revealed that the divers experience a significantly greater drop in heart rate during simulated dives, indicating a physiological adaptation. Genetic analysis identified two genes associated with cold tolerance and blood pressure regulation, suggesting that generations of divers have shaped the genetic makeup of the island's population, reducing stroke mortality.</p>
