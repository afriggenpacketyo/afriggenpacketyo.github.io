          <p>Four people were safely rescued from a boat that caught fire on Saturday near Cape Canaveral, Florida. The U.S. Coast Guard reported that a good Samaritan was instrumental in helping the passengers escape the burning vessel. Dramatic images showed thick black smoke billowing from the boat as beachgoers watched from the shore. Fortunately, no injuries were reported in the incident. The cause of the fire remains under investigation by the authorities, who are working to determine what led to the dangerous situation at sea.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England international Marc Guehi enters the final year of his Crystal Palace contract, Liverpool is reportedly a strong contender for his signature. The potential transfer hinges on several factors, including Crystal Palace's valuation, which was as high as ¬£65 million last year, and whether Liverpool sees value in a deal estimated around ¬£40-¬£45 million. Guehi's decision will also depend on his prospective role at Anfield, where he would compete with established defenders Virgil van Dijk and Ibrahima Konate. With the 2026 World Cup approaching, securing regular playing time will be crucial for his international aspirations.</p>

The highlighted companies include fast-food giant McDonald's, praised for its consistent dividend growth and defensive qualities, and EPR Properties, a real estate investment trust focusing on experiential venues. Oilfield services company Halliburton is also favored for its strong international market presence and free cash flow generation, which supports its dividend payments.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a reflective essay, author V (formerly Eve Ensler) contemplates how to resist despair and take action in a political climate she describes as authoritarian and suffocating. She argues that survival depends on embracing duality‚Äîfeeling pain without being immobilized by it and directing rage into purposeful action. The author points to the power of public demonstrations not just as acts of refusal but as community-building events that strengthen resolve. Drawing inspiration from activists in the Congo and the US, the piece advocates for building local networks of care and believing that creating a new, more humane world is possible.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend among younger bar patrons, particularly Gen Z, involves closing out their tab after every single drink instead of keeping one open for the evening. Bartenders interviewed expressed that this habit is annoying and time-consuming, especially during busy periods, as it disrupts their workflow. While some young adults cite fiscal responsibility and a desire to monitor their spending as reasons for the practice, it also creates more transaction fees for bar owners. The behavior is part of a larger shift, with data showing that fewer young adults are consuming alcohol compared to previous generations.</p>

          <p>Fifteen years after its initial public offering on June 29, 2010, Tesla's stock has seen a monumental increase, turning a $10,000 investment into nearly $3 million. The company has grown from a niche electric sportscar maker into the world's eighth most-valuable public company, largely driven by the mass-market success of its Model Y and Model 3 vehicles. However, with recent sluggish sales and increased competition, CEO Elon Musk is now pivoting the company's future value proposition towards advancements in autonomous driving and humanoid robots. Despite this vision, the stock has underperformed in 2025 amid market skepticism and concerns over Musk's political activities. (not investment advice)</p>
