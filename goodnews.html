        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The English government is proposing a new law to ban the sale of energy drinks to anyone under 16, encompassing retail, online, and vending channels. This initiative responds to widespread concerns from parents and teachers regarding the adverse effects on children's health, concentration, and academic performance. Many popular energy drinks contain caffeine levels equivalent to multiple cups of coffee, linked to issues like headaches, sleep disturbances, and rapid heart rates, with rare cases of death. Sugary versions also contribute to obesity and dental damage, according to dieticians. A 12-week consultation period is underway to gather feedback from health experts, educators, the public, and industry stakeholders before the ban's implementation, aiming to significantly improve children's overall well-being.</p>

          <p>South Korea has selected German-born Jens Castrop for its national football team, signaling a new era for the country, which previously lacked naturalized players at the World Cup. Castrop, who represented Germany at youth levels and made his Bundesliga debut, is set to make his senior international debut against the United States. This move is widely supported by Korean fans and media, largely due to his undeniable talent and his Korean mother's strong emphasis on his heritage and passion for the country. His selection also brings the sensitive issue of South Korea's mandatory military service into focus, with Castrop expressing full awareness and a willingness to fulfill his obligations. This precedent could encourage more foreign-born players of Korean descent to join the national team, potentially boosting its global standing in various sports.</p>

          <p>Watches of Switzerland Group saw its shares jump over 8% following a positive trading update and a stock upgrade by Deutsche Bank. The company confirmed it is on track to deliver first-half results in line with its expectations, successfully shrugging off the impact of new U.S. tariffs on Swiss imports. It reported consistently strong trading, particularly within the U.S. market, and anticipates no material impact from the 39% tariff in H1 FY26 due to brand partners having increased inventories. Deutsche Bank upgraded the stock to "buy," asserting that the downside risk to earnings from US import tariffs is much more contained than market sentiment reflects. This positive momentum for the company contrasted with broader European market declines driven by fiscal outlook concerns and rising bond yields. (not investment advice)</p>

He is scheduled to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping later on Wednesday and will return to his country the same day, according to Indonesian State Secretariat Minister Prasetyo Hadi. The article notes that Prabowo's attendance comes as protests are raging in Indonesia, though it does not elaborate on the nature or cause of these domestic demonstrations. His presence adds to the diverse group of international leaders at the event, including those from Southeast Asia, such as Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and Myanmar’s junta leader Min Aung Hlaing, further highlighting China's growing diplomatic influence in the region.</p>

          <p>In a landmark antitrust case, a U.S. judge ruled that Google is a monopolist in online search but opted against forcing a company breakup, a scenario that had loomed large. Judge Amit Mehta decided not to compel Google to spin off its Chrome browser or impose court oversight on its Android operating system, which were proposals from government lawyers. However, the ruling does mandate Google to share certain search index data with "qualified competitors" and prohibits exclusive contracts for preloading its search engine, giving partners more leverage. The judge acknowledged the evolving landscape of generative AI as a factor in his cautious remedies.</p>

          <p>Russia's Rosatom state nuclear corporation announced it would actively help China surpass the United States as the world's largest producer of nuclear power. Alexei Likhachev, the Rosatom chief, stated after talks in Beijing that China has ambitious plans to reach over 100 gigawatts of installed capacity, aiming to exceed the current U.S. network of nearly 97 gigawatts. Russia has already assisted in building four nuclear reactors in China and is currently constructing four more, demonstrating a long-standing collaboration. Likhachev emphasized that China's ambitious plans will necessitate a large amount of uranium and nuclear fuel, requiring the development of a new generation of closed nuclear fuel cycle reactors based on Russian technology, highlighting a deepening strategic energy partnership between the two nations.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid has solidified its reputation as masters of the free transfer market, consistently acquiring world-class talent for minimal or no fees, as exemplified by the recent signing of Trent Alexander-Arnold from Liverpool for 10 million euros.

The unique allure and grandeur of Real Madrid, coupled with its relentless desire to win every single possible trophy, often outweighs the financial incentives offered by other major European clubs. This successful strategy has a long and illustrious history, dating back to 1988, and continues to attract top-tier players eager to be part of its mystique.</p>

          <p>The charged atmosphere at this year's US Open in New York has reignited a debate surrounding on-court etiquette, with incidents involving net cords, underarm serves, and body shots drawing scrutiny. Players like Jelena Ostapenko have expressed frustration over opponents not apologizing for net-cord winners, a common courtesy in tennis. The article notes that in the U.S., a lack of apology for net cords is often not considered a major faux pas. Underarm serves, utilized by players like Nick Kyrgios, and intentionally hitting opponents with the ball, have also sparked controversy, dividing opinions on sportsmanship versus legitimate tactics. This discussion highlights the evolving norms and passionate rivalries within professional tennis.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court panel ruled that former President Donald Trump cannot use the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to expedite the deportations of individuals accused of belonging to a Venezuelan gang, Tren de Aragua. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with immigrant rights lawyers, stating the law was not intended for peacetime immigration enforcement against gangs. The Trump administration had argued courts couldn't second-guess the president's determination of danger. This 2-1 ruling, which can be appealed to the Supreme Court, found no "invasion or predatory incursion" to justify using a statute previously invoked only during declared wars, thus upholding a preliminary injunction sought by the plaintiffs.</p>

          <p>Australia's Gross Domestic Product expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing Reuters' economist forecast of 1.6% and marking the fastest growth since September 2023. Quarter-over-quarter GDP grew 0.6%, also above expectations. Growth was primarily driven by domestic spending, particularly household and government consumption, despite public demand remaining flat. Oxford Economics suggests this might be a "high watermark" for 2025 due to cooling job markets and tapering cost-of-living support. The Reserve Bank of Australia recently cut rates to 3.6%, citing reduced global uncertainty regarding U.S. tariffs and a gradual recovery in private demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that former President Donald Trump's deployment of National Guard soldiers and marines to Los Angeles was illegal, dealing a setback to his ambition to act as a "national police chief." The judge found that the administration used armed soldiers and military vehicles for crowd control and traffic blockades, effectively turning them into a "national police force," which violates a 1878 law prohibiting military involvement in civilian law enforcement. The deployment, which occurred amid protests against immigration raids, was condemned by LA Mayor Karen Bass as political theatre. This ruling, though subject to appeal, challenges the President's authority to federalize city policing.</p>

          <p>Fire crews swiftly contained a brush fire that ignited Tuesday evening in the Hollywood Hills, below several homes, preventing any structural damage. The blaze, which started north of West Sunset Boulevard, burned approximately a quarter of an acre of vegetation as it moved uphill, briefly threatening nearby residences. About 80 firefighting personnel, supported by helicopters making crucial water drops, were deployed to the scene, significantly slowing the fire's progress. Within an hour, all active flames were extinguished, and forward progress was stopped, though one car was burned. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass praised the "heroic" and rapid response of first responders, as a heat advisory remains in effect for the region, elevating fire danger compounded by late-summer thunderstorms.</p>
