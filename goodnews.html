          <p>A top Chinese resources official has asserted that China must take a more proactive and influential role in the development of international rules for deep-sea mining. In a recent article, Wu Changbin, director of the China Deep Ocean Affairs Administration, argued that as the country with the largest number of mining areas, China should play a "key guiding role" in forming the regulatory framework. This push comes as nations look to the seabed for critical minerals like cobalt and nickel, which are essential for technologies such as electric vehicles, highlighting China's strategic ambitions in global resource governance.</p>

          <p>The NBA is making a significant return to China with preseason games in Macao, marking a milestone in rebuilding its relationship with its second-largest market after a six-year hiatus. The league is looking to tap into its massive Chinese fanbase of over 425 million social media followers to drive future growth, especially as U.S. television viewership declines. This return is underscored by a renewed partnership with Alibaba and extensive community outreach, signaling a strategic effort to re-establish a strong presence. The move is seen as a positive development for the league, its partners, and fans in Asia.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, has declared his party is ready to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party in the next Senedd election. At the party's annual conference, he positioned Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting, promising "new energy and new ideas" to voters. This move comes as recent polling suggests a tight race between Plaid, Labour, and the Reform UK party. Ap Iorwerth is attempting to frame his party as the primary alternative to both the established Labour government and the rising influence of Reform UK, aiming to broaden its appeal beyond its traditional strongholds.</p>

          <p>The list of potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair under the Trump administration has been narrowed to five individuals following a series of interviews led by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The remaining contenders include current Fed officials Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller, as well as former officials Kevin Warsh, Kevin Hassett, and BlackRock's Rick Rieder. Bessent is reportedly seeking a candidate open to new ideas on monetary policy and willing to potentially pare down the Fed's size and scope. The final decision rests with President Trump, who may nominate the chosen individual to a governor seat before elevating them to chair. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Upcoming 401(k) Rule Change to Impact Tax Breaks for High Earners</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-10 07:15:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant change to 401(k) plans, enacted by the Secure 2.0 Act, is set to alter how high-earning individuals make catch-up contributions. Starting in 2026, workers who earned more than $145,000 in the previous year will be required to make their catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account, eliminating the option for a traditional pretax deduction. This shift means higher earners will lose an upfront tax break on these extra savings. Financial experts advise that now is the time for affected individuals to conduct multi-year tax projections to decide whether to maximize pretax contributions through 2025 or transition to Roth contributions sooner.

          <p>The Knight First Amendment Institute, an affiliate of Columbia University, has secured a major legal victory against the Trump administration over the detention of pro-Palestinian students. A federal judge ruled that the detention and attempted deportation of student Mahmoud Khalil was an unconstitutional effort to chill free speech. The ruling highlights a growing rift between the institute and Columbia University, which has been criticized for its own restrictive policies on campus protests and for reaching a settlement with the administration over antisemitism claims. The case positions the Knight Institute at the forefront of defending constitutional values against government overreach.</p>

This strategy, built on resiliency and a disciplined low block, has been criticized by some for lacking offensive creativity but is a source of pride for the players. Fueled by a new generation of talent emerging from strong domestic youth academies, Ecuador is focused on achieving its best-ever World Cup performance.</p>

          <p>The Israeli military has begun withdrawing its troops from parts of Gaza following the government's approval of a ceasefire agreement aimed at ending the two-year war with Hamas. The deal includes the release of all remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for approximately 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. As part of the initial phase, Israeli forces are retreating to a buffer zone, allowing some displaced Palestinians to attempt to return to their homes amid vast destruction. The U.S. is contributing about 200 troops to a multinational force to monitor the ceasefire, a fragile step toward stability in the devastated region.</p>

The 62-year-old star, currently competing on "Strictly Come Dancing," underwent a hysterectomy and radiation therapy, completing her treatment in late 2024. Kingston stated she had initially dismissed symptoms like bloating and aches as signs of aging before seeking medical help after spotting blood in her urine. She said the experience inspired her to join the dancing competition, embracing a "life is too short" philosophy, and she is now urging other women not to ignore potential health warning signs.</p>

          <p>An ancient Roman grave marker discovered in a New Orleans backyard has been traced back to a U.S. soldier who served in Italy during World War II. The soldier's granddaughter, Erin Scott O’Brien, revealed that her grandfather brought the 1,900-year-old artifact home and that it was later passed down to her. Unaware of its historical significance, she used the marble tablet as a garden decoration and left it behind when she sold the house in 2018. The new owners, an anthropologist and her husband, identified the Latin inscription and alerted experts, leading to the FBI's art crime team facilitating its repatriation to an Italian museum.</p>

          <p>Katrina Thompson, the mayor of Broadview, Illinois, asserts that the Trump administration is fabricating a narrative of urban unrest to justify deploying the National Guard to her community.

Broadview has become a focal point for protests at a local ICE facility, but the mayor describes the situation as overblown and the military presence as unnecessary. A federal judge recently issued a temporary restraining order blocking the deployment, finding no credible evidence of a "danger of rebellion in Illinois."</p>
