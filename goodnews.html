          <h2>Newcastle United Initiates Negotiations to Acquire Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United has started discussions with Southampton to sign England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale, exploring either a loan or a permanent deal. Southampton, which was recently relegated from the Premier League, reportedly prefers a permanent sale for the player they acquired for an initial £18 million. The move comes after Newcastle's deal for another goalkeeper fell through and reflects their effort to strengthen their squad for the upcoming Champions League season. The potential transfer would reunite Ramsdale with his former manager, Eddie Howe.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered a complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact, a rare and exciting find according to curators. The print was found pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a model building placed in tombs, likely left by its creator before it dried between 2055 and 1650 B.C.E. While fingerprints have been found before, a full handprint of this clarity is highly unusual. The artifact will be a centerpiece in an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, focusing on the craftspeople of ancient Egypt.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion semiconductor contract with Samsung Electronics, set to run until the end of 2033. Musk stated that Samsung's new Texas factory will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation AI6 chip, a move he described as strategically critical. He also suggested the deal could grow even larger and noted that Tesla would be personally involved in maximizing the plant's manufacturing efficiency. The news caused Samsung's shares to surge over 6% to their highest level since September 2024. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of American liquefied natural gas (LNG) companies experienced a significant jump after the European Union agreed to a landmark $750 billion energy purchase from the U.S. This deal is part of a broader trade agreement intended to reduce Europe's reliance on Russian natural gas and enhance its energy security. Companies involved in LNG exportation and infrastructure, such as Cheniere and Venture Global, saw their stock values increase by 3-4%. The agreement was highlighted by President Trump as a very important component of the new transatlantic trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The WNBA is experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and revenue, fueling a contentious debate over player pay as the league and its players' union negotiate a new collective-bargaining agreement. With a new $2.2 billion media-rights deal starting in 2026 and franchise valuations soaring, players are demanding a larger share of the income. Currently, players receive just over 9% of league revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share in men's leagues like the NBA and NFL. This article argues that despite past unprofitability, the league's financial future is bright, and players deserve compensation proportional to their labor.</p>

The business lasted only a month because, as he discovered, nobody wanted to buy his product despite his pitch that it would save them money. Cuban says the experience taught him a valuable lesson about failure: you only have to be right once to succeed. For aspiring entrepreneurs with no money, he advises focusing on sweat equity and providing a service based on a personal skill, such as tutoring or freelance design.</p>
