        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European defense company stocks, including Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt, experienced a significant rally. This market movement directly followed former U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in stance, where he expressed strong support for Ukraine's efforts to reclaim all its territory from Russia. Trump's comments, made at the UN General Assembly, suggested that with sustained European and NATO support, Ukraine could successfully restore its original borders, boosting investor confidence in the defense sector. The gains contrasted with a broader downturn in European markets, which were affected by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's warnings about inflated asset prices.</p>

          <p>In an emotional return to his late-night show, Jimmy Kimmel criticized what he called "anti-American" threats to free speech following his brief suspension over comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. During his monologue, Kimmel clarified it was never his intention to make light of the murder and also took aim at Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr for threatening the broadcast licenses of ABC. The controversy has sparked a national debate, with many local affiliate stations refusing to air his return, even after ABC reinstated the program.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million lost to fraud over the past year by employing a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent activities during the Covid-19 pandemic, such as bogus Bounce Back Loans. The AI tool, known as the Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator, identifies weaknesses in new policies before they can be exploited. Following its success, the UK plans to license this technology to international partners, including the US and Australia, to combat fraud on a global scale.</p>

During the meeting in Beijing, the first of its kind in six years, Wang urged Washington to view China objectively and properly manage differences, particularly regarding Taiwan. The visit, led by Democrat Adam Smith, is seen as a crucial step in reopening channels of communication and stabilizing the complex bilateral relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, Chinese Premier Li Qiang announced that China will no longer seek "special and differential treatment" reserved for developing countries in future World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations. The declaration, made at the UN General Assembly, is a gesture aimed at supporting multilateralism and free trade amidst global economic fragmentation. By relinquishing these privileges, Beijing is positioning itself as a responsible major power committed to upholding the international trade system, even as it criticizes decoupling trends that it argues harm the global economy.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has unveiled plans for an unprecedented $850 billion infrastructure expansion in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank to build a network of AI supercomputing facilities.

He framed the initiative as essential for delivering the future of AI, stating that the biggest bottleneck is not capital but electricity. Critics, however, warn of a potential investment bubble and a circular financing model among the partner companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The northern Chinese city of Datong successfully averted a major disaster during this summer's heavy rains, thanks to a large-scale infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. The project, spearheaded by former mayor Geng Yanbo, involved widening the city's main river and reinforcing its banks, a move once considered wasteful by some residents. This foresight is now being hailed as a crucial investment in urban resilience. Economists suggest that such long-term infrastructure spending not only protects cities but can also serve as an effective short-term economic stimulus.</p>
