        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's decision to deploy National Guard troops and Marines to Los Angeles has inadvertently given California Governor Gavin Newsom a national platform. Newsom delivered a televised address criticizing the deployment and defending California's values. This exposure has likely boosted Newsom's standing within the Democratic Party and revived speculation about a potential 2028 presidential bid. Newsom's strong communication skills and telegenic presence have allowed him to effectively counter Trump's narrative and gain valuable attention.</p>

          <p>US Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth assured Congress that lawmakers would be involved in a 30-day assessment of the Aukus alliance. This assurance came after reports questioned the future of the security pact between Australia, Britain, and the U.S., with concerns raised about the review's timeframe. China has voiced opposition to Aukus, viewing it as a bloc confrontation that amplifies nuclear proliferation risks. The alliance, launched in 2021, is widely seen as a counter to China's regional influence.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reiterated his support for Chinese students in America, pledging to help them remain in the country after graduation. This statement contrasts with previous initiatives from his administration that aimed to limit or block international students due to national security concerns. Trump emphasized the benefits of Chinese students for American schools and the country as a whole, advocating for their employment by American companies. He noted that preventing them from staying would lead to them starting businesses in their home countries.</p>
