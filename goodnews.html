          <p>The number of foreign visitors to Japan reached 3.7 million in May, marking a record for the month, propelled by strong travel demand even after the cherry blossom season. South Korea topped the list with the most visitors, followed by China, both countries achieving new visitor records for May. The Japan National Tourism Organization reported that nineteen other markets also set new visitor records for May. This surge in tourism reflects Japan's continued appeal as a popular travel destination and the recovery of international travel.</p>

          <p>Boeing's Turbo Sjogren emphasizes the need for Europe to reduce its dependence on China for critical minerals, mirroring similar concerns in the United States. He highlighted that the aerospace supply chain is global, requiring international cooperation. Sjogren noted that US legislation since 1973 mandates that the aerospace industry and defense sector cannot rely on countries like China for critical materials. Despite sovereignty considerations, programs developed in the US will likely have significant European content, and vice versa, due to the nature of the supply chain.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Businesses are increasingly using 'tariff engineering' to lower duty payments by strategically altering product classifications. This involves modifying an item's materials, dimensions, or composition to fit into a different harmonized system code. Despite broad-based tariffs, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit through these strategic design choices. Tariff engineering is considered a legal practice, allowing companies to reduce duty liability by leveraging the over 5,000 product classification codes used by U.S. customs authorities.
