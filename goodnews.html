          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s vaccine policies appear influenced by the historical miasma theory, which attributed disease to bad air.  While the germ theory has superseded the miasma theory, Kennedy seems to equate modern environmental toxins, including vaccines, with miasma.  Experts criticize this approach, emphasizing the proven effectiveness of vaccines.  The article presents contrasting viewpoints on the role of environmental factors and vaccines in public health.</p>
