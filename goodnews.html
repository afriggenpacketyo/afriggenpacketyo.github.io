          <p>A Japanese nutritionist living in the U.S. details her experience shopping at a Costco in Kyoto, Japan, highlighting the incredible variety of foods not commonly found in American stores. She was impressed by the extensive selection of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like tofu, and seasonal Japanese produce. The store also offered a wide range of ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and numerous green tea options. The author wishes U.S. Costco stores would carry more of these nutrient-dense and culturally significant items.</p>

          <p>A 74-year-old dog trainer, initially diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and given less than a year to live, has made a remarkable recovery following a double-lung transplant. Despite having no initial symptoms, a routine scan revealed the progressive and fatal lung disease. After overcoming initial reluctance and enduring a difficult wait, he successfully underwent the procedure at the Cleveland Clinic. Now with 98% lung capacity, he has returned to his life and passion for training hospital therapy dogs, even preparing to train a new puppy named "Encore."</p>

          <p>Sources indicate that Washington and Beijing are actively working to arrange a visit to China for U.S. President Donald Trump, potentially in October or November. While a previously rumored September visit for a WWII commemoration is off the table, officials from both nations are said to share a consensus on the trip. The potential visit could occur either before or after the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit in South Korea. This diplomatic effort follows a recent meeting between the two countries' top diplomats, which was described as positive and a crucial step for any leader-level engagement.</p>

          <p>After her partner was captured fighting for Russia in Ukraine, Irina Krynina left her life in Siberia and traveled to Kyiv to find him. Disappointed by his changed demeanor and their subsequent separation, she remained in Ukraine and founded "Our Way Out," a project that helps relatives of Russian POWs make contact. She visits camps, records interviews, and facilitates calls, providing proof of life that is often hard to obtain from the Russian government. Despite facing mixed reactions, Krynina continues her work, believing it helps show Russians the reality of the war and facilitates prisoner exchanges.</p>

          <p>China has released a global action plan for artificial intelligence, emphasizing international cooperation just days after the U.S. announced its own AI strategy. Premier Li Qiang proposed a global AI cooperation organization, signaling China's intent to lead a multilateral approach, particularly with nations in the Global South. This move sharpens the tech race between the two economic superpowers, with analysts suggesting the formation of two distinct camps. The development comes as China continues to build its domestic AI capabilities despite U.S. restrictions on advanced semiconductor access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, "Swag," and its hit single "Daisies" are being hailed as the unlikely "song of the summer," filling a void in a music landscape dominated by stale tracks. The album departs from his usual pop style, embracing a more subtle, R&B-influenced sound with muffled, aqueous production. Critics argue its downtempo, melancholic, yet intricate quality resonates with a collective cultural mood that feels more reserved and hungover than celebratory. This trend towards more subdued music reflects a broader shift, suggesting a culture grappling with widespread malaise.</p>

          <p>To combat devastating dengue fever outbreaks, Brazil is undertaking a massive public health initiative by releasing millions of specially bred mosquitoes. These "Wolbitos" are infected with Wolbachia, a naturally occurring bacteria that prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside them, thus stopping transmission to humans. A pilot program in the city of Niterói demonstrated remarkable success, reducing dengue cases by about 90% and also curbing other viruses like Zika and chikungunya. The Brazilian government is now scaling up the program, aiming to protect 140 million people over the next decade.</p>

          <p>According to Harvard conversation expert Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual interactions can significantly improve their quality. This brief mental rehearsal involves thinking about topics, questions, or goals for the chat, which can make you appear more prepared and considerate. Brooks explains that once a conversation starts, our brains are too cognitively overwhelmed with listening and responding to effectively brainstorm new topics. This simple strategy helps you remain present and steer the conversation more effectively, strengthening relationships in both personal and professional settings.</p>

          <p>In a significant political event, Taiwanese voters have rejected an unprecedented attempt to recall 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The recall campaigns were initiated by supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who were frustrated by the opposition's legislative actions, including blocking budgets and passing controversial reforms. The failure of the recall effort means President Lai Ching-te's administration will likely continue to face a challenging, divided legislature. The result is seen as a setback for the DPP's hopes of gaining a majority in the legislative body.</p>

The article notes that while Jansen came to the Angels to help them win, a trade to a contender like the Dodgers could be beneficial for all parties.

          <p>Ukraine has appointed Yulia Svyrydenko as its new prime minister, a rare move for a woman in Eastern European politics, but she is already facing sexist criticism and skepticism. Observers have dismissed her as a mere "loyalist" to President Zelensky, questioning her ability to act independently, a common critique leveled at female leaders in the region. However, Svyrydenko has an extensive resume, including negotiating major international trade and investment deals. Her appointment is part of a broader government reshuffle as Ukraine navigates the ongoing war and seeks to strengthen its economy and military.</p>
