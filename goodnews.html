The study argues that subsidies for fathers produce higher long-term fertility gains than solely subsidizing mothers. This innovative policy proposal comes as China faces a rapidly ageing population, shrinking workforce, and strained social welfare system. The study also found that traditional expectations placing the burden on women persist in China, clashing with rapid economic changes.</p>

          <p>Nutritionists are warning that intermittent fasting, a popular eating plan, may be disordered eating in disguise for some individuals. While intermittent fasting is often touted for its potential benefits, it can lead to restrictive eating and obsessive thoughts about food. Experts emphasize that individuals with a history of eating disorders or body image issues should avoid intermittent fasting. They recommend intuitive eating, which focuses on balanced meals, variety, and listening to hunger and fullness cues, as a healthier alternative.</p>
