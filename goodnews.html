          <h2>Bank of Japan to Slow Bond Purchase Cuts Amid Growth Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 00:43:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of Japan announced it would reduce the pace of government bond purchase cuts starting in April of next year, while maintaining the benchmark interest rate at 0.5%. This decision aligns with economists' expectations, as the central bank aims to improve the functioning of the JGB markets to support stability. The BOJ will decrease its monthly purchases of Japanese government bonds by approximately 400 billion yen per quarter until March 2026, followed by a slower reduction of 200 billion yen per quarter from April 2026 to March 2027. Japan's economy faces growth uncertainty, with inflation running above the BOJ's target for about three years, prompting the bank to monitor underlying inflation closely. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gold has emerged as the premier safe haven asset, with spot prices increasing by 30% in 2025, outperforming traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys. Experts at the Asia Pacific Precious Metals Conference attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities. Concerns about fiscal sustainability and geopolitical tensions have fueled demand for gold, while confidence in U.S. assets has been compromised by volatile policymaking. Gold's value is unaffected by high debt-to-GDP ratios impacting other currencies, making it a large, liquid, and apolitical market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Starmer secured a tariffs agreement with the US, removing tariffs completely for the aerospace industry and setting a 10% levy on the car industry. This deal is expected to prevent significant job losses in the UK, particularly in the West Midlands, where Jaguar Land Rover's plant is located. While Britain is exempt from the global tariff of 50% on steel and aluminium, a 25% tariff remains due to technicalities in proving the steel's origin. The deal also includes reciprocal access for 13,000 metric tonnes of beef being sold each way, ensuring no changes to the UK's food safety standards.</p>

          <p>Shares in South Korea's SK Hynix surged to a more than two-decade high following reports that SK Group plans to build the country's largest AI data center in partnership with Amazon Web Services. SK Hynix shares have risen nearly 50% this year due to the AI boom, as the company is a leading supplier of dynamic random access memory (DRAM). SK Telecom and SK Broadband are reportedly leading the initiative, with support from other affiliates, including SK Hynix. Samsung, a rival DRAM producer, also saw growth.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani made his long-awaited pitching debut for the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking his return to the mound after undergoing Tommy John surgery in September 2023. He pitched one inning, allowing one run on two hits, while also continuing to serve as the team's leadoff hitter. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts expressed his excitement about Ohtani's return, noting the significance of the two-way star's ability to both pitch and hit. The Dodgers plan to ease Ohtani back into a regular pitching routine, with the possibility of him serving as an opener once per week.</p>

          <h2>MPs to Vote on Decriminalizing Abortion; Potential Law Changes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 22:30:54 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Members of Parliament (MPs) are scheduled to vote on a law change aimed at decriminalizing abortion. Two Labour MPs have proposed amendments to the Crime and Policing Bill, which could be debated and voted on in the House of Commons. The current law in England and Wales deems abortion illegal but allows it up to 24 weeks of pregnancy under certain circumstances, requiring approval from two doctors. One amendment seeks to prevent women from being investigated or prosecuted for terminating their own pregnancies, while maintaining punishments for medical professionals and violent partners.</p>
