          <h2>Chinese Scientists Discover Longevity Protein in Naked Mole-Rats</h2>

          <p>Chinese scientists have made a significant breakthrough, discovering a specific version of a DNA repair protein in naked mole-rats that is strongly linked to their remarkable longevity and disease resistance. This protein, also found in humans, provides a crucial molecular basis for understanding how DNA repair mechanisms are activated, contributing to the mole-rats' extraordinary maximum lifespan of around 37 years, which is highly unusual for a mammal of their size. Published in the journal Science, this research suggests that the unique biological adaptations of naked mole-rats could inspire novel therapeutic anti-aging strategies aimed at improving human health and extending lifespan. The findings offer promising avenues for future scientific exploration into the mechanisms of aging.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets opened higher, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index up over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 rising almost 3% to a record high, despite China's GDP growing 4.8% in the third quarter, a figure that met expectations but indicated a slowdown. China also kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged. This market optimism was further fueled by Japan's Liberal Democratic Party and the Japan Restoration Party forming a coalition government. Investors seemed to brush off the moderate Chinese economic data, focusing instead on broader regional stability and a perceived softening in U.S.-China trade relations, which positively impacted global sentiment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British soldiers are set to receive new powers, allowing them to shoot down drones that pose a threat to military bases, a measure designed to enable faster and more decisive action. Defence Secretary John Healey will announce this "kinetic option," which will initially apply to military sites but could be extended to civilian locations such as airports. This significant policy shift follows four British airbases, utilized by US forces, reporting mystery drone sightings last year, alongside numerous drone disruptions across Europe in recent months. The new authority represents a clear escalation from existing protocols, which primarily focused on diverting or disrupting drone GPS signals.</p>

          <p>Christian McCaffrey delivered an explosive offensive performance for the San Francisco 49ers, accumulating 201 yards from scrimmage and scoring two crucial touchdowns in their 20-10 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. McCaffrey's impressive 129 rushing yards and 72 receiving yards were pivotal, helping the 49ers secure an early lead and a late-game dagger. Despite battling injuries, particularly on defense and with backup quarterback Mac Jones filling in, San Francisco improved its season record to 5-2. The Falcons' offense, led by Michael Penix Jr., struggled to find rhythm, managing only 19 first downs and failing on critical third and fourth down conversion attempts against a resilient 49ers defense.</p>

          <p>The Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Seattle Mariners 6-2, forcing a decisive Game 7 in the American League Championship Series, marking the second Game 7 in Blue Jays history. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. hit his sixth postseason home run, tying a franchise record, and rookie pitcher Trey Yesavage impressed with seven strikeouts over five and two-thirds innings. Toronto capitalized on three Mariners' errors and executed three double plays, notably two consecutive bases-loaded, inning-ending double plays, setting a postseason record. Seattle, the only big league team without a pennant, now faces its first-ever postseason Game 7, with the winner advancing to the World Series.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen, after securing victories in both the sprint and grand prix at the United States Grand Prix, confidently stated that winning his fifth world championship is now a "real possibility." His recent remarkable form has seen him close a 104-point deficit after the Dutch Grand Prix to just 40 points behind Oscar Piastri in only four races. Verstappen attributes this to a better understanding of the car and effective upgrades. McLaren, while facing increased pressure, remains encouraged by their car's competitive pace, especially after Lando Norris's strong performance in Austin. With five races remaining, the championship battle is intensifying, fueling Verstappen's "positive pressure" drive.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, signaling the end of two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule. Paz, the son of a former president, campaigned on promises to stabilize Bolivia's economy, which is grappling with its worst crisis in decades due to a US dollar shortage and 23% inflation. Both Paz and his conservative rival, Jorge Quiroga, pledged to attract foreign investment and fix the exchange rate, though Paz aims to avoid IMF assistance by tackling corruption and the black market. His victory represents a significant geopolitical shift, potentially strengthening ties with the United States.</p>

          <p>Thirteen individuals were arrested during a Friday night operation in West Hollywood's Rainbow District, sparking initial concerns about a possible ICE raid due to the presence of unmarked vehicles and recent immigration enforcement. However, Los Angeles County Sheriff officials quickly clarified that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents were not involved in the arrests. The operation, which took place near popular venues like The Abbey, was conducted by local law enforcement in response to multiple reports of pickpocketing, drug sales, and other criminal activity in the area. The sheriff's department did not immediately detail the specific charges related to the arrests, but confirmed it was a local crime-fighting initiative.</p>

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder and chief scientist of Chinese LiDAR maker RoboSense, has criticized Elon Musk's vision-only approach to self-driving technology, advocating for a safer multi-sensor system. Qiu argues that Level 3 or 4 driving automation cannot be reliably achieved without incorporating sensors like LiDAR, which uses laser beams to map environments. He highlights "corner cases" where vision-only systems struggle, such as distinguishing a white car from a cloud or a black car in a tunnel. Despite Musk's long-standing dismissal of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," Qiu points out that its cost has dramatically fallen, and other industry leaders, including Ford's CEO, consider it "mission critical."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is transforming decommissioned Confederate monuments, including a massive statue of General Robert E. Lee, into a provocative art exhibit titled "Monuments." Curated by Hamza Walker, the exhibit aims to directly confront the "Lost Cause" ideology and promote a more accurate understanding of Civil War history, emphasizing the figures' fight for slavery and white supremacy. Pieces like Kara Walker's "Unmanned Drone," which reinterprets Stonewall Jackson as a "haint," challenge traditional glorifications. Coming amidst calls by former President Trump to reinstall such statues, the exhibit uses art to spark critical dialogue about American history, its contested symbols, and their ongoing societal impact, with some melted bronze to be transformed further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Career experts are recommending a simple yet powerful linguistic shift to help individuals establish firmer boundaries at work: replacing "I can't" with "I don't." Helen Tupper, co-founder of Squiggly Careers, explains that "I can't" invites negotiation, while "I don't" is a more definitive statement that is harder to challenge, such as "I don't go to meetings after 5pm on a Wednesday." This practical advice is crucial, as recent research indicates nine out of ten workers have experienced high or extreme levels of pressure or stress in the past year, with many reaching breaking point. The article emphasizes adjusting goals to current capacity and maintaining firm routines to prevent burnout.</p>

Kaiser Permanente welcomed back approximately 30,000 employees, confirming that its facilities maintained operations with physicians, experienced managers, and nearly 6,000 contracted staff during the five-day stoppage.

          <p>Millions across India are joyously celebrating Diwali, the vibrant festival of lights, one of Hinduism's most significant and widely observed festivals. While lamps and firecrackers illuminate homes and streets, they unfortunately exacerbate air pollution, a particularly acute problem in northern India during winter months. This year, the Supreme Court allowed "green crackers" in Delhi, which purportedly emit 20-30% less pollution, though their actual environmental benefit remains debated. Beyond the fireworks, Diwali traditions include extensive home cleaning and decoration, shopping for new clothes, sharing traditional sweets, and worshipping Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. The festival's widespread appeal boosts the economy and fosters community spirit.</p>

Originally seen as a "doomsday vault," the collection is now actively used for environmental restoration projects worldwide, including re-establishing chalk grasslands and aiding recovery after Australian wildfires.

          <p>The global secondhand luxury market is experiencing a significant boom, expanding at an annual rate three times faster than the firsthand market and projected to reach $360 billion by 2030. As this market soars, robust authentication has emerged as the new "gold standard," crucial for combating increasingly sophisticated "superfakes" that even luxury brands sometimes fail to detect. Resale platforms like Singapore-based Carousell and South Korea's Bunjang are investing heavily in verification, employing brick-and-mortar stores, proprietary databases, and AI-trained systems to ensure product authenticity and build consumer trust. This stringent verification process is driving sales, as affordability and access to rare or discontinued items attract a new generation of luxury consumers.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that X and xAI's antitrust lawsuit against Apple and OpenAI will remain in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, despite the companies having "at best minimal connections" to that geographic area. Judge Mark Pittman, who has previously criticized the practice of forum-shopping, ironically encouraged the companies to relocate their headquarters to Fort Worth, even providing a city website link. This decision is significant given the tendency of some plaintiffs, including those associated with Elon Musk's companies, to file lawsuits in this specific division, often linked to Republican-appointed judges.

Historically, plans like Deng Xiaoping's "Reform and Opening Up" (1981-84) transformed China into an economic powerhouse, leading to the "China shock" of outsourced Western manufacturing jobs. Later, the "Strategic emerging industries" plan (2011-15) propelled China to global leadership in green technology, such as EVs and solar panels, and a near monopoly on critical rare earth supply chains. More recently, "High quality development" (2021-2025) focuses on technological self-reliance, challenging American dominance and sparking diplomatic disputes over tech bans.</p>
