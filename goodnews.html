          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral candidate at Tufts University, returned to Massachusetts after being detained by ICE for six weeks. A federal judge ordered her release after determining her due process and First Amendment rights were likely violated. Ozturk was detained after co-authoring an op-ed critical of Israel's war with Hamas, which the Trump administration cited as the primary reason for revoking her student visa. Leaders in Massachusetts celebrated her release, emphasizing that her detention was an attempt to silence dissent, and Tufts University expressed eagerness to welcome her back to campus.</p>

          <p>Starbucks and Luckin Coffee are regaining momentum in China by focusing on lower-tier cities amidst sluggish consumption and intense price competition. Starbucks' China operations reported flat same-store sales but saw a 4% increase in transactions, offsetting a decline in average tab. The company has expanded to over 1,000 county-level markets in China, adding 665 stores in the past year. This strategy reflects an effort to defend market share as competition persists, though the long-term sustainability beyond wealthier cities remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Chinese consumers are increasingly buying local brands as an emotional and cultural act reflecting national pride and resilience amid rising global protectionism. This trend is particularly pronounced among younger generations who view domestic brands as markers of cultural identity and creative ambition. Market data shows a surge in preference for domestic brands, especially in technology, fashion, and consumer goods, driven by a desire to celebrate Chinese innovation on the global stage. This shift underscores China's evolution towards a domestically driven consumption economy.</p>

          <p>The Southeastern United States is preparing for an unusual atmospheric river event, expected to bring widespread rainfall and potential flooding. The National Weather Service forecasts 4 to 6 inches of rain across Florida, Tennessee, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, with isolated areas possibly receiving up to 12 inches. While atmospheric rivers typically impact the Western U.S., this event is caused by a cutoff low diverting a jet stream from the Gulf of Mexico. The precipitation could alleviate recent drought conditions in some areas, but residents are advised to take precautions against potential flooding.</p>

          <p>Experts suggest that winning Eurovision involves a combination of factors, including a song with themes of self-assertion, simple yet effective staging, and a minor key to signal emotional depth. Surprise twists, like costume changes or key changes, can also make a song more memorable and catchy. Conchita Wurst's 2014 victory showed that quirky acts embracing the LGBT community are favored by Eurovision fans, but vocal talent is also essential for success.</p>
