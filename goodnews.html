        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Poland is preparing for a presidential election that could significantly impact the pro-European, center-left government's reform plans. President Andrzej Duda, a national-conservative, has been blocking the government's initiatives, leading to public disappointment. The election pits Rafal Trzaskowski, backed by the government, against Karol Nawrocki, supported by the opposition PiS party. The outcome will determine whether the government can advance its agenda, including restoring the rule of law and liberalizing abortion legislation, or remain in a stalemate, as the article points out that Tusk is likely to be on tenterhooks until the very last vote is counted.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner is focused on winning the FA Cup final against Manchester City, which would be the club's first major trophy. A win would also secure European qualification for Palace. Glasner has significantly improved the team's performance since taking over, achieving the highest points-per-game record of any Palace manager in the Premier League era, as the article points out that the team is really settled in mid-table and looking at the teams in front of us more than looking at the teams who are behind us.</p>
