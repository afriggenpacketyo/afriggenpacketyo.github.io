          <p>Soaring home prices, which have increased over 50% since 2020, are compelling a growing number of Americans to purchase property with friends or relatives. This trend, known as co-buying, allows individuals to pool their financial resources to overcome significant affordability challenges, particularly for single buyers who face a major disadvantage in the market. While co-buying offers a pathway to homeownership, it also presents unique legal and financial complexities that differ from traditional spousal purchases. Experts advise creating detailed legal agreements to navigate potential future disagreements, such as property division or selling the home.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has asserted that China's semiconductor industry is "nanoseconds behind" the United States, emphasizing the need for American tech companies to compete directly in the Chinese market. Speaking on a podcast, Huang highlighted China's rapid progress, deep talent pool, and entrepreneurial culture as reasons why the U.S. cannot afford to be complacent. He argued that allowing American firms to compete globally, including in China, is crucial for maximizing U.S. economic success and geopolitical influence. Huang expressed his hope that Beijing will maintain an open market, suggesting it is in China's best interest to foster foreign investment and competition.</p>

Gomez confirmed the marriage by sharing photos on Instagram with the caption "9.27.26," showcasing her white halter-neck wedding gown. The event was attended by approximately 170 guests, including notable figures like Taylor Swift, Paul Rudd, and Gomez's co-stars Steve Martin and Martin Short. The couple, who have collaborated on several music projects, became engaged in late 2024 after dating for about a year.</p>

          <p>Swiss citizens are voting for a second time on the introduction of a national electronic identity (e-ID) system, following a rejection of a similar proposal in 2021 due to data privacy concerns. The revised plan addresses previous objections by ensuring the system is entirely optional and state-run, with data stored on users' smartphones rather than in a central database. Supporters argue the e-ID will streamline a wide range of bureaucratic and commercial transactions online, from signing contracts to age verification. Despite Switzerland's strong tradition of privacy protection, recent polls suggest voters may be more receptive this time, partly due to positive experiences with the government's Covid ID during the pandemic.</p>

          <p>A neck injury to European golfer Viktor Hovland could bring the Ryder Cup's rarely used "envelope rule" into play on the final day of the competition. Hovland, who withdrew from the Saturday afternoon fourballs, is scheduled for the last singles match, and his potential absence would trigger the rule. Before the singles matches begin, each team captain secretly places the name of one player in a sealed envelope. If an opponent withdraws due to injury, the player in the envelope also sits out, and the match is declared a half-point tie, ensuring the team with the injured player is not unfairly penalized.</p>

          <p>The southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen, known for its hot and humid climate, is set to become an unlikely skiing destination with the opening of the world's largest indoor ski resort. The new facility, Qianhai Huafa Snow World, is scheduled to open just before the country's "golden week" national holiday, aiming to capitalize on the growing domestic interest in winter sports. The 10-hectare resort will feature five different ski slopes, including one with a significant 83-meter vertical drop. This development reflects a broader effort by Chinese authorities to stimulate the winter sports economy and boost consumer spending.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Citizens of Zurich, Switzerland's largest city, are voting in a referendum on a proposal to severely restrict the use of leaf blowers and leaf vacuums to combat noise and air pollution. If the measure passes, all gas-powered devices would be completely banned within the city. The use of electric models would be permitted, but only for a limited three-month period from October to December, with special permissions required at other times. Supporters of the ban highlight the environmental and health benefits, while opponents argue it represents an unnecessary and "anti-social culture of prohibition" that would complicate maintenance work.</p>

          <p>Britain's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. A taskforce has identified Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites from a list of twelve potential locations. The party aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, with these new towns collectively expected to deliver up to 300,000 homes in the coming decades. The plan draws inspiration from the post-WWII new towns program, utilizing development corporations with special planning powers to accelerate construction.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump's proposal to significantly increase H-1B visa application fees could inadvertently benefit Middle Eastern countries, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, in the global competition for tech talent. As Gulf nations invest billions to become global AI hubs, they are offering attractive compensation packages, a tax-friendly environment, and long-term "golden visas" to skilled professionals. This business-friendly approach contrasts with the increasing restrictions and uncertain immigration policies in the U.S. and U.K. Analysts suggest that the Gulf region's combination of ambitious large-scale projects and welcoming policies could make it a prime destination for top tech experts.

          <p>Despite having a physically imposing team, Newcastle United has been struggling to convert set-piece opportunities into goals this season, an issue manager Eddie Howe has taken responsibility for. The team, which includes several players over 6-foot-6, has shown a tactical shift towards using long throws but has only scored once from a corner or free-kick in all competitions. This contrasts sharply with their upcoming opponent, Arsenal, who leads the Premier League in expected goals from dead-ball situations and has scored half of their league goals from them. The article analyzes Newcastle's challenge in making their height and specialized coaching translate into a consistent threat on the field.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece critiques recent claims from the Trump administration about autism, reframing autistic traits as valuable qualities that stand in stark contrast to the former president's character. The author argues that traits often associated with autism, such as an intense capacity for focus, adherence to facts, a strong sense of social justice, and difficulty with dishonesty, are qualities from which a leader like Trump could learn. The article highlights the deep empathy and joy many autistic people experience, pushing back against the narrative of autism as a tragedy. It concludes that love and human connection are the ultimate measures of a person, not the neurotypical standards often promoted by politicians.</p>

          <p>As the regular season concludes, the Los Angeles Dodgers are finalizing their wild-card roster, with major questions surrounding player health and the composition of the pitching staff. Key players like Max Muncy and Will Smith are dealing with injuries, leaving their availability for the postseason opener in doubt. Manager Dave Roberts also has several decisions to make for the bullpen, balancing a surplus of left-handed relievers with a need for more right-handed options. The team is considering various strategies, including potentially using starter Tyler Glasnow in relief, as they prepare for the best-of-three wild-card series.</p>

          <p>The town of Rock Springs, Wyoming, is taking new steps to acknowledge a dark chapter in its history by unveiling a prominent monument commemorating the 1885 anti-Chinese massacre. The violent event saw a mob of white miners burn down the local Chinatown and kill 28 Chinese laborers amid labor tensions. The new seven-foot-tall bronze statue, "Requiem," was dedicated on the 140th anniversary of the massacre and stands in stark contrast to the previously small and overlooked plaque. This public reckoning with its anti-immigrant past comes as archaeologists simultaneously excavate the site of the original Chinatown to uncover artifacts from the period.</p>
