          <p>A recent CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that about two-thirds of Americans are in favor of the U.S. space program returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The survey also found that a large majority still view the 1969 moon landing as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. These positive views on space exploration are consistent across different political and ideological groups.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese companies like DeepSeek and Alibaba are disrupting the global AI landscape by releasing powerful, open-source large language models (LLMs). Unlike the closed, proprietary systems from U.S. giants like OpenAI and Google, these free-to-use models are fostering a collaborative development environment and gaining support from developers worldwide. This open-source movement is not only accelerating AI applications within China but also presenting a significant competitive challenge to American dominance in the field. Analysts suggest this new wave of open-source AI could be more impactful than previous efforts in other software domains.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that ten more hostages held in Gaza are expected to be released "very shortly" as his administration continues to push for a 60-day ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The proposed truce includes the return of these ten living hostages and the remains of eighteen others in exchange for the release of an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners. The announcement follows recent indirect talks mediated by Qatar and a visit to Washington by Israel's Mossad chief. Trump has been actively promoting his role in brokering a potential ceasefire deal in the region.</p>

          <p>The Australian government announced it has delivered a shipment of M1A1 Abrams tanks to Ukraine to aid in its defense against the ongoing Russian invasion. The tanks are part of a larger A$245 million military aid package, with most of the 49 promised tanks having already arrived in Ukraine. As one of the largest non-NATO contributors, Australia has provided over A$1.5 billion in total assistance to Ukraine since the conflict began. The move reinforces Australia's position of labeling Russia as the aggressor and supporting a resolution to the war on Kyiv's terms.</p>

          <p>Scott Harrison, a retired Marine, found solace during the Vietnam War by imagining a carousel in a mountain meadow, a vision that helped him endure the conflict's brutality. After struggling with PTSD for years, he decided to make that vision a reality to help himself heal. In 1986, he brought a broken-down carousel to Nederland, Colorado, and spent 26 years carving new animals for it. The "Carousel of Happiness" opened in 2010 and has since brought joy to over a million people, providing Harrison with a profound sense of purpose and healing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major regulatory framework for cryptocurrency in the United States. The bipartisan legislation focuses on the $250 billion stablecoin market, creating consumer protections and clear rules for issuing these digital currencies, which are pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar. The act allows banks and other financial institutions to issue their own stablecoins, a move hailed by the administration as a way to strengthen the dollar and upgrade the financial system for the 21st century. The law is seen as a major step toward integrating digital currencies into the mainstream financial system. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An adviser for the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has stated that the global financial system must adapt its rules to address the rise of tokenization and stablecoins. Shin Hyun-Song, a BIS economic adviser, warned that these digital currencies pose new challenges for anti-money-laundering efforts and cross-border payment systems due to their pseudonymous nature. The call for updated regulations comes amid increased market interest in stablecoins, fueled by the Trump administration's embrace of private digital currencies and a recent surge in bitcoin's value.

          <p>Following a directive from President Trump, the Department of Justice has formally filed a motion in court to unseal grand jury transcripts related to the federal investigations into Jeffrey Epstein. The move comes after significant public and political pressure for more transparency, which intensified after the DOJ initially stated no further files would be released. In its filing, the department cited "extensive public interest" and the administration's commitment to transparency as the reason for the request. A judge will ultimately decide whether to release the records, which would be redacted to protect victim identities.</p>

Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index funds and other portfolio managers must purchase shares to rebalance their holdings. Despite being down for the year, Block's market capitalization of around $45 billion places it well above the median for companies in the benchmark index. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has been diagnosed with chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), a common condition affecting blood flow in the veins, after experiencing mild swelling in his lower legs. The White House physician, Dr. Sean Barbabella, described the condition as "benign and common" for individuals over 70 and confirmed that tests ruled out more serious issues like blood clots. CVI occurs when valves in leg veins weaken, causing blood to pool, which can lead to swelling and discomfort. Treatment typically involves lifestyle changes like exercise, elevation, and compression stockings, with the doctor stating the president remains in "excellent health."</p>

          <p>The "California Forever" project, a controversial plan by Silicon Valley billionaires to build a new city in Solano County, has announced its intention to create a 2,100-acre manufacturing hub within the development. Dubbed the "Solano Foundry," the site aims to attract companies in defense, aerospace, robotics, and other frontier technologies, with the goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the state. The project's CEO, Jan Sramek, pitched the plan as a way to restore the "designed in California, made in California" model.

          <p>Pest control experts and entomologists in the UK report that this summer is shaping up to be a "good year for wasps," with increased sightings and larger nests appearing early in the season. The trend is likely linked to the very warm and dry spring weather, which provides ideal breeding conditions for the insects. While many people dislike wasps, experts emphasize their crucial role in the ecosystem as apex predators and natural pest controllers. To coexist peacefully, they advise staying calm, not swatting at them, and distracting them with a small amount of a sugary substance placed away from picnic areas.</p>

          <p>A new stage show in Liverpool, "The Legend of Rooney's Ring," reimagines the lives of football star Wayne Rooney and his wife Coleen as a fantasy saga inspired by "The Lord of the Rings." Written by Helen Serafinowicz, a co-creator of the sitcom "Motherland," the musical comedy is loosely based on a tabloid myth about Coleen throwing away her engagement ring. The writer stresses the show is an affectionate homage rather than a malicious satire, celebrating the couple as heroic figures who have overcome public battles. The play is part of the Royal Court theatre's strategy of staging original, locally relevant comedies.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a specific interaction between a gut bacteria molecule and a genetic variant that can trigger the inflammatory response seen in ulcerative colitis. The study found that in people with a faulty version of the OTUD3 gene, the immune system overreacts to a substance produced by certain gut bacteria, leading to chronic inflammation. This finding helps explain why the disease varies so much between patients and why treatments can be inconsistent. The discovery could pave the way for more precise, personalized therapies that target this specific inflammatory pathway rather than suppressing the entire immune system.</p>
