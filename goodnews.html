          <p>Researchers have presented new evidence suggesting rocks from the Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt in Quebec, Canada, are 4.16 billion years old, potentially making them the oldest on Earth. This finding, published in the journal Science, utilized multiple dating techniques that yielded consistent results, aiming to settle a long-standing scientific dispute over the rocks' age. The discovery could provide crucial insights into Earth's early formation and the origins of life, though the local Inuit community has restricted access to the site to prevent damage and exploitation.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reportedly agreed on a framework for a trade deal, aimed at de-escalating economic tensions between the two nations. While President Trump announced a signed deal, officials later clarified it as a framework to implement a previous agreement, focusing on issues like U.S. access to rare earth minerals and China's efforts to curb fentanyl precursor chemicals. This development follows months of negotiations and tariff threats that have impacted both economies, with the goal of stabilizing trade relations and addressing key points of contention.

The legislation includes funding for the border and a provision to eliminate taxes on tips, fulfilling several of his key campaign promises. The White House is pushing for a swift vote despite a setback in the Senate, where a Medicaid provision was rejected by the parliamentarian.

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery manufacturer and a key supplier to Tesla, is aggressively expanding its global operations.

          <p>A coalition of sports and entertainment figures, including Mike Tyson and Kevin Durant, has sent a letter to the White House calling on President Trump to implement federal cannabis reform. The group's requests focus on three key areas: granting clemency for nonviolent marijuana offenses, reclassifying marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, and ending discriminatory banking practices against legal cannabis businesses. The letter criticizes the previous administration for a lack of action and argues that current policies are outdated, economically harmful, and create unjust barriers for businesses and individuals.</p>

This climbdown occurred after the government faced a potential defeat in Parliament, with rebel MPs expressing satisfaction with the compromise, though some still intend to vote against the bill.

In contrast, less wealthy affluent buyers are more sensitive to high interest rates and are acting with more caution. According to a Coldwell Banker survey of luxury agents, over half have seen an increase in cash purchases in 2025, driven by a desire to avoid high borrowing costs. While real estate remains an attractive hard asset, the market saw a dip in May, and buyers at all levels have become more discerning. (not investment advice)</p>
