          <p>German authorities are set to unveil a memorial plaque for a police officer who tragically died following a knife attack in Mannheim last year, marking a moment of remembrance for the community. In other news, Germany witnessed a record number of naturalizations in 2024, spurred by the implementation of a new citizenship reform aimed at streamlining the process. Simultaneously, the country's interior minister is actively seeking an EU-wide agreement to facilitate the return of rejected asylum seekers to designated third countries. This multifaceted approach underscores Germany's efforts to balance immigration policies with security concerns and integration initiatives.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government began releasing stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers, offering consumers cheaper alternatives amidst soaring rice prices. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. were the first to sell the rice, pricing a 5-kilogram bag at 2,160 yen ($15), including tax. At an Ito-Yokado store in Tokyo's Ota Ward, 500 bags sold out in just 30 minutes, highlighting the high demand for affordable rice. This effort aims to alleviate financial strain on households and stabilize the market by distributing 300,000 tons of rice from 2021 and 2022.</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss this weekend's games against the New York Yankees after fracturing his toe at home, though the team hopes to avoid placing him on the injured list. Betts humorously explained that he sustained the injury by hitting his toe on a wall while walking to the bathroom in the dark. Despite the injury, both Betts and manager Dave Roberts are optimistic about a quick recovery, anticipating his return within a few days based on his pain tolerance. In Betts' absence, Miguel Rojas will take over at shortstop, with Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim also being considered as options.</p>
