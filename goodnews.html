Promoting his new memoir, Kennedy reflected on his tenure as a crucial swing vote on divisive issues like abortion rights and same-sex marriage. He emphasized the importance of civility in public discourse, warning that its absence puts democracy in danger, and noted that the court's recent reversal of some of his key decisions is a relatively infrequent occurrence.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance has confirmed that Hamas is holding 20 living hostages, with their release anticipated in the next 24 hours as part of a ceasefire agreement. President Trump is scheduled to travel to Israel and Egypt to mark the occasion and meet with the families of those being released. While U.S. Central Command is establishing a coordination center in Israel, Vance clarified that the approximately 200 troops being sent are specialists already stationed in the region and are intended to monitor the peace, not to enter Gaza.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning director Kathryn Bigelow's latest film, "A House of Dynamite," presents a harrowing, authentic depiction of a nuclear crisis scenario. The movie follows the U.S. government's response in the 19 minutes after a single, unidentified ballistic missile is launched toward the country, forcing the president to make an impossible decision. Bigelow and screenwriter Noah Oppenheim utilized military consultants, including a retired general, to ensure the film's realism in portraying the protocols and immense pressure involved in defending against a nuclear attack, aiming to remind audiences of the persistent threat.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships outlines seven toxic habits that can prevent children from developing mental strength. These behaviors include rescuing kids from every struggle, modeling perfection, silencing their emotions, and making them feel responsible for their parents' feelings. The article advocates for allowing children to face age-appropriate challenges, modeling accountability for mistakes, and validating their emotions to build resilience, self-trust, and the ability to rebound from setbacks. This approach helps them learn that their worth is not dependent on constant achievement.</p>

Gong emphasized that foreign-funded manufacturers will receive equal treatment in government procurement and will be supported in their efforts to participate in building local supply chains, reinforcing Shanghai's commitment to being an open market.

          <p>This advice column addresses the dilemma of enjoying the Harry Potter universe while disagreeing with author J.K. Rowling's anti-trans views. The author argues that it is possible to separate the art from the artist, noting that the books' core message of rejecting supremacy and discrimination has positively influenced a generation. Rather than simply boycotting or offsetting purchases with donations, the article suggests fans should actively and critically interrogate the problematic elements within the canon, similar to how religious communities reinterpret flawed sacred texts, to generate positive social value.</p>

          <p>Scotland's First Minister, John Swinney, has argued that the precedent set in 2011, when the SNP's majority win at Holyrood led to the 2014 independence referendum, should apply again if his party secures a majority in the next election. Despite UK Labour leader Keir Starmer's opposition to another poll, Swinney claims he is in a "much stronger position" to negotiate a mandate based on this historical example. The UK's Scottish Secretary, Douglas Alexander, dismissed the strategy as a diversion from the SNP's record on public services.</p>
