          <p>Oghenochuko Ojiri, an art expert featured on the BBC's Bargain Hunt, has pleaded guilty to eight counts of failing to report high-value art sales to Nazem Ahmad, who was sanctioned by the US in 2019 for allegedly financing Hezbollah. The offenses occurred between October 2020 and December 2021, during which Ojiri sold artwork worth ¬£140,000 to Ahmad. Despite reading news reports about Ahmad's sanctions and discussing them with others, Ojiri did not notify the authorities, a violation of the Terrorism Act 2000. Ojiri has been granted bail but must surrender his passport and will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on June 6.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has ruled out reducing the consumption tax rate to alleviate the impact of inflation and U.S. tariffs, despite growing calls from the opposition and some ruling party lawmakers. Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi stated that cutting the consumption tax, a crucial revenue source for Japan, would be inappropriate. This decision comes as Japan faces economic challenges from U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs and rising inflation. The government plans to address these issues through other economic measures, while opposition parties advocate for a temporary removal of the consumption tax on food items.</p>

          <p>Amidst rising tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Keen, a U.S.-based footwear company, has pledged not to increase its prices for consumers. The company has been proactively diversifying its supply chain for over a decade to mitigate the risks associated with over-reliance on any single country. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in Cambodia, India, and Vietnam, allowing it to spread costs and avoid significant tariff impacts. While other retailers plan to pass tariff costs onto consumers, Keen is absorbing these costs through shared responsibility with its partners.</p>

          <p>This article argues that attempting to time the stock market based on political events and trade policies, such as those of President Donald Trump, is a risky and often unsuccessful endeavor. The market's rapid fluctuations following the election, hitting a record high, then sinking, and subsequently rebounding, demonstrate the difficulty in predicting market movements. The article highlights the importance of disciplined investing rather than making sweeping portfolio changes based on news headlines. The author advises against trying to sell at the high or buy at the low, as it requires being right twice, which is nearly impossible.</p>

Discussions on pharmaceuticals are ongoing, with the US seeking preferential treatment. The agreement does not affect the UK's digital services tax, which remains a point of contention.
