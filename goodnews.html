        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Negotiations between the U.S. and China over TikTok's ownership are increasingly focused on the app's powerful recommendation algorithm, a piece of technology China has been reluctant to sell. A potential deal could involve a licensing agreement, allowing a new U.S.-based entity to use the algorithm's technology under specific terms rather than owning it outright. This arrangement aims to address U.S. national security concerns about data access by TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, while allowing the app to continue operating in its largest market.</p>

          <p>Rapper Cardi B has released her highly anticipated sophomore album, "Am I The Drama?," her first full-length project since her 2018 debut. The album features candid lyrics addressing her recent divorce from rapper Offset and her ongoing public feud with fellow artist Bia. Critics have largely praised the record for its raw honesty and energetic delivery, though some have noted its extensive 23-track length. The release marks a significant return to music for the artist after several years of focusing on family and other ventures.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed President Donald Trump's $15 billion defamation lawsuit against The New York Times and publisher Penguin Random House. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday struck down the complaint, criticizing it as "decidedly improper and impermissible." The judge stated that a legal complaint should not serve as a "megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration." The president's legal team has been given 28 days to refile the lawsuit with appropriate revisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the monthly cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable for homeowners. With HELOCs having variable rates, they adjust quickly to changes in the Fed's policy, making them cheaper than fixed-rate home equity loans or credit cards. For a $50,000 HELOC, the monthly payment on a 10-year term has dropped to approximately $608, down from over $640 before the cut, offering homeowners a less expensive way to tap into their home equity.

          <p>A UK cabinet minister has dismissed President Donald Trump's suggestion that the British military should be used to address illegal migration across the English Channel. Trade Secretary Peter Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is the appropriate agency for policing borders and that the military's focus should remain on national defense. The comments came after Trump, during a state visit, advocated for using military force as a deterrent, contrasting it with the current UK government's strategy of diplomatic return agreements with countries like France.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran has stated that he did not discuss his vote on interest rates with President Trump ahead of the Federal Open Market Committee meeting. Miran, who voted for a larger rate cut than the one approved, affirmed his decision was made independently, despite concerns about the Fed's autonomy under political pressure from the White House. He explained that a call from the president was purely congratulatory and did not involve any attempt to influence monetary policy, seeking to quell speculation about his impartiality.

          <p>Following a recent drop to a three-year low, mortgage rates could fall further by the end of 2025 if the Federal Reserve continues its rate-cutting campaign. Market analysts predict at least one more quarter-point cut, which, combined with easing inflation, could push the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate into the high 5% range. However, this forecast remains speculative, as persistent inflation or other economic headwinds could keep rates closer to their current 6% level, influencing home affordability for potential buyers and refinancers.

          <p>President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping have made significant progress toward a deal regarding TikTok's U.S. operations, though a final agreement was not reached during their recent phone call.

The discussions aim to resolve U.S. national security concerns over the app's ownership by Chinese company ByteDance, which faces a deadline to divest or be banned.</p>

          <p>A U.S. vaccine advisory panel, newly appointed by Health Secretary Robert F.

These initiatives are designed to offer energy companies more flexibility and a reliable alternative to the longer shipping routes they adopted when low water levels restricted canal transits, aiming to restore the canal's role as a critical energy gateway.</p>

Despite the crash, Leclerc noted that McLaren's pace appeared "very, very impressive" on unfinished laps, suggesting they could be strong contenders in qualifying.

Speaking at the launch of the new models, Cook stated there was "no increase for tariffs in the prices." To mitigate the impact of the trade dispute, Apple has been diversifying its supply chain, shifting some production to countries like India and Vietnam.
