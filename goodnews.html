          <p>Special Envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff stated that the ceasefire between Israel and Iran is holding and dismissed concerns that Iran could quickly resume its nuclear enrichment program. He also criticized the leak of an initial intelligence assessment of Iran's nuclear capabilities after U.S. strikes, calling it "treasonous." The assessment had concluded that the strikes did not completely destroy Iran's nuclear program but likely set it back by a few months. Witkoff assured that it's "not even conceivable" that Iran could resume its program within months. </p>

          <p>Chinese astronomers have discovered that stars nearing the end of their lives slow their spin, revealing insights into star formation. By studying thousands of stars, researchers found that stars born today spin up to 10 times faster than older stars. This increased spin causes gas clouds to break into smaller fragments, hindering the formation of massive stars. The study provides direct evidence that the Milky Way's star-forming clouds have become more turbulent over time, offering a new method to study the galaxy's evolution.</p>

These efforts focus on the futures market, with Chinese exchanges allowing qualified foreign institutional investors to trade additional futures and options contracts.

          <p>A debate has emerged regarding the use of lab-grown meat in restaurants, with discussions on its environmental benefits, ultra-processed nature, and potential for mass production. Advocates claim that cultivated meat can meet growing demand with reduced carbon emissions and land use, while critics argue that these benefits are overstated. The science involves growing animal cells in vats, with companies developing proprietary methods to create meat-like products. Singapore, the United States, and Israel have already approved the sale of cell-cultivated meat, but concerns persist about mass production and affordability. </p>
