          <p>All 31 construction workers trapped deep underground in a Los Angeles tunnel project were successfully rescued following a partial collapse. The workers, located about six miles from the entrance and 400 feet below ground, managed to navigate over debris to a tunnel boring machine before being brought to the surface. Officials, who initially feared a major tragedy, praised the workers' calm response and hailed the outcome as a victory. No major injuries were reported, and an investigation into the cause of the cave-in is underway.</p>

          <p>A new analysis by RentCafe.com identifies the best U.S. cities for renters, with Southern metropolitan areas dominating the top spots due to affordability and economic strength. McKinney, Texas, ranked number one, followed by Sarasota, Florida, and Atlanta, Georgia, based on metrics like cost of living, housing quality, and local economy. The report suggests that while Southern cities offer the best overall value, renters prioritizing quality of life might look to Northeastern cities like Stamford, Connecticut, while Western cities excel in work/life balance.

          <p>American tennis player Taylor Fritz is set to face two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in the Wimbledon semi-finals, marking a significant moment in his career. The article highlights Fritz's powerful serve and recent success on grass, but emphasizes that his improved mental resilience is the key factor in his advancement. Having overcome tough five-set matches early in the tournament, Fritz appears more composed and confident than in previous years. The match is framed as a classic clash of styles against the dynamic Alcaraz.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is experiencing its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures forecast to peak this weekend, potentially reaching 34°C (93°F). The UK Health Security Agency has issued yellow heat-health alerts for all of England, warning of potential strain on healthcare services. The Met Office defines a heatwave by sustained high temperatures, and this event follows a trend of hotter, more frequent heatwaves linked to climate change. The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has also issued an "extreme wildfire warning" due to the conditions.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency has arrested four individuals in connection with the major cyber-attacks that targeted retailers M&S and the Co-op. The suspects, aged 17 to 20, were apprehended on suspicion of offenses including blackmail and participation in organized crime.

          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling that travel demand has stabilized after a period of lower-than-expected bookings. While the full-year outlook is reduced from earlier predictions, the airline's third-quarter revenue and earnings-per-share forecast surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to jump. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while consumers are booking closer to their travel dates, premium cabin sales and revenue from its American Express partnership remain strong, helping to offset weaker demand in the main cabin.

          <p>A joint operation between Romanian police and the UK's HM Revenue & Customs (HMRC) has targeted an organized crime group suspected of stealing millions in a sophisticated tax scam. Armed raids in Bucharest resulted in thirteen arrests, while a fourteenth man was arrested in the UK. The gang allegedly used stolen personal data from UK taxpayers, obtained through phishing, to fraudulently claim tax refunds for PAYE, child benefits, and VAT. The operation highlights international cooperation in tackling complex, cross-border cybercrime.</p>

          <p>This article contrasts two recent, severe flooding events in neighboring states: one in Ruidoso, New Mexico, and the other in central Texas. While the Texas flood resulted in over 120 deaths and caught officials by surprise, the Ruidoso flood, though destructive, had a much lower death toll. Local officials and residents in Ruidoso were better prepared, having anticipated increased flood risk due to recent wildfire "burn scars" that make the ground less absorbent. The comparison underscores how community experience and proactive planning can significantly mitigate the human cost of natural disasters.</p>

          <p>After a cabinetmaker took their $8,100 deposit and closed his business, a retired Tennessee couple took creative legal action to recoup their money. Steve and Tammy Wright won a civil judgment but had to enforce it themselves. Using the business owner's vehicle information, they filed a motor vehicle lien, which allowed the sheriff's department to seize the company van and sell it at auction. The couple successfully recovered their deposit and legal fees from the auction proceeds, providing a unique example of citizen-led legal enforcement.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Nvidia briefly became the first publicly traded company to reach a market capitalization of $4 trillion, driven by intense investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. The California-based company's stock has surged as it has become the primary beneficiary of the AI boom, with major tech companies relying on its chips. This milestone has helped bolster the wider stock market, which had faced a downturn earlier in the year due to trade and tariff concerns. Nvidia's recent earnings have remained strong despite US export controls limiting chip sales to China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old Australian surfer, Darcy Deefholts, who went missing off the coast of New South Wales, has been found safe after spending a night on an uninhabited island. A major land and sea search was launched after he failed to return from a surf session. He was located the next day on North Solitary Island, about seven miles offshore. His father, who had made an emotional plea for help, called the rescue a "one in a million miracle," and Marine Rescue NSW said its crews were "jumping for joy" at the incredible outcome.</p>

          <p>South African athlete Caster Semenya has won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights, which ruled that Switzerland violated her right to a fair hearing in a 2023 case. The case concerns World Athletics regulations that restrict testosterone levels for female athletes with differences of sexual development (DSD), effectively barring Semenya from her signature 800m event. While the ruling does not overturn the athletics regulations themselves, it is a significant step in her long legal fight and could lead to the case being reheard by Switzerland's supreme court.</p>
