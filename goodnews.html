        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article outlines four strategies for borrowers to reduce their credit card debt in June 2025, given the current economic climate of high interest rates and lingering inflation. The strategies include balance transfer credit cards, which allow borrowers to transfer balances to cards with low or 0% introductory interest rates, and debt consolidation loans, which offer lower interest rates compared to credit cards. The article also suggests debt management programs for those needing expert assistance and credit card debt forgiveness for those with significant debt and financial hardships. Borrowers are encouraged to review these options and evaluate their unique situations to determine the most suitable approach. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine conducted a daring drone attack, dubbed "Spider Web," on Russian air bases, targeting nuclear-capable long-range bombers. The operation, which took 18 months to prepare, involved smuggling drones into Russia in wooden cabins on lorries. The attack reportedly damaged or destroyed several strategic bombers and A-50 military spy planes, causing significant losses for Russia, while Ukraine celebrated the operation as a historic victory.</p>

          <p>The UK government plans to invest billions to enhance its war-fighting readiness amid growing threats from nuclear powers like Russia and China. The plan includes building new nuclear-powered submarines, munitions factories, and embracing technologies like artificial intelligence. The aim is to make the British Army "10 times more lethal" and address deficiencies in weapon stockpiles and recruitment. The review expects defence spending to rise to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with potential increases to 3% to meet all goals.</p>

          <p>The article suggests opening a $10,000 long-term CD in June 2025 due to potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in July. A long-term CD can protect money against market volatility with fixed interest rates, and savers can earn hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest.
