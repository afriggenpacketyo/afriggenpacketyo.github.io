          <h2>Home Depot to Maintain Current Pricing Despite Tariff Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 08:06:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot's CFO, Richard McPhail, announced that the retailer does not plan to raise prices due to tariffs, citing its scale, supplier partnerships, and productivity. This strategy contrasts with Walmart's plan to increase prices to offset tariff costs. McPhail noted that over half of Home Depot's sales originate in the U.S., and the company has diversified its import sources to reduce reliance on China. Home Depot reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, anticipating a 2.8% increase, based on the continuation of temporarily lowered tariffs on imports from China and other countries. Despite missing first-quarter earnings expectations, Home Depot's sales estimates were higher than anticipated.</p>

          <p>Christopher Thuss, a fisherman, recently discovered the J.C. Ames, a tugboat intentionally sunk in Lake Michigan in 1923, near Manitowoc. The Wisconsin Historical Society announced the discovery, highlighting the significance of uncovering lost history. The J.C. Ames, built in 1881 for the lumber trade, was once a powerful tugboat. Maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen noted that abandoning ships was common practice then and estimates that 13 ships were abandoned in the area. The discovery is notable because Thuss's step-grandmother has a history of finding shipwrecks, and this recent find adds to the maritime history of the region.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles landlord stopped playing the children's song ‚ÄúBaby Shark‚Äù to deter homeless people from loitering outside a commercial building after receiving complaints. The landlord initially started playing the song to address concerns about homeless encampments affecting local businesses. Councilwoman Ysabel Jurado's office confirmed a meeting occurred between the landlord and LAPD. In response, the Los Angeles Mission and Styles Barber Lounge are collaborating to offer free haircuts and grooming services to unhoused individuals, aiming to address the homelessness crisis with compassion.</p>

          <p>New York Mets manager Carlos Mendoza plans to speak with Juan Soto about his effort level leaving the batter's box after Soto failed to run hard on a potential home run that hit off the Green Monster for a single. This incident follows a similar play where Soto was slow out of the box on a groundout against the Yankees. Soto defended his hustle, but Mendoza emphasized the need to run hard, especially in Fenway Park. Soto, who recently signed a 15-year, $765 million contract, has had a mixed start with the Mets, batting below his career average.</p>

          <p>Bruce Springsteen and Donald Trump are embroiled in a public feud after Springsteen criticized Trump's administration as "corrupt, incompetent and treasonous" during a concert in England. Trump responded by calling Springsteen a "dried out prune of a rocker" and suggested investigating appearances Springsteen and Beyonc√© made for Kamala Harris. Springsteen repeated his criticisms the following night, prompting Trump to reiterate his dislike for Springsteen's music and politics. The exchange highlights the ongoing cultural and political divide between the two figures, both prominent figures with roots in New Jersey.</p>

          <p>The Senate confirmed Charles Kushner, pardoned by President Trump for previous crimes, as the ambassador to France and Monaco by a vote of 51-45. Trump nominated Kushner in November, praising him as a "tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker." During his confirmation hearing, Kushner acknowledged making "very, very, very serious mistakes" but believed they made him more qualified for the position. Kushner is the father of Trump's son-in-law and former advisor, Jared Kushner.</p>

          <h2>Three-Eyed Ancient Predator Discovered in Canada</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-20 07:07:12 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have discovered a 500-million-year-old predator with three eyes, named Mosura fentoni, in Canada's Burgess Shale. The fossil species, resembling the Japanese kaiju Mothra, was about the size of an index finger with spiny claws and a circular mouth. Mosura was a member of radiodonts, an extinct group distantly related to modern moths and arthropods like spiders and crabs. Researchers said it was "unlike any living animal" and had a unique abdomen-like body region with multiple segments. Scientists suspect this adaptation could be related to a specific habitat requiring more efficient respiration.</p>
