          <p>China decreased its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds in March, falling to the third position among foreign holders with a stockpile of $765.4 billion, a decrease of $18.9 billion from February. This reduction occurred before trade tensions between China and the U.S. escalated. Britain increased its holdings by $29 billion to $779.3 billion, surpassing China as the second-largest foreign creditor to the U.S. Moody's Ratings also downgraded the U.S. government's credit rating, leading to higher yields on Treasury bonds.

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has suggested a youth mobility scheme could be part of a future agreement with the EU, potentially allowing young people to work in other countries for up to two years. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the possible scheme, describing it as "free movement through the back door." The UK already has reciprocal agreements with countries like Australia. Prior to Brexit, young people in the UK had the right to travel and study freely, without a visa, in the rest of Europe and vice versa, which this deal could be returning to.</p>

          <p>A DW Fact Check article discusses the growing use of AI chatbots for fact-checking and evaluates the reliability of their responses. Studies by the BBC and the Tow Center for Digital Journalism reveal significant shortcomings in the ability of generative AI chatbots to accurately convey news reporting, with factual errors and altered quotes being common issues. The article stresses that AI chatbots are only as good as the data they are trained on, and users should always double-check responses with other sources. AI systems should not be seen as fact-checking tools.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are holding a summit to improve their post-Brexit relationship, focusing on defense, trade, and security cooperation. While a comprehensive new deal is not expected, the summit aims to address issues created by Brexit, such as administrative hassles for farmers and the food industry. Discussions will include easing restrictions on young people living and working in each other's countries, as well as fishing rights. The goal is to present practical measures that improve existing arrangements without angering either Remainers or Brexiteers.</p>

          <p>A report from Resume Now identifies 13 careers that offer good pay, long-term stability, and are unlikely to be replaced by AI, all without requiring a college degree. These jobs typically require only a high school diploma, pay at least $50,000 a year, and represent growing fields with high-demand skills. Many of these positions necessitate significant human interaction, manual dexterity in unpredictable environments, or high levels of creativity, making them resistant to automation.</p>

          <p>This article draws parallels between President Trump's "one big, beautiful bill" and Ronald Reagan's economic policies in 1981, dubbed "Reaganomics." Both initiatives involved sweeping changes to federal fiscal policy, including tax cuts and increased military spending, enacted through budget reconciliation. Reagan's program aimed to stimulate the economy and reduce the burden of government, while Trump's efforts are focused on reshaping and redirecting the federal government. The article also notes the presence of an unelected official, Elon Musk, wielding significant power in Trump's administration, similar to David Stockman in Reagan's era.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study has traced prehistoric human migration from Asia to North and South America, finding that the first people to colonize the Americas migrated from modern-day Russia 20,000 to 30,000 years ago. The study suggests that the languages and traditions of Indigenous groups living in the Americas today can be traced back to these early settlers. The research also found that the early settlers split into groups that became isolated in different environmental settings, leading to the foundation of South America's Indigenous groups.</p>
