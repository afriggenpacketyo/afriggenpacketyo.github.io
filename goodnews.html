          <p>Doordash has announced its acquisition of SevenRooms, a restaurant booking platform, for $1.2 billion in cash, aiming to enhance its services and support financial goals. However, the company's first-quarter revenue fell short of expectations, causing shares to decline by approximately 4%. Despite the revenue miss, Doordash reported an 18% increase in total orders compared to the previous year, reaching 732 million. The company anticipates second-quarter adjusted EBITDA between $600 million and $650 million, reflecting continued strong consumer demand in its marketplaces, consistent with typical seasonal patterns.

          <p>King Charles III has unveiled his official coronation portrait, painted by Peter Kuhfeld, depicting the monarch in his regalia from the crowning ceremony two years prior. Sunlight illuminates the crown, adding a regal touch to the painting, which has received a more positive reaction than his previous portrait. Alongside the King's portrait, Queen Camilla's portrait, painted by Paul Benney, was also revealed, showcasing her in her silk coronation dress. Both artists have long-standing relationships with the royal family, with Kuhfeld having painted Charles's sons in 1986 and Benney having painted Queen Elizabeth stroking a horse in 2015.</p>

          <p>Luxury carmaker Ferrari reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profit, driven by strong demand for personalized vehicles, but cautioned that U.S. tariffs on EU cars could negatively affect earnings this year. The company posted a net profit of 412 million euros ($466.3 million) for the first three months of the year. CEO Benedetto Vigna noted that key metrics recorded double-digit growth, highlighting strong profitability from product mix and personalization demand. Ferrari warned that U.S. tariffs on EU car imports could reduce profitability percentage margins by 50 basis points.</p>

          <p>The Taiwan dollar has eased after a historic surge, weakening over 3% against the U.S. dollar, following a 9% rally over the previous two trading days. This surge was driven by exporters converting U.S. dollar reserves and life insurers hedging U.S. dollar debt, although officials deny currency talks with the U.S.. Despite the pullback, the Taiwanese dollar remains up over 8% this year against the greenback. Analysts are closely watching the Taiwanese central bank, as its apparent lack of intervention has fueled speculation that authorities are allowing a stronger currency to potentially win trade concessions from the U.S..</p>

          <p>Former Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his bid to become mayor, is proposing a plan to remove more mentally ill people from the streets of New York City to address public safety concerns. The 36-page plan includes expanding involuntary hospitalizations and requiring screenings for mandatory outpatient treatment for those discharged from public hospitals and jails. Cuomo aims to add supportive housing units and psychiatric beds, focusing on those who pose a danger to themselves or the public. Many of Cuomo's ideas align with those of Mayor Eric Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul, who have also pushed for changes to force more people into treatment.</p>

          <p>A brief outage at Newark Liberty International Airport last week caused air traffic control computer screens to go dark for approximately 60 to 90 seconds, preventing controllers from communicating with aircraft.

Following the incident, several controllers took medical leave, citing the event as traumatic. United Airlines has removed 35 round-trip flights per day to ease congestion, and flights are experiencing significant delays.</p>
