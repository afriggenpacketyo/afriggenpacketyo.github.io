          <p>The U.S. government has lifted export curbs on chip design software to China, according to a statement from American software company Synopsys. The company is now working to restore access for its Chinese customers to previously restricted products. This move follows a reported U.S. government mandate in May requiring several software firms to obtain licenses for such exports to China. The decision signals a potential de-escalation in the ongoing technology trade tensions between the two countries.</p>

Made of durable martensitic steel, it represents a significant engineering achievement for China's renewable energy sector.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hong Kong's market for initial public offerings has seen a dramatic revival, with fundraising volume surging to $14 billion in the first half of the year, a significant increase from 2024. This boom is fueled by Chinese companies seeking listings, driven by supportive policies from Beijing, a slower pace of A-share listings, and concerns about potential delistings from U.S. exchanges. High-profile listings from companies like Contemporary Amperex Technology have positioned Hong Kong to potentially become the world's top IPO destination this year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked a Trump administration executive order that suspended the ability of migrants crossing the southern border to seek asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled that the president exceeded his legal authority, stating that the executive branch cannot unilaterally create an "alternative immigration system." The judge granted a class-action certification for all individuals affected by the order but stayed his decision for 14 days to allow for a government appeal. The ruling is a significant legal blow to the administration's hardline immigration policies.</p>

Despite having a record eight finalists in the fan voting, the team fell short of matching the all-time record of five starters from a single team. The remaining five Dodger finalists were outvoted for their respective positions. The final rosters, including pitchers and reserves, will be determined by player votes and selections from the commissioner's office and announced later in the week.</p>

Despite taking an early lead, the Swiss team conceded two goals, including an unfortunate own goal, making them the first host nation to lose their opening match in the tournament's history. Coach Pia Sundhage remains optimistic, urging her team to focus on their remaining group games against Iceland and Finland to secure a spot in the quarterfinals.

          <p>The United States and Vietnam have finalized a new trade agreement, establishing a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports and avoiding a planned 46% levy. Under the deal, Vietnam will not charge any tariffs on U.S. products, effectively opening its market. The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are "trans-shipped" through Vietnam from other countries, a key concern for the Trump administration regarding Chinese products. This deal resolves a major point of trade tension and provides more certainty for numerous international brands that manufacture goods in Vietnam.</p>
