          <p>Following President Trump's announcement that he fired the head of the National Portrait Gallery, the Smithsonian Institution issued a statement affirming its autonomy from external influences. The statement emphasized that personnel decisions are made by the Secretary, with oversight from the Board of Regents, including ex officio members Vice President JD Vance and Chief Justice John Roberts. The Smithsonian also addressed concerns about biased content, directing museum directors to ensure unbiased content and report progress to the board. Trump had signed an executive order placing Vance in charge of supervising efforts to "remove improper ideology" from the Smithsonian.</p>

          <p>With China imposing rare earth export restrictions, a global race is on to supplant its dominance in critical minerals. The trade in rare earths, vital for auto, electronics, and defense industries, is expected to be a key topic in discussions between US and Chinese officials. Companies like USA Rare Earth are working on establishing magnet-making plants and separation technologies in the US to reduce reliance on China. This push aims to create an industrial chain outside of China, albeit at a potentially high cost, to ensure a more secure supply of these crucial materials.</p>
