          <p>The article discusses the changing role of tech stocks, particularly Apple, as a safe haven during market volatility. Apple's recent underperformance compared to its sector and the broader market raises questions about the tech sector's reliability as a safe investment. Investors are now diversifying into broader market funds and traditional defensive sectors like utilities and consumer staples. Experts suggest that the market is becoming more accepting of volatility, and investors are using traditional hedging strategies with fixed income ETFs, while some believe geopolitical events present buying opportunities in tech, particularly AI-related stocks.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant decline following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, which resulted in no reported casualties. The market's reaction suggests investors are hopeful for a de-escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. The price of U.S. crude oil fell by over 7%, reaching its lowest level since Israel's bombing of Iran began earlier in June. Some analysts believe President Trump's strategy of escalating tensions has successfully created an opportunity for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Retired Gen. Robert Spalding, a former B-2 pilot, shared details behind the U.S. military's "Operation Midnight Hammer" strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. Spalding said the operation required more than a decade of preparation, including extensive work on weapons systems and planning. The mission's success relied heavily on keeping Iran in the dark, using decoy bombers and stealth technology, and pilots had to conduct multiple midair refuelings. The strikes aimed to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>U.S. regulators are expected to consider rolling back bank capital rules, potentially easing the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio (eSLR) for the largest U.S. banks.

Federal Reserve Board Governor Michelle Bowman indicated that revisiting the eSLR requirement is just the start of broader capital rollback considerations.

          <p>US regulators are expected to weigh one of the most dramatic rollbacks of bank capital rules since the 2008 financial crisis.

The largest and most important US lenders currently must keep those eSLR ratios at 5%. The proposal being considered by regulators would lower that requirement by 1.5 percentage points, according to a Bloomberg report. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor is recalling over 197,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles due to an issue with door latches that could trap passengers inside. The NHTSA explained that if the car's battery level drops too low, the door latches may remain locked, potentially trapping children and others. Ford is issuing a software update to address the recall and is not aware of any injuries or accidents associated with the faulty door latches. The company is also recalling 120,000 Mustang Mach-E vehicles in markets outside the U.S.</p>
