          <p>The United States men's national soccer team played to a 1-1 draw against Ecuador in an international friendly, showcasing continued progress under their new tactical system. Despite controlling possession for much of the game, the US fell behind to a goal from veteran striker Enner Valencia in the first half. Folarin Balogun scored the equalizer in the 71st minute, his second goal in as many games, securing a result that many players felt was less than their performance deserved. The team's comfort in a three-man backline and aggressive play provided positive signs for their long-term development.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces have won their third WNBA title in four seasons, completing a dominant four-game sweep of the Phoenix Mercury in the Finals. Led by A'ja Wilson's 31 points, the Aces clinched the championship with a 97-86 victory, showcasing their offensive power throughout the series. The team never trailed in the final game, establishing an early lead and successfully fending off a fourth-quarter rally from the Mercury. Phoenix's efforts were hampered by injuries and the ejection of their coach, Nate Tibbetts, for arguing a call in the third quarter.</p>

          <p>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has formally rejected a proposal from the Trump administration that would have granted preferential access to federal funding in exchange for adopting specific policies. In a letter, MIT President Sally Kornbluth stated that the agreement would restrict freedom of expression and contradict the university's core values. The proposed "Compact for Academic Excellence" included controversial measures such as capping foreign student admissions, limiting leaders' political commentary, and using force against campus protests. Brown University and the University of Pennsylvania were also approached with the deal, which has been met with significant opposition.</p>

          <p>Maiwand Banayee, a former Taliban enthusiast who now works for the NHS in the UK, has published a book detailing his journey into and out of extremism. Radicalized as a teenager in a Pakistani refugee camp in the 1990s, he was drawn by promises of martyrdom and paradise, later joining the Taliban to enforce their strict laws in Kabul. However, witnessing the group's cruelty and experiencing their rigid dogma firsthand led him to question his beliefs. He hopes his story, 'Delusions of Paradise,' will serve as a cautionary tale to prevent other young people from being lured into radical ideologies.</p>

          <h2>Strategies for Coping with Seasonal Affective Disorder and 'Autumn Blues'</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As autumn begins, many people experience a dip in mood and energy, often referred to as the 'autumn blues' or, in more severe cases, seasonal affective disorder (SAD). Experts suggest that the decrease in sunlight affects serotonin and melatonin levels, impacting mood and sleep. To combat this, counselors recommend maintaining a balanced diet, exercising, and spending time outdoors to get fresh air and natural light. Other popular strategies include using light therapy boxes, sunrise alarm clocks, and embracing cozy activities to 'romanticize' the colder, darker months, thereby shifting one's perspective on the season.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump completed a medical checkup at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, which he described as a "semiannual physical." The visit occurred just six months after his last annual exam, prompting some questions, though the White House maintained it was a routine follow-up. A memo from the president's physician, Capt. Sean Barbabella, stated that the 79-year-old is in "excellent overall health" and that his cardiac age was found to be 14 years younger than his chronological age. The examination comes as the president prepares for an upcoming trip to the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Senior U.S. officials have revealed a timeline detailing the months-long negotiations that culminated in the recent Israel-Hamas peace plan. The process involved key figures like Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff, who refined a 20-point proposal with Qatari, Egyptian, and Turkish officials. A critical breakthrough occurred after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a formal apology to Qatar for an airstrike in Doha, which helped rebuild trust. The final intensive negotiations in Sharm El Sheikh, Egypt, led to a phased agreement beginning with a ceasefire and the release of hostages and prisoners.</p>

          <p>According to Wang Lei, CEO of Huatai Financial Holdings, Hong Kong's future success as a global financial hub depends on its ability to adapt to mainland China's economic shift towards technological self-sufficiency and advanced manufacturing. Historically, the city has thrived by meeting China's financing needs, and this new era presents a similar opportunity. Wang, who also advises Hong Kong's Chief Executive, emphasized the need for the city to develop financial frameworks specifically designed to support specialized technology sectors.

          <p>Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca has agreed to a deal with the Trump administration to provide some of its prescription drugs to Medicaid patients at "most-favored-nation" prices. This means the price will not exceed the lowest rate offered in other developed countries. The company will also list its primary care medications on a new government website, TrumpRx, which will direct consumers to lower prices. This agreement is the second of its kind, following a similar deal with Pfizer, as the administration pressures drugmakers to voluntarily lower costs to avoid potential tariffs and tighter regulations.</p>

          <p>Quaker, one of the five military horses that bolted through central London last year, has been officially retired from service due to his injuries. The Household Cavalry horses were spooked by construction noise, leading to a chaotic scene where they ran loose and collided with vehicles. While the other four horses have recovered and returned to duty, it was determined that retirement to The Horse Trust sanctuary in Buckinghamshire was the best option for Quaker's welfare. The incident drew global attention after being captured on camera, highlighting the unpredictable nature of working with animals in a busy urban environment.</p>

Acting on a tip from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Thai police, the China Coast Guard intercepted the ship, confiscating nearly 5,000 kilograms of the illicit drug and arresting seven suspects. The operation is being hailed as the largest single maritime drug seizure in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years.

FCC Chair Brendan Carr stated the removed items, including security cameras and smart watches from companies like Huawei and ZTE, were either on a list of barred equipment or not properly authorized for sale. The agency is concerned these products could be used to surveil Americans or threaten national security.
