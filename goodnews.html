          <h2>Writer Reflects on Why Zombie Shows Provide Comfort in Anxious Times</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In this guest essay, Rachel Feintzeig discusses her fascination with zombie shows like "The Last of Us" as a form of escapism from real-world anxieties. She admits to being both tortured and obsessed with the show, finding that it serves as a distraction from the possibly apocalyptic events of 2025. Feintzeig recalls how horror movies helped her cope with a past miscarriage, offering a temporary release from personal grief by focusing on fictional horrors. The author concludes that while the show's season finale brings relief, she anticipates needing a new terrifying alternate reality to escape to when the real world becomes too relentless.</p>

          <p>Germany is increasing its efforts to defend against cyberattacks targeting state agencies, hospitals, and critical infrastructure. Recent incidents, such as the cyberattack on Bremen's police force, highlight the growing threat and the need for improved digital security. The annual Conference for National Cybersecurity in Potsdam emphasized the urgency of investing in cybersecurity, particularly for smaller companies and state authorities. Germany's Federal Criminal Police Office reports over 333,000 registered cybercrimes in 2024, with experts noting the increasing professionalization and use of artificial intelligence by cybercriminals.</p>

          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking to reduce their smartphone usage, with some preferring a world without the internet. The Offline Club, a Dutch startup, organizes offline meetups to encourage people to disconnect from social media and engage in real-world activities. Studies indicate that many young people feel worse when spending time on social media and desire digital curfews. Governments in countries like Norway and Australia are considering measures to limit social media use among young people due to concerns about mental health issues associated with excessive smartphone use.</p>

          <p>South Western Railways became the first private operator in the UK to return to public ownership as part of the Labour government's plan to renationalize the country's rail services. The move aims to address the poor reputation of Britain's railways, marked by frequent cancellations and high ticket prices. The government plans to bring all 14 rail operators under public control by 2027, potentially saving up to ¬£150 million in compensation fees. Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander called it a "watershed moment" to end fragmentation and improve passenger service.</p>

During the trial of the kidnappers, Michelle was attacked by the defense, who attempted to portray her as a willing participant due to her past as a stripper and financial difficulties. Despite investigators finding no evidence of her involvement, the experience was traumatizing, and she and her daughter had to rebuild their lives.</p>

          <p>A new study reveals that dog owners who ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their pets. The research found that dogs of owners with higher job stress exhibited more stress-related behaviors, such as whining and pacing. This connection is driven by "work-related rumination," where owners mentally take work home, spreading stress to their dogs. Experts suggest that employed dog owners should avoid work-related thoughts at home to protect their pets' well-being.</p>

          <p>Alibaba's Amap has introduced a ride-hailing feature on its English version, catering to foreign visitors in China. This feature allows users with registered mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau phone numbers to access transportation in over 360 cities. The new Amap feature is in support of China‚Äôs visa-free travel scheme, which permits visitors from 43 countries to stay for up to 30 days. During the recent Labour Day holiday, approximately 380,000 foreign visitors entered the mainland visa-free, reflecting a significant increase from the previous year.</p>

          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has been renationalized, becoming the first train company to transfer to public ownership under the Labour government. The government says it will improve services and reinvest profits in infrastructure, but does not promise lower fares. Unions have expressed concerns over outsourcing to private companies. SWR trains are now the responsibility of DfT Operator and will be integrated into Great British Railways (GBR), which will oversee all railway infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges have become a major nuisance at the World Exposition in Osaka, causing distress among visitors. The insects are found on walls and pillars, with visitors forced to fight them off. While the midges do not bite, their remains can cause allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is taking measures, including spraying insecticide and installing insect repellent lights, to combat the issue, with Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura seeking assistance from an insecticide manufacturer.</p>

          <h2>New York City Beaches Open with Limited Lifeguard Staffing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 20:23:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 lifeguards, fewer than needed due to a staffing shortage. The city expects to increase staffing over the summer, with new lifeguards in training and returning lifeguards expected to join. The city is offering incentives, such as increased hourly wages and signing bonuses, to attract more lifeguards. Despite the shortage, the presence of lifeguards provided beachgoers with some peace of mind.</p>
