          <h2>FIFA Agrees to Implement Mandatory Rest Periods for Professional Footballers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 11:32:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FIFA has reached an agreement with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods to protect players from injury and burnout. The consensus includes a minimum 72-hour gap between matches and a three-week rest period at the end of each season. This decision follows a lawsuit filed by Fifpro over concerns about an expanded fixture calendar, particularly the new 32-team Club World Cup. While FIFA has conceded on rest periods, the governing body remains committed to creating more global competitions to provide opportunities for players worldwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head coach Deion Sanders has called for the NCAA to enforce stricter rules on college football uniforms, similar to the NFL's system of fines. Speaking at Big 12 Media Days, Sanders expressed his disapproval of players wearing minimal gear, such as biker shorts and no knee pads, arguing it shows a lack of respect for the game. He suggested that financial penalties should be implemented for uniform violations. Sanders, who recently signed a five-year extension with Colorado, also addressed questions about his health, insisting he is well and focused on his team.</p>

          <p>A detailed report highlights the work of Barbara Rae-Venter, a genetic genealogist who was instrumental in identifying the Golden State Killer, a man responsible for at least 13 murders and over 50 sexual assaults. The article explains how she used public DNA databases to build a family tree for the unknown suspect, providing a crucial investigative lead. This technique is now being used by law enforcement nationwide to solve other cold cases, including decades-old sexual assaults. The piece also touches on the privacy concerns surrounding the use of public DNA data for criminal investigations.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service is bolstering its security protocols with new technology. The agency is deploying a fleet of military-grade drones and mobile command posts to improve aerial reconnaissance and inter-agency communication. These upgrades are a direct response to failures identified during the 2024 incident, where a shooter used a commercial drone for surveillance and communication gaps existed with local police. The Secret Service expressed confidence that these new measures will help prevent a repeat of such an event.</p>

          <p>English amateur Lottie Woad came remarkably close to winning a major title at the Evian Championship, a feat not achieved by an amateur in 58 years. The 21-year-old shot a brilliant final-round 64 to set the clubhouse lead at 13 under par. Australia's Grace Kim ultimately won the tournament in a playoff against Thailand's Atthaya Thitikul, after both finished at 14 under. Despite the narrow miss, Woad's performance has earned her enough points to qualify for the LPGA Tour, leaving her with a significant decision about when to turn professional.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has announced that the government will take steps to make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers, with details to be revealed later this week. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she highlighted a new £88 million package for charging infrastructure, including solutions for homes without driveways. The move aims to address the high upfront cost of EVs, which is a major barrier to adoption. Critics argue the government is moving too slowly and forcing families into expensive vehicles before the country is fully prepared.</p>

          <p>Professor Zheng Yongnian, a prominent Beijing policy adviser, has argued that Chinese think tanks must adopt a "self-centred" approach and develop an "indigenous knowledge system" to effectively project the country's soft power. He stated that these organizations should focus on China's unique practical experiences rather than relying on Western academic frameworks. According to Zheng, this shift is necessary to accurately explain China's practices to the world and to better anticipate the nation's future development. This perspective highlights a strategic push within China to shape its own global narrative.</p>
