Sheinbaum emphasized the need for cooperation between the two countries, but insisted that each nation must operate within its own territory. The U.S. military presence has increased along the southern border, with troops and equipment surged to monitor fentanyl trafficking.</p>

          <p>Anthony Albanese's re-election as Australia's prime minister was bolstered by anti-Trump sentiment, despite his neutral stance towards the U.S. president. While Albanese avoided direct criticism of Trump, the global turmoil caused by Trump's policies, including tariffs, influenced Australian voters. The conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, was even nicknamed ‚ÄúTemu Trump‚Äù for espousing similar ideas, which ultimately hurt his campaign. Voters expressed concerns about the cost of living and instability in their retirement accounts due to Trump's policy announcements, leading to a landslide victory for Albanese's Labor Party.</p>
