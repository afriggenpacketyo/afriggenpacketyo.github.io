          <h2>China Develops Stealth Technology for Early Warning Aircraft</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 00:00:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly made a significant breakthrough in developing stealth technology for airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft, traditionally vulnerable command nodes. This innovative method, utilizing frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, assigns each antenna a minutely varied frequency, making radar emissions exceptionally resistant to interception and geolocation. This renders the signal chaotic and difficult for adversaries to track, behaving like a "phantom" beyond recognition. Engineers describe this as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars, potentially enhancing the survivability and operational effectiveness of these crucial military assets and significantly impacting future aerial warfare strategies.</p>

These deals, announced during a White House meeting between Presidents Trump and Lee Jae Myung, build upon a prior trade agreement that reduced U.S. tariffs on South Korean exports. The leaders also committed to energy cooperation, including developing Alaska's natural gas reserves, and reaffirmed their dedication to regional security. This summit strengthens the economic and strategic alliance between the two nations, fostering mutual growth.</p>

          <p>Tennis icon Venus Williams delivered a courageous performance in her US Open return, engaging 11th seed Karolína Muchová in an intense two-hour battle before ultimately falling 6-3, 2-6, 6-1. The 45-year-old's appearance coincided with the 28th anniversary of her US Open debut on Arthur Ashe Stadium, where she showcased her formidable serve and attacking style. Williams expressed pride in her improved physical condition, attributing her inability to maintain peak form to a lack of recent match practice. Her return was particularly meaningful after undergoing surgery for fibroids, allowing her to compete without the significant pain she had experienced previously.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its colossal Super Heavy-Starship rocket, initially due to an oxygen leak in a ground system and subsequently because of an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad. This milestone mission is crucial for demonstrating fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, aiming to clear the path for a faster launch cadence. SpaceX is preparing for autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers next year, a critical requirement for NASA's Artemis moon landing as early as 2027 and eventual Mars missions. Despite the delays and engineering challenges, both Elon Musk and NASA's acting administrator express confidence in achieving these ambitious goals.</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $750 million, making it the game's tenth largest grand prize in history. The winning numbers drawn on Monday night were 16, 19, 34, 37, and 64, with a Powerball of 22. A single jackpot winner would have the option of receiving a lump sum cash payment of approximately $338.6 million before taxes, or opting for an annuity paid out over 29 years. With drawings held every Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, the jackpot continues to grow if no grand prize winner emerges. The odds of winning the top prize remain 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung employed a strategy of flattery to successfully navigate his first meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump, despite Trump's earlier critical social media post about South Korean politics. Lee praised Trump's personal rapport with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and even joked about building a "Trump Tower" in North Korea. This diplomatic approach aimed to prevent a public confrontation and ensure a positive outcome for Seoul. While the meeting diffused immediate tensions and avoided a "Zelensky moment," concrete progress on long-standing trade and defense issues, including the cost of U.S. troops in South Korea, remained largely unresolved.</p>

          <p>Surgeons in China have conducted a successful pig-to-human lung transplant, demonstrating the procedure's viability, although substantial further tests are required. Scientists at the National Clinical Research Center for Respiratory Disease in Guangzhou reported that the genetically modified pig lung, transplanted into a brain-dead human recipient, maintained functionality for 216 hours without infection or rejection. This advancement in xenotransplantation is considered a potential solution to the global organ shortage, despite the distinct anatomical and physiological challenges lungs present. The study highlights significant progress in genetic modifications and immunosuppressive strategies, paving the way for future clinical translation.</p>

          <p>The Cleveland Browns have executed a surprising trade, sending quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders in exchange for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick. This move addresses the Raiders' immediate need for a backup quarterback, as Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, sidelining him for 6-8 weeks. Pickett, who has 25 NFL starts under his belt, is expected to back up Geno Smith in Las Vegas. His departure from Cleveland leaves the backup quarterback position behind starter Joe Flacco wide open, with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders now competing for the role. The trade significantly impacts both teams' quarterback depth charts ahead of the NFL roster finalization deadline.</p>

Plug-in hair straighteners and curling irons, however, remain unrestricted for both carry-on and checked luggage.

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding for U.S. schools, reversing an earlier freeze after a multi-state lawsuit challenged the decision. These funds, which support crucial programs like after-school and summer learning, teacher training, and assistance for English-learners, were withheld without a clear official explanation, though the White House cited alleged "misuse" for a "radical left-wing agenda." California Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the agreement, emphasizing that states accused the administration of illegally impounding congressionally allocated funds. The restoration provides significant relief to programs benefiting approximately 1.4 million children nationwide, many from low-income families, who faced considerable uncertainty due to the funding freeze.</p>
