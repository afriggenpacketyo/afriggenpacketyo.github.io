          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed global investors at the Milken Institute Global Conference, outlining President Trump's "America First Vision" and appealing to wealthy investors. Bessent emphasized the administration's efforts to reduce government waste, cut regulations, and implement tax cuts, framing these policies as incentives for private investment. He highlighted tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation as the core components of Trump's economic agenda, aiming to make the U.S. more appealing for investors.

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled to meet with Ksenia Karelina, an American ballerina who was recently released from a Russian prison after being sentenced to 12 years for treason. Karelina was arrested for donating approximately $50 to a U.S.-based charity aiding Ukraine. She was released in exchange for Arthur Petrov, a dual German Russian citizen accused of exporting sensitive U.S. electronics to the Russian military. Karelina expressed gratitude to Trump for securing her release, and her boyfriend has stated their eagerness to thank him personally.</p>

          <p>Central Park's northern end has undergone a significant makeover to address years of neglect and disrepair, particularly following major redevelopment in the mid-20th century.

The makeover aims to restore the park's serenity and improve its accessibility for the surrounding communities.

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute is set to host its annual Met Gala, celebrating the exhibition ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,‚Äù which focuses on the influence of Black men on fashion. The event, co-chaired by figures like ASAP Rocky and Pharrell Williams, takes place amid a political climate where diversity initiatives face scrutiny. The Met Gala, often criticized for its display of privilege, is now seen by some as a statement of allyship, particularly given the administration's stance on diversity, equity, and inclusion. Sponsors like Instagram and Louis Vuitton navigate a delicate balance between supporting the event and maintaining relationships with the administration.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch press no longer holds the sway over Australian elections it once did, with its consistent support for the Coalition failing to yield discernible impact since 2010. The decline is part of a wider trend of waning influence for mainstream media, as people increasingly access news from diverse sources. Trust in news is rising, but those who trust news are more likely to pay for it, and they also pay a higher price. The most trusted outlets are ABC and SBS, while News Corporation outlets rank lower. Belief in the power of the Murdoch press has been a bit of an excuse for progressives, who have spent far too much time railing against its excesses.</p>

          <p>Ekaterina Barabash, a Russian journalist critical of Moscow's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, said she fled to France after Reporters Without Borders (RSF) smuggled her out of Russia. Barabash was facing up to 10 years in prison for criticizing the Russian army and said that journalism no longer exists in Russia. RSF director general Thibaut Bruttin said Barabash's escape from Russia was "one of the most perilous operations" the RSF has been involved in since Russia's brutal clampdown on media in March 2022. The reporter said she crossed the border on her birthday on April 26. and had been "hiding for two weeks" during her escape.</p>

But it‚Äôs another thing if you can actually get an official ID when you have some kind of nefarious intent. While the deadline is May 7, 2025, the enforcement might be ‚Äúphased.‚Äù</p>

Pence's actions were praised for upholding the Constitution. Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 vote later led to criminal cases against him and his supporters.</p>
