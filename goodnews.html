          <p>President Trump's "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" has garnered support from some banks, who view it as a necessary economic stimulus. Experts from Nomura and Citi suggest the bill could boost the U.S. economy in the near term by preventing a fiscal contraction and encouraging investment, especially as provisions from the 2017 tax act are set to expire. However, critics, including the Congressional Budget Office and the Tax Foundation, express serious concerns about the bill's projected $3 trillion addition to the federal deficit and its fiscally irresponsible nature. The article highlights a divided financial community on the long-term economic implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the complex question of how much money is needed for retirement, emphasizing that the answer is highly individual. It discusses various adequacy measures, including "pounds and pence" benchmarks like the Living Pension, which sets a minimum income for basic needs, and "relative measures" such as target replacement rates based on pre-retirement earnings. The Hargreaves Lansdown Savings and Resilience Barometer suggests that relative measures offer a better reflection of personal income needs for maintaining living standards. The article advises monitoring pension performance and increasing contributions to ensure a comfortable retirement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pakistan is poised to assume the rotating presidency of the United Nations Security Council for a month, marking its first presidency since 2013. This largely symbolic role comes at a time of heightened geopolitical tensions, with Pakistan's Permanent Representative emphasizing a commitment to peaceful conflict resolution. The article notes that Pakistan is expected to raise its recent conflict with India over the disputed territory of Kashmir, a move India is preparing to counter by highlighting its economic strength and commitment to UN Sustainable Development Goals.

          <p>This article critiques French cinema's historical reluctance to portray the country's significant involvement in the transatlantic slave trade and colonial crimes. The author notes a personal reliance on Hollywood films like "Roots" and "Amistad" to learn about slavery, highlighting the near absence of these stories in French collective imagination. However, the article celebrates recent French films like Simon Mouta√Ørou's "No Chains No Masters" and Jean-Claude Barny's biopic "Fanon," which finally address these sensitive topics with nuance and depth. Despite their critical acclaim and audience success, these films still face marginalization in prestigious French showcases.</p>

          <p>China's yuan has shown unexpected strength against the US dollar, with its daily reference rate strengthening and cumulative gains observed in the second quarter. Goldman Sachs analysts attribute this to a less bearish outlook on China's near-term growth and increasing investor concerns about the sustainability of US government debt. The article notes that fading confidence in "US exceptionalism" and rising long-term financing costs are contributing to expectations of dollar depreciation. Forecasts suggest the yuan could break the 7 per dollar level in six months and 6.9 in 12 months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts at CNBC's East Tech West conference discussed the importance of nations, particularly emerging economies, developing "sovereign AI" to control their own AI technologies and data. They highlighted that many prominent large language models are English-centric, emphasizing the need for localized AI systems that cater to specific languages and cultures. Panelists stressed that open-source AI models and cloud computing services can democratize access to AI development, enabling countries to build their own AI environments. This approach fosters a "collective energy" to compete in the AI landscape and ensure strategic autonomy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's factory activity unexpectedly expanded in June, according to the Caixin/S&P Global manufacturing purchasing managers' index (PMI), rebounding significantly from its previous contraction. This growth, primarily seen in export-oriented manufacturers, is attributed to improved trade conditions and promotional activities. While diverging from the official PMI report, analysts suggest the Caixin survey reflects a delayed response to US-China tariff reductions. Despite this positive indicator, concerns persist regarding declining new export orders, bleak employment in the manufacturing sector, and an intensifying price war impacting profit margins.

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom successfully pushed through "transformative" housing legislation, including bills that significantly lessen environmental review standards to accelerate construction. The governor took an unusual step by linking the housing bills to the state budget, effectively compelling lawmakers to pass them. This move sidestepped opposition from progressive lawmakers, environmental groups, and labor unions. Experts believe these reforms, particularly for urban housing, could be the most significant changes to the California Environmental Quality Act in its 55-year history, aiming to alleviate regulatory burdens and boost homebuilding.</p>
