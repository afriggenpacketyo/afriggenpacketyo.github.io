        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from deporting Venezuelan migrants accused of gang membership, citing due process concerns under the Alien Enemies Act. The ruling sends the case back to an appeals court for further review, indicating skepticism among the justices regarding the government's handling of the deportations. In Congress, five House Budget Committee Republicans blocked their party's major domestic policy bill due to disagreements over budget cuts. The legislation, designed to enact President Trump's agenda, would cut taxes (benefiting the wealthy), increase military and immigration enforcement funding, and reduce health, nutrition, and education spending.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden dismissed concerns about his mental acuity raised in Special Counsel Robert Hur's report months after being interviewed about his handling of classified documents. Leaked audio from Biden's October 2023 interviews with Hur revealed Biden struggling to recall key details such as the death of his son Beau and the year Donald Trump was elected. Biden responded to questions about the report by asserting his competence and experience. Hur's report declined to bring charges against Biden, in part, because a jury would find him to be a "sympathetic, well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory."</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, dramatically reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue its first-ever dust storm warning for the city itself. High winds blowing over dry farmlands collected dust and carried it into the Chicago area, impacting travel and outdoor activities. Visibility dropped to near zero in some areas, forcing drivers to pull over and halting flights at Midway International Airport for about an hour. The skies cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas affected by the dust storm.</p>

          <p>Ammunition makers in Gorazde, Bosnia, fear for their survival due to tariffs imposed by President Trump on goods sent to the United States, their biggest market. The tariffs have disrupted expansion plans and threaten to scare off American customers, impacting companies like Ginex, which makes ignition devices for ammunition. The mayor of Gorazde worries that the U.S. has abandoned its faith in free trade and economic development as a path to peace. Bosnia has increased its exports to the U.S. by over 250% in the past five years, making the U.S. a vital lifeline for Gorazde's ammunition industry.</p>

          <p>The United Arab Emirates is increasing its investment and strategic presence in Africa as the United States and China reduce their involvement. Emirati corporations are investing heavily in ports, mines, renewable energy projects, and other key sectors across the continent. Since 2019, Persian Gulf investments in Africa, primarily by the Emirates, have totaled $110 billion, surpassing amounts pledged by any other country. This push is part of an ambitious plan to diversify the Emirates' economy away from fossil fuels and increase its influence over global supply chains, particularly as the Trump administration fast-tracks America's exit from Africa.</p>
