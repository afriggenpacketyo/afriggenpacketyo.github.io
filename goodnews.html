          <p>As part of its annual Han Kuang military exercises, Taiwan's navy conducted a live-streamed drill demonstrating its mine-laying capabilities off the coast of Kaohsiung. The exercise, aimed at bolstering readiness against a potential invasion, featured fast minelaying boats deploying Taiwanese-made naval mines. Simultaneously, military police practiced urban warfare tactics by using the Taipei metro system for a pre-dawn troop and supply redeployment under simulated air strikes. These drills highlight Taiwan's focus on asymmetric warfare strategies to deter potential aggression.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve has launched a public defense of its headquarters renovation project, responding to escalating attacks from the Trump administration. An FAQ page on the Fed's website addresses claims made by officials, such as OMB Director Russell Vought, who criticized the project's cost overruns and alleged extravagances. The Fed clarifies that taxpayers do not fund the project and attributes cost increases to unforeseen issues like asbestos and design changes. This public pushback represents a rare move by the central bank to counter political pressure from the White House. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, former NYC Rent Guidelines Board member Leah Goodridge defends mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for a rent freeze on stabilized apartments. Drawing on her experience as a tenants' rights attorney, she argues that a rent freeze is not an unrealistic idea but a critical lifeline for New Yorkers struggling with affordability. Goodridge notes the board has approved freezes before and frames the debate as part of a larger effort by landlords to deregulate housing. She contends that such policies are a necessary check on market forces to prevent homelessness.</p>

The product, created by 26-year-old Connor Blakley, will be sold exclusively in 3,000 Walmart stores. Jams is targeting health-conscious consumers and the lucrative athlete market, hoping to carve out a niche in the billion-dollar frozen sandwich category.</p>

          <p>A historical overview examines the varied acceptance and persecution of queer, non-binary, and transgender individuals throughout history. The article contrasts the relative openness of ancient societies, like Greece and Rome where same-sex relationships were common, with the severe persecution that arose with the spread of Christianity, which framed such relationships as sinful. It also highlights the existence of third-gender identities in various cultures, from the Hijras in India to the Lhamanas of the Zuñi in North America. The analysis underscores that the modern fight for LGBTQ+ rights is a struggle against historically imposed norms.</p>

This discussion comes as the organization attempts to reform its culture following the Horizon IT scandal, which led to the wrongful conviction of hundreds of sub-postmasters. The consultation will explore a new vision for the state-owned service, including its ownership structure and the range of services it should offer, such as banking. The goal is to address a "grim past" and find a sustainable path forward for the UK's largest retail network.</p>

          <p>This article refutes the characterization of the YIMBY ("yes in my backyard") movement as a centrist or conservative scheme, arguing it aligns with progressive, anti-monopoly principles. The author contends that restrictive zoning and land-use laws function like a cartel, allowing wealthy landowners to hoard wealth by artificially limiting housing supply and driving up prices. Therefore, the YIMBY goal of deregulation is not anti-regulation in general, but a targeted attack on rules that have been captured by a powerful elite. The piece concludes that fighting for housing abundance is a populist effort to unrig the market for everyone else.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's proposal for free, universal childcare has resonated with voters and become a key plank of his affordability-focused platform. The plan, which would be funded by raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy, responds to a surge in activism around the city's childcare crisis, where annual costs can exceed $26,000. Advocates say the policy would provide financial relief, improve gender equity in the workforce, and bolster the city's economy. The success of the proposal in the primary suggests that making childcare a public good has become a winning political issue.</p>

          <p>Despite modern advancements like comfortable beds and climate control that should enable better sleep, many Americans still suffer from insomnia and sleep deprivation. This article explores the paradox, attributing the problem to a mix of modern lifestyle choices, environmental factors, and systemic issues. Revenge bedtime procrastination, constant screen use, and stress disrupt sleep, while an obsession with "perfecting" sleep can ironically worsen insomnia. Furthermore, factors like noise pollution, housing insecurity, and the stress of discrimination create significant barriers to rest, particularly for lower-income and minority populations.</p>

          <p>India's consumer price inflation fell to 2.1% in June, a rate lower than economists had expected and an extension of a more than six-year low. This marks the eighth consecutive month of decline, driven primarily by a continued drop in food prices, which registered at -1.06%. The cooling inflation provides the Reserve Bank of India with more room to continue its monetary easing policy to stimulate the economy. Strong crop production and a good monsoon season are expected to keep food inflation low, boosting consumer purchasing power. (not investment advice)</p>
