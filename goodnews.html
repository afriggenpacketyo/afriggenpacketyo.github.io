          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 20:50:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK has successfully grown its first experimental rice crop in East England, a project spearheaded by ecologist Nadine Mitschunas and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology. Benefiting from the hottest summer on record, this trial explores future food production and farmer livelihoods in a changing climate. Beyond food, the initiative aims to re-wet peat soils in Cambridgeshire, locking away greenhouse gases and potentially cutting national emissions. While commercial viability is still distant, the project offers a radical model for sustainable agriculture and climate mitigation, drawing government interest.</p>

          <p>Tech billionaire Larry Ellison and his son, Hollywood producer David Ellison, are rapidly expanding their influence in the US media industry, with deals involving major companies like TikTok and CNN. Larry Ellison's close ties with President Donald Trump have reportedly facilitated these ventures, including Oracle's role with TikTok and David Ellison's acquisition of Paramount. The family is also reportedly preparing a bid for Warner Brothers Discovery, potentially creating one of the largest media conglomerates. Critics, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, express concerns about this concentration of power and potential political influence on media outlets.</p>

          <p>Two Indian researchers, Vikash Kumar and Sarthak Mittal, have been awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for their study on how foul-smelling shoes impact the user experience of shoe racks. Their research, initially aimed at designing a better shoe rack, evolved into a scientific inquiry into the Kytococcus sedentarius bacterium, responsible for shoe odor. The duo developed a prototype UVC light-equipped shoe rack that sterilizes footwear, effectively eliminating the smell within minutes. This quirky yet inventive scientific endeavor highlights a universal domestic problem and offers a unique solution.</p>

          <p>Dominion Voting Systems has reached a confidential settlement in its $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit against Rudy Giuliani, stemming from his baseless claims of election rigging in the 2020 presidential election. Giuliani, former personal lawyer to President Trump, had accused Dominion of conspiring to flip votes. This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion reached with Fox News and Newsmax. The lawsuit was part of a series of legal and financial setbacks for Giuliani, including disbarment and a $148 million judgment to defamed Georgia election workers, highlighting the severe consequences of spreading election conspiracy theories.</p>

          <p>Europe has established a formidable 11½–4½ lead over the United States, heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup singles matches, requiring only two and a half more points to retain the cup. This marks Europe's largest ever pre-singles lead, making a US comeback statistically unprecedented. The day was also marred by controversial fan behavior, with personal insults directed at European players, particularly Rory McIlroy. Despite the challenging atmosphere, Europe's dominance on the course led thousands of spectators to leave early, highlighting the one-sided nature of the competition so far.</p>

          <h2>Effectiveness of Collagen Supplements for Skin Aging Debated by Experts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The efficacy of collagen supplements in reducing signs of skin aging is a subject of ongoing debate among dermatologists and consumers. While some users report brighter skin, thicker hair, and stronger nails, consultant dermatologist Emma Wedgeworth expresses skepticism about collagen's ability to reach skin cells effectively when taken orally. She notes that collagen creams are largely ineffective as they don't penetrate beyond the skin's surface. Industry-funded studies often show positive results, but independent research frequently finds no substantial effect. Experts suggest that consistent sunblock use, a healthy diet, and avoiding smoking are far more impactful for skin health.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on 50 years of formal diplomatic relations between China and the European Union, specifically examining China's rapid technological ascent. Decades ago, Chinese officials observed a significant technological gap with Europe, estimating China was at least 20 years behind. Following its reform and opening-up policy, China embarked on a path of breakneck growth and modernization. The article implicitly suggests that China has not only caught up but, in many high-tech sectors, may have surpassed Europe, flipping the technological script and redefining their economic relationship over the last five decades.</p>

          <p>Labour has pledged to begin construction on three new towns before the next general election, aiming to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029. A taskforce has identified Tempsford, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill as the most promising initial sites from a list of 12 recommendations across England. Each new town is expected to have at least 10,000 homes, with 40% designated as affordable housing. This initiative, central to Labour's vision for economic growth, will be overseen by a New Towns Unit with special planning powers, drawing inspiration from post-war housing booms.</p>

          <p>Modular homebuilder Fading West is addressing America's housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in a factory setting, claiming up to 20% cost reduction and half the build time compared to traditional methods. The company's innovative manufacturing approach, exemplified by its rapid production of 82 modular homes for Lahaina wildfire victims, highlights the efficiency and quality of off-site construction. While modular homes currently represent a small fraction of new builds, their potential to provide more affordable, quicker-built housing for a broad range of aspiring homeowners, including essential workers, is gaining recognition. This model also addresses labor shortages and reduces waste in the construction industry.</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its suppliers and protect jobs after a cyber attack halted production for weeks. The Export Development Guarantee will help JLR boost cash reserves and make backlog payments to its 700 suppliers, many of which are small businesses facing financial distress. The shutdown is estimated to cost JLR £50 million per week, impacting approximately 150,000 people in its supply chain. Both government and opposition figures welcomed the support, though some criticized the delayed response and called for broader cyber reinsurance schemes.</p>
