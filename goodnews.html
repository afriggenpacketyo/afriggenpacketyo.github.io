          <p>Virginia Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger engaged in a heated gubernatorial debate, marked by Earle-Sears' aggressive questioning and Spanberger's attempts to maintain a bipartisan stance. A central point of contention was Spanberger's reluctance to directly condemn Democratic attorney general candidate Jay Jones after the emergence of violent text messages. Earle-Sears repeatedly pressed Spanberger on the issue, accusing her of lacking courage, while Spanberger focused on denouncing political violence generally. The debate also covered topics such as the federal shutdown and transgender rights, highlighting the stark differences between the candidates' approaches to governance and social issues. </p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Philadelphia Phillies in a dramatic National League Division Series game, propelled by a crucial throwing error from Phillies reliever Orion Kerkering. With the score tied and the bases loaded in the 11th inning, Kerkering's miscue allowed the Dodgers to score the winning run, securing their place in the National League Championship Series. The game was a tense, low-scoring affair featuring strong pitching performances from both sides, but ultimately decided by a late-inning blunder. The Dodgers now advance to face either the Milwaukee Brewers or Chicago Cubs for a chance to compete in the World Series. </p>

          <p>A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order halting the deployment of National Guard troops in Illinois, siding with state and local leaders who opposed the Trump administration's plan. The judge cited a lack of credible evidence of an organized rebellion in Illinois and questioned the reliability of the Department of Homeland Security's assessment of the situation. The ruling prevents National Guard units from operating in Illinois for 14 days, including protecting federal agents and facilities. The decision has been praised by Illinois officials who view it as a victory for states' rights and a check on presidential power. </p>

          <p>Maine Governor Janet Mills is reportedly planning to launch a campaign for the U.S. Senate, challenging incumbent Republican Senator Susan Collins. Mills, a Democrat, has served as governor since 2019 and previously as the state's attorney general. Her entry into the race is expected to make it one of the most closely watched Senate contests in the upcoming midterm elections. The Maine Senate race presents a potential opportunity for Democrats to gain a seat in a closely divided Senate, despite facing a challenging electoral landscape. </p>

          <p>A Chinese research team has developed a self-healing interface for solid-state batteries, potentially overcoming a major obstacle to their commercialization. The new interface acts as a liquid seal, filling tiny gaps and maintaining stable contact between the battery's internal layers without requiring heavy pressure. This technology could significantly improve the performance and stability of solid-state batteries, which are considered a promising alternative to conventional lithium-ion batteries. The development has been hailed as a decisive step towards the practical application of next-generation battery technology. </p>

          <p>A near-complete skeleton discovered on Dorset's Jurassic coast has been identified as a new species of ichthyosaur, a prehistoric marine reptile. The dolphin-sized ichthyosaur, named Xiphodracon goldencapensis, or the "sword dragon of Dorset," is the only known example of its kind. Scientists believe the ichthyosaur lived about 185 million years ago and may have been killed by a bite to the head from a larger species. The discovery is significant because it fills a gap in the ichthyosaur fossil record from that period. </p>
