          <p>Alphabet's autonomous vehicle unit, Waymo, announced plans to expand its robotaxi service to Dallas in 2026, with rental company Avis set to manage the vehicle fleet. This move adds Dallas to a growing list of future markets, including Miami and Washington, D.C. Waymo, which already operates in cities like Los Angeles and Phoenix, is a leader in the U.S. autonomous driving sector, competing with firms like Tesla and Amazon's Zoox. The expansion reflects Alphabet's growing investment in its "Other Bets" division. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California's state parks department is implementing a new lottery-style drawing system to make it easier for the public to reserve campsites at three of its most popular locations: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. This change aims to address the issue of reservations being booked within minutes of becoming available, giving more people a fair chance. The system, which is free to enter, will also feature a points system to increase the odds for applicants who are unsuccessful in previous drawings.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have brokered a new trade deal, narrowly avoiding a significant escalation in tariffs threatened by President Trump. The agreement establishes a 15% tariff on most EU imports, which is half the previously threatened rate. In exchange, the EU has committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy over three years and will eliminate tariffs on certain American products like aircraft and some pharmaceuticals. The deal comes ahead of a deadline for agreements with other major trade partners, including China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amid a significant slump, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly prioritizing an upgrade to their outfield defense before the MLB trade deadline. While the team's potent offense has struggled, a key concern is run prevention, making defensive prowess a valuable asset for a potential playoff run. Minnesota Twins center fielder Harrison Bader has emerged as a strong candidate, offering elite defensive skills and a solid offensive season, which could help fortify the team for its championship aspirations.</p>
