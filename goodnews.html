          <p>Ozeki Onosato secured the Emperor's Cup with a 14-1 record at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, despite a final-day loss to yokozuna Hoshoryu, preventing an undefeated run. The 24-year-old had already clinched consecutive championships and promotion to yokozuna prior to the final bout. Hoshoryu's victory improved his head-to-head record against Onosato, while komusubi Wakatakakage's strong performance sets the stage for a potential ozeki promotion bid. Onosato's promotion to yokozuna will be formally recommended, making him the fastest to reach the sport's highest rank under the modern calendar and the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster. The article reflects on Onosato's impressive achievements and future prospects in sumo wrestling.</p>

          <p>Dermatologist Dr. Michelle Hure discusses the growing trend of younger individuals seeking "baby Botox" and other cosmetic procedures, expressing concern about the long-term costs and unrealistic expectations. Hure attributes this trend to increased online presence during the pandemic, leading to heightened self-scrutiny and dissatisfaction with perceived flaws. She emphasizes the importance of medical professionals pushing back against unnecessary procedures, even if it means sacrificing potential profits. Hure also warns about the psychological risks associated with cosmetic procedures, such as dependence and perception drift, and the dangers of medical procedures being treated as mere retail services. The article explores the ethical and psychological implications of cosmetic dermatology.</p>

          <p>Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner declined to confirm whether the government intends to abolish the two-child benefit cap, despite reports that Sir Keir Starmer privately supports the move. Rayner pointed to the establishment of a Child Poverty Taskforce, which is evaluating the policy, among other measures. She also denied being the source of a leaked memo suggesting the government "claw back" child benefit payments from wealthier families. Nigel Farage has stated that Reform UK would abolish the two-child benefit cap if it gains power, while Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch argues that the country cannot afford to lift the cap.
