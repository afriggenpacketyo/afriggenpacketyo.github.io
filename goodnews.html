          <p>California's insurance regulator has approved State Farm's request for a 17% premium increase for its homeowners in the state, aiming to help the insurer rebuild its capital after the Los Angeles wildfires. State Farm argued the increase was necessary to avoid a financial crisis that could lead to dropping more policies. The decision comes amid California's efforts to encourage insurers to continue operating in the state despite increasing wildfire risks. In exchange for the rate hike, State Farm will receive a $400 million cash infusion from its parent company and halt some nonrenewals through the end of the year.</p>

          <p>A forthcoming book, "Original Sin," by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, reveals new details about former President Biden‚Äôs mental and physical decline while in the White House. The book describes how Biden's aides allegedly quashed concerns about his age-related limitations, including internal worries and external scrutiny. The book recounts instances of Biden forgetting names and appearing frail, leading aides to wrap him in a protective political cocoon. The reliance on anonymous sourcing highlights the enduring chill that Biden‚Äôs loyalists have cast over the Democratic Party, which remains hesitant to publicly address his waning abilities.</p>

Newsom is seeking to blame the president for California‚Äôs expected revenue shortfall, releasing this information ahead of his revised 2025-26 state budget plan.

Officials reported that the AI tool produced "nearly identical" results compared to human experts tasked with the same job. This marks the first use of AI for such a purpose in the UK, potentially saving taxpayers an estimated ¬£20 million by sparing civil servants from time-consuming tasks. The AI tool is part of a set of government AI-powered tools collectively dubbed "Humphrey," after the character from the sitcom Yes, Minister.</p>

          <p>A team of researchers in China has cautioned against the rapid adoption of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence (AI) in hospitals, citing potential clinical safety and privacy risks. As of early March, at least 300 hospitals in China have begun using DeepSeek‚Äôs large language models (LLMs) for clinical diagnostics and medical decision support. The researchers warned that DeepSeek‚Äôs tendency to generate ‚Äúplausible but factually incorrect outputs‚Äù could lead to ‚Äúsubstantial clinical risk‚Äù. The paper highlights the need for careful evaluation and comprehensive cybersecurity infrastructure in healthcare facilities.</p>

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a microbiologist from Brazil, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long research on soil bacteria that act as fertilizers, boosting farmers' harvests. Hungria's work, initially met with skepticism, has been instrumental in transforming Brazil into an agricultural superpower. She isolated useful strains of bacteria that enhance nitrogen fixation in soybeans and stimulate root growth in crops like corn and wheat. Her research has enabled farmers to reduce their reliance on chemical fertilizers, saving money and reducing environmental burdens. This article highlights the impact of her work on sustainable agriculture in Brazil.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.3% in April on an annual basis, slightly less than economists expected, but still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Housing and energy costs were major contributors to inflation, while grocery prices saw a slight decrease. Economists are closely monitoring the potential impact of President Trump's tariffs on consumer prices. The CPI report may influence the Federal Reserve's decisions on interest rates, potentially delaying expected rate cuts. The tentative trade agreement between China and the U.S. could mitigate some inflationary pressures.</p>

          <p>Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, discussed Disney's business strategy, emphasizing service bundling and leveraging linear television. Disney uses its linear channels to program for audiences still watching on traditional TV, then windowing that content onto streaming platforms. The company's bundling strategy, offering discounted rates for combined Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN subscriptions, is proving successful. Walden highlighted Disney's unique ecosystem, which integrates theme parks, cruises, and consumer products to optimize and monetize content, setting it apart from competitors.</p>

          <p>President Trump's negotiating strategy of taking maximalist positions and then backing down to declare a win is being tested in negotiations with Russia and Iran. After backing off on plans to transform Gaza and impose tariffs on Canada and China, Trump now faces complex negotiations involving Ukraine's sovereignty and Iran's nuclear program. Both Russia and Iran are hinting at potential investment opportunities for Americans if the United States eases its demands. This article analyzes how these negotiations differ from tariff negotiations and the potential impact on global stability.</p>
