          <p>Following a summit, China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi announced the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's (SCO) new development strategy extending to 2035. This long-term plan is designed to guide the bloc's direction for the next decade, emphasizing a unified stance against unilateral actions and bullying, seen as an implicit critique of U.S. policies under President Trump. The strategy advocates for a multilateral trading system centered around the WTO, positioning the SCO as a key force in promoting a multipolar global order amid escalating geopolitical tensions.</p>

          <p>A coronal mass ejection from the sun over the weekend is expected to create a geomagnetic storm, potentially making the aurora borealis visible across parts of Canada and 18 northern U.S. states on Monday night. Forecasters at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center anticipate the colorful light display will peak in the early hours of Tuesday morning. While not expected to be as intense as the major storm in spring 2024, it presents a significant opportunity for skygazers in states like Montana, Michigan, Maine, and New York to witness the phenomenon.</p>

          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on member states to unite against unilateral 'bullying,' a clear reference to U.S. economic pressure and sanctions. He emphasized the bloc's historic achievements and its potential as a major platform for multilateralism and collective security. Xi also urged the prompt establishment of an SCO development bank to provide financial support for security and economic cooperation among its ten member nations, which collectively represent nearly half the world's population.</p>

Szczerek claimed he mistakenly believed the player was passing the hat to him and expressed deep regret for hurting the child and disappointing fans. He has since returned the hat to the boy, and Majchrzak also met with the young fan over the weekend to give him a new cap and other merchandise, stating the incident was likely a misunderstanding in a moment of high emotion.</p>

          <p>ScotRail, Scotland's national rail operator, has officially scrapped peak-time fares, making weekday travel significantly cheaper in an effort to encourage commuters to switch from cars to trains. This move follows a trial period and will see ticket prices on key routes, like Edinburgh to Glasgow, fall by nearly 50% during former peak hours. First Minister John Swinney announced the policy is a sustainable investment in the rail network and the public, with the estimated annual cost of £40-£45 million to be covered by the ScotRail budget.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that short-term CDs, particularly those with a six-month term, are currently offering the most competitive returns for savers amid a fluctuating interest rate environment. While rates have fallen from their recent peaks, they remain attractive, and locking in current yields could be advantageous before potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. For those with longer-term goals, a CD laddering strategy, which involves spreading funds across multiple terms, is recommended to balance high returns with liquidity and buffer against interest rate risk.
