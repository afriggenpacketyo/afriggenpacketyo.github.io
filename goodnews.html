          <p>Authorities in Devon and Cornwall have seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit for a limited-edition Aston Martin Valhalla supercar in 2021. The police successfully argued in court that the funds were derived from tax evasion and money laundering, obtaining forfeiture orders under the Proceeds of Crime Act. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously confiscated from Tate and his brother for unpaid taxes on revenue from their online businesses.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential dorm room supplies.

The initiative aims to level the playing field, ensuring these students feel prepared and equal to their peers, thereby addressing a critical support gap and helping them focus on their academic success.</p>

          <p>Samsung is challenging Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional design of the iPhone. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of products and price points is creating renewed competition in the high-end device sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Psychologist Outlines Three Steps to Build Emotional Endurance and Tolerate Stress</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-16 09:05:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests that developing emotional endurance—the capacity to withstand stress without being overwhelmed by negative feelings—is key to personal growth. She recommends three powerful steps: using a visual aid to understand that learning involves struggle, engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult situations, and undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone. These practices help build resilience by teaching your body and mind that you can tolerate discomfort and emerge stronger.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House to discuss a potential peace agreement to end the war with Russia. The announcement came after Trump's meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, which he described as "very successful." According to Trump, the goal is to go directly to a comprehensive peace deal rather than a temporary ceasefire, a proposal he says was determined after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and other European leaders.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has fallen to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, driven by growing concerns about the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now believing even moderate drinking is unhealthy. This trend is particularly pronounced among underage individuals, where reported drinking has seen a sharp decline over the past few decades.</p>

With rising costs and a lack of affordable options, they are partnering with developers and even building their own housing to prevent their vulnerable clients from ending up on the streets.</p>
