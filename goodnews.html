          <p>OpenAI has been awarded a $200 million contract to provide the U.S. Defense Department with artificial intelligence tools. The one-year contract follows OpenAI's announcement of collaboration with defense technology startup Anduril for "national security missions." The Defense Department specified that the contract is with OpenAI Public Sector LLC, with work primarily in the National Capital Region. This contract represents a small portion of OpenAI's revenue, as the company generates over $10 billion in annualized sales and has a $300 billion valuation.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, all 13 of Yosemite's campgrounds will be open to visitors this summer, according to the National Parks Service. This reopening will provide an additional 500 campsites, increasing access to the popular park that saw over 4 million visitors in 2024. Maintenance and staffing challenges had kept several campgrounds closed since 2020, but White Wolf Campground, Tamarack Flat Campground, and Yosemite Creek Campground are set to open in the coming weeks. Reservations are available at Recreation.gov, but finding a camping spot remains highly competitive.</p>

          <p>Keir Starmer and Donald Trump finalized a UK-US trade deal at the G7 summit in Canada, with Trump stating Britain would be protected from future tariffs "because I like them". The deal covers aerospace and the auto sector, eliminating tariffs for the UK aerospace sector and reducing auto industry tariffs to 10%. Steel tariffs remain at 25% for now, but the leaders pledged to work towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The US seeks assurances regarding the Chinese ownership of British Steel, reflecting concerns about circumventing US tariffs.</p>

          <p>A new bill in California proposes making it a misdemeanor for law enforcement officers to cover their faces while on duty. The bill aims to increase transparency and public trust in law enforcement by requiring officers to be identifiable by their uniform and name or other identifier. Exceptions would be made for SWAT teams and officers responding to natural disasters. The proposal is a response to incidents of federal officers conducting raids while concealing their faces and badges.</p>
