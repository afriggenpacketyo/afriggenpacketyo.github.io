          <p>The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (LAHSA) is set to appoint Gita O’Neill, a career city attorney, as its new interim chief executive. O'Neill will lead the agency for a 12-month term as it undergoes significant downsizing, with its budget being reduced by about 40% due to the creation of a new county homelessness department. The leadership change comes as LAHSA faces scrutiny over its financial management and contracting practices following critical audits. O'Neill's appointment is scheduled for a vote just as the current CEO, Va Lecia Adams Kellum, departs from the role.</p>

          <p>A new student loan repayment plan, named the "Repayment Assistance Plan" (RAP), has been established under a bill recently signed into law by President Trump. This income-driven repayment option, set to be available by July 2026, will calculate payments based on a borrower's adjusted gross income, ranging from 1% to 10% with a $10 minimum. The plan offers forgiveness after 30 years, longer than existing plans which are being phased out for new borrowers. While it includes benefits like a monthly credit for dependents, it differs from previous plans by not shielding a portion of income from the payment calculation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A New Jersey man, Navin Khanna, has pleaded guilty to leading a sophisticated, nationwide theft ring that trafficked in stolen catalytic converters, generating over $600 million in revenue. Khanna admitted to conspiring to purchase stolen converters from multiple states and reselling them to a metal refinery, which would then extract the valuable precious metals inside. The extensive operation was uncovered following a 2021 traffic stop in Tulsa, Oklahoma, during a period of surging catalytic converter thefts across the country. He now faces a potential prison sentence of up to 17.5 years for his role in the scheme.</p>

          <p>Venture funding for artificial intelligence startups in the U.S. reached a staggering $104.3 billion in the first half of the year, nearly matching the total for all of 2024. Despite this fundraising boom, led by massive investments in companies like OpenAI and Anthropic, the exit market tells a different story. According to PitchBook data, most exits have been smaller, lower-value acquisitions rather than high-value IPOs, as larger companies "bolt on" smaller startups to enhance their own offerings. This trend highlights a disparity between the massive capital flowing into the AI sector and the more modest returns investors are currently realizing. (not investment advice)</p>

Her statement comes after an interview where she discussed her family's personal move to Tennessee, which some interpreted as a corporate relocation. While the popular burger chain is expanding eastward with a new regional office planned for Franklin, Tennessee, Snyder affirmed the company's roots will stay in California, with headquarters moving from Irvine to Baldwin Park.

Bessent stated that he believes trade relations with China are in a "very good place" and that the talks will formalize an extension. The discussions are also expected to cover other topics, including China's manufacturing output and its purchases of sanctioned Russian and Iranian oil, signaling a potentially more constructive phase in U.S.-China relations.
