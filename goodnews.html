          <p>New laboratory research from Hiroshima University in Japan indicates that a fermented extract from the stevia plant may have potential as an anti-cancer agent. The study, published in the International Journal of Molecular Sciences, found that the substance exhibited enhanced antioxidant activity and was effective against pancreatic cancer cells in a lab setting. Medical experts caution that these findings are very preliminary and have not been tested in humans, but they represent a promising avenue for future cancer treatment research.</p>

          <p>Álvaro Uribe, the former president of Colombia, has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest following his conviction for witness tampering and bribery. The historic case centered on accusations that Uribe attempted to manipulate the testimony of former paramilitary members who had linked him to their groups. This verdict is a significant moment in Colombian justice, tarnishing the legacy of a polarizing leader who governed from 2002 to 2010 and has been banned from holding public office for eight years.</p>

          <p>Following his treatment for bladder cancer, Hall of Fame athlete and coach Deion Sanders is raising awareness about neobladder reconstruction surgery. The procedure involves removing the diseased bladder and constructing a new one from a segment of the patient's own small intestine. Surgeons explain that while the operation is a modern marvel, patients must retrain their bodies to use the new organ and often manage incontinence, a side effect Sanders has openly discussed to help reduce public stigma.</p>
