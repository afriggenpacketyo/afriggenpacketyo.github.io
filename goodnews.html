        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alpine has decided to replace Jack Doohan with Franco Colapinto for the next five races following a review of the season's opening races, with Briatore assuming Oakes' responsibilities. The team aims to fairly assess drivers for the 2026 season, deeming a line-up rotation necessary given the closely matched field and improved car performance. Doohan remains an integral part of the team as the first-choice reserve driver, while Colapinto is eager to deliver the best possible results alongside Pierre, acknowledging the intensity of the upcoming races. This decision follows the resignation of team principal Oliver Oakes, with Flavio Briatore stepping in to take over his responsibilities.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk reported strong first-quarter profits but lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to competition from copycat drug compounders affecting Wegovy sales. Despite overall revenue increasing, Wegovy sales fell slightly short of analyst expectations, while Ozempic sales exceeded forecasts. The company now anticipates slower sales growth and operating profit growth for 2025, reflecting the challenges posed by increased market competition. The adjustment indicates the impact of generic alternatives on the company's blockbuster weight loss drug.</p>

Despite the failed merger, the three automakers continue to explore collaboration on EV software, while Foxconn seeks to expand its EV business through partnerships with Japanese manufacturers.</p>
