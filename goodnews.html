German Chancellor Friedrich Merz and French President Emmanuel Macron are the key figures at the event, highlighting the strong Franco-German relationship and the historical significance of the day. The celebrations underscore the progress made over the past three and a half decades while also acknowledging the remaining disparities between the former East and West.

          <p>Financial experts at a recent forum emphasized that Hong Kong's role as a vital gateway to mainland China solidifies its strength as a global asset and wealth management hub. The city is expected to benefit significantly from China's continued economic opening, attracting more affluent individuals and innovative tech companies. This influx of capital and resources is predicted to create a favorable macroeconomic environment, lowering funding costs and enhancing business opportunities. Hong Kong's unique position within the Greater Bay Area allows it to act as a crucial 'superconnector' between mainland and international markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a major victory for conservationists, eleven cheetah cubs were rescued from the illegal pet trade off the coast of Somaliland, a major transit hub for wildlife trafficking. The cubs, found packed in bags on a small boat, were in poor condition, with two dying shortly after the rescue despite intensive care. The Cheetah Conservation Fund is now rehabilitating the surviving animals, highlighting the severe threat the illegal pet trade poses to the endangered species, of which fewer than 7,000 remain in the wild. This incident underscores the urgent need to combat the demand for exotic pets in Gulf countries.</p>

The new facility will be housed in a space previously occupied by Children's Wisconsin's emergency department. In addition to the new emergency services, the hospital's birth center will undergo a significant expansion, doubling its number of labor and delivery rooms from 12 to 24.

          <h2>Digital Price Tags in Grocery Stores Raise Questions About Dynamic Pricing</h2>

          <p>Electronic shelf labels are becoming increasingly common in major grocery chains like Walmart, Kroger, and Whole Foods, allowing for rapid, centralized price changes. While retailers praise the technology for its efficiency, some lawmakers and consumer advocates express concern that it could enable "dynamic pricing," where prices for essential goods could fluctuate based on demand, time of day, or other factors. Retailers like Kroger deny any plans for surge pricing, stating the technology helps manage inventory and lower prices on perishable items. Economic studies suggest the practice could reduce food waste, and so far, there is no evidence of surge pricing being implemented.</p>

          <p>As electric air taxi services move closer to reality, a major operator of aviation landing sites has begun scouting locations for "vertiports" across Los Angeles. The company, VertiPorts by Atlantic, is seeking to build infrastructure on rooftops or open land in congested urban areas like Santa Monica and downtown L.A. to support this futuristic mode of transport. This move comes as aerospace companies like Archer Aviation partner with the LA28 Olympics committee to provide aerial transport during the games. The initiative aims to offer a traffic-avoiding alternative for urban travel, though regulatory and zoning challenges for the new technology remain.</p>

          <p>Scientists and conservationists are engaged in an ambitious mission to save the endangered Houston toad from extinction through a combination of assisted reproduction and habitat restoration. At the Fort Worth Zoo, biologists use advanced techniques like hormone injections and genetic matchmaking to breed thousands of toads for release into the wild. This effort is paired with programs that incentivize private landowners in Texas to restore their property, creating safe habitats for the toads. Despite significant challenges like drought and habitat loss, these dedicated efforts are showing signs of success, offering a hopeful model for saving uncharismatic but ecologically vital species.</p>

The selections reflect a strategy of rewarding recent success and carefully managing player fitness ahead of key World Cup qualifiers.</p>
