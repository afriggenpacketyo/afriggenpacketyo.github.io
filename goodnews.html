          <h2>Gulf States Face Financial Pressure Amid Falling Oil Prices Despite Trump Investment Pledges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 13:43:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Gulf states promise substantial investments in the U.S. under President Trump, falling oil prices pose a challenge to their financial commitments. Despite diversification efforts, these nations remain heavily reliant on oil revenues, with Saudi Arabia needing oil prices around $91 a barrel to balance its budget. Analysts suggest that while the UAE and Qatar can manage, Saudi Arabia may face pressure on domestic reforms and international pledges, potentially leading to cuts in ambitious projects like Neom. The article indicates that Gulf states may need to reallocate existing investments or borrow to meet their financial obligations.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced that the U.S. and China have made "substantial progress" in de-escalating the trade war following high-level talks in Geneva. While details remain undisclosed, Bessent indicated that an agreement has been reached and that Trump has been updated on the situation. The discussions, the first since the U.S. imposed steep tariffs on China, are focused on "de-escalation" rather than a comprehensive trade deal, with both sides issuing warnings ahead of the meeting.</p>

          <p>Nottingham Forest's manager says their bid to qualify for the Champions League is "not finished" despite a damaging home draw against already-relegated Leicester. With only two rounds of fixtures remaining, the race for the top five is tight, and Forest's match against Chelsea on the last day of the season could be decisive. Only champions Liverpool have sealed a Champions League place so far, but second-placed Arsenal will hope to soon join them.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government in Afghanistan has suspended chess until further notice, citing concerns that the game is a source of gambling. Officials stated that the game has been prohibited indefinitely until its compatibility with Islamic law can be determined. This is the latest sport to be restricted by the Taliban, with women already barred from participating in sports. One cafe owner in Kabul, who hosted informal chess competitions, expressed respect for the decision but noted it would hurt his business.</p>
