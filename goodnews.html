          <p>The UK and EU are preparing for their first bilateral summit since Brexit, focusing on defense, security, and trade. Despite a desire for closer relations driven by global concerns like Russia and China, significant hurdles remain, particularly regarding fishing rights and defense contracts. The UK aims to reduce trade barriers sector by sector, with a plant and animal health deal being a key point of negotiation, while the EU seeks long-term fishing rights in UK waters. A mobility section is also planned, facilitating professional qualification recognition and easing visa restrictions for UK musicians, though migration concerns complicate a youth mobility scheme. The article highlights the cautious approach of the UK government, balancing economic growth with Eurosceptic sentiments.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine, Nuvaxovid, but with restrictions, limiting its use to older adults and individuals over 12 with high-risk medical conditions. This decision has sparked controversy, with some experts concerned about limiting access for healthy individuals under 65 and the potential impact on public confidence in vaccines. The approval also requires Novavax to conduct further studies on potential heart-related side effects, which could be costly and time-consuming. Critics suggest the new restrictions reflect skepticism towards vaccines from within the health agencies.</p>

          <p>President Trump criticized Walmart for attributing potential price increases to tariffs, suggesting the retailer should "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs on to consumers. Walmart CFO John David Rainey had warned about the challenges of rising prices due to tariffs, despite some relief from lowered duties. Walmart affirmed its commitment to keeping prices low, but acknowledged the reality of small retail margins. The incident is part of a broader trend of companies increasing prices or warning of higher prices due to tariffs.</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni, nicknamed the "sea moth." The fossilized remains were found in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies, providing new insights into animal life in the Cambrian period. The predator was about the length of an index finger, with a unique mouth and intimidating claws. The discovery reveals that the creature was more complex than previously thought, with a multi-segmented abdomen and an open circulatory system.</p>
