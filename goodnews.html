          <p>A non-fatal shooting occurred outside CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, prompting a security response and closure of the main gate. The incident took place early Thursday morning, hours after a separate shooting in D.C. involving Israeli Embassy staff, though no connection between the two incidents has been established. Fairfax County Police assisted with traffic control, and the CIA spokesperson indicated that additional details would be released as appropriate. The investigation is ongoing to determine the circumstances surrounding the shooting at the CIA headquarters.</p>

          <p>ASML has developed High NA, a $400 million chipmaking machine that is transforming microchip manufacturing. The machine, which is larger than a double-decker bus, is made up of four modules manufactured in different countries and assembled in the Netherlands. Intel was the site of the world's first commercial installation of High NA in 2024, and only five of these machines have been shipped to date. High NA improves chip prices due to improvements in speed, performance and yield, and it is expected to be used by all of ASML's EUV customers, including Micron, SK Hynix and Rapidus.</p>

          <p>Millions of public sector workers, including nurses, doctors, and teachers, have been offered pay rises between 3.6% and 4.5% after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies that exceeded its initial budget of 2.8%. Unions had threatened action if pay awards were not increased, arguing that 2.8% was insufficient. The government has allocated additional funding to cover the cost of the pay rises, but schools will be required to fund the first 1% through improved productivity and smarter spending. The impact of these pay rises on inflation remains a key consideration.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's new leader, William Lai, has notably toned down his rhetoric on mainland China in recent public addresses, omitting any direct mentions of cross-strait relations. This marks a shift from his previous assertive stance, where he emphasized Taiwan's independence and described Beijing as a hostile force. Lai has also extended an olive branch to opposition parties, offering briefings on national security matters.

          <p>House Republicans passed a major tax and spending bill early Thursday morning. SALT is an acronym that stands for ‚Äústate and local taxes‚Äù ‚Äî it allows Americans to deduct some of what they pay, right now up to $10,000, in state and local taxes (like property taxes and sales taxes) from their federal taxes. Removing the SALT cap is seen as benefiting mostly wealthy earners in high-tax states like California or New York: people who might make $500,000 a year or $10 million a year and pay tens or hundreds of thousands in state and local taxes, the sort of people who don‚Äôt take the standard deduction.</p>

          <h2>Xpeng Shares Surge</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts predict that Xpeng's Hong Kong shares are poised for further gains after experiencing a nearly 80% increase this year. This surge is attributed to the Chinese electric-vehicle maker's introduction of new models and its progress towards achieving profitability. Xpeng's shares in Hong Kong witnessed a substantial increase following positive earnings reports and a stronger-than-expected revenue forecast for the second quarter. Analysts anticipate that Xpeng will achieve profitability in the fourth quarter of this year, driven by its robust sales momentum and upcoming new models.</p>
