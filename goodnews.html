          <p>After years of significant crises, Boeing is reportedly stabilizing under the leadership of CEO Kelly Ortberg, who was brought out of retirement to helm the company. The aerospace giant has seen its stock rise over 30% this year, with increased aircraft production and deliveries hitting an 18-month high. Analysts anticipate the company may post its first annual profit since 2018 next year, crediting Ortberg's hands-on approach for a positive culture shift. Despite progress, Boeing still faces challenges, including FAA production caps and the need to fix its struggling defense unit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to an "immediate and unconditional ceasefire" to end five days of deadly border clashes that killed dozens and displaced over 260,000 people. The agreement was brokered in Malaysia after significant pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump, who threatened to halt tariff negotiations with both nations if the fighting continued. The conflict, rooted in a century-old border dispute, had recently escalated with the use of heavy artillery and rockets. While the ceasefire is a crucial first step, maintaining it will be challenging due to deep mistrust and nationalist sentiments.</p>

          <p>During a visit to Scotland, President Trump announced a significant trade agreement with the European Union after meeting with EU leader Ursula von der Leyen. The deal sets a 15% tariff rate for most EU imports to the U.S., avoiding a threatened 30% tariff, and secures EU commitments to purchase U.S. energy and military hardware. Trump also met with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to discuss their separate trade deal and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza. The agreement marks a major development in transatlantic trade relations, aiming to bring stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Three-time speedway world champion Tai Woffinden has ridden a bike for the first time since a life-threatening crash in March left him in a medically induced coma. The 34-year-old from Scunthorpe suffered extensive injuries, including a broken back, broken leg, and a punctured lung. A video showed him riding at the Olympic Stadium in Wroclaw, Poland, four months after the incident. Woffinden described the past four months as the "biggest challenge" of his life, demonstrating remarkable resilience in his return to the sport where he is Great Britain's most decorated rider.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition parties, the Kuomintang (KMT) and Taiwan People's Party (TPP), are looking to build on recent political momentum after an unprecedented recall vote against 24 KMT lawmakers failed. The result is seen as a significant setback for President William Lai Ching-te's ruling party, which had supported the recall effort. The failure to unseat any legislators has re-energized the "Blue-White" opposition alliance and deepened their coordination. Observers suggest this outcome strengthens their position ahead of the 2026 local elections and the 2028 presidential race.</p>

          <p>In an effort to combat its demographic crisis, China has launched its first nationwide childcare subsidy program.

This policy aims to reverse a declining birth rate that poses a long-term threat to the country's economic growth and social stability.

          <p>This article delves into the reasons why some individuals are more emotionally sensitive than others, often feeling deeply hurt by minor slights or comments. It explains that this trait can stem from a combination of genetic predisposition, known as being a "highly sensitive person," and life experiences like past rejection or trauma. Experts suggest that this heightened sensitivity is often rooted in a fundamental human need to feel valued. To cope, the article recommends strategies such as recognizing the tendency to assume the worst and developing healthier communication skills.</p>

          <p>To address a severe shortage of affordable housing, Germany's government is planning a "Bau-Turbo" (construction turbo) law to expedite new building projects. The proposed legislation would allow municipalities to approve residential construction that deviates from existing building codes and would automatically approve planning applications after two months unless vetoed. While the construction industry welcomes the move to cut through bureaucracy, environmental groups fear it will lead to the loss of green spaces.

Using the philosophy of Ruth Chang, the article explains that such "hard choices" are not about finding a single "better" option, as the alternatives are often "on a par." Instead of being a problem of ignorance, these choices are an opportunity to exercise personal agency and define one's own values. The act of choosing, by creating reasons for oneself, is what forges one's identity and determines the kind of person one becomes.</p>
