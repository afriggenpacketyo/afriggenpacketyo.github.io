          <p>Tech billionaire Peter Thiel's venture capital firm, Founders Fund, has disclosed a 9% stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy. The news prompted a significant surge in Bitmine's stock price, with shares climbing over 12%, and also lifted the stock of other companies with similar crypto-focused plans. This investment comes as interest in Ethereum and related assets grows, partly due to new European stock trading initiatives by Robinhood and advancing US stablecoin legislation. The move highlights increasing institutional confidence in the Ethereum ecosystem. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 10:02:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that Physician Associates (PAs) and Anaesthesia Associates (AAs) be renamed 'assistants' to clarify their roles for patients. The review, prompted by safety concerns and high-profile patient deaths, also suggests they wear distinct uniforms and see patients only under limited circumstances, such as for minor ailments after triage. While the government accepted all recommendations, the doctors' union BMA believes the changes don't go far enough in defining scope of practice. Conversely, the union for PAs and AAs warned that the new restrictions could potentially lengthen patient waiting lists.</p>

          <p>China has completed a new, advanced telescope on the Tibetan Plateau designed to detect gravitational waves, or ripples in spacetime, from the universe's origin. This significant scientific endeavor involves international collaboration, notably with assistance from the United States. Stanford University was instrumental in developing and testing the telescope's critical detector and readout systems, ensuring their functionality in extreme cold conditions before deployment. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) may also contribute, marking a key partnership in a global effort to explore the beginnings of the universe and strengthen fundamental physics research.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sold an additional 225,000 shares of the company's stock, valued at approximately $37 million, as part of a pre-arranged trading plan. This plan, adopted in March, allows for the sale of up to 6 million shares. The sale coincides with Nvidia's soaring market value, which recently surpassed $4 trillion, making it the world's most valuable company, driven by immense demand for its AI-powering chips. In related news, Nvidia plans to restart sales of its H20 chips to China after the U.S. government indicated it would approve the necessary export licenses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A parametric heat insurance program in Ahmedabad, India, is offering financial relief to informal workers, such as waste pickers, who lose income during extreme heatwaves. The program, a collaboration between the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) and nonprofit partners, automatically disburses payments when temperatures exceed specific thresholds, without requiring workers to file claims or prove illness. This initiative provides a crucial safety net for daily wage earners who must choose between their health and their livelihood amid record-breaking temperatures. The model is gaining traction as a way to build climate resilience for vulnerable populations facing increasing climate-related risks.</p>

          <p>At a roundtable with President Donald Trump, Westinghouse's interim CEO Dan Sumner announced an ambitious plan to build 10 large AP1000 nuclear reactors in the United States, with construction to begin by 2030. Each reactor can power over 750,000 homes, and the total project is projected to generate $75 billion in economic value nationwide. This announcement aligns with President Trump's executive orders aiming to quadruple U.S. nuclear power by 2050. The plan is notable given the significant cost overruns and delays of the last two U.S. reactors, which were also Westinghouse AP1000s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. producer price index (PPI), a measure of wholesale inflation, showed no change in June, contrary to economists' expectations of a 0.2% increase. This report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggests that the impact of President Trump's tariffs on the broader economy has so far been marginal. While the overall figure was flat, final demand goods prices did rise by 0.3%, offset by a decline in services. On a year-over-year basis, the headline PPI increased by 2.3%, its lowest level since September 2024, providing a mixed signal for the Federal Reserve as it monitors inflationary pressures.

          <p>Republican senators have indicated they will protect funding for the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar), a major US-backed global HIV/Aids program. The move would reverse a planned $400 million cut, which was part of a larger Trump administration effort to rescind $9 billion in previously approved government spending. Pepfar, initiated under President George W. Bush, has enjoyed bipartisan support for decades and is credited with saving millions of lives worldwide. The White House has reportedly agreed to the amendment, which would spare the program from cuts that have already impacted other international aid and public broadcasting funds.</p>

With the Federal Reserve potentially lowering rates, CDs offer the advantage of locking in current high rates for a fixed term, making them ideal for specific, time-bound goals. In contrast, money market accounts provide greater liquidity, making them better suited for emergency funds, though their variable rates will fall if the market changes.

          <p>Professional cycling teams at the 2025 Tour de France are increasingly incorporating heat training into their preparation, not just to adapt to hot weather but also to boost overall performance. Sports scientists explain that actively raising an athlete's core body temperature, either through intense exercise in warm clothing or passive methods like saunas, can be more effective than traditional altitude training. This stress stimulates beneficial physiological adaptations, such as increased blood volume and improved oxygen delivery to muscles. The practice, once considered eccentric, is now a mainstream strategy for gaining a competitive edge in endurance sports.</p>
