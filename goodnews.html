          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and the Rwanda-backed M23 militant group have signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement in Qatar, committing to a permanent peace deal by mid-August. This agreement aims to address the long-running conflict in the mineral-rich eastern DRC, which has displaced over seven million people. The terms of the final deal are still being negotiated, with key issues including the release of captured fighters and the withdrawal of M23 troops from seized territories. The African Union has hailed the deal as a major milestone for regional stability.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Vegetarians Are More Ambitious, Sparking Debate Over Dietary Stereotypes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 07:00:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new meta-analysis claims that vegetarians tend to value power and achievement more than meat-eaters, challenging common stereotypes. The research, which analyzed data from over 3,700 people, found that vegetarians scored higher on values like stimulation and power, while placing less emphasis on security and tradition. The study's author suggests this reflects the strong character required to maintain a minority dietary choice against social pressures. However, critics argue that categorizing individuals based on their diet is an oversimplification and that human motivations are far more complex than such labels imply.</p>

          <h2>England Football Team Hopeful Captain Leah Williamson Will Be Fit for Euro 2025 Semi-Final</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:59:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The England women's football team is optimistic that captain Leah Williamson will be available for their Euro 2025 semi-final match against Italy. Williamson sustained an ankle injury during extra time in the quarter-final victory over Sweden and was later seen on crutches with a protective boot, which is believed to have been a precautionary measure. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that the defender would be assessed before the crucial upcoming game. Teammate Esme Morgan expressed confidence that Williamson would recover, emphasizing the captain's importance to the team's success in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Leading UK end-of-life charities Marie Curie and Hospice UK are calling for a nationwide exemption from council tax for people diagnosed with less than a year to live. The campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a policy. Advocates argue that a terminal diagnosis often brings a severe financial shock, as individuals may have to stop working while facing increased costs for things like energy for medical devices. They believe that removing the burden of a significant bill like council tax would provide priceless peace of mind.</p>

          <p>The California red-legged frog, a species that had vanished from Southern California for decades, is showing signs of a comeback thanks to a dedicated conservation effort using artificial intelligence. Scientists successfully reintroduced frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula to their historic range in California. To confirm if the re-established population was breeding, researchers deployed a custom AI model to analyze thousands of hours of audio recordings, successfully detecting the frogs' mating calls. This breakthrough marks the first time the frog has been heard in the San Diego County wilds in 25 years.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve continues to cut the federal funds rate, interest rates on deposit accounts, including money market accounts (MMAs), are declining. While the national average MMA rate is 0.62%, some high-yield accounts still offer over 4% APY, presenting a closing window of opportunity for savers. The article explains how much a $10,000 deposit could earn at both average and high-yield rates to illustrate the difference. It also addresses potential downsides of MMAs, such as higher minimum balance requirements and withdrawal limits compared to traditional savings accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This commentary argues that Democrats need to change their messaging to win back non-college-educated voters, who prioritize economic issues over the party's focus on defending democracy. The author suggests a three-pronged strategy: highlighting that Trump's policies do not address kitchen-table issues, showing how his cuts harm programs that support ordinary Americans, and framing his foreign policy as weakening the country. By focusing on economic security, small business support, and patriotism, Democrats could better resonate with the values of working-class voters and build a more effective coalition to counter the far right.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high-protein snacks flood the market, nutrition experts advise consumers to look beyond marketing claims and assess the actual nutritional value. Many products labeled "high-protein" may also be high in sugar or heavily processed. To determine if a snack is a good source, experts suggest a simple calculation: a food should derive at least 30% of its total calories from protein. They also recommend checking the nutrition label for an FDA-defined high-protein snack, which provides 20% or more of the daily value. Ultimately, whole foods like Greek yogurt or nuts are often healthier alternatives.</p>

          <p>To help people avoid impulsive or emotionally-driven purchases, financial and mental health experts suggest a series of self-reflection questions before buying. Consumers should consider if they have limited cash flow, are trying to fill an emotional need, or are seeking to impress others. It is also important to research products to ensure quality and value, rather than assuming price equals performance. By asking whether you are hungry, angry, lonely, or tired (HALT), and being honest about your motivations, you can develop more intentional and healthier spending habits.</p>
