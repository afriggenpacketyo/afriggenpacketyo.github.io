          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches, particularly those of SpaceX, to understand their impact on communities. As the frequency of launches increases, the noise, including sonic booms from returning boosters, is causing disturbances. Researchers are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and how topography affects sound wave propagation. The goal is to gather data to lessen disruptions before problems become pervasive, especially with the testing of larger, louder rockets like Starship.</p>

          <p>An examination of early electric vehicles and their decline in the face of cheaper gasoline powered cars, this article draws parallels to today's market. Electric vehicles may be in trouble, at least in the United States, as Republican leaders are pushing legislation that would eliminate many Biden administration programs intended to promote electric vehicle sales, including a $7,500 federal tax credit. A restored 1909 Baker Electric in Jay Leno's collection, and a discussion about gender stereotypes and policy decisions from the past, offer a historical context for current challenges.</p>
