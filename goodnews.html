          <p>Speaker of the House Mike Johnson is attempting to shield the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" from the ongoing public dispute between President Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Musk has voiced strong criticism of the bill, prompting a response from Trump, creating a challenge for Johnson who once enjoyed a close relationship with Musk. Despite the conflict, Johnson insists his focus remains on advancing the legislative agenda and passing the bill, downplaying the significance of the online feud. Some Republicans are concerned about Musk's influence on the bill's passage, while others urge unity and an end to the public spat.</p>

Reports suggest that Barcelona may sign another goalkeeper, potentially relegating ter Stegen to third choice, causing frustration for the player.

          <p>Passengers on an American Airlines flight from Philadelphia to Naples, Italy, were rerouted to Rome after the Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner was deemed too large to land at Naples Airport. The flight diverted approximately halfway between Rome and Naples, forcing the airline to bus the 231 passengers and 11 crew members to their final destination, a roughly three-hour journey. American Airlines stated the diversion was due to operational limitations and apologized for the disruption. The airline typically operates a smaller Boeing 787-8 to Naples.</p>

          <p>Richard Tice, Reform UK's deputy leader, has dismissed claims of chaos within the party following the resignation and subsequent return of chairman Zia Yusuf. Yusuf initially resigned, citing exhaustion after 11 months in the role, but returned two days later to lead the party's unit focused on identifying spending cuts at councils. Tice attributed the situation to the demanding nature of chairing a fast-growing political party. The party is expected to appoint a new chairman and deputy chairman next week.</p>
