          <p>India is under increasing pressure to secure a trade deal with the United States before an August 1st deadline, which would raise tariffs to 26%. The urgency is heightened by a recent US-Japan trade agreement and India's own deal with the UK, where it protected sensitive agricultural sectors. Analysts suggest the U.S. also has strategic interests in a deal, viewing India as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific and a potential manufacturing alternative to China. India is leveraging its multi-alignment strategy and its role in BRICS to negotiate favorable terms while balancing geopolitical pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former UFC middleweight champion Robert Whittaker is set to return to the octagon nine months after suffering a severe jaw injury where his bottom teeth were caved in during a fight. Whittaker, who required surgery and dental implants, humorously recounts the incident and his recovery, noting his life is now "much better" with his new teeth. Now 34, he states his primary motivation is no longer just regaining the title but setting an example for his children. He will face Dutch fighter Reinier de Ridder in Abu Dhabi, preparing for a potential "25-minute slugfest."</p>

          <p>The chief executive of England's Football Association (FA), Mark Bullingham, has stated there is no need to expand the powers of the Video Assistant Referee (VAR) system in football. This comes amid reports that the sport's law-making body, IFAB, might consider using VAR for decisions like corner kicks and second yellow cards. Bullingham expressed the FA's position that the current model already causes enough interruptions to the flow of the game. The FA holds a vote on IFAB, and any rule change would require a three-quarters majority, making the FA's opposition significant.</p>

          <p>This week's film releases offer a diverse slate for moviegoers, led by the much-anticipated superhero reboot "The Fantastic Four: First Steps," praised for its 1960s aesthetic and self-contained story. Also reviewed is "Cloud," a psychological thriller from Japanese director Kiyoshi Kurosawa about an online reseller whose life spirals into paranoia and violence. Other notable films include "Diciannove," an Italian coming-of-age drama about a confused and ambitious teenager, and "Shoshana," a historical thriller set in 1930s Tel Aviv exploring the complex origins of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</p>

          <h2>UK Aims to Finalize Trade Deal Details During Trump's Visit to Scotland</h2>

          <p>As President Donald Trump visits Scotland, the U.K. government hopes to finalize key elements of its recent trade agreement with the United States. While a baseline deal is in place, several commitments remain unresolved, including the removal of a 25% U.S. tariff on British steel and aluminum and disagreements over the UK's digital services tax. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is scheduled to meet with Trump to refine the pact. Analysts suggest a potential "give and take," where the U.S. might lower metal tariffs in exchange for the U.K. dropping its tech tax. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 01:04:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Welsh government is launching a UK-first initiative to provide people with conditions like coeliac disease with pre-loaded debit-style cards to buy gluten-free food. This new system offers an alternative to the current model of obtaining food on prescription from a pharmacy, aiming to "de-medicalise" the process and give individuals more choice and convenience. A pilot program participant received £14 a month, which she noted only "scratches the surface" of the higher cost of gluten-free products. The government anticipates the scheme will be cost-neutral for the NHS and will be rolled out later this year.</p>

          <p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang has called for a "healthy" economic relationship between China and the European Union, emphasizing that cooperation is the "only right choice." Speaking at a business symposium attended by EU officials, including Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Li urged both sides to leverage their complementary strengths in areas like technology and the green economy. He positioned a strong China-EU partnership as a stabilizing anchor for the global economy, particularly amid rising protectionism. The comments reflect China's ongoing efforts to maintain strong trade ties with Europe.</p>

          <p>USC football coach Lincoln Riley stated he feels "refreshed and recharged" heading into his fourth season, despite mounting pressure after a disappointing 7-6 record last year. Riley credits a new general manager for easing his workload and believes the program is now focused on "finishes" rather than major fixes. He expressed confidence in the team's improved defense and new starting quarterback Jayden Maiava. Riley pointed to the nation's No. 1 recruiting class for 2026 as a sign of the program's strong momentum as they prepare to enter the Big Ten conference.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and Australia have deepened their ties through the AUKUS security pact, signing a new treaty that commits them to a 50-year defense partnership. The agreement focuses on supporting both nations' nuclear-powered submarine programs and is expected to generate tens of thousands of jobs and potentially £20 billion in British exports over 25 years. The move reinforces the trilateral agreement, which also includes the United States, at a time when Washington has signaled some uncertainty about its long-term role and urged Australia to increase defense spending to counter China.

          <p>In response to recent devastating floods in Central Texas that claimed over 130 lives, CBS Texas is organizing the "Loud for Love" benefit concert to raise funds for those affected. The event will take place on August 3rd at a venue in the Fort Worth Stockyards and will be broadcast live. The concert will feature performances by country artist Coffey Anderson and other musicians, with proceeds and viewer donations going to the Salvation Army's flood relief efforts. An online silent auction with memorabilia and fan experiences will also be held to support the cause.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Scientists Make First Direct Observation of Quantum Friction Effect</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 22:00:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Lanzhou Institute of Chemical Physics has become the first to experimentally observe and measure quantum friction between two solid surfaces. Using folded graphene, they discovered a counterintuitive effect where friction did not always increase with thickness; in some cases, thicker folds slid more easily. The team attributed this phenomenon to changes in electron movement within the bent material, which locked them into fixed energy levels and reduced the conversion of motion into heat. The findings could pave the way for developing ultra-efficient, low-wear nanoscale devices and machines.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Princeton, a city 30 miles north of Dallas, has been named the fastest-growing city in the U.S., with its population surging from 17,000 in 2020 to 37,000 last year. The boom is driven by affordable housing, with homes selling for around $300,000 in a county where the median price is nearly $475,000. This rapid expansion has caused significant growing pains, forcing the city to temporarily halt new construction to allow infrastructure like sewer lines, water, and roads to catch up. With another 13,000 homes already approved, Princeton is expected to reach a population of 100,000 within five years.</p>

Williams lost 6-2, 6-2 to Poland's Magdalena Frech. Her first-round victory had made her the oldest woman to win a WTA tour-level match in two decades and was her first singles win since 2023, following a long absence due to surgery. Despite the loss, Williams received a standing ovation from the crowd, smiling and waving in appreciation of their support during her comeback tournament.</p>
