          <p>Space manufacturing startup Varda has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round to expand its operations. The company specializes in producing pharmaceuticals in microgravity, where drug crystallization can be more effective than on Earth. This new capital will be used to increase the frequency of missions and develop a biologics lab for testing potential drug molecules. Varda recently achieved a milestone by receiving FAA approval for the return of a capsule that manufactured the drug Ritonavir in space.</p>

          <p>Tesla has submitted an application to Arizona's Department of Transportation to test and operate its Robotaxi service in the Phoenix metropolitan area. This move positions Tesla to compete directly with Waymo, an Alphabet subsidiary that has been running a driverless taxi service in Phoenix since 2020. The application covers operations with and without human safety drivers, with a decision expected by the end of July. This expansion effort follows Tesla's recent pilot program launch in Austin, Texas, as the company aims to scale its autonomous vehicle technology.</p>

          <p>The Department of Homeland Security has ended the two-decade-old requirement for air travelers to remove their shoes for TSA screening. This article from The Atlantic argues that the policy change is a form of "populism theater," giving the public something they want without a fundamental improvement in security technology. The original rule, a response to the 2001 shoe-bomber attempt, became a symbol of security theater, an inconvenience that gave the appearance of vigilance. Its removal is framed not as a technological advance but as a political gesture, making a formerly universal hassle a thing of the past.</p>
