          <p>JPMorgan Chase marked the opening of its 1,000th new bank branch since initiating a major expansion plan in 2018, with a ceremony in Charlotte, North Carolina. This strategic growth has given the bank a presence in all 48 contiguous U.S. states and solidified its position as the American bank with the most physical locations. The expansion counters the industry trend of branch closures, aiming to capture more deposits in fast-growing markets like North Carolina. The bank anticipates these new branches will contribute over $160 billion in incremental deposits, with each location expected to break even within four years.</p>

          <p>A Michigan program called Rx Kids is providing unconditional cash payments to new mothers, gaining attention as a potential model for addressing the high costs of child-rearing in the U.S. The program, backed by public and philanthropic funds, gives pregnant women in participating areas $1,500, followed by monthly payments of $500 for up to a year. With bipartisan support, advocates believe the simple, no-strings-attached approach effectively mitigates economic vulnerability during a critical developmental period for infants. Supporters hope to expand the program statewide, framing it as a pro-family policy that helps parents afford necessities and child care.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 11:49:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension of the current trade terms with Mexico, delaying any new tariff hikes as negotiations for a broader deal continue. The agreement, reached after a call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, maintains the 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and the 50% tariff on metals. Trump also stated that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers, a key point of discussion between the two nations. This extension provides temporary stability and avoids an escalation that was set to occur, with both leaders expressing optimism about reaching a formal trade deal within the 90-day period.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The College Sports Commission (CSC) has eased its restrictions on name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, avoiding further legal battles over athlete compensation. The new guidance allows third-party collectives to pay players if the deal is for promoting goods or services sold to the public for profit, relaxing a previous, stricter interpretation. This change provides a more liberal view of what constitutes a 'valid business purpose,' focusing on the substance of the deal rather than the 'collective' label. The move brings more clarity to the evolving landscape of college sports, where schools can now also pay players directly under a separate settlement.</p>

          <p>A pediatric oncology nurse from Boston, Kristin McIntire, missed her planned ride in the Pan-Mass Challenge charity cycling event for a life-saving reason: to donate stem cells. After being identified as a match for a leukemia patient, she spent the event weekend undergoing the donation procedure. McIntire, an avid cyclist who has completed 10 marathons, found another way to fulfill her commitment by completing the ride virtually in the following weeks. Her story highlights the profound impact of stem cell donation, a process that she describes as making her 'a little tired' in exchange for saving a person's life.</p>

          <p>According to dermatologist Dr. Renita Ahluwalia, an effective anti-aging skincare routine can be simplified to three essential, science-backed products. She advises that instead of using numerous unproven creams and serums, people should universally incorporate sunscreen, a vitamin C serum, and a retinol product. Sunscreen is described as a 'non-negotiable' daily staple to prevent sun damage, the primary cause of photoaging. A well-formulated vitamin C serum acts as an antioxidant shield, while retinol helps increase cell turnover and stimulate collagen, addressing fine lines and pigmentation. This pared-back approach focuses on investing in quality products with proven efficacy.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has broken with decades of tradition by no longer explicitly naming its competitors in its annual regulatory report. In its latest 101-page filing, mentions of rivals like Apple, IBM, and even partner-turned-competitor OpenAI were absent, a departure from the previous year's report which named over 25 companies. This move contrasts with the common industry practice of identifying specific rivals, although companies like Amazon and Alphabet have also stopped this practice in recent years.

The proposals also seek to cap invoice payment terms at a maximum of 60 days, eventually reducing to 45 days.

By embedding their critique of Paramount within a provocative and viral storyline featuring Trump, creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone managed to address a complex, industry-focused issue in a way that was accessible and pointed, sparking widespread discussion.</p>

          <p>A remarkable new study suggests that the modern potato originated from an ancient hybridization event between an ancestor of the tomato and another flowering plant. Researchers found that this improbable union, occurring 8-9 million years ago, produced a new lineage that gained the novel ability to form tubers, the nutrient-storage organs we eat as potatoes. Neither parent plant could form tubers, but their hybrid offspring combined the necessary genetic material to do so, allowing it to thrive in new, harsher environments. This discovery recasts the evolutionary history of one of the world's most important food crops.</p>

Scientists believe these organisms survive not on nutrients trickling down from above, but by capitalizing on chemical energy produced by microbes from carbon accumulated in the trench floor.
