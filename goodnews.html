          <p>An opinion article addresses concerns about Hong Kong's legal system after 2047, when the 'One Country, Two Systems' framework is set to expire. The author urges calm, drawing on experiences from the 1970s when similar anxieties arose about the 1997 handover. The article suggests that Hong Kong should not revisit alarmist sentiments and that its legal professionals should not be overly concerned about an immediate shift to mainland law. It is important to maintain confidence in the existing legal framework to ensure stability and continued economic activity in Hong Kong.</p>

          <p>Poland is holding a presidential election amidst heightened security concerns related to the war in Ukraine and questions regarding the U.S.'s commitment to European security. The front-runners are Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski, the pro-EU Warsaw Mayor, and Karol Nawrocki, a nationalist historian backed by the Law and Justice party. Trzaskowski supports abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki champions conservative values and national sovereignty. The outcome will significantly shape Poland's political trajectory and its approach to key social and international issues, potentially leading to political gridlock depending on who wins.</p>

          <p>A new internal survey by the Bundeswehr indicates that extremist attitudes within the German military are not systemic, with only a small percentage of soldiers displaying right-wing extremist views. However, the study also reveals that some soldiers hold chauvinistic and xenophobic attitudes. Despite safeguards and legal obligations for soldiers to uphold democratic rights, some researchers remain skeptical, suggesting the military may not be doing enough to address the complexity of modern right-wing mindsets, especially with increasing recruitment efforts. The study was conducted in the wake of increased scrutiny on right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece contrasts the resurgence of night train travel in Europe with the decline of long-distance public transport in the United States. Europe is revitalizing its sleeper train network to compete with short-haul flights, driven by environmental concerns and government support for high-speed rail. In contrast, the U.S. prioritizes cars and air travel, neglecting investment in rail infrastructure and often favoring niche transportation projects over proven transit systems. The author advocates for revitalizing American railways to offer a sustainable and community-oriented alternative to car dependence and air travel.</p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund large infrastructure projects in Africa, marking a shift from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This model involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for financing construction. Projects like Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway extension and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway are being pursued through PPPs. This approach aims to alleviate African governments' debt concerns and sustain infrastructure development, with Chinese firms recouping investments through toll fees and operating rights.</p>

The changes aim to address a $12 billion deficit attributed to President Donald Trump's tariffs and rising healthcare costs. While Newsom affirms his commitment to protecting immigrant communities, he argues that these measures are necessary to ensure Medi-Cal's fiscal stability.

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day to night and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous conditions. The storm, driven by high winds from thunderstorms, reduced visibility to near-zero in some areas, including Chicago. Such dust storms are uncommon in the region, with the last significant event occurring during the Dust Bowl era. The dry soil conditions in central Illinois contributed to the intensity of the storm, highlighting the impact of drought on weather patterns.</p>
