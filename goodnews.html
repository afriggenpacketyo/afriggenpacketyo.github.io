          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott has signed a controversial $1 billion school choice bill into law, allowing taxpayer money to be used for private school tuition. The bill provides most students attending accredited private schools with $10,000 per year, students with disabilities with up to $30,000 per year, and home-schooled students with $2,000 a year. Democrats argue the legislation hurts public schools, while supporters say it provides families with more educational options.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk's SpaceX rocket facility in South Texas is moving towards becoming an official city named Starbase, following a vote approved by local residents, primarily SpaceX employees. The creation of Starbase has drawn both support for its job creation and investment in the area, and criticism over concerns it will expand Musk's personal control over the region. Companion bills in the state legislature aim to shift authority over beach closures from the county to the new town's government.</p>
