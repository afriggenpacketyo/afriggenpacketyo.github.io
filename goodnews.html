          <p>Strategy's bitcoin treasury strategy is inspiring other companies to adopt similar approaches, including meme stock companies and media firms. Trump Media announced plans to raise $2.5 billion to buy bitcoin, and GameStop revealed a $500 million allocation. Michael Saylor, Strategy Chairman, believes this marks a global shift in corporate finance, with interest exploding in Hong Kong, Korea, Abu Dhabi, the Middle East, and the U.K. The Biden administration has often treated corporate bitcoin adoption as a regulatory red flag, but under President Donald Trump, the tone has changed with the establishment of a U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.

          <p>Doctors at the University of Maryland Medical Center performed a first-of-its-kind surgery to remove a tumor on a patient's spine through her eye. Karla Flores, who was initially diagnosed with a chordoma on her brain stem, had a second chordoma discovered on her spinal cord during an MRI. The team developed a unique surgical plan, called the "third nostril" approach, to access the tumor through the side of Flores' eye. The procedure took about 20 hours and involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone, but the chordoma was successfully removed and Flores has no evidence of cancer nearly a year after completing treatment.</p>

          <p>Lyft has made significant improvements under CEO David Risher, streamlining operations and enhancing platform functionality, leading to increased revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. Despite these improvements, Lyft's share price has decreased, potentially due to its duopoly with Uber and suboptimal capital allocation practices. Engine Capital has called for a strategic review, improved capital allocation, and the elimination of the dual-class share structure. Engine withdrew their director nominations after Lyft announced an increase in its share repurchase authorization, indicating positive engagement between the company and the activist investor.</p>

          <p>A rare, gold lobster was saved from being cooked at a New England restaurant due to a cook recognizing its unique genetic mutation. The cook pulled the lobster, named Calvin, from a basket of lobsters ready to be cooked, and the restaurant donated it to the Biomes Marine Biology Center. The lobster's golden color is due to a genetic mutation that occurs in approximately one in 30 million lobsters. The Biomes center is now displaying Calvin, and visitors can learn about his unique characteristics.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Matthijs de Ligt has praised Ruben Amorim's blunt approach, stating that it will benefit the club in the long run. Amorim has delivered withering statements about United during his short time in charge, including calling his side the worst in Manchester United history. De Ligt feels that Amorim's words are positive because of his nationality and the Dutch reputation for blunt speaking. He believes that this directness will ultimately lead to improvements within the team.</p>

          <h2>Jamie Overton Ruled Out of England's ODI Series Due to Broken Finger</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 07:00:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jamie Overton has been ruled out of England's remaining one-day internationals against West Indies after breaking his little finger. The injury occurred while attempting to take a return catch during England's win in the series-opener. Overton is expected to be sidelined for about a month, which means he will also miss the three T20s against West Indies. Matthew Potts has been called up to replace Overton in the England XI, earning his first ODI cap since September.</p>
