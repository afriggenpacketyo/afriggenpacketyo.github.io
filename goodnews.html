          <p>A free-kick goal by Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze against Chelsea was correctly disallowed by VAR due to a lesser-known rule. The decision was made because a Palace player was standing less than one meter away from Chelsea's defensive wall when the kick was taken. This regulation, introduced in the 2019-20 season under Law 13, is designed to prevent attacking players from interfering with the wall and causing delays. The referee announced the specific reason for the disallowance to the stadium crowd, providing clarity on the application of the rule.</p>

          <p>In an interview, Alaska Senator Dan Sullivan characterized the summit between President Trump and Vladimir Putin as a "place-setting exercise" for more complex peace negotiations regarding Ukraine. He stated that the primary goal was to assess Putin's seriousness about a ceasefire, which would be the necessary first step before addressing territorial issues and security guarantees with Ukraine and NATO allies. Sullivan defended holding the summit on Alaskan soil, arguing it projects American strength through its military presence. He emphasized that the threat of severe sanctions is what brought Putin to the table.</p>

          <p>Air Canada is set to resume flight operations after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by more than 10,000 flight attendants. The Canadian Industrial Relations Board ordered staff to return to work, and the Jobs Minister initiated binding arbitration to resolve the dispute over salaries and pay for ground time. The union, which had caused around 700 flight cancellations, accused the government of "caving to corporate pressure" and violating workers' rights. The airline cautioned that while flights will restart, it will take several days to stabilize its schedule completely.</p>

          <p>A derelict Napoleonic fort on Thorne Island in Pembrokeshire, Wales, has been transformed into a luxury party venue and is now on the market for £3 million. New owner Mike Conner purchased the abandoned, off-grid island for £555,000 in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable. The historic 100-man fort, originally built in the 1850s, now features 40 beds, en-suite bathrooms, and a nightclub. The complex renovation required bringing all materials in by helicopter and housing a crew of workers on the island for years.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Sparks forward Cameron Brink attributes her positive mindset and successful recovery from a torn ACL to the practice of creating vision boards. The No. 2 draft pick began the practice during her 13-month rehabilitation at the suggestion of a teammate to combat the mental strain of the long process. By visualizing her goals—from Olympic rings to simply being a good teammate—Brink was able to maintain focus and manifest a positive outlook. This mental rehearsal and focus on incremental progress helped her manage pressure and make an immediate impact upon her return to the court.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man was rescued by helicopter after being trapped behind a powerful waterfall in California's Tulare County for two days. Ryan Wardwell was rappelling down the Seven Teacups waterfalls when the river's "extreme hydraulics" pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. After he was reported missing, a search and rescue team located him using a drone and a California Highway Patrol helicopter crew performed a hoist rescue. Wardwell was treated for dehydration and minor injuries in what the local sheriff's office called a "stunning survival story."</p>

          <p>UCLA football coach DeShaun Foster implemented a series of "brotherhood meetings" during training camp to build chemistry among a team with 55 new players and eight new assistant coaches. In these sessions, coaches and players shared personal stories and vulnerabilities, leading to what Foster described as emotional breakthroughs and "a lot of tears." The goal was to connect the team on a deeper level by having individuals open up about their anxieties and motivations. This effort to foster a collective mindset has resulted in a new team motto for the 2025 season: "We over me."</p>
