        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>George Clooney's latest film, "Jay Kelly," has premiered at the Venice Film Festival to a polarized critical reception, with some praising it as a masterpiece and others calling it self-indulgent. In the movie, directed by Noah Baumbach, Clooney portrays an aging movie star grappling with a midlife crisis, a role that draws parallels to his own public persona. The film explores themes of identity and the gap between public presentation and private reality, with Clooney's performance generating early awards season buzz. The supporting cast includes Adam Sandler and Laura Dern, who also reflect on their own experiences within the Hollywood system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Automotive research firm Edmunds reports that this Labor Day presents a significant opportunity for consumers to find deals on electric vehicle leases. This is primarily due to a $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and a $4,000 credit for used EVs, both of which are set to expire on September 30. With EV prices already declining amid softer demand, leasing has become the dominant method for acquiring them, accounting for 70% of transactions in July. The IRS has also clarified that a signed contract and down payment before the deadline will secure the credit, even if the vehicle is delivered later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece explores how China can positively influence Indonesia's palm oil industry as the Indonesian government cracks down on illegal plantations. With authorities confirming 3.7 million hectares of illegal plantations, the article argues that global demand is intrinsically linked to deforestation. As a primary consumer of Indonesian palm oil, China is positioned to help rewrite the industry's future by championing and demanding more sustainable and environmentally responsible production practices. This could help shift the economic narrative from one of growth at the expense of destruction to one of responsible partnership.</p>

          <p>The Dallas Cowboys have traded All-Pro edge rusher Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers following a prolonged and public contract dispute. As part of the move, Parsons has agreed to a four-year, $188 million contract extension with the Packers, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history with $136 million guaranteed. The rift between Parsons and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones grew after Jones refused to negotiate with Parsons' agent. In return for the 26-year-old defensive star, Dallas will receive two first-round draft picks and veteran defensive tackle Kenny Clark.</p>

          <p>Large, gelatinous masses described as looking like a "mutant brain" or "cursed gummy bear" and spotted in U.S. waterways have been identified by wildlife officials as magnificent bryozoans. Despite their strange appearance, these blobs are harmless colonies of thousands of tiny, filter-feeding invertebrates called zooids that work together in harmony. These ancient organisms, which have existed for hundreds of millions of years, play a beneficial role in their freshwater ecosystems by capturing plankton and cleaning the water. The colonies can sometimes grow to be over a foot wide.</p>
