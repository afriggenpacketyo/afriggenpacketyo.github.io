        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is preparing to discontinue the Transportation Security Administration's "Quiet Skies" program, a domestic surveillance program for travelers. The program, which began in 2010, aims to identify travelers who could present an elevated risk to aviation security using various data and monitoring techniques. Critics have long condemned the program for tracking U.S. citizens not suspected of any crimes, and the criteria for inclusion and removal from the Quiet Skies list have remained largely concealed from the public. The decision to end the program comes after debates about its uneven application and concerns about its impact on civil liberties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UConn head coach Dan Hurley has dismissed rumors linking him to the New York Knicks coaching job, stating, "Not another summer of that." The Knicks fired Tom Thibodeau despite a deep playoff run, prompting a search for a new head coach. Hurley, who has led UConn to two consecutive NCAA championships, declined a six-year contract offer from the Lakers last summer. The Phoenix Suns have hired Jordan Ott as their next head coach, removing another potential candidate from consideration for the Knicks position. Hurley signed a six-year extension with UConn last summer, committing to the Huskies through the 2029 season.</p>

          <p>A judge has ordered the Trump administration to take steps to give due process to deported migrants. The judge stated that men expelled under the Alien Enemies Act were likely treated unfairly, having been deported without the chance to contest their removals. This ruling highlights ongoing legal challenges to the administration's immigration policies and their impact on the rights of individuals seeking asylum. The court's decision underscores the importance of ensuring fair treatment and due process for all individuals, regardless of their immigration status.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally, has resigned as CEO of Shift4 Payments after President Trump withdrew his nomination for NASA administrator. Trump cited a "thorough review of prior associations" for the withdrawal, possibly referencing Isaacman's past donations to Democrats. Isaacman expressed that his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience" and stated he would do it all over again. The timing of the withdrawal coincided with Musk's criticism of Trump's tax-cut bill, adding to speculation about the reasons behind the decision. Isaacman will be succeeded as CEO by Taylor Lauber.</p>

          <p>Despite data indicating that college graduates earn more than non-graduates, skepticism about the value of a college degree persists in America. Confidence in higher education has fallen sharply, particularly among Republicans, and only a minority believe a four-year degree is essential for a well-paying job. The unemployment rate for recent graduates is at its highest since July 2021, but this is also attributed to post-pandemic economic patterns. Research suggests that the earnings gap between college and high school graduates has remained consistent since 2010, with low-income students seeing a declining relative value in a college education.</p>

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister assured Greece that Egypt will preserve the spiritual and religious value of the historic Saint Catherine's Monastery, which is part of the Greek Orthodox church. The statement came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders about the monastery's fate. The court ruled that the monastery sits on public land but affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites in the area. Saint Catherine's Monastery, established in the sixth century, holds immense religious and historical significance as the world's oldest continually inhabited Christian monastery.</p>

However, the fungus is commonly found in native grasses and crops across the U.S., causing a crop disease called Fusarium head blight. Scientists believe F. graminearum likely originated in North America, and farmers rely on methods such as fungicides to mitigate the risk of the disease. The FDA monitors for toxins produced by the fungus to prevent excessive contamination in the food supply.</p>
