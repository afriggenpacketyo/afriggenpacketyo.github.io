          <p>Walmart CFO John David Rainey has warned that consumers should expect to see price increases due to tariffs, despite recent agreements to lower duties on Chinese imports. The retail giant is attempting to navigate the situation by absorbing some costs and seeking alternative materials, but expects shoppers to see markups, particularly on items like toys and electronics sourced from China. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon noted that tariffs on goods from countries like Costa Rica and Peru are also impacting prices on items such as bananas and coffee. Rainey suggested that Walmart may strategically lower prices in some areas to gain market share during this period of higher prices. </p>

          <p>A Republican-backed bill is advancing in the House, proposing a series of tax cuts that could significantly affect millions of Americans. The bill aims to make President Trump's 2017 tax cuts permanent while introducing new reductions, including eliminating taxes on overtime pay and tips, as well as offering a $4,000 deduction for individuals aged 65 and older. While supporters claim the bill would provide an average tax reduction of $1,300 per taxpayer, Democrats have criticized its proposed cuts to Medicaid and food stamps. The legislation is expected to undergo changes as it moves through the legislative process, with potential impacts on various aspects of personal finance. </p>

          <p>Doctors have successfully treated a baby, KJ Muldoon, born with a rare genetic disorder using a gene-editing therapy specifically tailored to repair his unique mutation. The treatment, involving infusions of microscopic gene-editors, appears to have partially reversed his condition, reducing the risk of brain damage. This marks a significant step towards personalized medicine, offering potential treatments for other rare disorders that lack commercial incentive for pharmaceutical companies. Experts emphasize the need for longer-term follow-up to assess the treatment's durability, but this case represents a promising advancement in genetic cures. The technique is known as "base-editing."</p>

          <p>A 9¬Ω-month-old baby with a rare genetic condition has become the first patient to receive a custom gene-editing treatment, offering hope for individuals with thousands of other uncommon genetic diseases. Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia created a personalized infusion designed to correct the baby's specific mutation, carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (CPS1) deficiency. The treatment, which uses base editing, has shown promising results, allowing the baby to eat more protein and reducing his need for medication. This breakthrough could pave the way for cheaper and faster development of personalized gene therapies for a wide range of rare genetic disorders.

          <p>Several Republicans have declined to run for key U.S. Senate races in 2026, raising concerns about the party's ability to recruit competitive candidates. High-profile Republicans like Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia and former Gov. Chris Sununu of New Hampshire have opted not to run for Senate seats, leading to debate about whether Trump's influence is deterring centrist candidates. Some Republicans believe Trump's demands for absolute loyalty make it difficult for candidates to focus on local issues. Others argue that Kemp's decision was based on personal reasons and that Trump's win in Georgia in 2024 demonstrates continued Republican enthusiasm. The NRSC has indicated it will consider getting involved in Senate primaries on a case-by-case basis. </p>
