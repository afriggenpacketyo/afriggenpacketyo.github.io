          <p>The No. 3 Ohio State Buckeyes defeated the top-ranked Texas Longhorns 14-7 in a highly anticipated college football matchup, repeating their victory from last season's Cotton Bowl. Texas quarterback Arch Manning struggled in his first career road start against Ohio State's formidable defense, throwing for 170 yards, most of which came in the fourth quarter. The Longhorns' offense was repeatedly stalled, failing on three critical fourth-down conversion attempts. Ohio State's defense dominated the game, holding Texas scoreless until the final minutes and solidifying the Buckeyes' position as a national championship contender.</p>

          <p>Manchester United narrowly defeated Burnley 3-2, thanks to a stoppage-time penalty from Bruno Fernandes, providing a crucial win for manager Ruben Amorim. However, the victory was overshadowed by persistent goalkeeping errors, with goalkeeper Altay Bayindir's mistake leading to Burnley's second goal. This follows similar errors from the team's goalkeepers in previous matches, highlighting a significant issue for the club. The win was further complicated by injuries to key players Matheus Cunha and Mason Mount, adding to the challenges facing the team ahead of a difficult stretch of upcoming fixtures.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While no uniform international rules exist for children's screen time, a consensus among experts suggests a cautious approach based on developmental stages. For toddlers, the recommendation is "screen-free until three," as they need to explore the physical world and develop self-control. For preschool-aged children, excessive screen time can hinder the development of social skills and imagination, with a maximum of 30 minutes suggested. As children grow, the focus shifts from time limits to content and context, with experts advising supervised use and open communication to mitigate risks and ensure digital engagement doesn't replace crucial real-world interactions.</p>

          <p>Jack Grealish has experienced a remarkable resurgence since joining Everton on a season-long loan from Manchester City, where he had limited playing time. In his latest man-of-the-match performance, he provided two assists in a 3-2 victory at Wolverhampton Wanderers, repeating his feat from the previous week. Everton manager David Moyes praised Grealish's immediate impact, noting his creativity and presence on the field. Despite his strong club form, Grealish was recently left out of the England squad, but his revitalized performances are reigniting discussions about his potential return to the national team.</p>

          <p>New York City health officials have declared the Legionnaires' disease outbreak in central Harlem to be over, as no new cases have been reported since August 9. The outbreak resulted in 114 cases, 90 hospitalizations, and seven deaths. Investigators traced the source of the Legionella bacteria to cooling towers at Harlem Hospital and a nearby construction site, which have since been disinfected. In response, Mayor Eric Adams' administration has proposed new regulations to enhance the city's detection and response capabilities, including more frequent testing of cooling towers to prevent future clusters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that stethoscopes enhanced with artificial intelligence can detect three major heart conditions—heart failure, valve disease, and abnormal rhythms—in seconds. Researchers from Imperial College London conducted a study across over 200 GP surgeries, finding the device significantly improved detection rates compared to traditional methods. The AI stethoscope analyzes subtle sounds in heartbeat and blood flow that are undetectable by the human ear and compares them to a vast patient database. Experts believe this innovation could be a "game-changer" for early diagnosis, allowing patients to receive treatment sooner.</p>
