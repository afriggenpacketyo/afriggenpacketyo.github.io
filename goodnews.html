        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei and SMIC, adding them to its "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List" and requiring licenses for domestic firms shipping products to these entities. This move aligns Taiwan more closely with U.S. trade policy amid growing tensions with Beijing, as both Huawei and SMIC are already on a U.S. trade blacklist. According to an analyst, the new export controls aim to reinforce existing policies and tighten loopholes, potentially increasing penalties for future breaches. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) already adheres to U.S. export restrictions, and this action is likely to further solidify those measures.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani is scheduled to make his pitching return on Monday against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB pitching appearance since August 2023.

Ohtani is expected to pitch short innings, with Dodgers manager Dave Roberts noting Ohtani's eagerness to return to pitching.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos experienced a significant surge following a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, led by ADNOC's investment arm XRG, represents a substantial premium over Santos' previous closing price. Santos' board intends to recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, contingent on the absence of a superior proposal. This potential acquisition would grant the consortium control of key Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in PNG LNG and Papua LNG.</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, urging private sector firms to take proactive steps to protect key systems and sensitive industrial data. New legislation allows the government to track online communications and take early action against harmful servers, while obliging companies to report cyberattacks. This move aims to counter cyber threats mainly from China, North Korea, and Russia. NEC Corp. is developing AI-driven systems to combat increasingly sophisticated attacks, and the government plans to increase the number of trained cybersecurity workers by 2030.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales in May experienced their most rapid growth since late 2023, driven by government subsidies that stimulated consumption. The surge in retail sales provides a positive sign for the world's second-largest economy, which has been grappling with persistent deflation. However, industrial output slowed slightly, and fixed-asset investment also showed a deceleration. Declining property prices remain a concern, potentially dampening consumer sentiment despite the overall improvement in retail activity.</p>

          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites. This action is in response to the illegality of gambling with overseas-based betting sites in Japan, prompting the government to urge operators to cut off access to their sites. The move comes after revelations that some professional athletes and celebrities have used online casinos, leading to a crackdown on illegal gambling. The government plans to tighten regulations on online gambling and reiterate its request to the eight nations after a new bill is passed.</p>

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and U.S. President Donald Trump are potentially meeting in Canada during the G7 summit to discuss ongoing bilateral tariff talks. The leaders aim to follow up on ministerial-level discussions to conclude a mutually beneficial deal following the imposition of higher import tariffs by the United States. Tokyo is advocating for Washington to focus on boosting investment and jobs rather than imposing tariffs to reduce the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. The leaders are also likely to address security alliance issues amidst China's military activities and North Korea's weapons programs.</p>

The figures suggest some resilience in the Chinese economy despite ongoing trade pressures.</p>
