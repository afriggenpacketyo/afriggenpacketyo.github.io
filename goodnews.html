Press secretary Karoline Leavitt stated the results revealed chronic venous insufficiency, a common and benign condition for his age, with no signs of deep vein thrombosis or arterial disease. The administration also attributed minor bruising on Trump's hand to frequent handshaking and aspirin use, reassuring the public that the president remains in excellent health following his annual physical.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on six key leaders and affiliates of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, including its head, Hector "Niño Guerrero" Flores. The sanctions aim to dismantle the gang's operations, which span illegal mining, human trafficking, sexual assault, and murder across the Western Hemisphere. This action is part of the Trump administration's broader strategy to label the gang as a foreign terrorist organization and disrupt its destabilizing influence in the region, aligning with its goal to 'Make America Safe Again.'</p>

          <p>The Ukrainian parliament has approved Yulia Svyrydenko, a former economy minister, as the new prime minister, replacing Denys Shmyhal after more than five years in office. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy initiated the reshuffle to better implement agreements with international partners, though the move has faced criticism from the opposition regarding its legality under martial law. While Svyrydenko is seen as a dynamic and experienced negotiator, political analysts suggest the change is unlikely to alter key domestic policies, which will continue to be directed by the president's office.</p>

          <p>Senator Elizabeth Warren and other Democratic lawmakers have introduced a bill aimed at making corporate price gouging illegal, granting enforcement power to the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The proposed legislation specifically targets companies that exploit market shocks, such as inflation or President Trump's tariff policies, to excessively raise prices on consumers. The bill would also mandate public reporting on significant price changes for large companies and provide $1 billion in additional funding to the FTC for enforcement, a move supported by major labor unions.</p>

          <p>A group of Democratic lawmakers, joined by one Republican, has introduced legislation to amend the Stafford Act to include extreme heat as a major disaster, which would make affected areas eligible for federal FEMA assistance. Proponents argue that heat waves are the deadliest form of extreme weather and that federal funding is needed for cooling centers, air conditioning, and heat adaptation projects. However, some, including a former FEMA administrator, argue that the existing law already allows for such declarations and that the focus should be on hazard mitigation grants.</p>

          <p>The UK government's plan to lower the voting age to 16 has sparked debate over which political parties might benefit from the change. While polls indicate younger voters currently favor Labour and other left-leaning parties, analysts caution that this trend is not guaranteed to hold, especially with the rise of parties like Reform UK on social media. Furthermore, research from other countries and the relatively small size of the 16-17 year-old demographic suggest the overall impact on national election results would likely be negligible, though it could influence outcomes in marginal constituencies.</p>
