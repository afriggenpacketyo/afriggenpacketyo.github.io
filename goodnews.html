          <p>Home Depot's stock increased by 3% after the company reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast, signaling confidence despite narrowly missing Wall Street's second-quarter earnings and revenue expectations. This marks the first time since 2014 that the retailer fell short on both metrics, attributing the performance to a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty. However, the company noted positive momentum with a 2.6% rise in big-ticket transactions over $1,000 and improved sales trends each month throughout the quarter, suggesting underlying resilience in its business.

          <p>Chinese electric vehicle giant BYD has officially registered a local unit as a car manufacturer in Argentina, signaling a potential move to begin vehicle production in the country. The filing authorizes BYD Auto Argentina S.A.U. to manufacture, import, and sell vehicles, batteries, and auto parts, covering the entire EV supply chain. This development is part of BYD's broader expansion strategy in Latin America, which also includes Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. If production plans are confirmed, this would mark the company's second vehicle factory in the region, further solidifying its global manufacturing footprint.</p>

          <p>Major food and beverage chains like McDonald's, Starbucks, and Dunkin' are increasingly relying on new and customized drink offerings to drive sales, particularly among younger consumers. The number of beverage options at top chains has risen over 9% in the last year, with a strong emphasis on cold drinks, specialty coffees, and energy drinks. This strategy shift comes as consumers are more frequently visiting establishments solely for a "pick-me-up" beverage rather than as a food add-on. As companies compete for Gen Z's attention, they are launching products ranging from nostalgic cereal-flavored lattes to protein-infused cold foams to capture market share.</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that Intel will be required to give the U.S. government a non-voting equity stake in the company in exchange for receiving funds from the CHIPS Act. This policy shift turns what was previously a grant under the Biden administration into an equity investment for the American public. The move is part of the Trump administration's push for greater reshoring of U.S. manufacturing to reduce reliance on foreign chipmakers like TSMC and Samsung. Following the news and a separate $2 billion investment from SoftBank, Intel's stock saw a significant rally amid discussions of increased government involvement with the struggling chipmaker.

          <p>Following a series of meetings with European leaders, President Trump is now working to arrange the first face-to-face summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy since the war began. Trump stated he has spoken with Putin, who was receptive to the idea, and that a location for the meeting, possibly Budapest, could be decided this week. The plan is for the two leaders to meet bilaterally first, after which Trump might join for a trilateral session to finalize a peace agreement. This diplomatic push follows discussions about providing U.S.-coordinated security guarantees for Ukraine, though Trump has specified this would not involve U.S. ground troops.</p>

          <p>S&P Global has maintained its AA+ credit rating for long-term U.S. sovereign debt, citing an expectation that revenue from President Trump's tariffs will largely offset the fiscal impact of his recent tax-and-spending legislation. The ratings agency projects that "meaningful" tariff revenue will counteract the weaker fiscal outcomes associated with the bill, which the CBO estimated would increase the deficit by $3.4 trillion over the next decade. However, S&P warned it could lower the rating in the future if deficits continue to rise due to political inability to control spending or if political instability threatens U.S. institutions.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-19 15:23:40 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The senior living real estate market is facing a significant supply shortage as demand rapidly increases with the aging baby boomer population. Over the next five years, more than 4 million boomers will turn 80, yet annual inventory growth for senior housing has fallen below 1% for the first time since 2006. High interest rates are a primary barrier to new development, creating what experts call a "catastrophic problem" for the industry. This supply-demand imbalance is creating a strong investment opportunity, with real estate investment trusts like Ventas and private firms aggressively acquiring existing properties below replacement cost.
