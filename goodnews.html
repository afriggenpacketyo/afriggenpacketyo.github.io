          <p>Fashion retailer H&M reported a 40% year-on-year increase in operating profit for its fiscal third quarter, surpassing analyst expectations and causing its share price to jump. The positive results suggest that the company's turnaround strategy, which focuses on cost controls and a return to core product lines under CEO Daniel Erver, is beginning to yield results. However, the company cautioned that the full impact of U.S. tariffs on imports is expected to be felt in the coming months, potentially leading to price increases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Patricia Lockwood's latest novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," delves into the profound changes brought on by chronic illness, specifically long COVID. This book review highlights how the novel follows a writer, also named Patricia, as she navigates the lingering and disorienting effects of the virus over four years, including memory loss and a shattered sense of self. The narrative is praised for its poetic prose and open-minded exploration of being sick, capturing how the illness replaces the old self with a new, unfamiliar one, thereby adding a unique voice to the growing canon of sickness literature.</p>

The visit comes after North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met with President Xi Jinping, where both leaders reaffirmed their strong bilateral ties regardless of the international situation. The diplomatic engagement signals that Beijing and Pyongyang remain closely aligned, even as South Korea's new president has pursued closer engagement with China.</p>

          <p>To combat the overwhelming volume of robocalls and spam messages, Apple has introduced new screening features in its iOS 26 update. A new AI-powered option, which is off by default, has Siri intercept calls from unknown numbers to ask for the reason of the call, transcribing the response for the user in real-time. Additionally, enhanced filtering for text messages automatically sorts messages from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate folders, aiming to make the iPhone more usable for its primary communication functions.</p>

          <h2>Ticketmaster to Improve Price Transparency Following Investigation into Oasis Tour Sales</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 06:04:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), Ticketmaster has agreed to provide fans with clearer information about ticket prices in advance. The probe was launched after complaints that the company may have misled fans during the sale of Oasis reunion tour tickets by using an unclear tiered pricing system, which resulted in some tickets costing nearly two and a half times the standard price. While the CMA found no evidence of illegal "dynamic pricing," Ticketmaster will now have to provide more upfront details and use accurate labeling.</p>

          <h2>NYC Mayoral Candidate Zohran Mamdani Uses Soccer to Advance Progressive Platform</h2>

          <p>This article analyzes how Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for New York City mayor, is leveraging soccer to connect with voters and promote his progressive agenda. By launching a petition against FIFA's dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, Mamdani has framed the issue of ticket affordability as part of his broader campaign against corporate greed and for cost-of-living relief. This move is seen as a shrewd attempt by the left to re-engage with sports, a domain often dominated by conservative politicians, using soccer's global appeal and economic issues to resonate with a progressive-leaning fanbase.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), once the world's third busiest, has fallen to 11th place globally as passenger counts lag in post-pandemic recovery. The airport is in the midst of a $30-billion transformation aimed at modernizing its aging infrastructure ahead of the 2028 Olympics, including the long-delayed Automated People Mover train. Officials hope the overhaul will improve the passenger experience and reverse the airport's decline, but the massive construction project continues to face setbacks and logistical challenges.</p>

          <p>Millions of California residents will see a credit on their October electricity bills as part of the state's biannual California Climate Credit program. The refund, which will range from approximately $56 to over $250 depending on the utility provider, is derived from the state's cap-and-invest program that requires large polluters to buy allowances for their greenhouse gas emissions. Following recently signed legislation that extends the program, these credits are expected to increase in the coming years, providing further financial relief to ratepayers.</p>
