          <p>AI software company Palantir reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, significantly surpassing Wall Street expectations. The company's revenue grew 48% year-over-year, driven by strong performance in its U.S. government and commercial sectors. As a result of this strong performance and a 140% increase in contract value, Palantir has raised its full-year revenue guidance and lifted its outlook for operating income and free cash flow. The company's stock has more than doubled this year, reflecting investor confidence in its AI tools and government contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Flaco Jiménez, the celebrated Tex-Mex accordionist who died at 86, is being remembered for his profound musical influence and his often-overlooked political engagement. Known for collaborations with artists like the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan, Jiménez also used his music to support civil rights and social causes. The article highlights his 1976 performance of "Un Mojado Sin Licencia" ("A Wetback Without a License"), a song that uses humor to critique American xenophobia and the struggles of undocumented immigrants. This approach of finding joy and defiance in the face of hardship is presented as a powerful form of resistance.</p>

          <p>Dame Stella Rimington, the first woman to serve as director general of the British security service MI5, has died at the age of 90. She led the agency from 1992 to 1996 and was the first head to be publicly named, ushering in an era of greater transparency. Her leadership period included overseeing MI5's move to Thames House and taking on primary responsibility for countering Irish republican terrorism in Great Britain. After retiring, she became a successful author of spy novels and was widely seen as the inspiration for Dame Judi Dench's portrayal of "M" in the James Bond films.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new production of "Jesus Christ Superstar" at the Hollywood Bowl presented a challenging and vulnerable take on the classic rock opera. The casting of Cynthia Erivo, a queer woman of color, as Jesus and Adam Lambert, a gay man, as Judas brought fresh perspectives to the roles. The review praises Erivo's sensitive and emotionally raw performance, which highlighted the character's fragility, and Lambert's powerful, show-stealing portrayal of Judas. The production's minimalist, concert-like aesthetic and dynamic staging by director Sergio Trujillo were also commended for effectively serving the story's tragic and intense themes.</p>

          <p>New scientific research proposes a novel theory to explain the unusually high nitrogen values often found in the remains of Neanderthals. Scientists have long been puzzled by this chemical signature, which has influenced theories about their diet. This new study suggests that the high nitrogen levels may not be from what Neanderthals ate directly, but from the consumption of maggots that had infested their stored food supplies. This alternative explanation could reshape the understanding of Neanderthal dietary habits and food storage practices.</p>

          <p>Shares of design software company Figma fell 27% on Monday, giving back a significant portion of the gains from its successful stock market debut last week. The company's stock had more than tripled on its first day of trading, indicating strong investor appetite for new, high-growth tech IPOs. Despite the recent drop, Figma's valuation remains substantially higher than the price Adobe had offered in a 2022 acquisition attempt that was later blocked by regulators. The company has shown consistent profitability and projects continued strong revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle surged over 23% after former President Donald Trump praised its new marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump called the ad the "hottest out there," which appeared to reverse a recent stock slump for the company. The campaign's slogan, "Sydney Sweeney has great jeans," had previously faced some criticism for being a double entendre, sparking a culture war debate. The incident highlights the volatile impact of political and cultural discourse on brand marketing and stock performance in a polarized environment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With ongoing inflation and market volatility, many savers are considering annuities to secure retirement income, facing a choice between fixed and variable options. In the current high-interest-rate environment, fixed annuities offer attractive, guaranteed returns, providing safety and predictability for risk-averse individuals. Conversely, variable annuities offer the potential for higher, market-linked growth that can better hedge against long-term inflation, appealing to those with a longer time horizon and higher risk tolerance. The article advises that the best choice depends on an individual's financial goals, risk comfort, and timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 15:35:49 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After more than a decade of mystery, researchers have identified the cause of the sea star wasting disease that has killed billions of the animals along the U.S. West Coast since 2013. A study published in Nature Ecology & Evolution pinpoints a specific bacterium, *Vibrio pectinocida*, as the culprit. The epidemic was particularly devastating for the sunflower sea star, a keystone species whose population collapse led to an explosion of sea urchins and the destruction of vital kelp forests. This discovery is a major breakthrough, enabling the development of diagnostic tests and targeted conservation strategies to help restore these critical marine ecosystems.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Cabinet Office has appointed business leader Moni Mannings to chair a new diversity and outreach committee for the national honours system. The move aims to make the process of awarding honours like knighthoods more inclusive and representative of the entire country. This follows a BBC analysis showing that higher awards disproportionately go to individuals in southern England and from wealthier backgrounds. The new committee will advise the government and encourage a wider range of nominations from under-represented regions and communities to ensure the system celebrates excellence from all walks of life.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has granted CEO Elon Musk an interim stock award worth approximately $29 billion in an effort to incentivize him to remain with the company. This "good faith" payment is intended to honor a 2018 pay package worth over $50 billion that was voided by a Delaware court last year. The new award is contingent on Musk staying in a top executive role for two more years and the original package not being reinstated on appeal. The move comes as Tesla faces declining sales and increased competition, with the board emphasizing Musk's importance for talent retention. (not investment advice)</p>
