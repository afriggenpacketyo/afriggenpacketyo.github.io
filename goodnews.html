          <p>University of Texas quarterback Arch Manning demonstrated a significant return to form during a 55-0 victory over Sam Houston State. Manning accounted for five touchdowns, throwing for 309 yards and three scores while also running for two more. After one rushing touchdown, he engaged in a verbal exchange with a defender, an act he later admitted his mother was upset about but attributed to built-up frustration. Teammates and coaches noted his restored confidence and swagger, a stark contrast to his performances in previous weeks.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch, and likely his father Rupert Murdoch, will be part of the investment group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. The deal is being structured to prevent a ban on the popular social media app, which was mandated by Congress over national security concerns related to its Chinese ownership. Trump also mentioned that Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell are involved, describing the investors as "American patriots" who will do a good job managing the platform.</p>

          <p>The Azerbaijan Grand Prix proved to be a challenging event for McLaren's Formula 1 drivers, potentially impacting their championship hopes. Lando Norris finished seventh after a qualifying session where he hit a wall, a result he attributed to difficult track conditions and a strategic decision to run first. Meanwhile, his teammate and championship contender Oscar Piastri had an uncharacteristically error-filled weekend, crashing in both qualifying and the race. The poor results allowed rival Max Verstappen to gain ground in the drivers' standings, highlighting the competitive pressure of the season.</p>

          <p>England defeated Ireland by six wickets in the third T20 international to secure a 2-0 series victory, the first ever between the two nations. Chasing a target of 155, England's effort was anchored by a crucial 55 runs from Jordan Cox, who was a late addition to the squad. England's bowlers, led by Adil Rashid's three wickets, had earlier restricted the Irish batting lineup on a slow pitch. The win sealed the series for the tourists after the first match was won by England and the second was washed out by rain.</p>

          <p>London held a one-day trial banning all vehicle traffic from a half-mile stretch of Oxford Street, one of the world's busiest shopping districts. Mayor Sadiq Khan, who supports making the change permanent, hailed the event as the beginning of a "fight back to rescue this street." The plan aims to increase footfall and create a more pleasant environment for shoppers and visitors. However, the proposal has raised concerns from some local councillors and residents about traffic being diverted to smaller side streets and potential accessibility issues for people with mobility challenges.</p>

          <p>American runner Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000m at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo with a dramatic finishing kick. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final lap but unleashed a powerful surge to overtake the field and win in 12 minutes and 58.30 seconds. The victory served as a moment of redemption for Hocker, who said he felt he was "robbed" after being controversially disqualified from the 1500m semifinals earlier in the competition for jostling.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team, has suggested that the home crowd at Bethpage Black might turn against the American team if they fail to perform. He pointed to the controversial decision for U.S. players to each receive a $500,000 payment for participating, a first for the event, while European players continue to compete for free. Donald believes that New York fans, facing high ticket prices, could be particularly critical of a paid team that is not delivering, adding a unique psychological pressure to the biennial competition.</p>

          <p>Passenger rail travel is currently booming in the United States, signaling a potential shift in transportation habits. Amtrak, the national railway corporation, has seen a significant increase in ridership and is capitalizing on the trend with a strong social media presence and the launch of new, European-style train sets. The introduction of the next-generation Acela service on the Boston to Washington, D.C. corridor is a key part of this modernization effort. This growing interest suggests an increasing public appetite for alternatives to driving and flying for intercity travel.</p>

          <p>In a milestone event for urban environmental restoration, hundreds of swimmers plunged into the Chicago River for the first officially sanctioned swim in almost a century. The event highlights the remarkable transformation of the waterway, which was once notoriously polluted with sewage and industrial waste. Decades of cleanup efforts, spurred by the Clean Water Act and local advocacy, have restored the river's health, allowing it to become a recreational hub. The swim symbolizes a renewed connection between Chicagoans and a natural resource that was long considered untouchable.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve interest rate cut, some Wall Street strategists believe the stock market's record-setting rally could have more room to run. Optimism is fueled by easier financial conditions and the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence, which analysts argue is driving productivity and justifies higher valuations. While the S&P 500's valuation is high by historical standards, some argue the market's composition has changed. However, other experts caution that further rate cuts could fuel a speculative "melt-up" driven by investor FOMO rather than fundamentals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to aging and well-being expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the biological aging process at a cellular level. The article explains that stress speeds up the shortening of telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, which is a key marker of aging. However, this damage is not irreversible. Epel recommends several daily practices to de-stress and promote cellular restoration, including eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, prioritizing deep rest, and incorporating more Omega-3s into one's diet.</p>

          <p>The Liberal Democrats are considering ending their long-held opposition to national identity cards, a significant policy shift for the party. The party was instrumental in scrapping Labour's previous ID card plans when it entered a coalition government in 2010. However, with reports that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is planning a new digital ID scheme, Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey stated that "times have changed" and the party should not have a "knee-jerk" opposition, citing a positive impression of Estonia's digital ID system.</p>
