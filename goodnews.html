        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery revealed its plan to divide the company into two distinct public entities by the following year. The split will create Streaming and Studios, which encompasses movie properties and HBO Max, and Global Networks, including CNN, TNT Sports, and Discovery. David Zaslav will serve as CEO of Streaming and Studios, while Gunnar Wiedenfels will head Global Networks. This strategic move aims to streamline operations and enhance focus within the evolving media landscape. The company hopes this will lead to better financial performance.</p>

          <p>Chicago is employing various strategies to resist Trump's immigration policies, rooted in collaboration between organizations dating back to the first Trump administration. These strategies include community meetings, rapid-response groups, and hotlines to monitor ICE activity. Volunteer interest in anti-deportation efforts has surged, but immigrants in Chicago still express fear as Trump threatens to ramp up deportations. Despite challenges from conservative city council members, Chicago has maintained its sanctuary city status, with policies protecting immigrants and limiting ICE's power in communities. The ability for Chicago organizers to respond effectively stems from strong relationships, trust, and a common commitment among organizations. Solidarity is vital.</p>

          <p>Theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek discusses the fruitful interplay between physics inside materials and fundamental physics in empty space, highlighting its role in modern electronics and ongoing innovations. He contrasts ancient and early scientific views of the world as a material with Newton's concept of immaterial space. The article traces the evolution of these ideas, leading to Maxwell's space-filling medium mimicking electric and magnetic fields. The exploration delves into the philosophical and practical implications of considering the universe and quasi-worlds, blurring the lines between fundamental physics and material science. The article is the sixth in a monthly series by the author.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reducing home energy use can be achieved through simple and inexpensive methods, such as opening windows for natural ventilation and utilizing ceiling fans instead of air conditioning. Reflective roofs can also help to alleviate cooling loads, while exterior shades prevent heat from entering the house. Sealing air leaks around windows and doors can further improve energy efficiency. These measures not only reduce climate pollution but also make homes more resilient to global warming and lower energy bills. Simple changes can make a big difference.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix's 'The Eternaut' presents a chilling adaptation of the acclaimed Argentine comic, depicting a toxic snowfall that decimates Buenos Aires. The series follows Juan, a card player who ventures into the ghostly city to find his daughter, donning makeshift protective gear. This story holds special resonance in Argentina, where the original comic has attained near-mythic status due to its political undertones and the disappearance of its writer, H√©ctor Germ√°n Oesterheld, during a brutal military dictatorship. The series updates the action to a modern setting while retaining the core themes of collective action and societal horrors, garnering positive reception amidst current political and social unrest in Argentina. A second season has been confirmed.</p>

          <p>The UK government is considering extending a ban on ocean bottom trawling across English waters to protect marine ecosystems. The proposal would expand the ban from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2 of offshore areas already designated as protected, pending a 12-week industry consultation. This announcement comes as Sir David Attenborough warns of the destructive impact of bottom trawling at the UN Ocean Conference in France. President Macron called for a moratorium on deep sea mining and pressure is mounting for more countries to ratify the High Seas Treaty to protect international waters. The UK is among the countries that have yet to ratify.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says that artificial intelligence is making programming more accessible, as anyone can now program using everyday language. Speaking at London Tech Week, Huang explained that AI allows users to interact with computers conversationally, similar to training a person. He gave the example of asking a computer to write a poem, emphasizing that programming an AI is now as simple as asking it nicely. This shift is due to the development of conversational AI models like ChatGPT, which allow users to interact with computers using natural language. People can now program more effectively.</p>

          <p>St. George, Utah, is exploring an unconventional solution to water scarcity by reusing sewage. The city plans to build a wastewater reclamation plant that will clean effluent for reuse, addressing the challenges of population growth and climate change in the American West. The treated wastewater will initially be used for outdoor irrigation, freeing up drinking water for homes, with plans to directly introduce it into the drinking supply within two decades. This initiative, costing over a billion dollars, is part of a broader effort to address water stress in the Colorado River Basin. The city is planning for the future.</p>
