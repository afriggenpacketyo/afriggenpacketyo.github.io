          <p>Morningstar has launched the PitchBook US Modern Market 100 Index, a pioneering benchmark that combines public and private equity exposure, catering to a growing investor appetite for alternative assets. This index tracks 100 leading U.S. companies, with a 90/10 split between public and venture-backed firms such as OpenAI and Stripe, recognizing that many dynamic companies now choose to remain private for extended periods. The initiative aims to offer a more comprehensive representation of the modern asset universe, where private markets present substantial opportunities often overlooked by traditional public-only benchmarks.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed new plans that could eliminate the current £100 cap on contactless card payments, allowing banks and other providers to set their own limits, potentially making them unlimited. This initiative aims to align physical card payments with digital wallet transactions, which already operate without such restrictions, and acknowledges the continuous evolution of consumer payment habits. Despite 78% of consumers expressing concerns about increased theft and fraud during a consultation, the FCA maintains that providers will implement fraud prevention systems and consumers will remain protected.

This secure testing environment would enable AI firms to apply for waivers from existing regulations, thereby accelerating development, especially in sensitive areas like cancer screening software that might require modifications to HIPAA rules. The initiative aims to codify elements of the Trump administration's AI Action Plan into law, fostering U.S. leadership in AI innovation amidst global competition.

          <p>The race to elect a new Labour deputy leader has officially commenced following Angela Rayner's resignation from the role and her government positions, prompted by issues concerning her tax payments on a flat. Prospective candidates are required to secure the backing of at least 80 Labour MPs, followed by support from either 5% of local parties or three Labour-affiliated groups, including two unions. The ultimate winner will be determined by a vote among party members, with an announcement scheduled for October 25. Prominent contenders like Bridget Phillipson, Bell Ribeiro-Addy, and Lucy Powell are vying for the position, each representing diverse political leanings and backgrounds.

          <p>An opinion article posits that China, rather than Russia, stands to gain the most strategic advantage from the proposed Power of Siberia 2 pipeline. This assessment comes as Western sanctions on Moscow, imposed following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, compelled Europe to drastically reduce its reliance on Russian energy, forcing the Kremlin to actively seek alternative markets. Russia's initial attempts to establish Turkey as a gas hub proved largely unsuccessful, and its energy trade with Europe remains significantly below pre-war levels. This article suggests that China's negotiating leverage in energy deals with Russia has consequently increased considerably.</p>
