          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking 61% year-over-year increase in its second-quarter profit, significantly exceeding analyst expectations. This surge is primarily fueled by sustained high demand for artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple, with high-performance computing now accounting for 60% of its revenue. The company provided a strong forecast for the upcoming quarter and expects full-year revenue to grow by approximately 30%. Despite this positive outlook, TSMC acknowledges potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and global macroeconomic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares in Sweden's Volvo Cars jumped more than 10% after the company reported second-quarter operating profits that beat analyst forecasts, despite a significant year-on-year decline. The automaker, owned by China's Geely, is navigating a challenging market and the impact of US tariffs by adjusting its production strategy. To better utilize its South Carolina factory and mitigate tariff effects, Volvo plans to start producing its popular XC60 SUV in the US. This move comes as the company begins to phase out its sedan and station wagon models from the American market due to waning demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential new trade agreement between the United States and China is likely to be structured similarly to the phase one deal from Donald Trump's first term, according to former Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun. Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum, Biegun suggested the core of such a deal would involve substantial Chinese purchases of American agricultural and industrial goods. This framework is seen as a way to address the trade imbalance, which the U.S. president uses as a key metric for economic fairness. The original phase one deal, signed in 2020, was only partially fulfilled, a factor the current U.S. negotiators are reportedly considering. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The upcoming animated musical "Smurfs," starring Rihanna as Smurfette, is reigniting discussions about a long-standing sexist trope in pop culture known as the "Smurfette principle." Coined in 1991, the term describes the common practice of including a single female character in an otherwise all-male ensemble. While the new film reportedly gives Smurfette an empowering role, the character's name remains synonymous with this pattern, seen in franchises from "Star Wars" to "The Muppets." Previous "Smurfs" films have attempted to address the gender imbalance with varying degrees of success, reflecting Hollywood's ongoing struggle with representation.</p>

The seven-year framework also dedicates 35% of funds to climate projects, triples migration management funding, and includes €100 billion in support for Ukraine.

The visit highlights the ongoing danger of unexploded ordnance left from the country's civil war, which still threatens civilian lives daily.
