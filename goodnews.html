          <p>Senior Indian officials have refuted claims made by former U.S. President Donald Trump that his administration single-handedly brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. According to these officials, India kept key allies, including members of the Quad, informed about its actions against what it termed "terror bases" in Pakistan. These interactions, however, were briefings on actions already taken rather than mediations led by the U.S., as New Delhi's top diplomat, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, maintained regular contact with the Trump administration to provide updates on India's response to Pakistan's provocations. The Quad is an informal strategic forum comprising the US, India, Australia and Japan aimed at upholding a free and open Indo-Pacific.</p>

Chime generates revenue from interchange fees associated with purchases made using its debit and credit cards, offering services such as high-yield savings accounts, free tax filing, and early access to earned pay. The company experienced a 32% revenue growth in the March quarter, generating $12.4 million in net income on $518.7 million in revenue.</p>
