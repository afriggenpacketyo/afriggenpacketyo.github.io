          <h2>Researchers Identify Smoke-Dried Human Remains in Southeast Asia as Potentially World's Oldest Mummies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 07:00:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that human remains found across Southeast Asia, dating back up to 12,000 years, may be the world's oldest known mummies, predating previously known examples by thousands of years. Researchers discovered that hunter-gatherer communities likely used a smoke-drying process over fires to preserve the bodies of their ancestors. This practice is believed to have allowed relatives to maintain physical and spiritual connections with the deceased. The findings push back the timeline of mummification and suggest the tradition was widespread in ancient Asian cultures.</p>

          <p>Meta is set to introduce its most advanced smart glasses, codenamed Hypernova, at its annual Connect event, shifting its metaverse focus from virtual reality to a more accessible consumer device. The new glasses will feature a display controlled by a neural wristband and are part of the company's ongoing partnership with EssilorLuxottica. This launch comes as investors scrutinize the massive financial losses of Meta's Reality Labs division, which has lost nearly $70 billion since late 2020. The success of the new product is seen as a crucial test for Meta's long-term hardware ambitions.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 06:51:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump does not have the authority to remove Federal Reserve governor Lisa Cook from her position, delivering a blow to the administration. The 2-1 decision allows Cook, a Biden appointee, to participate in the upcoming policy meeting where an interest rate cut is expected. Trump had announced his intention to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denied, but the case has raised significant questions about the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A group calling itself the "Kingdom of Kubala" has been evicted by sheriff officers from privately-owned woodland near Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders. However, the three members simply dismantled their camp and re-established it a few meters away on the other side of a wire fence. The group, which claims ancestral rights to the land stolen 400 years ago, had ignored a previous court order to leave. The eviction follows a legal challenge by the landowners, with local officials stating the group is breaking the law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from the Department for Work and Pensions show that the number of people receiving winter fuel payments dropped from approximately 11 million to just 1.3 million last year. This sharp decline followed a controversial government decision to means-test the payment, which helps pensioners with energy bills, limiting it to those on low-income benefits. After a public and political backlash, the chancellor reversed the policy in June, and now pensioners with an annual income of £35,000 or less will again be eligible for the payment this winter.</p>

          <p>Researchers have scientifically confirmed the source of a distinctive blue color in Jackson Pollock's famous 1948 painting, identifying it as the synthetic pigment manganese blue. By taking scrapings from the canvas and using laser analysis, scientists were able to create a chemical fingerprint of the paint, solving a long-standing mystery about the materials used in the abstract expressionist masterpiece. The study not only provides the first confirmed evidence of Pollock using this specific pigment but also helps in understanding artists' materials for conservation and authentication purposes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% next April, a rise of over £500 a year for those on the new flat-rate pension. This increase is determined by the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the pension rises by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth, with the latter being the key figure this year. While this provides a boost for nearly 13 million pensioners, it also brings the state pension closer to the frozen personal income tax allowance. This proximity means pensioners could start paying income tax on their state pension for the first time by 2027. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United has apologized to its supporters and cancelled 103 season tickets after uncovering an unauthorized resale scheme that had gone undetected for years. The club discovered that tickets sold to tour organizers a decade ago, intended for school groups, were still being resold at inflated prices without a formal contract in place. The issue came to light when a school from Dundee was able to purchase 45 tickets for a high-demand Champions League match against Barcelona. The club has now terminated the arrangement and returned the seats for sale to fans through the official ballot system.</p>

          <p>Mathematicians and enthusiasts are celebrating today's date, 9/16/25, for its rare numerical properties, an occasion that occurs only once a century. The date is composed of three consecutive perfect squares: 9 (3²), 16 (4²), and 25 (5²). Furthermore, the base numbers (3, 4, and 5) form a Pythagorean triple, where 3² + 4² = 5², representing the fundamental theorem of geometry for right triangles. This alignment of mathematical principles makes the date a unique "Pythagorean Triple Square Day," offering a moment to appreciate the hidden patterns and beauty in numbers.</p>

          <p>The rise of telehealth offers undeniable convenience but also presents potential drawbacks for patients, according to a primary care physician. While online services are suitable for straightforward issues like prescription refills for erectile dysfunction, they are less effective for complex conditions requiring a physical exam. The article advises that building a long-term relationship with a regular doctor, who can also offer virtual appointments, is often more beneficial. A provider who knows a patient's history may be less cautious and can prevent unnecessary emergency room visits, ultimately leading to better and potentially more cost-effective care.</p>

Moorpark College and Cerritos College were the only two Los Angeles-area institutions to rank in the statewide top 10, with students at both recouping their investment in under two months. The study highlights the success of public colleges in providing economic mobility, noting that 40% allow students to recoup costs within a year, compared to just 5% of private, for-profit schools.

          <p>Artist Alice Matzkin, 85, is experiencing a profound creative resurgence after losing most of her life's work in the 2017 Thomas fire. After a long fallow period, she was inspired to return to her studio, where she has since produced 55 large abstract paintings, a significant departure from her previous portrait work. Matzkin, whose career includes a portrait of Chelsea Clinton that hung in the White House, had previously focused on the theme of aging.

          <p>Despite the popularity of viral videos depicting crime in specific urban areas like Frankfurt's Bahnhofsviertel, criminologists assert that Germany is, overall, a very safe country with a long-term downward trend in crime rates. Experts note that while violent offenses have seen a recent uptick, partly linked to social factors among young men, Germany's homicide rate remains significantly lower than in many other nations. They emphasize that crime is more concentrated in cities and that factors like unemployment and lack of prospects, rather than country of origin, are key drivers of criminality.</p>
