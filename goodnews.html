          <p>President Trump declared that Israel and Iran have agreed to a ceasefire following a week of aerial attacks that began after Israel targeted Iran's nuclear program. Prior to the ceasefire, Iran carried out a missile attack on the United States‚Äô Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, which followed the U.S. bombing of three nuclear sites in Iran. The President stated that there were no casualties reported at the base. Iran's attack was a response to the U.S. sending B-2 bombers to drop Massive Ordnance Penetrator bombs over Iran, with Trump claiming that monumental damage was done to all nuclear sites. </p>

A Washington Post poll indicated that 46% of Trump voters supported the airstrikes. Some Republicans criticized the action, accusing Trump of betraying his pledge to avoid "never-ending wars." However, other Trump voters believed the strikes aligned with his America First agenda, viewing them as protecting military and strategic interests. Some defended Trump's decision to proceed without congressional approval, arguing that the process of declaring wars is outdated.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target to spend 5% of GDP on national security by 2035. The commitment, made at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, involves allocating 3.5% to core defense and 1.5% to resilience and security. The strategy aims to address global uncertainties and strengthen the UK's national interest. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then.</p>
