          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in frozen UCLA medical research grants, providing significant relief to the University of California system. The judge ruled that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) grants were suspended via unspecific form letters, likely violating the Administrative Procedure Act. The administration had cited allegations of campus antisemitism, race in admissions, and recognition of transgender identities for the freeze. This article details the legal victory for UC researchers, who faced potential layoffs and lab closures, against what the judge called a "fundamental sin" in grant terminations.</p>

          <p>US comedian Jimmy Kimmel will return to his late-night talk show after Disney, ABC's parent company, reinstated him following a suspension. The suspension, prompted by FCC threats over Kimmel's remarks about Charlie Kirk's death, sparked a national debate on free speech. Disney stated the suspension was due to "ill-timed and insensitive" comments, but after "thoughtful conversations," decided to bring the show back. While some ABC affiliates like Sinclair continue to preempt the show, the decision to reinstate Kimmel is seen by many as a victory for free speech amidst government intimidation.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of pigs have been released into England's New Forest for the annual pannage season, an ancient practice dating back to 1079. This tradition involves pigs grazing on acorns, which are toxic to the forest's free-roaming ponies and cattle, thus acting as a natural cleanup crew. The verderers initiated pannage due to a heavy acorn crop, emphasizing its importance for the forest's ecology. While beneficial, visitors are cautioned to maintain a safe distance and drive carefully, as pigs have been struck by cars in recent years.</p>
