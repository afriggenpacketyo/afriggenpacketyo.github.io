          <p>A recent UK-EU deal addresses trade, defense, fishing, and energy, but leaves key questions unanswered. The financial contribution the UK will make for certain benefits, like reduced food export checks, remains unclear. The number of participants and duration of the "youth experience scheme," allowing young people to work in the UK and EU, are still under negotiation. The deal states there will be "no legal barriers" to Britons using e-gates when traveling to and from EU countries after the introduction of the European Union Entry/Exit System, but it is up to individual EU countries to decide whether British passport holders can use e-gates at their airports. The deal only recognizes the "value" of touring artists and promises to continue efforts "to support travel and cultural exchange".</p>

          <p>The SEC is nearing a decision to allow asset managers to offer ETF share classes of existing mutual funds, potentially offering investors more choices but also introducing tax risks. Over 50 asset managers have petitioned the SEC for exemptive relief, with the SEC prioritizing the issue after Commissioner Mark Uyeda's announcement in March. The key difference between ETFs and mutual funds lies in tax treatment, where ETFs avoid capital gains tax for remaining shareholders when one shareholder exits. The SEC is concerned that co-mingling the funds might subject ETF holders to unexpected tax bills, and the Dimensional amendment includes updated guidelines around oversight of funds that could help navigate issues like tax impact.</p>

Claims of a "stage five metastatic cancer" and accusations that Jill Biden missed the diagnosis are false.

The White House has previously addressed Biden's health, citing the removal of non-melanoma skin cancers before his presidency.</p>

However, reverse mortgages accrue interest and fees, reducing home equity over time. Experts recommend considering individual financial situations and consulting professionals before deciding.

          <p>A recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has prompted questions over the stability of solar and wind energy sources. While the investigation into the cause is ongoing, some have suggested that Spain's high reliance on renewables may have contributed to the blackout. Spain is one of the leaders in Europe's green energy transition and has ambitious targets for renewables. Experts suggest the blackout highlights grid stability issues more than problems with renewable energy sources, emphasizing the need for grid modernization and improved storage solutions.</p>
