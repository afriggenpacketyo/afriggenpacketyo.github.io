        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia, a leading AI chip provider, faces high expectations ahead of its earnings report, with investors focusing on the magnitude of any beat. Key questions revolve around the ramp-up of its new GB300 chip, including potential order delays for its predecessor, the impact on profit margins due to scaling production, and discussions on total cost of ownership for data center operators. Additionally, clarity is sought on Nvidia's China sales expectations, especially after revised export rules and reported pushback from the Chinese market. Commentary on networking sales and cloud partnerships beyond major hyperscalers will also be closely watched.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 70% after AT&T agreed to acquire wireless spectrum licenses from the company for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash transaction. This deal, expected to close in mid-2026, will add 50 megahertz of mid-band and low-band spectrum to AT&T's network, covering over 400 U.S. markets. EchoStar stated the transaction aims to resolve Federal Communications Commission inquiries regarding its 5G network buildout, which had faced complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. The agreement also expands a network services partnership, allowing EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand.</p>

          <p>Okta, the identity software maker, saw its shares rise 4% after reporting fiscal second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company achieved 91 cents adjusted earnings per share and $728 million in revenue, exceeding analyst consensus. CEO Todd McKinnon attributed the strong performance to economic conditions being 'better than we thought,' despite U.S. government customers exercising more caution. Okta also raised its fiscal 2026 forecast, anticipating continued growth from the need for AI agent identity management and sales of its software suites, while also announcing the acquisition of Axiom Security.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 16:12:45 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors aged 62 and older, a reverse mortgage presents a timely financial option this September, allowing them to access home equity without immediate repayments. With average home equity at a record high, many homeowners have substantial borrowable equity, providing a significant funding source. This approach also mitigates concerns over the fluctuating interest rate climate, as it bypasses variable rates and monthly payments. Furthermore, a reverse mortgage can be an effective tool for paying down high-interest debt, such as credit card balances, offering financial independence and stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>V, a member of the K-pop group BTS, made a memorable appearance at Dodger Stadium, throwing a ceremonial first pitch before the Dodgers shut out the Cincinnati Reds 7-0. The pop star, whose real name is Kim Taehyung, interacted with baseball stars Shohei Ohtani, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, and Clayton Kershaw, fulfilling a fanboy moment. Delivering a strike to Yamamoto, V delighted the crowd and later spoke the iconic words, 'It’s time for Dodger baseball.'

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high credit card APRs, averaging 22%, and record national balances of over $1.2 trillion persist, many Americans face difficulties affording their credit card payments this September. Ignoring the problem can lead to late fees, higher interest, and credit score damage. Viable solutions include immediately contacting credit card companies for hardship programs, which may offer reduced payments or interest rates. Exploring credit counseling for budget creation and creditor negotiation, or considering balance transfers to 0% introductory APR cards, are also options. Debt consolidation through personal loans can combine multiple debts into a single, more manageable payment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The 2026 midterm elections are shaping up with competitive Senate contests, as Democrats aim to flip four seats to gain control of the chamber. With 13 Democratic and 24 Republican seats up for grabs, the map presents challenges for Democrats in states won by President Trump in 2024. Open seats due to three Democratic retirements create opportunities for the GOP. Key races include North Carolina, where former Gov. Roy Cooper faces RNC Chairman Michael Whatley, and Georgia, where Sen. Jon Ossoff is the only incumbent Democrat defending a Trump-won state. Other battlegrounds like New Hampshire, Michigan, and Ohio are also seeing intense primary battles.</p>

          <p>The Spanish Civil Guard has dismantled an illegal animal trafficking ring, seizing over 150 exotic animals, including endangered species, from a pet store in Nules, Valencia. Two men, aged 30 and 35, were found selling protected animals online without proper permits and are now being prosecuted for trafficking and smuggling. The investigation, sparked by an online listing, uncovered species like ring-tailed lemurs, Bali starlings, and Asian otters, some with the highest international protection status. The total market value of the seized animals is estimated at nearly $81,500, with some macaws also identified as stolen.</p>

          <p>Frontier Airlines is launching 20 new routes this winter, many in key Spirit Airlines markets, as its struggling rival faces severe financial challenges. Spirit recently warned it might not survive another year without additional cash, having emerged from bankruptcy protection with ongoing issues. Frontier CEO Barry Biffle indicated his airline expects to capture most of Spirit's market share if it collapses. Both ultra-low-cost carriers have struggled with changing consumer preferences and increased competition from larger airlines, but Frontier's aggressive expansion strategy aims to capitalize on Spirit's vulnerability and become the largest budget airline.</p>
