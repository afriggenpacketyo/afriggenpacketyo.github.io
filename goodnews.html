          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has won a second consecutive three-year term, marking the first time in 21 years an Australian prime minister has achieved this feat. Opposition leader Peter Dutton conceded defeat, acknowledging his party's shortcomings during the campaign.

The election occurred against a backdrop of a cost-of-living crisis, with Foodbank Australia reporting widespread food insecurity. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio congratulated Albanese on his re-election, emphasizing the strong alliance between the two countries.</p>
