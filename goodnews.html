        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is urging 200,000 new blood donors to register, citing ongoing shortages that have impacted patient care. A previous "amber alert" highlighted critically low supplies, especially for O negative blood, which is universally compatible. The NHSBT aims to increase regular donors from 800,000 to over one million to ensure a stable supply and prevent a "red alert" situation, which would delay treatments. The NHSBT is also emphasizing the need for more black donors to help treat sickle cell disease, as only a small percentage of the population donates regularly.</p>

          <p>Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is the only cabinet minister yet to finalize her department's budget ahead of the upcoming Spending Review, despite an offer of above-inflation increases for police funding. Cooper's team argues they followed the Treasury's negotiation timetable, while some suggest an earlier agreement would have been more favorable. The impasse raises the possibility of the Treasury imposing a settlement on the Home Office, as police chiefs lobby for more funding amid concerns about maintaining police numbers and delivering policy commitments. The spending review is expected to include increased funding for the NHS and investments in technology and infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The U.S. National Guard, a component of the Armed Forces Reserve, consists of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. Typically deployed for disaster relief, the National Guard can also be used for internal security and military operations abroad. The governor of a state usually commands reservists deployed within the state, while the U.S. president serves as commander-in-chief during nationwide deployments. President Trump recently bypassed the authority of California's governor when deploying the National Guard in Los Angeles due to protests against ICE immigration raids.</p>
