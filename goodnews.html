          <h2>Germany's Cabinet to Discuss Voluntary Military Service Reintroduction</h2>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is scheduled to present a draft law to the cabinet, proposing the reintroduction of voluntary military service for the Bundeswehr. This move is a direct response to Germany's commitment to enhancing its defensive capabilities within NATO, a necessity underscored by Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Bundeswehr aims to recruit approximately 80,000 additional professional soldiers and 140,000 reservists to fulfill NATO's strategic plans, with the initial emphasis placed on voluntary recruitment. Although compulsory military service was suspended in 2011, its reinstatement could be achieved with a simple parliamentary majority if the voluntary recruitment targets are not met. This article highlights a significant shift in German defense policy.</p>

          <p>Mitch Brown, a former West Coast Eagles player, has made history as the first openly gay or bisexual man in the Australian Football League's 129-year history. Brown revealed that hiding his sexuality significantly influenced his decision to retire from the sport. He hopes his public announcement will foster a safer and more inclusive environment for other athletes. This article highlights a pivotal moment for the AFL, which previously lacked openly gay or bisexual male players, even post-retirement. Brown also criticized the "hyper-masculinity" and homophobic comments he experienced within the league, advocating for positive male role models to drive cultural change.</p>

          <p>European markets opened higher on Wednesday, as traders eagerly awaited the quarterly earnings report from chipmaker Nvidia. Nvidia's stock has become a crucial barometer for the global technology sector, particularly for gauging the progress of the artificial intelligence boom, influencing major corporate customers like Microsoft and Google. France's CAC 40 index notably rebounded by 0.4% following a decline, despite investor concerns over potential political instability and budget issues. The broader pan-European Stoxx 600 also registered gains across various sectors, signaling a generally strong month for the regional index amidst mixed global market performance.

The more-than-400-foot vehicle, crucial for SpaceX's commercial dominance and NASA's Artemis program to return astronauts to the Moon, completed its tenth test flight. Key achievements included the first successful deployment of eight mock Starlink satellites, an in-orbit relight of its Raptor engine, and a successful stress trial of its heat shield, which is vital for reusability. Both the Super Heavy booster and the spacecraft executed controlled splashdowns, signaling a major step forward for deep-space missions and Elon Musk's aspirations for Mars colonization.</p>

          <p>China's embattled property market is showing tentative signs of recovery, as major developers like China Resources Land (CR Land) and Sunac posted stronger earnings and reduced losses. State-owned CR Land's first-half net profit increased by 16.2%, with sales rising 20%, driven by property development and robust retail consumption in its shopping centers. Privately owned Sunac narrowed its interim loss by 14.4%, primarily due to lower operating and financing costs. This article highlights how government stimulus measures and a recovery in mainland China's retail consumption are beginning to alleviate the financial distress that impacted the industry previously.

          <p>Denmark's National Museum has unveiled a miniature 10th-century ivory walrus tusk figurine, believed to be the first "portrait" of a Viking. Measuring just 1.2 inches, the figure depicts a meticulously groomed man with an imperial mustache, braided beard, and neatly styled hair, challenging common perceptions of Vikings as savage. The artwork, possibly a board game piece representing a king, was originally found in Norway in 1796 but remained forgotten in museum archives. This article emphasizes the figurine's unique detailed carvings and smiling expression, which stand in stark contrast to other simplistic Viking depictions and offer new insights into their personal appearance and social status.</p>

          <p>Lewis Hamilton's challenging first season with Ferrari has prompted discussions about his performance, the effects of aging in athletes, and his adaptation to the current generation of Formula 1 cars. Despite initial promise, Hamilton has struggled for competitiveness, leading to self-questioning and a significant qualifying deficit against teammate Charles Leclerc. This article explores how the shift to ground-effect cars in 2022, which require a different driving style, may not suit Hamilton's traditional corner-attacking technique. As Hamilton turned 40, the analysis delves into whether biological age impacts a driver's ability to adjust, although rule changes next year could potentially favor his style.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a new residual heat removal system designed to enhance the meltdown-proof capabilities of its next-generation, radioactive waste-recycling nuclear power plants. The China Institute of Atomic Energy announced this breakthrough in developing a fourth-generation nuclear plant with a closed-loop fuel cycle. This article highlights the significance of this "proof-of-principle test" for integral fast reactors, which use liquid metal as a coolant and are more fuel-efficient than conventional thermal reactors. These advanced reactors are capable of breeding new fissile material from spent fuel, reprocessing it within the same facility, marking a step towards safer and more sustainable nuclear energy.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits saw a narrowed decline of 1.5% year-on-year in July, a significant recovery from previous months, attributed to Beijing's clampdown on "involution" or excessive price wars. Profits for major industrial firms fell 1.7% in the first seven months, with the mining sector seeing a sharp drop, while manufacturing and utilities improved. This article highlights how government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels have begun to improve corporate profitability, particularly in raw-material manufacturing. Despite this, factory-gate deflation persists, and analysts remain cautious about a sharp rebound, suggesting that further industry consolidation may be necessary for sustained recovery.
