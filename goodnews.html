        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>South Western Railway (SWR) has become the first rail firm to be renationalized under the Labour government, marking a significant shift in railway ownership. The initial nationalized service commenced from Woking to Surbiton, although a bus service partially covered it. While the government emphasizes service improvements and infrastructure reinvestment, it refrained from promising lower fares. Unions have voiced concerns about outsourcing to private companies, while the Conservatives stress the need for Labour to fulfill its commitments. The nationalization is viewed as a watershed moment, with SWR now under the Department for Transport's control and integrated into Great British Railways (GBR).</p>

          <p>Swarms of midges are causing distress at the World Exposition in Osaka, prompting concerns about potential health issues among visitors. The insects have been found on the Grand Ring's walls and pillars, forcing people to avoid swallowing them. While these midges do not bite, inhaling dead ones can trigger asthma and allergic reactions, prompting health advisories for those with respiratory conditions. The insects are believed to originate from the Water Plaza, where seawater is stored, and could remain until autumn. Expo organizers are spraying insecticide, treating rainwater accumulation areas, and installing insect repellent lights to combat the problem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City's beaches opened for the season with 280 certified lifeguards, which is short of the city's full staffing needs but an improvement over last year's numbers. Parks Commissioner Sue Donoghue anticipates the lifeguard numbers will increase as students finish classes for the summer. The city is offering incentives, including higher hourly wages and signing bonuses, to attract more lifeguards and has also improved lifeguard stations. Beachgoers expressed relief at seeing lifeguards present, though some noted they had become accustomed to being more cautious due to past shortages. The city is also working to make training and qualifying easier by offering classes in multiple boroughs and relaxing some requirements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author of "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault," has died at 90; her work redefined sexual assault as a crime of power and violence rather than passion. Published in 1975, "Against Our Will" offered a comprehensive history of sexual assault and its use as a tool of subjugation. The book's impact led to the opening of sexual assault crisis centers, self-defense classes, and the revision of laws to facilitate the prosecution of offenders. Brownmiller's work faced criticism from both the left and right, with some critics arguing that it presented an anti-male perspective, though she stood by her work and continued to advocate for women's rights.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Mark Carney has invited King Charles III to open the 45th Canadian parliament, signaling Canada's sovereignty and independence amid perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. This move is viewed as a statement against Trump's suggestions of Canada becoming a "51st state". The invitation marks a shift in Canada's relationship with the Crown, with Carney campaigning heavily on standing up to Trump. While the bulk of Canada's modern population is indifferent to the British monarchy, the King's visit underscores Canada's distinct identity and traditions.</p>

Doctors advised against performing due to exacerbated symptoms, but Joel is undergoing physical therapy with hopes of returning to the stage.

          <p>Young American men are increasingly joining Russian Orthodox churches that promote a virile, traditional form of masculinity, rejecting what they perceive as feminization in Western culture. These churches, particularly the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR), attract converts who feel alienated by modern American society and seek a more structured, disciplined religious environment. The converts often embrace conservative social views, including home-schooling and traditional gender roles. This trend reflects broader political shifts and a search for community among those who feel disconnected from mainstream American culture.</p>

          <p>Arsenal defied expectations to win the Women's Champions League, completing a remarkable comeback after a rocky season. The team overcame multiple challenges, including finishing third in the Women's Super League and having to navigate three rounds of qualifying. The Gunners took on the mantle of 'comeback queens' after falling to first leg defeats against both Real Madrid and Lyon in the quarter and semi-finals respectively, but against all odds they turned things around to book their place in Saturday's final.</p>

          <p>Hainan, China's southernmost island province, is quietly becoming a hub for experimental medical treatments, with Lecheng designated as a "medical special zone." Patients can access cutting-edge therapies still in clinical trials, including personalized mRNA vaccines for lung cancer. The area is dotted with state-of-the-art hospitals offering stem cell treatments and gene therapies.

          <h2>New Rules May Allow Taking Unfinished Housing Sites Off Developers</h2>

          <p>Under new government rules, developers who leave housing sites unfinished for years could have their land handed over to local councils. The new regulations, part of a plan to build 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, require housebuilders to commit to delivery time frames and submit annual progress reports. Developers who fail to meet targets could also face penalties and be denied future permissions. The government aims to back "the builders not the blockers" and get homes built faster.</p>
