          <p>Energy company Coterra has reversed its earlier decision to reduce its oil rig count, indicating a more optimistic outlook on the economy and oil prices. The company will maintain nine oil rigs in the Permian Basin, a change from its May plan to cut back amid fears of a tariff-driven recession. This move is seen as a positive signal for Coterra's ability to meet its long-term production growth targets. Concurrently, the company is proceeding with plans to increase activity in the natural gas-focused Marcellus Shale, balancing its energy portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major U.S. stock indexes, including the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, surged to record highs, driven by investor optimism over potential trade deals and an anticipated interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The market has recovered significantly since a downturn in April, with easing trade tensions and a rebound in technology stocks boosting confidence. Recent inflation data showed a slight increase, but this has not dampened the positive sentiment. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting that markets have previously celebrated potential trade agreements that were slow to materialize. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda have signed a peace deal in Washington, D.C., aimed at ending decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern Congo region. The agreement calls for the disarmament of armed groups, including the M23 rebels, who are allegedly backed by Rwanda. While hailed as a major diplomatic success, specifics of the deal, particularly regarding the withdrawal of Rwandan troops, remain unclear. Previous peace accords have failed, leaving observers cautious about whether this U.S.-brokered agreement can bring lasting stability to the volatile region.</p>

          <p>Three years after a mass exodus threatened its existence, the Pac-12 conference is rebuilding by extending an invitation to Texas State University. This addition will bring the conference to eight football-playing members, the minimum required by the NCAA. The move follows the departures of 10 schools, initiated by USC and UCLA's move to the Big Ten. The revitalized conference, which also recently added five Mountain West schools and Gonzaga, has secured a new media deal with CBS, signaling a strategic effort to ensure its long-term viability in the shifting landscape of college sports.</p>

The feat underscores another dominant season for the three-time MVP, who continues to excel as both a hitter and, more recently, a pitcher. Ohtani's home run helped secure a 3-1 victory for the Dodgers over the Colorado Rockies. In addition to his powerful hitting, he has recently returned to the mound for short, one-inning appearances after recovering from elbow surgery.</p>

During the 1970s, she championed a generation of unapologetically Black writers, including Angela Davis and Huey P. Newton, in a predominantly white publishing industry. Morrison believed that literature written for a specific community could achieve universal appeal without compromising its integrity.
