        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sir Keir Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme on Friday, aiming to combat illegal working and modernize state services. The practicalities of the scheme, including provisions for those without smartphones or passports, will be subject to a public consultation. Starmer believes public opinion has shifted since a previous Labour attempt at ID cards was blocked, citing increased reliance on digital identification in daily life. However, opposition parties like the Conservatives, Reform UK, and Liberal Democrats criticize the proposal as a "desperate gimmick" that impinges on civil liberties and is unlikely to solve illegal immigration effectively.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that external critics are overlooking the foundational strengths driving China's economic transition, focusing too narrowly on short-term challenges like a cooling property market. China is cultivating a diversified economy by synergistically leveraging green infrastructure, advanced digital connectivity, and world-class scientific research. The nation has emerged as a global leader in scientific output, producing 33.8% of highly cited papers and leading in 57 out of 64 key technologies, including AI and renewable energy. This strategic shift towards sustainable, quality development forms a resilient backbone for future growth, despite current economic headwinds.</p>

          <p>Henry Jaglom, the acclaimed independent filmmaker known for his uncompromising artistic vision and intimate, naturalistic storytelling, has passed away at 87. Jaglom deliberately eschewed large studio productions to maintain creative control, often featuring autobiographically inspired narratives and foregrounding women's stories in films like "Last Summer in the Hamptons" and "Eating." He was a close friend and mentee of legendary filmmaker Orson Welles, who made his final screen appearance in Jaglom's 1987 film "Someone to Love." His commitment to low-budget, improvisational filmmaking and empowering female voices left a distinctive and influential mark on independent cinema.</p>

          <p>Costco reported impressive fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, fueled by robust double-digit gains in both membership income and its e-commerce business. The warehouse club's net income climbed to $2.61 billion, with total revenue increasing to $86.16 billion. Despite a slight deceleration in same-store sales, Costco has successfully broadened its appeal, attracting a growing number of younger shoppers by emphasizing value, offering a wider variety of merchandise, and enhancing online shopping convenience. This strategic approach, coupled with a membership fee increase, has contributed to strong full-year revenue growth of approximately 8.1%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order approving a deal designed to keep TikTok operating in the U.S. under a new corporate structure, thereby avoiding a ban mandated by Congress. The agreement, valued at approximately $14 billion, establishes a U.S.-based joint venture with a majority of American investors, including Oracle, who will oversee the app's algorithm and user data security. This "qualified divestiture" aims to address long-standing national security concerns regarding potential Chinese government access to user data and content manipulation. While Trump stated Chinese President Xi Jinping approved the deal, some lawmakers remain concerned about potential ongoing reliance on ByteDance's algorithm and continued operational ties.</p>

          <p>Bryson DeChambeau has undergone a significant transformation, evolving into a "gladiator" and a unifying talismanic figure for the American Ryder Cup team ahead of the 2025 event in New York. Once a polarizing personality, DeChambeau's two US Open victories and deliberate efforts to foster team cohesion have earned him renewed respect and popularity among his peers and fans. Despite his controversial move to LIV Golf, which initially complicated his Ryder Cup eligibility, he secured an automatic spot through exceptional performances in major championships. His palpable national pride and ability to electrify crowds are now considered vital assets for the U.S. team's quest for victory on home soil.</p>

          <p>Amazon has agreed to pay $2.5 billion to resolve Federal Trade Commission allegations that it deceptively enrolled millions of customers into its Prime membership program and intentionally complicated cancellation processes. The settlement, reached just days into a federal trial, includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds for an estimated 35 million affected customers. While Amazon maintains it committed no wrongdoing, the agreement prohibits the company from misrepresenting Prime terms and mandates clear disclosures and easy cancellation mechanisms. FTC Chairman Andrew Ferguson hailed the settlement as a "monumental win" for consumer protection.</p>

          <p>U.S. new car sales have experienced an unexpected boost, prompting Cox Automotive to raise its 2025 sales forecast to 16.1 million units, attributing the rise to consumers accelerating purchases due to fears of future tariffs and higher prices. This "pull-ahead" in demand, particularly notable for electric vehicles ahead of federal credit expirations, has temporarily benefited the automotive industry. While robust sales have helped some automakers mitigate higher tariff costs, analysts anticipate a slowdown in the fourth quarter as tax credits expire and new pricing reflects increased duties. Larger manufacturers like General Motors and Toyota have gained market share, while smaller brands have largely struggled. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bestselling author Jillian Lauren, wife of Weezer bassist Scott Shriner, will avoid jail time after a judge granted her mental health diversion following an incident where she shot at Los Angeles police officers.

Lauren, who was not connected to the initial crime and was wounded when officers returned fire, reportedly ignored commands to drop her weapon. Under the two-year diversion agreement, she must abstain from firearms, drugs, and alcohol, and attend therapy, with all charges to be dismissed upon successful compliance.</p>

With cumulative home equity in the U.S. reaching a record $17.8 trillion, homeowners possess substantial financial resources to access.
