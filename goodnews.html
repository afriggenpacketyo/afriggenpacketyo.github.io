        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a Supreme Court hearing, justices expressed skepticism regarding the legality of President Trump's executive order that aims to sharply limit birthright citizenship in the United States. Justice Sotomayor asserted that the order violates established Supreme Court precedents, while Justice Kagan questioned the means by which the executive order's constitutionality could be challenged. The justices' concerns centered on the potential for the order to bypass judicial review, raising fundamental questions about the balance of power between the executive and judicial branches. Trump defended the order in a social media post, claiming it targets those exploiting citizenship for vacation purposes.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A bipartisan consensus is emerging in Washington that "debanking," the practice of financial institutions closing accounts or denying services based on political positions, is a problem, but finding solutions remains challenging. Brian P. Brooks, a former financial regulator, notes increasing complaints from conservative and religious groups, cryptocurrency companies, and even liberal lawmakers. While banks are prohibited from discriminating based on race or gender, they can refuse services to high-risk customers, leading to accusations of politically motivated discrimination. The Trump administration is considering measures to address the issue, but differing views on the definition and appropriate response complicate the path forward, as some see it as prejudice and others see it as risk management.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company is recalling nearly 275,000 Lincoln Navigator and Ford Expedition SUVs from the 2022-2024 model years due to a potential issue with the front brake line. A bent brake line could contact the engine air cleaner outlet pipe, leading to damage and a brake fluid leak, potentially reducing brake function and increasing crash risk. The issue stems from faulty assembly during engine installation at Ford's Kentucky Truck Plant, which was later modified to prevent brake line damage. Owners will be notified by mail, and dealers will inspect and replace the brake line or air cleaner outlet pipe as needed, free of charge.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods announced its intention to acquire Foot Locker for $2.4 billion, aiming to expand its international presence, attract new customers, and dominate the Nike sneaker market. Dick's plans to operate Foot Locker as a separate business unit, maintaining its existing brands, and expects the merger to be accretive to earnings in the first full fiscal year after closing. The acquisition will give Dick's access to Foot Locker's international markets and a younger, more urban customer base, while also raising anti-competition concerns due to the combined company's potential control over Nike wholesale distribution. While Dick's anticipates cost synergies, some analysts view the deal as a strategic misstep, citing potential risks to integration and returns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy grew by 0.7% at the start of the year, exceeding expectations, driven by strong spending on services like retail, hospitality, and finance. This growth rate is the highest among the G7 countries, despite global trade shocks from U.S. tariffs. However, economists caution that this growth may be short-lived, as the full impact of U.S. tariffs and rising taxes could slow down the economy in the coming months. A recent trade deal between the UK and the US might alleviate some tariff pressures, but the details and timing of its implementation remain uncertain.</p>
