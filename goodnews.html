          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney announced that King Charles III and Queen Camilla will visit Canada later this month, with the King formally opening Canada's 45th Parliament on May 27. Carney emphasized that the King's visit underscores Canada's sovereignty, a strategic move considering President Trump's past remarks about making Canada the 51st US state. Carney also plans to visit the White House to discuss tariffs and strengthen relationships with reliable trading partners in Europe and Asia. He aims to unite Canada amidst divisions and offered an olive branch to political rivals, focusing on addressing the cost of living and safety concerns. </p>

          <p>The White House clarified that President Trump's announcement to rename Veterans Day as "Victory Day for World War I" was intended as an additional proclamation, not a replacement. Trump also expressed his intent to designate May 8 as "Victory Day for World War II." Establishing a federal holiday or national observance requires the passage of a law, according to the Congressional Research Service, thus limiting the President's unilateral authority in this matter.</p>

          <p>A federal judge permanently struck down Donald Trump's executive order that targeted the law firm Perkins Coie, deeming it unconstitutional and unlawful. The order, which aimed to restrict Perkins Coie's access to government contracts and federal buildings due to its past work with Hillary Clinton's campaign, was found to violate the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments. The judge criticized the order as retaliatory and a form of viewpoint discrimination, raising concerns about potential chilling effects on other law firms dealing with the government. The Trump administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <h2>Rising Autism Diagnoses: Exploring the Factors Behind the Increase</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>There has been a significant rise in autism diagnoses, with studies showing an exponential increase in recent years. While this suggests more autism around, it is not necessarily an increase in autistic people, but also reflects changes in diagnostic criteria, greater awareness, and better identification, especially in women and adults. The definition of autism has broadened over time, now including those with less severe symptoms and higher cognitive abilities. This has led to a more diverse group of individuals being diagnosed, highlighting the importance of understanding the varied experiences and needs within the autistic community.</p>

          <p>Australians are voting in an election amidst concerns about the rising cost of living and housing affordability, with both major parties pledging small-scale measures to alleviate economic pressures. The election takes place against a backdrop of global turmoil and strained relations with the United States and China. Voters have been moving away from the two major parties, turning to independent candidates, potentially leading to a minority government. The election may hinge on whether voters believe either party can effectively address their economic anxieties.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt its efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools, a victory for the state after being targeted over its support of transgender rights. The USDA had suspended funding for a child nutrition program after Maine officials refused to comply with demands to bar trans girls from participating in girls' sports. Governor Janet Mills challenged the administration, and the state sued the USDA to maintain its funding, ultimately reaching a settlement.</p>
