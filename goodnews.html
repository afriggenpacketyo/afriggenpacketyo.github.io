          <p>Mexico has initiated legal action against Google following the tech giant's decision to relabel the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America on its maps platform, aligning with a previous executive order. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced the lawsuit, emphasizing Mexico's disagreement with applying the 'Gulf of America' label beyond the U.S. continental shelf. The Mexican Foreign Relations Ministry had previously communicated its concerns to Google, while the U.S. House Republicans passed the Gulf of America Act to codify the name change. Google's policy is to reflect local official names, displaying different labels within the U.S., Mexico, and other regions.</p>

          <p>The Labour Party, led by Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, is preparing to introduce new measures aimed at reducing UK net migration, which reached 728,000 last year. The proposed policies, outlined in an upcoming immigration white paper, will require employers to prioritize investment in UK skills before recruiting overseas workers, particularly in sectors like IT and telecommunications. Visa applications from countries with high rates of overstaying and asylum claims, such as Pakistan, Nigeria, and Sri Lanka, are expected to face stricter screening. Additionally, migrants may need to wait longer to apply for permanent residency, and tougher English language requirements are anticipated, though reports of A-Level equivalent tests have been denied.</p>

          <p>Former New Labour cabinet member Lord Mandelson, now the UK's ambassador to the US, has lauded the recent UK-US trade deal as a foundation for future trade opportunities between the two nations. The agreement reduces or eliminates tariffs imposed by former US President Donald Trump on some UK imports, including cars, steel, and aluminum. While discussions regarding the UK's Digital Services Tax (DST) occurred, abolishing the DST was not part of the deal. Lord Mandelson emphasized the positive relationship between Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump, highlighting their shared commitment to defending their respective national interests.</p>

          <p>The recent trade agreement between the United States and Britain, which lifts the 25 percent tariffs on steel exported to the US, has provided some relief for struggling British businesses. The tariffs, imposed in February, had added significant costs and complexities to an already challenged industry. While the deal is welcomed by British steelmakers, uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. The impulsive nature of the Trump administration's trade policy also creates concerns about long-term stability and planning.</p>

          <p>Faced with high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration, Chinese companies are increasingly shifting their manufacturing operations to Vietnam. This trend is accelerating as the cost of sending products to the United States has soared. Chinese e-commerce platforms like Alibaba and Shein are facilitating this transition by helping companies find manufacturing alternatives in Vietnam. While Vietnam offers advantages such as a shared border and a large workforce, it also faces challenges, including potential scrutiny from American officials concerned about China using Vietnam to circumvent tariffs.</p>

          <p>A judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing sweeping cuts and layoffs at over a dozen government agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting drive. U.S. District Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove that the Trump administration's efforts to reorganize and downsize the federal government exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. The ruling will remain in effect for at least 14 days while the judge considers the case.</p>

          <p>Taylor Swift has reportedly been subpoenaed in the legal battle between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, though Swift's representative denies any creative involvement in the film 'It Ends With Us,' beyond licensing a song. The lawsuit stems from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on set and Baldoni's countersuit claiming defamation. Baldoni's team suggests Lively's close friends, including Swift, pressured him to accept changes to the script. Swift's spokesperson stated that the subpoena is a tactic to draw public interest by using her name.</p>
