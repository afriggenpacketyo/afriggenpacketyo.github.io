          <p>Experts weigh in on the benefits and potential risks of chiropractic care, noting that while it can be helpful for musculoskeletal issues, it's important to consult with a spine specialist for more serious problems. Chiropractors focus on spinal adjustments and musculoskeletal issues, while spine doctors have specialized medical training. Potential benefits of chiropractic care include reduced tension, inflammation, and stress, but caution is advised as treatments for underlying conditions could lead to complications. Choosing a transparent chiropractor with a clear treatment plan and a strong relationship with a spine surgery practice is advised.</p>
