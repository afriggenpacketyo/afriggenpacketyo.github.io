          <h2>Kenya Swaps US Dollar Loans for Chinese Yuan to Reduce Debt</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 00:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in Chinese railway loans to Chinese yuan, a move aimed at reducing annual debt-servicing costs by US$215 million. The loans, taken in 2014 and 2015 from the Export-Import Bank of China, funded the construction of the Standard Gauge Railway from Mombasa to Naivasha. As of June 2024, approximately US$3.5 billion remained unpaid, with Kenya spending US$1 billion annually on servicing its Chinese debt. The deal is expected to halve the SGR loan rates from the existing 6.37 percent under the dollar-denominated agreement, potentially paving the way for other debt-stressed African countries to draw closer to China.

          <p>King Miller, a walk-on running back for USC, delivered a breakout performance, leading the Trojans to a 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan. With USC's top two running backs injured, Miller stepped up, rushing for 148 yards and a touchdown. The Trojans' defense also showed improvement, stifling Michigan's offense and quarterback Bryce Underwood. The victory marked a significant turnaround for USC after a previous loss to Illinois, raising questions about offering Miller a scholarship.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's struggles at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies have raised concerns. Ohtani, who is usually a high-performing hitter, had a poor series, going one for 18 with nine strikeouts. Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the need for Ohtani to improve his at-bat quality and be more aggressive within the strike zone. The Dodgers' success in the NLCS depends on Ohtani's ability to recalibrate and perform at his usual level.</p>

          <p>Britain is experiencing a surge in respiratory illnesses, including the common cold, flu, and COVID-19, with many people reporting symptoms.

Data indicates that Rhinovirus, or the common cold, is the most prevalent illness, while COVID-19 is also circulating with new variants. Vaccinations are recommended for vulnerable populations to protect against serious illness.</p>
