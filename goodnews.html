          <p>A federal judge has invalidated a Trump administration order that sought to ban individuals from seeking asylum if they crossed the southern border. U.S. District Judge Randolph D. Moss ruled that the president does not have the authority to create an alternative immigration system that bypasses laws enacted by Congress. The policy, issued on President Trump's first day in office, was challenged by immigrant rights groups like the ACLU, who argued it was an unprecedented "flat-out ban" on asylum that endangered vulnerable people. The judge's ruling affirms that the executive branch cannot unilaterally supplant existing federal immigration statutes.</p>

The agreement also includes a steeper 40% tariff on goods that are trans-shipped through Vietnam from other countries to prevent tariff evasion.

Cramer also identified the dollar's decline to a four-year low as a significant trend. He suggests this weakness benefits multinational consumer packaged goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble, by making their exports more competitive on the global market.
