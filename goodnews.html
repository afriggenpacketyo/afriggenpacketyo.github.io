          <p>The British pound reached a near four-year high against the dollar following reports that former U.S. President Donald Trump might accelerate the appointment of a new Federal Reserve chair. Market concerns arose from the possibility of Trump selecting a candidate more aligned with his demands, potentially compromising the Fed's independence. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has faced criticism from Trump for maintaining steady interest rates, with concerns that retaliatory tariffs could drive up inflation. The dollar's weakness reflects broader anxieties about the erosion of institutional independence in the U.S., potentially leading to higher borrowing costs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy experienced a greater contraction than previously estimated during the first quarter of 2025, marking the first decline in three years. The Commerce Department's final GDP report indicated a 0.5% annual rate decrease, revised from earlier estimates of 0.3% and 0.2%. This downturn was largely attributed to a surge in imports as companies rushed to acquire foreign goods ahead of tariff implementations, though consumer spending also sharply decreased. While underlying economic strength, measured by real final sales to private domestic purchasers, showed a modest increase, it was less robust than the previous quarter, with economists forecasting a rebound in the second quarter.

          <p>After escalating tensions, the U.S. and China have entered a period of uneasy calm in their trade relations, retreating from extreme positions. This pause follows months of tariff battles and mutual threats, including China's restrictions on rare earth exports and the U.S. limiting jet engine and semiconductor software access. Analysts suggest this breather, effective since May 12, aims to stabilize relations, with the U.S. seeking resumed rare earth exports and China pushing for more organized negotiations to moderate Trump's unpredictable approach. While the Iran crisis adds uncertainty, its impact on any potential U.S.-China deal is expected to be minimal.</p>

          <p>A $200,000 annuity purchased at age 65 could provide a monthly income to supplement retirement funds. Monthly payments from a fixed lifetime annuity can vary based on factors such as gender, annuity type, and the prevailing interest rate environment. Current estimates suggest a 65-year-old man might receive around $1,294 per month, while a woman of the same age could receive approximately $1,240 per month. The decision to buy an annuity depends on an individual's retirement income strategy and whether guaranteed income is desired to offset market volatility and longevity risk.

A study by Apple researchers found that these models fail to develop generalizable problem-solving capabilities, with accuracy collapsing beyond certain complexities. This raises concerns that the models might be memorizing patterns instead of generating new solutions, limiting their real-world applicability. Researchers at Salesforce and Anthropic have also noted limitations, describing "jagged intelligence" and a gap between current capabilities and enterprise demand.</p>

This decision allows Merck to launch the shot ahead of the RSV season, competing with a rival shot from Sanofi and AstraZeneca.

          <p>London's West End production of 'Evita' at the Palladium theater has gained attention for its unique offstage balcony performance. During Act Two, actress Rachel Zegler, playing Eva Per√≥n, sings "Don't Cry For Me Argentina" from a balcony overlooking Argyll Street, which is livestreamed into the theater. Andrew Lloyd Webber, who owns the theater, obtained permission to close the street for the performance, drawing large crowds. The production's unconventional staging technique is intended to involve the public and create a memorable theatrical experience.</p>
