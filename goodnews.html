        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A team of biologists near the California-Oregon border is employing innovative drone technology to protect cattle from gray wolves. The drones broadcast loud sounds, including AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck,' movie dialogue from 'Marriage Story,' and live human voices, to scare predators away. This experiment is part of ongoing efforts to foster coexistence between recovering wolf populations and ranchers, who have historically faced livestock losses. While previous nonlethal methods like fencing and guard dogs have been used, drones offer a new, adaptable approach to hazing, with early trials showing successful interruptions of wolf hunts. The long-term effectiveness, however, against wolves becoming accustomed to the sounds remains to be seen.</p>

          <p>Brandon Burgess, a 29-year-old British Formula 1 enthusiast, is undertaking an ambitious challenge to attend all 24 Grand Prix races this season on a strict £20,000 budget. Burgess, who has been an F1 fan since childhood, aims to demonstrate that the sport is accessible beyond the wealthy. He is managing this feat while utilizing only his annual 28 days of work leave, strategically varying his attendance days at each event and opting for budget accommodation. As the season progresses into more expensive 'flyaway' races, his financial planning remains tight, but he is determined to complete his lifelong dream.</p>

          <p>India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping are meeting at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, aiming to reset their strained relationship amidst global economic challenges. Both nations face high US tariffs, pushing them to seek a business reboot. The relationship has been marked by deep mistrust and border disputes, notably the 2020 Ladakh clash, which led to economic fallout including flight cancellations and Chinese app bans. Experts suggest this visit could be a turning point, with a stronger China-India partnership potentially reshaping global trade flows and reducing dependence on the United States, aligning with their shared multipolar world view.</p>

Zverev, the 2020 runner-up, initially controlled the match but lost momentum after a grueling second-set tiebreak. Auger-Aliassime will now face Russia's Andrey Rublev in the fourth round.

          <p>Justin Sun, founder of the Tron blockchain, predicts that Tron's facilitated virtual asset transactions will surpass Swift's volume within the next five years. He projects Tron's transaction volume to reach US$8 trillion this year, with potential to scale to US$300-400 trillion, significantly outperforming Swift's multi-day processing times with Tron's near-instantaneous transactions. Sun's confidence stems from Tron's increasing influence in global stablecoin transactions, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to stable assets like the US dollar. He also commended Hong Kong's progress in developing its virtual asset sector, signaling optimism for the region's role in the evolving digital finance landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan's opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party finds itself at a crossroads, with rising public favorability but consumed by anxiety over who will succeed Eric Chu Li-luan as chairman in October. A recent poll shows the KMT's favorability rating at 36.3 percent, surpassing the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) at 33.1 percent, which has seen a significant decline. This shift presents an opportunity for the KMT to capitalize on growing discontent with the DPP, but internal leadership struggles could hinder its ability to effectively challenge the current government and consolidate its position.</p>

          <p>The iconic Metal Gear Solid series is making a comeback with a remake of its third installment, 'Metal Gear Solid Delta,' nearly a decade after its creator Hideo Kojima's acrimonious split from publisher Konami. The series, known for its cinematic storytelling and philosophical themes, was left directionless following Kojima's departure in 2015, reportedly due to spiraling development costs for Metal Gear Solid V. This remake capitalizes on the growing trend of revitalizing classic titles with modern graphics and design, aiming to attract new fans while retaining the essence of Kojima's original vision. Fans are 'incredibly excited' by the faithful recreation.</p>

          <p>UK government scientists are deploying an unusual arsenal, including sniffer dogs and drones, to combat the spruce bark beetle, a tiny but devastating threat to the nation's forests. This beetle, which has destroyed millions of spruce trees across Europe, was found to be entering the UK via winds across the English Channel, not just imported wood. Drones survey vast forest areas for signs of infestation, while sniffer dogs detect the beetle's pheromones and waste in timber stacks. These innovative methods have reportedly led to the eradication of the beetle from at-risk areas in southeast England, though climate change poses future challenges.</p>
