          <p>Haoxiang Gao, a Chinese national attending the University of Michigan, fled the U.S. after being charged with illegal voting in the 2024 general election. Gao admitted to registering and casting a vote on campus in October 2024 but later missed court hearings and left the country using a passport different from the one surrendered to authorities. He is now federally charged with flight to avoid prosecution, although the U.S. lacks an extradition treaty with China. This case is among a small number of instances of noncitizens voting in federal elections.</p>

          <p>The New York Yankees avoided a series sweep by defeating the Los Angeles Dodgers 7-3 after a rare poor start from Yoshinobu Yamamoto. Yamamoto struggled with his command, allowing the Yankees to capitalize with early runs, while the Dodgers made defensive and baserunning mistakes. Ryan Yarbrough, a former Dodger, pitched effectively for the Yankees, stifling the Dodgers' lineup. Although the Dodgers managed to win the series, the loss highlighted inconsistencies in their performance this season, dropping their record to 13-13 over their last 26 games.</p>
