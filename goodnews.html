          <p>CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, is diversifying into clean technology ahead of its Hong Kong IPO, aiming to become a leader in China's green energy sector. The company established CharGo to develop mobile EV charging robots, addressing the lack of charging infrastructure. CharGo plans to deploy thousands of units globally, targeting Southeast Asia, the Middle East, and Europe by 2026. CATL's EV battery business remains its largest revenue source, but energy storage systems are growing, with net profit increasing despite lower lithium prices. </p>

          <p>A rare clue at a 1993 Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, led to a decades-long search for Jeanie Childs' killer. Investigators initially suspected Arthur Gray, who lived with Childs, but he had an alibi and his footprints didn't match. In 2015, DNA testing revealed an unknown profile that kept repeating itself. Investigative genetic genealogy linked the DNA to Jerry Westrom, who was later convicted of the murder after his footprints matched those at the scene. </p>

          <p>China is increasingly using Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to fund infrastructure projects in Africa, moving away from direct government loans under the Belt and Road Initiative. This approach involves granting Chinese companies long-term operating rights in exchange for construction financing, addressing African governments' debt concerns. Examples include the extension of Kenya's Standard Gauge Railway and Zambia's Lusaka-Ndola dual carriageway. Chinese contractors would have exclusive rights to construct and operate the railway for a minimum of 25 years after completion to recoup their investment through toll fees. </p>
