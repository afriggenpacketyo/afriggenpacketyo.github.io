          <h2>Bitcoin Price Surges Past $100,000 Amid Trade Deal Optimism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 15:23:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin experienced a significant price surge, surpassing the $100,000 mark for the first time since February, fueled by optimism surrounding a potential trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's value increased by nearly 5%, reaching $100,881.90, as investors reacted positively to President Trump's announcement of the trade deal's broad outline, which also spurred a rally in the stock market. According to Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, this resurgence reaffirms Bitcoin's resilience and safe-haven status amidst global economic uncertainties, including rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to interest rate cuts. Bitcoin's performance in 2025 has highlighted its strength as a safe haven compared to U.S. equities.</p>

          <p>Bill Gates announced that the Gates Foundation will close its doors permanently on December 31, 2045, earlier than initially anticipated, dedicating the next two decades to an intensified effort in global health and human development. This decision comes amidst a challenging landscape for foreign aid, marked by Trump administration cuts and a shifting philanthropic culture, with Gates expressing concern over the decline in global generosity. Despite these headwinds, Gates remains optimistic about achieving significant progress in reducing childhood deaths and eradicating diseases like tuberculosis and H.I.V., driven by advancements in biomedical tools and artificial intelligence. The foundation plans to spend down its endowment and Gates' remaining personal fortune, aiming to make itself unnecessary by addressing critical global issues effectively.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>AppLovin's stock price significantly increased in extended trading following the release of strong earnings and revenue figures that surpassed expectations, alongside the announcement of its mobile gaming business sale to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash and a 20% stake in Tripledot. The company's first-quarter net income rose to $576 million, a substantial increase from the previous year, while it expects second-quarter advertising sales between $1.2 billion and $1.22 billion, slightly below analyst estimates. This strategic move allows AppLovin to concentrate on its core advertising technology business, though it projects a slight decrease in advertising sales for the upcoming quarter.</p>

She emphasizes the importance of human connection and cautions against confusing surveillance with genuine care, highlighting the potential for technology to create distance between parents and children.

          <p>Cardinal Robert Prevost has been elected as the 267th Pope, taking the name Leo XIV, marking a historic moment as the first American to hold the position and a figure with strong ties to Latin America. Though born in Chicago, Prevost spent two decades as a missionary in Peru, working with impoverished communities, giving him a deep understanding of Latin American issues. His election has been met with joy and renewed hope among Latino Catholics in the United States, who see him as someone who understands their struggles and can prioritize issues like immigration reform and access to education. Prevost's experience in both North and South America positions him as a bridge between different parts of the global Church.</p>

          <p>Despite a general slowdown in deal-making among single-family offices due to tariff concerns, artificial intelligence-related startups continue to garner attention, with SandboxAQ finalizing a $450 million Series E round. The Palo Alto-based firm, which spun off from Alphabet in 2022, uses AI and quantum technology for large-scale predictions and statistical analysis across various industries, attracting investments from billionaires and their family offices, such as Jim Breyer, Marc Benioff, and Ray Dalio. CEO Jack Hidary notes that professionally managed family offices and large institutions have developed a greater appetite for deep-tech startups with strong competitive advantages, recognizing them as lower-risk investments compared to consumer-oriented tech.</p>

          <p>Elizabeth Holmes, the founder of Theranos, has lost her final attempt to overturn her 2022 fraud conviction, as the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals denied her request for a rehearing.

Holmes was sentenced to 11 years and 3 months in prison in January 2023, marking the culmination of a high-profile case that exposed the fraudulent practices of Theranos.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should understand the potential impact of minimum draw requirements, which can require upfront withdrawals or ongoing usage, potentially increasing interest costs and complicating repayment plans. Lenders may require an upfront draw, even if the borrower doesn't immediately need the funds, and ongoing minimum usage requirements during the draw period, which can lead to additional fees or a frozen line of credit if not met. It is important to ask lenders about these requirements to ensure that the HELOC aligns with borrowing plans.</p>
