          <p>Voters in Taiwan are participating in a significant recall election targeting 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The vote was initiated by supporters of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), who are frustrated by the KMT's legislative actions, including blocking the defense budget and passing reforms seen as favoring mainland China. The outcome could shift the balance of power in the legislature, where the KMT and its allies currently hold a majority. This election highlights the deep political divisions on the island regarding its relationship with Beijing and its democratic future.</p>

          <p>China has taken a significant step forward in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the preliminary design for a commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor. Known as the CFR-1000, this facility will be the country's first gigawatt-level fast reactor, a technology designed to be more fuel-efficient than current nuclear power sources. The project, which is now awaiting final government approval, is part of a global race among major powers like Russia and the United States to develop next-generation reactors. The design was unveiled at an event in Fujian province, attended by top officials from China's national energy and atomic authorities.</p>

          <h2>Dodgers' Offense Shows Signs of Revival in 5-2 Victory Over Red Sox</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. Despite being without star Mookie Betts, the team continued a recent trend of improved run production. Veteran outfielder Teoscar Hernández was a key contributor, hitting a crucial two-run homer in the eighth inning and drawing a bases-loaded walk earlier in the game. The win was supported by a solid pitching performance and a scoreless effort from the bullpen, providing a positive sign for the team as the MLB trade deadline approaches.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Quant Hedge Funds Attract Top Talent Amid US Academic and Visa Challenges</h2>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent, partly due to funding cuts and stricter visa policies in the United States. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are capitalizing on the situation by offering competitive salaries to PhD candidates and graduates who might have otherwise remained in the US. This influx of brainpower is expected to fuel the expansion of China's rapidly growing quant sector and enhance its use of artificial intelligence. The trend highlights a shift in the global competition for elite talent, benefiting China's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>California Regulators Clarify Tesla's Robotaxi Service Must Have Human Drivers</h2>

          <p>Despite Tesla's plans to expand its robotaxi service, California state regulators have clarified that the company is not authorized to operate autonomous passenger vehicles on public roads. The California Public Utilities Commission stated that any service offered to the public, paid or unpaid, must include a human driver in control at all times. Tesla recently notified the commission of its intent to offer a "friends and family" service in the Bay Area, but this must comply with its existing permit for a non-autonomous, human-driven charter service. The clarification highlights the significant regulatory hurdles Tesla faces in launching a true driverless taxi network.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star players Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba for one game. The suspension was automatically triggered because both players, who were voted into the MLS All-Star game, did not participate. Mas called the punishment "draconian," arguing the players and the club do not understand why missing an exhibition match warrants a suspension from a regular season game. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but stated the league had to enforce its long-standing policy, though he added the rule will be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>Former New York Congressman George Santos has surrendered to a federal correctional facility in New Jersey to begin serving his 87-month prison sentence. Santos pleaded guilty to federal wire fraud and identity theft charges stemming from a pattern of lies and deceit used to defraud donors and voters. Prosecutors detailed how he fabricated his biography, created a fake nonprofit, and stole from campaign contributors to fund a lavish lifestyle. After his sentencing, Santos publicly appealed to President Trump for a future chance, but the White House has not commented on any potential clemency request.</p>

          <p>A salon owner in Leicester is preparing for a crucial intellectual property hearing in her long-running trademark dispute with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of the 'nkd' salon, is being opposed by L'Oréal in her attempt to re-register her business's trademark. The French firm argues that 'nkd' is too similar to its 'Naked' line of beauty products and could cause consumer confusion. Having already spent over £30,000 on legal fees, Dowdeswell states she is ready to continue the fight and will not be intimidated into backing down.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has resulted in a noticeable boom for certain insect species, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm weather led to an abundance of aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and created ideal conditions for butterflies to thrive after a very poor season last year. Butterfly conservationists reported an "extraordinary" year for early sightings of numerous species. However, experts caution that the associated lack of rain could negatively impact insect and amphibian numbers next year due to the drying up of wetland breeding grounds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against the city of Chicago and the state over their "sanctuary" policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, had alleged that local laws limiting cooperation with federal immigration agents were unlawfully thwarting federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, Judge Lindsay Jenkins affirmed that the local policies are protected by the Tenth Amendment and do not illegally obstruct federal operations. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both celebrated the decision as a victory for the city's welcoming ordinance and a lawful rejection of the administration's immigration agenda.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society examines the Hollywood blacklist, a dark period in American history when entertainment professionals were persecuted for alleged Communist ties. The exhibit focuses on the "Hollywood Ten," a group of writers and directors who were imprisoned and blacklisted for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1947. It explores how the anti-Communist fervor ruined careers, compelled individuals to name names to save themselves, and extended beyond Hollywood to affect ordinary Americans. The display raises enduring questions about free speech, political persecution, and the protection of democracy.</p>

          <p>A dedicated team of wildlife biologists in Texas is undertaking a critical mission to save the state's bighorn sheep, whose population has been decimated by disease. After losing about half the population in five years, biologists captured and relocated dozens of healthy sheep from the last disease-free herd to an isolated mountain range. The goal is to establish a new, protected population away from the diseases spread by non-native animals. A recent check on the relocated herd brought good news, as biologists found the sheep surviving and spotted newborn lambs, signaling hope for the species' recovery.</p>

For instance, a kidney specialist argues that for most healthy people, simply drinking when thirsty is sufficient. While the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep is considered crucial, experts advise that adapting exercise goals to fit one's lifestyle is more practical than aiming for a rigid, one-size-fits-all number.</p>

It also delves into why female athletes face a higher risk for certain injuries, like ACL tears, and how new training methods aim to mitigate this. This research marks a major shift from a time when female athletes were often treated simply as "mini-men."</p>
