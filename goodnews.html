          <p>A 46-year-old man was successfully rescued by a helicopter after being trapped for two days behind a powerful waterfall in California's Seven Teacups area. The man, Ryan Wardwell, was rappelling when strong water hydraulics forced him off his climbing lines, leaving him stranded. The Tulare County Sheriff's Office initiated a search after he was reported missing, eventually locating him with a drone. He was treated for dehydration and minor injuries before being reunited with his family, prompting officials to remind the public about the dangers of navigating white-water rivers.</p>

          <p>Nine prison guards in Guatemala City have been freed after being held hostage for three days by rioting inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riots, which also involved the rival Barrio 18 gang, began after 10 gang leaders were transferred to a different facility and placed in solitary confinement. The incident is part of a larger pattern of gang violence in Guatemala, where rival groups compete for control and territory. Authorities stated the riots were a demand to return the leaders to prisons where they could continue to exercise criminal power.</p>

          <p>A new generation of Chinese restaurant chains is expanding globally, introducing diverse and authentic regional cuisines that move far beyond Westernized staples like chow mein. Starting in hubs like Singapore, brands are showcasing specific culinary traditions from regions such as Hunan, Sichuan, and Zhejiang, challenging outdated stereotypes about Chinese food. This culinary expansion is seen by some as an effective form of cultural diplomacy or "soft power" for China, offering an immersive experience that tells the story of the country's vast cultural landscape. These businesses bring sophisticated marketing and supply chains, which also presents a competitive challenge to local restaurants.</p>

          <p>A new box set titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley's career, compiling music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period includes his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded as his personal life faced turmoil. The collection offers insight into a time when Presley was creatively adrift, particularly after losing a potential role in the film "A Star Is Born," a disappointment his friends believe accelerated his decline. The set features studio tracks and rehearsal tapes, showcasing his expressive vocal abilities in his later years.</p>

          <p>Samsung's share of the U.S. smartphone market increased from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%, according to data from Canalys. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the traditional smartphone design. While Apple remains the market leader, its recent stagnation in design has created an opening for competitors. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable iPhone by 2026 to compete in this emerging high-end market segment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cardiologists are advising adults, particularly those over 60, to incorporate more salmon into their diets to support heart health. Salmon is a high-quality protein rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help lower bad LDL cholesterol, raise good HDL cholesterol, and reduce inflammation. These benefits contribute to healthy blood vessel function and can lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. Experts recommend eating at least two servings of omega-3-rich fish per week, prepared through healthy methods like baking or grilling rather than frying, to maintain cardiovascular wellness with age.</p>

          <p>A neighborhood community successfully voted to remove their newly elected HOA president after she attempted to ban Halloween, calling the holiday "Satanic" and against her religion. For 25 years, the community had enjoyed a relaxed HOA and elaborate Halloween festivities that were a local highlight. The new president's unilateral decision prompted immediate backlash from residents, who organized a vote to oust her at the next meeting. After her removal, an elderly resident was elected and new rules were implemented to prevent any single person from making such decisions without a community vote.</p>
