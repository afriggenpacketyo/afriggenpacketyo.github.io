          <p>The popular dance competition "Strictly Come Dancing" is gearing up for its first live show, with 15 celebrity-professional pairings preparing to compete for the glitterball trophy. Backstage interviews highlight the grueling training and the range of emotions, from excitement about the show's glamour to significant nervousness among contestants. This season features notable participants like Ellie Goldstein, the first star with Down's syndrome, and replacement Amber Davies. The article also touches on recent controversies, including allegations of drug use and a separate sexual assault investigation involving an unnamed star from the show, which contestants largely dismiss as they focus on the dancing.</p>

          <p>A new gene therapy has shown promising results in slowing the progression of Huntington's disease by 75%, offering immense hope for patients and their families. This breakthrough is particularly significant as there has been no prior treatment for the devastating neurodegenerative condition, which combines symptoms of dementia, Parkinson's, and MND. For families like Gemma and Matt Botting, whose husband was diagnosed in 2011, the news feels "like winning the lottery 10 times over," transforming their outlook from despair to optimism. While the treatment's full study awaits publication and NHS availability is years away, the scientific community sees it as a major step with potential implications for other neurodegenerative diseases.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>King Charles's long-held urban planning ideas, once controversial, are now inspiring the next generation of new towns in England. The government is expected to announce 12 new towns designed with walkable layouts, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" housing, reflecting the King's philosophy. These plans emphasize local materials, public spaces, and community building, drawing parallels with the King's own Poundbury and Nansledan projects. TV architect George Clarke notes a shift in mainstream architectural thinking, acknowledging the failures of past "ego-driven" modern designs and the need for more humane, community-focused development.</p>

          <p>Oberlin High School in Ohio offers a unique program called "Men's Work," led by Johnny Cole of Hey Brother and teacher David Reese, providing a space for teen boys to openly discuss their struggles. The initiative aims to challenge traditional masculinity and address the emotional pressures boys face, contrasting with messages from online "manosphere" influencers. A Pew Research Center survey indicates only 38% of teen boys feel comfortable discussing mental health with friends, highlighting the program's importance. The sessions encourage vulnerability and provide a supportive environment for young men to navigate their emotions and societal expectations.</p>

          <p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is intensifying his rhetoric against Reform UK, describing it as an "enemy" whose project is detrimental to the country's history. Ahead of the Labour Party Conference, Starmer emphasized the need to win this "battle for the soul of this country." He acknowledged Labour's past failure to address deep-seated concerns about illegal immigration, which he now seeks to tackle. Amid this political struggle, Starmer is also pushing for a digital ID plan, believing public willingness to embrace it has shifted, despite significant opposition and a petition garnering over a million signatures.</p>

          <p>Nine-year-old Jameson Pennings, a Philadelphia Phillies fan, displayed a heartwarming act of generosity by gifting his coveted foul ball to Donna Morey, who was celebrating her 80th birthday at the game. Jameson overheard Morey hoping for a ball and, realizing her odds were slim, selflessly approached her with his prize. His parents were "astounded" and "very proud" of his spontaneous act. Jameson explained his decision by saying Morey was older and wouldn't attend as many games as he would, adding that he felt happier without the ball. This touching gesture symbolized goodness and brought joy to both fans.</p>

          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records related to Amelia Earhart, whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean remains a subject of public fascination. Trump highlighted Earhart's attempt to circumnavigate the world and the enduring mystery of her vanishing. While the prevailing theory suggests she ran out of fuel and crashed, other theories, including one about her being a spy captured by the Japanese, have persisted without clear evidence. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had urged declassification, citing credible accounts of Earhart being spotted on Saipan, though experts like Laurie Gwen Shapiro dismiss these as "nonsense."</p>

          <p>Southern California experienced thousands of lightning strikes over two days, primarily offshore, as a low-pressure system brought thunderstorms and heavy rain. Over 2,000 strikes were recorded from the Channel Islands to the Central Coast, with the Bay Area seeing more than 13,000 total strikes. A weak low-pressure system is anticipated to move through Southern California over the weekend, potentially bringing isolated showers and cooler temperatures, with higher chances for rain in interior valleys and mountains. Meteorologists indicate that most strikes occurred during wet conditions, minimizing fire risk, but heavy downpours are possible over burn scars.</p>

          <p>Team Europe achieved a commanding 5½-2½ lead over the USA on the opening day of the Ryder Cup at Bethpage, winning both the morning foursomes and afternoon fourballs sessions. This strong start aligns with historical trends that favor teams leading after day one, boosting Europe's hopes for their first away win since 2012. Captain Luke Donald emphasized the importance of the fast start but cautioned that 14½ points are still needed for victory. Despite some frustration from home fans and a defiant stance from US captain Keegan Bradley, Europe's performance, particularly from Jon Rahm, positions them as strong favorites heading into Saturday's matches.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer outlined key economic events for the upcoming week, focusing on the nonfarm payroll report and earnings from companies like Paychex and Nike. Cramer expressed concern about economic overheating in some sectors versus struggles in others, questioning the Federal Reserve's ability to balance these trends. He highlighted Carnival and Jefferies for their insights into leisure travel and investment banking, respectively. Paychex earnings will provide a metric for the small and medium-sized business economy, while Nike's report is anticipated for its potential "breakout quarter." The nonfarm payrolls report on Friday is deemed crucial, as hot figures could deter further rate cuts. (not investment advice)</p>
