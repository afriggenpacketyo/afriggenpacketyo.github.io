          <p>Electric vehicles typically lose their value at a faster rate than traditional gasoline-powered cars, depreciating by an average of 13% more over a five-year period. This trend is attributed to several factors, including the impact of government incentives and manufacturer discounts on resale prices, as well as the rapid evolution of EV technology, especially concerning battery range. However, the introduction of more affordable, mainstream EV models in the coming years is expected to help stabilize their long-term value.</p>

          <p>This article clarifies the process and eligibility requirements for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, a legal proceeding that can wipe out most unsecured debts. The primary qualification hurdle is the "means test," which compares an individual's income to the median income in their state; those earning less than the median generally qualify. For higher earners, a more detailed analysis of disposable income is required, and actions such as hiding assets or making luxury purchases right before filing can lead to denial.</p>
