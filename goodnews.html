          <p>Ken Dryden, the Hall of Fame goaltender who led the Montreal Canadiens to six Stanley Cup titles, has died at 78 after battling cancer. Dryden, known for his relaxed stance in goal, backstopped the Canadiens to championships in six of his eight seasons in the NHL. He earned numerous accolades, including the Calder Trophy, five Vezina Trophies, and the Conn Smythe Trophy. Beyond hockey, Dryden was an accomplished author, broadcaster, and politician, serving as a Member of Parliament and a cabinet minister. The article details his career as a player, including his time at Cornell University and his role in the 1972 Summit Series, and his post-playing career. His contributions to hockey and Canadian society were widely celebrated, and he is survived by his wife and two children.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the geopolitical competition unfolding in central-southern Africa, where China, the United States, and Japan are vying for control of key logistical routes to secure critical minerals. The race to build corridors like the Lobito Corridor and the Nacala Corridor is viewed as a strategic effort to secure long-term influence over critical mineral supply chains and reduce reliance on rivals. The Nacala Corridor, for example, connects landlocked Zambia and Malawi to the Port of Nacala in Mozambique. These corridors are essential for transporting minerals needed for the green energy transition, highlighting the strategic importance of the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for over 1 million people from Haiti and Venezuela. The ruling prevents the deportation of these individuals and allows them to continue working in the United States. Judge Chen criticized Homeland Security Secretary Noem for revoking protections, stating it would force people back to dangerous conditions. The Trump administration argued that conditions in Haiti and Venezuela had improved, but the judge deemed the decision arbitrary and capricious, highlighting the legal battles and uncertainty faced by TPS holders. The government is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>Lord Mandelson, Britain's ambassador to the United States, is set to deliver a speech praising President Trump as a "risk taker" and framing Brexit as a "liberating force." The speech aims to strengthen the UK-US special relationship and "Reform-proof" the struggling Labour government. Mandelson draws parallels between Trump's appeal to anxieties and Keir Starmer's mandate for national renewal. He argues that Brexit has freed the UK to pursue closer ties with the US, while acknowledging its financial costs, and he emphasizes the importance of the US-UK alliance in a threatening world.</p>
