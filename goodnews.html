          <p>British number one Jack Draper secured his place in the second round of Wimbledon with a commanding performance against Sebastian Baez, who was forced to retire due to injury. Draper was leading 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 when Baez, a clay-court specialist, could not continue after slipping on the baseline. As the host nation's biggest hope following Andy Murray's retirement, the 23-year-old Draper confidently handled the expectations on Court One. He will next face 2017 runner-up Marin Cilic in what is expected to be a more significant challenge on the grass court.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare announced it will begin blocking artificial intelligence crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly impact how AI models are trained. The new policy requires website owners to explicitly opt-in to allow AI bots to access their content, giving creators more control over their intellectual property. Cloudflare, which handles roughly 16% of global internet traffic, argues that AI scraping deprives publishers of traffic and ad revenue. This change puts pressure on AI developers like OpenAI and Google, who rely on vast amounts of web data to build their large language models.</p>

          <p>French player Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard made Wimbledon history by hitting a 153 mph serve, the fastest ever recorded at the tournament, during his first-round match against Taylor Fritz. Despite the record-breaking feat and hitting 37 aces, the 21-year-old ultimately lost the epic five-set match to the fifth-seeded American. The previous record of 148 mph was set by Taylor Dent. Mpetshi Perricard's powerful performance showcased his potential, but Fritz's consistency and experience prevailed in a tightly contested battle on No. 1 Court, with the American advancing to the second round.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is investing tens of billions of dollars into AI, including a high-profile push to recruit top researchers that could add $1 billion in annual expenses. Despite the massive spending, Wall Street has remained supportive, with Meta's stock recently hitting a record high. Investors appear confident that the investment will pay off through enhanced user engagement, improved ad targeting, and the long-term potential of new AI products like its Llama large language model. This strategy reflects a broader tech industry belief that expansive investment in AI is essential for future growth and transformation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Republican-led "big beautiful" bill, passed by the Senate, includes a new temporary tax deduction aimed at providing relief for seniors, framed as a "senior bonus." The proposal would offer a deduction of up to $6,000 for eligible taxpayers aged 65 and over, phasing out for those with higher incomes. This measure is an alternative to President Trump's campaign promise to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits, which could not be achieved through the budget reconciliation process. Critics note that while the bonus targets lower-to-middle-income seniors, the overall bill could accelerate the insolvency dates for Social Security and Medicare trust funds.

          <p>The massive spending package passed by the Senate includes a provision to permanently increase the child tax credit, though it may not benefit all families, particularly those with very low incomes. The Senate bill would raise the maximum credit from $2,000 to $2,200 per child and index it to inflation after 2025. However, because the credit is only partially refundable, the lowest-earning families who do not owe federal income tax cannot access the full amount. The House version of the bill proposed a higher credit of $2,500, but only through 2028, setting up a point of negotiation between the two chambers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding significant tappable home equity, a recent article explores several strategic ways to use $100,000 of it in the current economic climate. Given that home equity loan rates are much lower than credit card APRs, one smart move is to pay off high-interest debt. Other recommended uses include strategic home renovations to boost resale value, investing in a diversified portfolio, funding a small business, or paying for education to increase earning potential. The article stresses that tapping home equity is a major financial decision that turns home value into a secured loan, requiring careful planning and risk assessment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Rhode Island has issued a preliminary injunction, halting the Trump administration's plan for mass layoffs and a major restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 19 attorneys general, who argued the plan would have devastating consequences on public health services. The judge found there was "no rational basis" for the overhaul, which would have impacted crucial agencies like the CDC and FDA. The court determined the plan would cause irreparable harm and that the executive branch likely exceeded its authority in attempting such wholesale changes without congressional action.</p>

The band, which considers itself a family, rallied around her, and she credits the music with helping her focus during her treatment.

          <p>In a positive sign for consumers feeling the pinch of food inflation, Waffle House has officially removed the 50-cent surcharge it had added to egg orders. The breakfast chain implemented the temporary charge in February when a severe outbreak of avian flu decimated egg-laying chicken populations and caused wholesale prices to skyrocket to record highs. As the market has stabilized and prices have begun to fall, the chain has ended the surcharge, which had become an informal symbol of public frustration with food costs. Retail egg prices in May were still elevated compared to a year ago, but have dropped significantly from their peak.</p>
