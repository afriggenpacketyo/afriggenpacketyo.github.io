          <p>Cooper Flagg, the first overall pick in the NBA draft, has prominently recognized Caitlin Clark's significance by naming her to his personal WNBA Mount Rushmore. He specifically cited her transformative impact on women's basketball as the primary reason for her inclusion alongside established legends like Candace Parker and A'ja Wilson. Flagg's public comments highlight the widespread acknowledgment of Clark's influence, which has been credited with driving record-breaking viewership and attendance for the league. This endorsement from a top male athlete is a powerful indicator of the substantial growth and shifting perceptions surrounding women's professional sports in the public consciousness.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, directly challenging threats of legal repercussions from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event went forward despite a new "child protection" law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality, with police authorized to issue fines and organizers facing potential prison time. High-profile attendees, including an EU equalities commissioner and several European Parliament members, joined the march to show solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community. Participants expressed their desire for a diverse and tolerant country, framing the march as a crucial and powerful defense of fundamental human rights.</p>

This decision reverses the situation from 2024, when Nagasaki's city government did not invite Israel due to the conflict in Gaza, an action that prompted a boycott from other G7 ambassadors in solidarity. For this year's event, the city has adopted a more inclusive approach, extending invitations to all diplomatic missions in Japan. The Israeli ambassador stated his attendance is a gesture of respect for the Japanese people and a mutual understanding of the importance of peace.</p>

          <p>British authorities have successfully intercepted one of the country's largest drug shipments in recent years, seizing 2.4 metric tons of cocaine at the London Gateway port. The drugs, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million ($132 million), were discovered hidden under containers on a commercial vessel that had arrived from Panama. The seizure was the result of a carefully planned, intelligence-led operation conducted by the U.K. Border Force. Officials have highlighted the bust as a significant blow to organized criminal gangs, emphasizing their commitment to using international cooperation to dismantle such operations and combat the rising number of cocaine-related deaths in the UK.</p>

          <p>Amid escalating tensions with the United States and Israel, Iran may look to China for weapons support, but Beijing is expected to proceed with significant caution, according to a veteran Chinese Middle East expert. The analysis suggests that China will prioritize its broader regional interests, which include carefully balancing relationships with Israel and other Western-aligned states, over fully committing to Iran's defense. Strained economic ties with Tehran and a desire to maintain regional stability also contribute to Beijing's hesitancy. While Iran's defense minister has called for a larger Chinese role in de-escalating the conflict, China is unlikely to provide substantial military aid.</p>

Her campaign revisits this controversial period, as she positions herself as a leader who witnessed the fragility of democracy firsthand. She faces a challenging path, potentially running against Republican Vivek Ramaswamy, who has already branded her "Ohio's Anthony Fauci," setting up a contentious race.</p>

          <p>American consumers can likely expect significant relief at the pump this summer, with one industry expert predicting it will feature the cheapest gasoline prices since 2021. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy suggests the national average price for a gallon of gas could fall below the $3 mark as early as September. A recent price spike, which was driven by the Israel-Iran conflict, is expected to be temporary now that a ceasefire is in place, allowing prices to resume their slow but steady decline. Factors contributing to the expected drop include increased refinery production and a softening of consumer demand after early summer travel peaks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial planners suggest that paying for a laundry service can be a worthwhile and smart expense if it aligns with your financial and personal values. Experts recommend asking four key questions before committing: does the service cost less than your personal hourly rate, does outsourcing the chore genuinely boost your emotional well-being, are you truly comfortable with the premium price, and are you still able to prioritize your long-term savings goals? By treating personal finances like a business, individuals can strategically delegate tasks that drain their time and energy, allowing them to focus on more valuable activities without sacrificing future financial security.</p>

When he put on the Islanders jersey, which thoughtfully featured a pink ribbon patch and his mother's initials, he broke down in tears in a moving moment.

          <p>The British and Irish Lions began their Australian tour with a decisive 54-7 victory against the Western Force in Perth. After a surprisingly competitive first half that ended with the Lions leading 21-7, the tourists completely dominated the second half, scoring a total of eight tries. Winger Elliot Daly and scrum-half Tomos Williams both scored two tries each, though Williams' impressive performance was unfortunately marred by a worrying hamstring injury he sustained while scoring his second try. Despite the lopsided final score, the Lions' early indiscipline gave the Force multiple opportunities, but the hosts were ultimately unable to capitalize before the tourists pulled away.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Maori All Blacks rugby team has overpowered a Japan XV squad with a decisive 53-20 victory in a non-test international match held in Tokyo. After a closely contested first half that saw Japan holding a narrow 17-15 lead, the Maori All Blacks completely dominated the second half, running in six unanswered tries to secure the win. The victory served as a form of revenge for a loss to Japan in their previous meeting last July. Japan's head coach, Eddie Jones, described the game as a valuable, if difficult, learning experience for his young and developing squad.</p>
