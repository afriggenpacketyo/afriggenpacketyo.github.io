        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is undertaking one of its most ambitious and expensive infrastructure projects, a 1,980km railway connecting the Xinjiang and Tibet autonomous regions. The project is dubbed a "project of the century" due to extreme engineering challenges, including construction across mountain ranges and permafrost at an average altitude of over 4,500 meters. The state-owned Xinjiang-Tibet Railway Company was established to build and operate the line, with total investment potentially reaching 400 billion yuan (US$56.2 billion). This cost would make it one of China's most expensive rail lines, reflecting Beijing's strategic focus on integrating these remote regions.</p>

          <p>The European Union has started the gradual introduction of its new digital border system, known as the Entry/Exit System (EES), for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area. The system, which replaces traditional passport stamping, will require travelers from countries like the UK to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, on their first entry. This registration will be valid for three years. While intended to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, there are concerns about potential delays and queues during the initial implementation phase, which is expected to be complete by April 2026.</p>

          <p>Wales's Plaid Cymru party has committed to creating a detailed plan for Welsh independence, though it has clarified this would not be pursued within the first term of a potential Plaid-led government. Party leader Rhun ap Iorwerth's proposal to establish a "standing commission" to research and prepare a white paper on independence was endorsed at the party's conference. This marks a shift from a previous pledge to hold a referendum within five years, indicating a more long-term strategic approach. The party is positioning itself as a government-in-waiting, aiming to first build a national consensus before pursuing a formal path to independence.</p>

          <p>Scotland's head football coach, Steve Clarke, has expressed his determination to qualify for the World Cup, viewing it as an opportunity to "put right" the team's failure to reach the 2022 finals. The team was eliminated in a painful 3-1 playoff defeat to Ukraine at Hampden Park, a memory Clarke is keen to overcome. Having successfully guided Scotland to the last two European Championships, ending a long major tournament drought, Clarke is now focused on the next challenge. A victory over Belarus could secure another play-off spot and keep Scotland's hopes alive for its first men's World Cup appearance in 28 years.</p>

          <h2>German State Formalizes Leave Policy for Muslim Holidays, Sparking Debate</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-12 02:51:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A routine agreement in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein to formalize unpaid leave for Muslim employees and students on two major Islamic holidays has ignited a public debate fueled by misleading media headlines. The policy allows Muslims to request time off for Ramadan and Eid al-Adha, mirroring existing provisions for Christian and Jewish holidays, and is rooted in Germany's constitutional protection of religious freedom. Scholars and officials clarified that this does not grant "extra holidays" but simply codifies a long-standing practice of accommodating religious observance. The controversy reflects a broader national conversation in Germany about integration, equality, and cultural identity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative team of scientists from China and the Netherlands has discovered the genetic process that allows a single plant cell to regenerate into an entirely new plant. Their research, published in the journal Cell, identifies two key genetic switches that can revert a differentiated somatic cell back to an embryonic state, a phenomenon known as somatic embryogenesis. This ability was previously thought to be exclusive to fertilized eggs. The findings provide a fundamental understanding of plant biology and could have significant implications for agriculture, conservation, and biotechnology by enabling more efficient plant propagation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a summer transfer window dominated by major striker signings, an early season analysis reviews how these high-profile forwards are faring in the Premier League. Players like Liverpool's Hugo Ekitike and Arsenal's Viktor Gyokeres have made strong starts, contributing crucial goals for their new clubs. In contrast, others, such as Everton's Thierno Barry and Liverpool's record signing Alexander Isak, have had slower integrations, struggling to find the net consistently in their initial matches. The performance of these key attackers is already shaping the fortunes of top clubs as they navigate the early stages of the competitive 2025-26 season.</p>

          <p>BBC presenter Lucy Owen shares her journey of understanding body donation after her 86-year-old mother, Patsy, revealed her decision to donate her body to medical science. Initially shocked, Owen investigated the process for a documentary at Cardiff University, where her mother's body will eventually go. She learned how donated bodies serve as "silent teachers" for medical students, providing invaluable, hands-on anatomical education that cannot be replicated by technology. The experience gave Owen a profound appreciation for the gift, which can provide comfort to families knowing their loved one continues to contribute to science and help future generations of doctors.</p>

          <p>Former England and current Brighton footballer Fran Kirby has opened up about her journey back to professional sports after a career-threatening heart condition. In 2019, Kirby was diagnosed with pericarditis, an inflammation of the sac around the heart, after collapsing at home with extreme chest pain, which sidelined her for ten months. The experience, which caused severe fatigue and required strong medication, made her reconsider her career but also gave her a new appreciation for her health. Now more cautious about rest and recovery, she has since won numerous trophies and continues to play at an elite level.</p>

          <p>Despite being England's and Tottenham Hotspur's all-time leading goalscorer and achieving remarkable consistency at Bayern Munich, questions persist about whether striker Harry Kane is fully appreciated. The 32-year-old has broken numerous records, recently becoming the fastest player to score 100 goals for a single club in Europe's top five leagues. However, criticism sometimes arises regarding his performances in major international tournaments, even though he is England's top scorer in those competitions as well. Pundits argue that his understated personality and the high expectations placed on him may contribute to him being undervalued compared to other global superstars.</p>

          <p>Kenya has converted US$5 billion in Chinese loans, originally denominated in U.S. dollars, into Chinese yuan in a strategic move to reduce its debt-servicing costs. The loans were taken from the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the Standard Gauge Railway project. This currency swap is expected to save Kenya approximately US$215 million annually, partly by halving the interest rate from the previous 6.37%. Analysts suggest this decision could set a precedent for other debt-distressed African nations, potentially strengthening their financial ties with Beijing and reducing their reliance on the U.S. dollar for international debt.

          <p>University of Southern California's football team secured a significant 31-13 victory over No. 15 Michigan, powered by an unexpected breakout performance from walk-on running back King Miller.
