          <p>Markeiz Ryan, a 36-year-old U.S. Army veteran, has found a more fulfilling and less stressful life after relocating to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. He lives comfortably on a monthly income of roughly $4,000 from various sources, a sum he says allows him to be in the middle or upper-middle class there. Ryan contrasts the constant financial pressure and lack of motivation he felt in America with the calm, safety, and freedom he now has to focus on personal happiness in Vietnam.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Anson Funds is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings, in which it holds a 3.65% stake. This move follows a period of significant restructuring at CCO, prompted by a previous activist campaign, where the company sold its international assets to become a U.S.-focused pureplay. Anson argues that despite these strategic improvements, the company's stock remains undervalued, and a sale to a strategic buyer or private equity firm represents the best path forward for shareholders.

This system is designed to fill a safety gap left by current in-air collision avoidance systems, which are typically not active at low altitudes.</p>

The author speaks with the original ACLU lawyer, David Goldberger, who reflects on the personal pain the case caused while reaffirming its crucial legal principle. He argues that free speech must protect even offensive and hateful expression, because allowing officials to ban speech based on whether it is disliked creates a dangerous precedent for censorship.</p>
