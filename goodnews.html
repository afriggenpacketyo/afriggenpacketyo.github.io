          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener is reportedly preparing to run for Nancy Pelosi's congressional seat in 2026, a move that has ignited political speculation in San Francisco. His entry sets up a competitive primary, challenging both the long-serving incumbent, should she run again, and wealthy progressive challenger Saikat Chakrabarti. The decision highlights a broader debate within the Democratic party about the need for younger candidates and forces a now-or-never moment for Wiener to leverage his political capital and fundraising capabilities in a high-stakes, nationally watched race.</p>

          <p>The United States and China are scheduled to hold a new round of trade negotiations next week, aiming to de-escalate the ongoing economic conflict between the two nations. The talks follow President Trump's recent statement in an interview where he described the cumulative tariff rate on Chinese goods as "not sustainable," despite defending the initial decision to impose them. This development occurs amidst retaliatory measures, including China's expanded export controls on rare-earth elements, which are critical for technology manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study has yielded promising results for the Galleri blood test, which can screen for more than 50 different types of cancer by detecting fragments of cancerous DNA in the bloodstream. In a trial involving 25,000 adults in North America, the test successfully identified cancer in nearly one in 100 participants, with over half of those cases found at an early, more treatable stage. The test was particularly effective at finding cancers that currently have no screening programs, suggesting it could significantly speed up diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.</p>
