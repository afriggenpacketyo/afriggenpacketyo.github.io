          <p>After an 18-month endeavor to forge a career in the NFL, Welsh athlete Louis Rees-Zammit has announced his decision to return to rugby union. The 24-year-old, who had been on the Jacksonville Jaguars' practice squad and active roster, stated it was the right time to come home and focus on what he does best. Before his departure for the NFL's International Player Pathway Program, Rees-Zammit had earned 32 caps for Wales. His return is anticipated to be a significant boost for the Welsh national rugby team under its new head coach.</p>

          <p>Nintendo announced that its revenue more than doubled in its first fiscal quarter, largely due to the successful launch of its new Switch 2 console. The company sold 5.82 million units of the new device, which launched in early June, contributing to a total revenue of 572.3 billion yen and exceeding analyst expectations. Despite the strong performance, Nintendo has maintained its full-year financial forecast, a target some analysts consider conservative. The company also stated that potential U.S. tariffs are not expected to have a significant impact on its current earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time, the German government has reported a "favorable" conservation status for its wolf population in the Atlantic region, which includes areas along the North Sea coast. Authorities documented 209 wolf packs, totaling around 1,600 individuals, indicating significant population growth in recent years. This new status could pave the way for controlled hunting in the region to manage the population and protect livestock, a move long advocated by farmers' associations. The conservation status for the rest of Germany remains under review pending further assessment.</p>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase social diversity within Whitehall, the UK government has announced that its main civil service internship scheme will now be exclusively open to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The determination of background will be based on parental occupation when the applicant was 14. Successful interns from this program will also be given priority for the Fast Stream, the primary graduate entry route into the civil service. The move, driven by Cabinet Office minister Pat McFadden, aims to ensure the civil service better reflects the country it serves.</p>

          <p>A new law named after Ronan Kanda, a 16-year-old fatally stabbed in 2022, has come into effect in the UK, outlawing the manufacture, sale, and possession of ninja swords. The law was championed by Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, after her son was killed with such a weapon purchased online by a teenager. Under Ronan's Law, possession of a ninja sword in private can lead to imprisonment, and retailers must now report suspicious knife orders and conduct strict age verification. The government reported that a surrender scheme in July successfully removed over 1,000 of these weapons from circulation.</p>

          <p>A new anti-poaching initiative in South Africa, the Rhisotope Project, is injecting rhinos' horns with harmless radioactive isotopes to deter trafficking. Led by the University of the Witwatersrand, the project aims to make the horns easily detectable by radiation sensors at international borders and airports, leading to the arrest of poachers. Following successful trials, five rhinos were injected at the official launch of the campaign. Researchers confirmed the process is safe for the animals but highly effective in making the horns traceable, even when hidden inside large shipping containers, offering a new tool against the illegal wildlife trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An analysis of the space industry suggests a strategic pivot from viewing the Moon as a final destination to seeing it as a stepping stone for more ambitious missions to Mars. While NASA's Artemis program continues to advance lunar exploration with planned human expeditions, the long-term rhetoric from figures like Elon Musk and national space agencies increasingly centers on Mars. China aims for a manned mission by 2033, and the European Space Agency targets 2040 for sending its astronauts to the red planet. This shift may see national agencies focus on Mars, leaving lunar projects increasingly to the burgeoning private space sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and Kuwait have pledged to deepen their military relationship as they near the inauguration of a joint ammunition factory in Kuwait. The facility, which will reportedly produce light and medium ammunition, is described by a Kuwaiti defense official as a milestone in their cooperation. The two nations also plan to expand their joint military training programs, which began in 2019. This development highlights China's increasing engagement and strengthening defense ties with key allies of the United States in the Gulf region, building on a military cooperation agreement first signed in 1995.</p>
