          <p>Actor Danny Dyer revealed that a letter from his daughter Dani convinced him to stay in rehab in 2016. Dyer had initially planned to leave the facility, but the letter made him reconsider his life and fame. He realized the toxic impact his lifestyle had on his family and committed to treatment in South Africa. Dyer, known for his role in 'Human Traffic' and 'EastEnders,' reflected on his past of drug use and hedonistic behavior, noting a turning point when he took the role of Mick Carter in 'EastEnders' due to financial struggles.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish student at Tufts University, was released from federal custody after a judge ordered her immediate release. Ozturk expressed joy and gratitude upon her return to Massachusetts, thanking supporters for their kindness. Despite her ordeal, she maintained faith in the American system of justice. Her detention sparked outrage due to the Trump administration's crackdown on international students and allegations that her visa was canceled in retaliation for her criticism of the university's response to pro-Palestinian demands, which her supporters deny was antisemitic. Representative Ayanna Pressley and Senator Edward J. Markey welcomed her home, promising to fight for her full exoneration and visa restoration.</p>

          <p>An international clinical trial led by Chinese and US scientists has found that a new medication, zongertinib, shows promise for treating HER2-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The oral medication outperformed the standard treatment option and had fewer adverse effects. The study was conducted at 82 sites worldwide, including institutions in the US, China, and Japan, with Asian populations accounting for a majority of the participants. This type of lung cancer is particularly difficult to treat, making this new medication a potential new benchmark for targeted therapy.</p>
