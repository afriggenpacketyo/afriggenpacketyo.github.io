          <h2>Boeing Aircraft Orders Frequently Included in Trump's Bilateral Trade Deals</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's bilateral trade deals often feature large orders for Boeing aircraft, a recurring symbol in his negotiations. Experts suggest this trend is partly performative, providing high-profile statements of trade commitment and helping reduce bilateral trade surpluses with the U.S. Additionally, aircraft imports are less politically sensitive than other commodities and their long delivery windows offer financial flexibility. Beyond symbolism, the growing international tourism industry means these U.S.-made passenger jets are genuinely needed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a new visa category on October 1, specifically targeting global professionals in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields. This initiative aims to offer greater flexibility and fewer barriers, signaling a strategic shift in China's immigration policy to enhance its hi-tech sectors and competitiveness. For individuals like Pakistani PhD student Rahdar Hussain Afridi, who faced uncertainty about staying in China post-graduation, this visa provides a crucial pathway to employment. Observers, however, caution that the plan's success will depend on effective policy support.</p>

          <p>New league tables have been published for the first time, ranking NHS trusts in England based on performance, with specialist hospitals generally topping the list. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated these tables aim to identify areas needing urgent support and end the "postcode lottery" in healthcare. Trusts will be categorized quarterly, influencing their autonomy and support levels, with leaders held accountable for poor performance. While intended to boost transparency and standards, some, like NHS Providers, question the accuracy of the metrics and warn of potential unintended consequences if trusts prioritize rankings over patient needs.</p>

          <p>Max Muncy has been activated from the injured list and returned to the Dodgers' lineup, starting at third base and batting cleanup against the Colorado Rockies.

Muncy, who was hitting .258 with 17 homers and 64 RBIs before his injury, aims to contribute by simply being himself and focusing on a day-at-a-time approach.

          <p>California lawmakers have approved a bill, AB 519, to ban online pet dealer websites and middlemen posing as local breeders from selling dogs, cats, and rabbits under one year old. This legislation targets deceptive practices highlighted by a Times investigation, where commercially bred animals from out-of-state puppy mills were resold under false pretenses. The bill, now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature, aims to close loopholes from a 2019 law that banned pet store sales of commercially bred animals. This article notes that additional bills seek to void contracts with nonrefundable deposits and mandate public disclosure of pet travel certificates, enhancing consumer protection and animal welfare.</p>
