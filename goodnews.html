          <p>Exit polls from South Korean broadcasters KBS, MBC, and SBS indicated that liberal candidate Lee Jae-myung was expected to win the presidential election. With a significant portion of the votes counted, Lee was projected to secure a substantial lead over conservative challenger Kim Moon Soo. A spokesperson for Lee's Democratic Party stated that voters had delivered a strong rebuke to the previous government, while a Conservative party representative expressed shock at the projected outcome. The election is seen as a critical juncture for South Korea, potentially shifting its political direction. Optimism for this article is based on the peaceful transfer of power. </p>

          <p>An American attorney who retired to Lisbon, Portugal, shares three myths about leaving the U.S. to live abroad. The first myth is that you'll have less stress, however the author notes that efficiency and customer service might not be up to par with American standards. The second myth is that you'll save more money, but Americans often face extra administrative steps and volatile currency exchange rates. The third myth is that you'll make friends easily, but it can be difficult to make new connections, especially in rural areas, so it is important to have a contingency plan. </p>
