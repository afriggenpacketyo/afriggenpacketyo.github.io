          <p>After 25 years of deadlock, World Trade Organization members have ratified a landmark agreement to eliminate harmful fisheries subsidies, a rare success for the institution. This development is seen as a crucial reaffirmation of multilateralism at a time when global cooperation is under significant strain. The deal's success, along with China's pledge to forego special treatment as a developing nation, offers a much-needed boost to the WTO's relevance. It demonstrates that despite political challenges, international bodies can still achieve progress on critical environmental and economic issues.</p>

          <p>Sergio Busquets, the decorated former captain for Spain and FC Barcelona, has announced he will retire from professional football at the conclusion of the Major League Soccer season in December. The 38-year-old midfielder won 32 major trophies with Barcelona, including nine La Liga titles and three Champions Leagues. He also played a pivotal role in Spain's national team, earning 143 caps and winning the 2010 World Cup and 2012 European Championship.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shipping industry analysts have observed a notable reduction in the deployment of Chinese-built vessels on transpacific trade routes to North America. This shift appears to be a proactive measure by carriers to mitigate the impact of an upcoming U.S. port service fee targeting such ships. According to consultancy Sea Intelligence, the share of Chinese-built vessels on the Asia-North America west coast route has trended downward in recent weeks. This strategic adjustment by shipping lines highlights how industries are adapting their operations in response to evolving U.S.-China trade policies and associated costs.</p>

The discussion was described as 'candid, in-depth and constructive,' with both sides committing to maintain dialogue and expand areas of cooperation. During the talks, China reiterated its stance on the one-China policy and urged the U.S. to take action to uphold stability in the Taiwan Strait.

          <p>As the Ryder Cup begins, analysis points to several key factors that will likely determine whether Team Europe can break the trend of home-side victories and win in the U.S. for the first time since 2012. A fast start in the opening foursomes sessions is considered crucial, as Europe has struggled in this format in recent away matches. Managing the famously boisterous New York crowd will also be a major challenge for the visiting team. Europe holds a significant advantage in player experience, but they will face a formidable U.S. side led by world number one Scottie Scheffler.</p>

          <p>During a farewell meeting for Beijing's outgoing ambassador, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. emphasized that maritime disputes in the South China Sea should not define the entirety of the relationship between the two nations. Both sides agreed to focus on deepening trade, cultural exchanges, and people-to-people interactions. The Chinese embassy stated its hope that Manila will work with Beijing to return relations to a stable track. This diplomatic tone echoes a joint statement from 2023, which stressed that maritime issues are only one component of their broader bilateral engagement.</p>

          <p>After being the subject of intense takeover speculation earlier this year, British energy major BP is now seen as a less likely acquisition target. The company's shares have climbed over 32% since April, outperforming many rivals, driven by a strategic reset, leadership changes, and recent oil discoveries. This improved performance and rising valuation have cooled talk of potential buyouts from competitors like Shell or Exxon Mobil. BP's CEO has emphasized that the company is focused on its own growth strategy to drive shareholder value rather than entertaining takeover approaches.</p>

          <p>Chinese toy company Pop Mart has stated that the recent crash in the secondary market prices for its popular Labubu monster toys is a welcome development. After commanding massive markups from scalpers, resale prices are now falling as the company has significantly increased production to meet demand. Pop Mart expressed that its products are intended for genuine fans, and a market driven solely by profit-seeking is unsustainable and alienates real customers. Analysts see this as a strategic pivot by the company towards a more stable, long-term business model rather than relying on short-term hype.</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks secured a dramatic 23-20 victory over the Arizona Cardinals with a 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired.

          <p>In a recent interview, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicated his readiness to step down from office once the war with Russia is over. He emphasized that his primary goal is achieving peace for his country, not securing another term in office. Zelenskyy also firmly committed to holding elections in Ukraine if a ceasefire agreement is reached, even a temporary one. Under Ukraine's current martial law, elections are suspended, and Zelenskyy's original five-year term would have ended in May 2024 had the full-scale invasion not occurred.</p>
