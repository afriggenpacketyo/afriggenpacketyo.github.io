        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move amid the ongoing AI talent war, Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior R&D staff. The deal involves Google paying $2.4 billion for compensation and a nonexclusive license to some of Windsurf's technology, though it is not an acquisition of the company itself. This follows reports that Windsurf had been in acquisition talks with OpenAI. The hiring highlights the intense competition for top AI expertise among major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued an emergency order temporarily blocking the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate immigration stops and arrests in seven Southern California counties. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from advocacy groups, which presented a 'mountain of evidence' that federal agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on their race or ethnicity. The order prohibits agents from using factors like appearance, speaking Spanish, or being present at certain locations as the sole basis for a stop. This decision is a temporary measure while the broader lawsuit concerning racial profiling proceeds.</p>

          <p>Following a backlash over sandals that closely resembled traditional Indian Kolhapuri chappals, luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers. The controversy erupted after Prada showcased the design at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its cultural origins, prompting criticism from Indian fashion experts and politicians. Prada has now met with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans, to discuss future collaborations. The move is seen as a step toward respectful engagement between global fashion brands and traditional craft communities.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege their voices were cloned without proper consent and used on the company's platform after they were hired for what they were told was internal or academic work. While the judge dismissed claims of federal copyright over their voices, the case will proceed on grounds of breach of contract and deceptive business practices. This decision is seen as a significant development for artists challenging the misuse of their work by AI companies.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence, driven by demand from Chinese companies expanding overseas and a push from Beijing. The number of Chinese legal offices abroad has grown by 70 percent since 2018, as Chinese businesses often prefer legal support from their compatriots. While they are successfully serving this niche, lawyers note that winning over non-Chinese clients is challenging amid current geopolitical tensions. The trend reflects China's growing economic footprint and the need for legal infrastructure to support its international ventures.</p>

          <p>With the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, dozens of local firms are developing rival medications. Analysts predict that up to 60 GLP-1 drugs are currently under trial in China, which could lead to a highly competitive market for more affordable generic versions. This development is poised to significantly increase access to these treatments for obesity and diabetes, which are currently very expensive. The global market for these drugs is estimated to be worth around $150 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Port of Long Beach has broken ground on a major $365-million expansion project, despite a recent slowdown in activity attributed to rising tariffs and global trade tensions. The project, led by terminal operator International Transportation Service, will add 19 acres of land and extend the quay to accommodate larger cargo ships, aiming to boost capacity by 50%. Port officials expressed confidence in the long-term demand for larger vessels and the port's ability to progress through periods of uncertainty.

          <p>Ten years after its release, 'The Night We Met' by indie band Lord Huron has become a massive sleeper hit, out-streaming major 2024 releases from global pop stars. The song, which was not a hit upon its 2015 release, has now surpassed three billion plays on Spotify, a milestone even Taylor Swift has yet to reach. Its slow-burning success is attributed to its inclusion in the Netflix series '13 Reasons Why' in 2017 and its subsequent viral popularity on TikTok. The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, reflects on the song's 'unbelievable' and sustained rise, driven by its emotionally resonant and relatable themes.</p>

The King's long-held beliefs, once considered fringe, advocate for a 'call to revolution' against consumer culture and in favor of sustainability.

          <p>A plan to dismantle and replace Prague's historic 123-year-old Vysehrad railway bridge is facing significant criticism from architects, preservationists, and the public. The Railway Authority argues that the corroded bridge cannot handle projected increases in rail traffic and needs to be replaced with a new, three-track structure. However, a coalition of experts, backed by a public petition and UNESCO, insists the iconic bridge can be repaired in place for less money and disruption. The debate highlights the classic conflict between preserving cultural heritage and meeting the demands of modern infrastructure in a historically rich city.</p>

While affirming the importance of the AUKUS security pact and the US alliance, Albanese is also emphasizing Australia's need to act in its own sovereign interest amid rising global tensions. Drawing inspiration from wartime leader John Curtin, he is asserting a posture rooted in strategic reality rather than tradition. This approach comes as his government faces domestic pressure from both the left and right on defense spending.</p>

For the first 14 years of his life, Viraj was unable to communicate and was presumed to be severely intellectually disabled. However, his single father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could type with his right thumb, unlocking a flood of communication and revealing a brilliant mind. In just a few years, he advanced from basic math to calculus, scored a 35 on his ACT, and now hopes his success will show the world the hidden potential within the non-speaking autistic community.</p>
