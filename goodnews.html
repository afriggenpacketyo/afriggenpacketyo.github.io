          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 18:30:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool has concluded its most expensive transfer window in history, spending £415 million on new players, including a British record £125 million for striker Alexander Isak. This significant shift in transfer policy was driven by a combination of factors, including accumulated funds from previous frugal windows, substantial commercial growth, and player sales exceeding £200 million. The club's recent Premier League title win under manager Arne Slot also created an opportune moment to invest heavily and strengthen the squad, although the tragic death of Diogo Jota necessitated unplanned changes in their forward line.</p>

          <p>The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), a Eurasian political and economic alliance including China, Russia, and India, has decided to establish a new development bank. This initiative aims to provide member nations with an alternative financial system to reduce their reliance on the US dollar for trade and insulate them from associated risks. Analysts suggest the bank would also accelerate key infrastructure projects within the 10 member countries. The move is seen as a logical step to strengthen economic cooperation and financial sovereignty among the participating nations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Met Office has announced a "decent chance" for the aurora borealis, or Northern Lights, to be visible across large parts of the United Kingdom in the coming days. This rare viewing opportunity, extending further south than usual, is due to heightened solar activity from a recent coronal mass ejection. While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies and minimal light pollution, the phenomenon could offer a memorable display for many. The best chances for sightings are predicted for Monday and Tuesday nights, particularly in areas with less cloud cover like the Midlands.</p>

          <p>At 38, Novak Djokovic continues to break age-related records, reaching the quarter-finals of all four Grand Slams this year, but questions about his physical endurance persist. Despite playing himself into good form at the US Open, his matches have been marked by various physical complaints, requiring trainer attention for his neck, shoulder, and back. As he prepares to face No. 4 seed Taylor Fritz, against whom he holds a dominant 10-0 record, the primary challenge is whether his aging body can withstand the strain of consecutive best-of-five-set matches.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has completed the signing of 23-year-old Belgian goalkeeper Senne Lammens from Royal Antwerp for an initial fee of £18.1 million. Lammens, who has signed a five-year contract, is seen as a promising talent intended to address the club's recent goalkeeping instabilities. The move comes after inconsistent performances from current goalkeepers Altay Bayindir and Andre Onana. Lammens was a standout performer in the Belgian Pro League last season, noted for his exceptional shot-stopping and ball-playing abilities, which the club hopes will translate well to the Premier League.</p>

          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," directed by Benny Safdie, stars Dwayne Johnson as pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr. The drama explores a crisis point in Kerr's life in the late 1990s, as he grappled with substance abuse and relationship anxieties after suffering his first professional loss. Johnson's performance is noted as the only conceivable casting for the role, though the film is seen as a solid but not groundbreaking drama primarily for UFC fans. Emily Blunt co-stars as Kerr's girlfriend, Dawn, providing a witty and sympathetic performance.</p>
