          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 07:04:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery has announced its intention to divide into two distinct public companies by the following year. The media conglomerate made this announcement on Monday, though specific details regarding the reasons for the split or the structure of the new entities were not immediately available. This move signifies a significant restructuring for the company, which could have wide-ranging implications for its various media properties and strategic direction. The full scope and rationale behind the decision will likely be revealed in subsequent updates from the company's leadership, as the split is likely being undertaken to increase shareholder value and allow the two separate companies to focus on different aspects of the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>This news digest covers several key events in Japan and the surrounding region. Japan is closely monitoring China's increasing maritime activity near its easternmost island, while Prime Minister Ishiba aims to boost Japan's nominal GDP to 1,000 trillion yen by 2040. The leaders of Japan and South Korea agreed to build stable ties, and four Japanese Self-Defense Force members were injured in an explosion near the U.S. Kadena Air Base. Japan's negotiator is planning a U.S. trip for tariff talks, and the country's January-March GDP was revised upward but still contracted. Lastly, Japan's current account surplus rose in April due to a smaller trade deficit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek explores the relationship between physics inside materials and fundamental physics in empty space, highlighting the fruitful implications of using similar ideas to describe both. This approach has enabled modern electronics and computer technology, and continues to inspire innovations in technology and discoveries in fundamental physics. Wilczek references historical perspectives, from Aristotle's concept of nature abhorring a vacuum to Descartes' theory of planets embedded in an ether, contrasting them with Newton's view of space as an immaterial void. The exploration delves into the notion of quasi-worlds and their potential connection to the universe, raising questions about the fundamental distinctions between them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) are facing challenges under the second Trump administration, including potential cuts to federal funding and grants. Mark Brown, president of Tuskegee University, discusses how HBCUs can navigate the uncertainty, emphasizing that these institutions are merit-based schools open to all qualified applicants, not just diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. He highlights the importance of HBCUs as economic engines and stresses the need for them to focus on capability, outcome, and performance, ensuring students gain internships, experience, and graduate. Brown also points out that proposed budget reductions in student loans and Pell Grants could significantly impact access to education for students at HBCUs, where most rely on federal aid.</p>

          <p>The UK government has proposed extending a ban on bottom trawling, a fishing method that involves dragging large nets along the seafloor, across a larger area of English waters. This expansion would increase the protected area from 18,000km2 to 48,000km2, covering 41 of England's 181 Marine Protected Areas. The proposal is subject to a 12-week industry consultation and aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. The announcement coincides with a UN Ocean Conference in France, where calls are being made for more countries to ratify a treaty to protect a third of international waters by 2030.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says artificial intelligence is a "great equalizer" because it allows anyone to program using everyday language. Speaking at London Tech Week, Huang explained that programming has historically been difficult and inaccessible, but now, with AI, the new programming language is "human." He highlighted that conversational AI models like ChatGPT allow users to simply ask the computer to perform tasks, such as writing a poem or generating images. This shift makes programming more accessible to a wider audience, as the way to program an AI is like the way you program a person.</p>

          <p>Rod Stewart, who turned 80 in January, maintains his fitness through an unusual workout routine that includes underwater training and sprints. He jokingly attributes his fitness to "lots of women, drugs and wine," but in reality, he has a dedicated trainer and an indoor pool, gym, and golf course at his disposal. His underwater training involves diving to push a brick to the end of the pool, inspired by advice from Frank Sinatra about the importance of powerful lungs for singing. Stewart also does 100-meter sprints on his private track, aiming to break the world record for an 80-year-old.</p>

          <p>St. George, Utah, is exploring an unconventional solution to water scarcity by reclaiming sewage for reuse, as climate change exacerbates water shortages and population growth strains existing supplies. The city is constructing a new wastewater reclamation plant to treat effluent for irrigation, eventually planning to send the clean water directly into the drinking supply. This reuse strategy is a key part of the city's long-term water plan, aiming to reduce reliance on the Virgin River and address the challenges of water scarcity in the American West. Other cities, like Las Vegas, have already proven the effectiveness of wastewater reuse in managing water resources.</p>
