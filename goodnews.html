          <p>Iran launched a missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; however, Qatari air defenses intercepted the missiles, preventing casualties. President Trump acknowledged the attack as a "very weak response" and thanked Iran for providing early notice, which allowed for effective countermeasures. The Qatari government condemned the attack as a violation of its sovereignty and international law, reserving the right to respond. The U.S. Embassy in Qatar had issued a shelter-in-place order prior to the attack, and Bahrain also temporarily closed its airspace. The overall sentiment suggests a controlled escalation with both sides signaling a desire to avoid further conflict. The US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend after more than a week of Israeli attacks on Iranian targets and Iranian strikes on Israel.</p>

          <p>An experimental weight-loss drug, amycretin, developed by Novo Nordisk, has demonstrated significant weight loss in early-stage trials, with participants losing nearly 25% of their body weight. The drug replicates hunger hormones amylin and GLP-1, suppressing appetite and boosting insulin secretion, and unlike other weight-loss treatments, amycretin did not appear to cause a weight-loss plateau. Common side effects were primarily gastrointestinal symptoms, and researchers emphasize that while promising, amycretin is not a cure-all for obesity and is most effective when combined with other interventions. Novo Nordisk is planning phase 3 trials for both oral and injectable forms of the medication.</p>

          <p>President Trump stated that Iran's missile attack on the U.S. Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar resulted in no American casualties and minimal damage, describing the attack as "very weak" and "effectively countered." Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice of the strike, and expressed hope for peace and harmony in the region. A U.S. official confirmed that 13 of the 14 Iranian missiles were intercepted by the U.S. and Qatar, and the 14th did not end up in Qatar.

          <p>Oil prices fell sharply after a missile strike by Iran on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about a broader conflict in the Middle East. U.S. crude oil and global benchmark Brent both experienced significant drops, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran on June 13. The oil market sell-off indicates that investors believe the conflict will de-escalate after President Donald Trump hit Iran over the weekend, with some analysts suggesting a "peace through strength" strategy. President Trump thanked Iran in a social media post "for giving us early notice" about the strike, "which made it possible for no lives to be lost."</p>

          <p>Miley Cyrus has shared how Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy helped her overcome stage fright, describing the therapy as having "saved my life." EMDR is a mental health therapy method that helps treat conditions resulting from past traumas by stimulating certain senses while recalling traumatic memories. During a session, a clinician will ask questions to stimulate components of a memory, including sensory information, and add in eye movements and tapping to facilitate information processing. Cyrus described her EMDR experience as watching her life like a movie, observing her past pass her by through the windows.</p>

          <p>Opening a $10,000 2-year CD account now can be a strategic move to protect and grow money in an uncertain economic climate. With CD interest rates remaining high, depositing a larger amount into a 2-year CD guarantees a return of close to $1,000. This approach secures long-term protection against market volatility and provides time to think about long-term financial goals. While the account requires discipline to avoid early withdrawal penalties, the benefits of guaranteed interest, market protection, and financial planning time make it a worthwhile consideration (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Apple is no longer acting as the stock market's safety trade, with the SPDR Info Tech Sector Fund (XLK) and Invesco Nasdaq Trust (QQQ) outperforming the S&P 500 Index. Amid recent tariff volatility, investors have turned to broad market ETFs like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) for diversification. VettaFi director of research Todd Rosenbluth suggests investors are incorporating tech and AI into broader portfolios, while also hedging with fixed income ETFs.  Despite the current volatility, some experts see opportunities to own tech stocks at cheaper prices (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Chelsea's training session in Philadelphia was cut short due to extreme heat, with temperatures reaching 36C and a heat index of 41C. Head coach Enzo Maresca expressed concern about the conditions, stating that it was almost impossible to train effectively. The team is preparing to face Esp√©rance in their final game in Group D, and Maresca will rotate players to manage fatigue. The heat has also raised concerns about player safety in other Club World Cup matches, with calls for postponements due to the extreme conditions.</p>
