          <p>An F-35 fighter jet crashed in a field in Fresno County, California, but the pilot managed to eject safely and was not injured. The aircraft, attached to the Navy's VFA-125 training squadron based at Naval Air Station Lemoore, went down on Wednesday evening. The crash caused a small grass fire that burned nearly a dozen acres but was contained by firefighters. The cause of the incident is currently under investigation, and no other personnel were affected. </p>

          <p>Despite facing new 25% tariffs from the U.S., India has strategically avoided hurrying into a trade deal, primarily to protect its sensitive agricultural sector, which represents a large and influential voting bloc. Analysts suggest India is negotiating from a position of strength, aware of its growing importance to the U.S. as a strategic partner and a manufacturing alternative to China. New Delhi appears confident it can secure a favorable agreement on its own timeline without compromising key national interests. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An Israeli military official from COGAT provided a detailed briefing on the extensive humanitarian efforts in Gaza during the war. The official stated that nearly 100,000 aid trucks have entered through multiple crossings, and that Israel has coordinated with dozens of international partners to facilitate aid, restore power lines, and establish 14 field hospitals. The briefing aimed to counter narratives of starvation, asserting that distribution challenges within Gaza, not Israeli obstruction, are the primary bottleneck for aid reaching civilians.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed into law a bill that strengthens penalties for soliciting minors for sex. The new law, AB 379, gives prosecutors the discretion to charge an individual with a felony on a first offense if they are at least three years older than the 16- or 17-year-old they solicit. This "wobbler" provision targets older offenders while avoiding harsher penalties for all younger individuals, a compromise reached after earlier controversy over the bill's scope.</p>

          <p>A powerful 8.8 magnitude earthquake off Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula triggered tsunami alerts across the Pacific, including for Hawaii and the U.S. West Coast. While the quake caused flooding in Russia and sent waves toward Japan, the threat to the United States was less severe than initially feared. Tsunami warnings were eventually downgraded to advisories, and evacuation orders were lifted in most areas after only minor flooding and small waves were observed, averting a major disaster.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal for the expansion of London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan put forth by the airport's owners. The Arora Group's "Heathrow West" proposal features a shorter third runway, which the company claims would avoid the expensive and highly disruptive project of rerouting the M25 motorway. This introduces the first-ever competitive bid for the long-debated expansion, potentially offering a less costly and lower-risk alternative.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a major earthquake in Russia that triggered tsunami alerts, this article explains the science behind these powerful ocean waves. Tsunamis are most often caused by large, shallow underwater earthquakes that create a vertical displacement of the seafloor, generating waves that travel at jet-plane speeds in deep water. As they approach the coast, they slow down and their height increases dramatically, creating a dangerous surge of water that can cause widespread devastation, making evacuation warnings critical.</p>

          <p>A research expedition using a human-occupied submersible has discovered and filmed what they describe as "thriving communities" of life at depths of over 9,000 meters in the Pacific Ocean. The team observed vast fields of tube worms, beds of clams, and mats of bacteria in the pitch-dark, high-pressure environment. These findings challenge long-held assumptions about the limits of life in extreme ocean depths and suggest that such chemosynthetic ecosystems, fueled by chemicals from the seafloor, may be widespread.</p>
