          <p>Renowned Nobel Prize-winning theoretical physicist Chen-ning Yang has died in Beijing at the age of 103, with the cause reported as sickness. Yang, frequently ranked alongside Albert Einstein, was a pivotal figure in 20th-century physics, whose contributions fundamentally reshaped our understanding of the universe. In 1954, he co-authored the groundbreaking Yang–Mills theory with American physicist Robert Mills, a set of equations that proved as crucial as Einstein’s relativity. This theory laid the mathematical foundation for the Standard Model, unifying the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces and explaining elementary particle behavior, thus profoundly influencing modern physics.</p>

          <p>The South African SUV market has witnessed a significant transformation, with Chinese original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) achieving an impressive 86% surge in sales volume between January and August, compared to the same period last year. This substantial growth has elevated their total market share to 15%, primarily fueled by the strong performances of brands such as Chery and Haval. Although established Japanese leaders like Toyota and Suzuki continue to command the largest sales volumes, their individual market dominance is notably declining. Both brands recorded a decrease in market share during this period, signaling a clear shift in consumer preference and increased competition within the automotive sector.</p>

This dominant display completed an NLCS sweep, securing the Dodgers' 26th pennant and their return to the World Series. Ohtani, who had been in a recent postseason slump, made a crucial adjustment to his batting practice routine, resulting in a historic game that solidified his status as a baseball phenom. His tour de force earned him NLCS MVP honors and fulfilled the long-held prophecy of his two-way talent on baseball's biggest stage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Alibaba Cloud has unveiled Aegaeon, a pioneering computing pooling solution that reportedly achieved an 82% reduction in the number of Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) required for its artificial intelligence models. Following a three-month beta test in Alibaba Cloud’s model marketplace, the system successfully decreased the Nvidia H20 GPUs needed from 1,192 to just 213 for serving numerous models of up to 72 billion parameters. This significant innovation aims to combat resource inefficiency prevalent in cloud services, where many AI models are only sporadically utilized, leading to considerable wasted GPU power.

          <p>A popular Chinese spy drama titled "Silent Honour" has inspired a significant outpouring of public praise and increased visits to the tomb of Wu Shi, a real-life underground party member and Kuomintang (KMT) lieutenant general. Despite it not being the traditional Ching Ming grave-sweeping festival, hundreds of flowers have been laid on Wu’s tomb, with visitors leaving thank-you notes for the individual they now regard as an "unsung hero." This phenomenon, reported by Beijing Daily, underscores the drama's profound impact on public sentiment, fostering a renewed appreciation for the sacrifices and contributions of real-life intelligence agents in China's history.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong is actively building a robust financial ecosystem to solidify its role as a leading offshore yuan trading center, introducing new schemes designed to make borrowing the Chinese currency both easier and more cost-effective. A key initiative, the RBF (Renminbi Business Facilitation) scheme, was noted by a local businessman for its significantly lower yuan loan rates compared to Hong Kong dollar rates. These measures, announced by both Hong Kong and mainland regulators, are strategically aimed at encouraging greater adoption of the Chinese currency by international investors and companies. The RBF scheme is slated for expansion in December, encompassing direct investments that will facilitate yuan loans for mainland firms investing overseas and for foreign firms seeking to expand their operations on the mainland.

          <p>President Trump has signed a proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imports of medium- and heavy-duty trucks, as well as their associated parts, and a 10% tariff on all imported buses, including school and city buses. This protectionist measure is designed to shield U.S. companies from foreign competition and strongly incentivize domestic manufacturing within the automotive sector. The administration plans to offer a credit for vehicle manufacturers who import some parts for U.S.-based assembly, effectively offsetting their tariff liabilities. This program aims to support American labor and ensure domestic producers remain cost-competitive, aligning with the president's broader objective of expanding manufacturing within the United States.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Liu Huaqing, the former commander of the Chinese navy, revered as a strategist and visionary technocrat credited with orchestrating China's comprehensive naval modernization to world-class standards. Often compared to 19th-century American naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan, Liu directed the transformation of China's maritime capabilities, laying the groundwork for its "blue sea strategy." Born in 1916, he joined the Red Army at just 13 and participated in the Long March, rising through the ranks of the People’s Liberation Army before his transfer to the newly established PLA Navy in 1952. His remarkable career illustrates a journey from a landlocked upbringing to becoming the pivotal architect of modern Chinese naval power.</p>

          <p>The annual Orionid meteor shower is poised to peak next week, promising a spectacular celestial display that will be visible until November 7, with optimal viewing conditions between midnight and dawn. These meteors, known for their brightness and rapid movement, originate from the debris left by Halley's Comet, which last passed Earth in 1986 and is not expected to return until 2061. As Earth traverses this debris field, minuscule particles burn up in our atmosphere, producing long, distinctive streaks of light. Stargazers can anticipate seeing approximately 15 meteors per hour during the peak around October 22, and are advised to find a dark location away from city lights, looking towards the constellation Orion, as no special equipment like binoculars or telescopes is needed for observation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's traditional Diwali gold rush is experiencing a notable shift this year, primarily influenced by soaring gold prices, which have topped $1,440 for 10 grams. While the demand for elaborate jewelry is slightly dented, a "fear of missing out" (FOMO) on further price increases is paradoxically driving more customers to markets. Jewellers are adapting to stagnant customer budgets by designing lighter, yet visually elaborate, pieces. A distinct trend indicates that more customers are purchasing gold and silver for investment purposes rather than solely for jewelry, a shift reflected in rising bullion market data and record inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and digital gold. Furthermore, India's central bank is significantly increasing its gold reserves to diversify foreign exchange holdings and provide economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is experiencing a significant and encouraging turnaround in its fentanyl crisis, with fatal overdoses falling by approximately 25% in 2024, potentially saving nearly 30,000 lives. This notable decline is largely attributed to a robust commitment to harm reduction strategies, particularly evident in states like North Carolina, where overdose fatalities are down by an impressive 35%. Key initiatives include law enforcement assisted diversion (LEAD) programs, which successfully steer substance users toward recovery services rather than incarceration. Additionally, medication-assisted treatment (MAT) using methadone and buprenorphine is proving critical, alongside the wider availability of Naloxone, a drug that effectively reverses opioid overdoses. A generational shift among young people avoiding opioids further contributes to this positive public health trend.</p>
