          <p>United Airlines experienced a significant technology issue that led to a nationwide ground stop for several hours, causing extensive delays at major hubs like Chicago, Denver, and Newark. The airline confirmed the problem has been resolved but warned of residual delays as they work to restore normal operations. Officials stated the disruption was an internal issue, not related to cybersecurity, and United is treating it as a preventable delay, meaning the company will cover applicable customer expenses like hotels. The Federal Aviation Administration offered support to help manage the flight backlog.</p>

          <p>China's trade data for July showed surprisingly strong performance, with exports rising 7.2% year-over-year, significantly beating economists' forecasts. This growth occurred amid an ongoing tariff truce with the United States, providing a potential boost to the nation's economy. In another positive sign, imports also saw their largest increase in a year, climbing 4.1% and defying predictions of a decline. This marks the first month of import growth this year, suggesting a potential recovery in domestic demand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conductor Gustavo Dudamel made a celebrated, albeit brief, return to the Hollywood Bowl for his 20th anniversary summer season with the Los Angeles Philharmonic. His homecoming week, however, is marked by the bittersweet news that his Simón Bolívar Symphony Orchestra of Venezuela has been forced to cancel its upcoming visit due to unspecified travel issues. The cancellation means Dudamel will also have to remain in Caracas instead of conducting those planned performances. His single week of concerts featured a program blending the works of Duke Ellington and Maurice Ravel, showcasing his signature innovative style.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and supply chain over the next four years, bringing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House alongside President Trump, who praised the move as a step toward ensuring iPhones are made in America. This increased commitment comes as Apple seeks to navigate the administration's threatened tariffs on foreign-made goods, which could significantly impact the company's costs. Apple CEO Tim Cook stated that while final assembly will remain overseas for now, many iPhone components are already produced domestically.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans for a significant crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetic industry to enhance public safety. The new regulations will introduce a licensing scheme for practitioners offering procedures like Botox and dermal fillers, requiring them to meet strict standards for training, safety, and insurance. For higher-risk treatments, such as non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), the rules will be even stricter, permitting only qualified health professionals to perform them. This move follows growing concerns over rogue operators and dangerous complications, including a death linked to an unregulated BBL procedure in 2024.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, UCAS, has predicted that a record number of 18-year-old domestic students are likely to be accepted into their first-choice university this year. This trend is partly attributed to financial uncertainty surrounding international student enrollment, which makes UK undergraduates a more stable and attractive option for universities' financial planning. As a result, institutions may be more flexible with admissions, potentially accepting students who narrowly miss their conditional grade offers. This comes as thousands of students across the UK prepare to receive their A-level and other final school results next week.</p>

Despite his efforts, the team's bullpen faltered, allowing four runs in the final five innings to squander the lead.
