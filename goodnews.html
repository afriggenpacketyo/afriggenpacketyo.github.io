          <p>Legendary football coach Nick Saban has effectively put an end to speculation about his potential return to the sidelines, stating he is happy with his current life. In a recent interview, he humorously remarked that the only time he considered returning to coaching was when his wife asked him to do household chores. Saban emphasized his enjoyment of his new role working with athletic directors and commissioners, as well as spending more time with his family, indicating no immediate plans to unretire.</p>

          <h2>A Satirical Account of Being Implicated in the Epstein Files</h2>

          <p>In a satirical piece written from a fictionalized perspective of Donald Trump, the author humorously recounts a fabricated history of his association with Jeffrey Epstein. The narrator claims he was reluctantly introduced to Epstein and endured years of miserable parties, all while being singularly obsessed with understanding tariffs. The piece lampoons the ongoing political controversy, portraying the narrator as an unwitting pawn in a bizarre, long-running conspiracy he never quite grasped.</p>

The author posits that such reactions reflect a culture that still takes marriage vows seriously, rather than being a sign of mere cruelty. Drawing on a George Orwell essay about lowbrow humor, the article suggests that laughing at these common human failings is a sign of a fundamentally moral, not decadent, society.</p>
