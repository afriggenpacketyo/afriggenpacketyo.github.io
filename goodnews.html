          <p>A federal judge in New Jersey has ordered the release of Columbia University activist Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, allowing his immigration proceedings to continue outside of custody. Judge Michael Farbiarz determined that Khalil is neither a flight risk nor a threat to the community, criticizing the "highly unusual" nature of his detention. Khalil, a green card holder, was detained in March, and the Department of Homeland Security cited omissions in his green card application as justification for continued detention. The judge found a lack of evidence supporting the allegations and suggested the immigration charge was being used to punish Khalil for his anti-Israel speech, which led to the judge ordering that he not be electronically monitored.</p>

          <p>Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski has voiced her concerns regarding potential cuts to Medicaid and food benefits in President Trump's proposed "big, beautiful bill," particularly how these cuts would affect her constituents in Alaska. While she has not set any absolute red lines, Murkowski has emphasized her reservations about the Medicaid proposals, citing Alaska's high healthcare costs and the significant percentage of Alaskan children relying on Medicaid. She acknowledged the need to address entitlement spending but stressed that it should not disproportionately burden the most vulnerable populations. Senate Majority Leader John Thune aims to pass the reconciliation bill by the July 4 holiday.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers reportedly blocked federal agents from entering their stadium amid ongoing protests against immigration enforcement in the city. While ICE denied that its agents were present, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) stated that Customs and Border Protection (CBP) vehicles were briefly in the stadium parking lot, unrelated to any enforcement activities. The Dodgers are expected to announce assistance for immigrants impacted by recent raids, reflecting the team's large Latino fan base.

          <p>States are increasingly offering significant tax breaks to attract data centers, leading to a forfeiture of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue. These incentives benefit tech giants like Amazon, Meta, and Google, but critics argue that data centers don't create many jobs while consuming immense amounts of electricity. A CNBC analysis found that 42 states provide full or partial sales tax exemptions to data centers, with 16 states granting nearly $6 billion in exemptions over the past five years. While some states like Virginia see some economic benefit from these exemptions, others are experiencing significant revenue losses, raising questions about the overall value for taxpayers.

          <p>Tesla is preparing to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip expected on June 28. The initial rollout will include a limited number of Model Y vehicles operating in a geofenced area of the city, with remote drivers monitoring as a backup. Access to the vehicles and rides will be by invitation only, with some social media influencers receiving early access invites. Analysts believe robotaxis could significantly boost Tesla's market capitalization, but the company is seen as lagging behind competitors like Waymo in the self-driving technology space.</p>
