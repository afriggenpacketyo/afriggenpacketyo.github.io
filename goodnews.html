          <p>Canelo √Ålvarez defeated William Scull by unanimous decision to reclaim the undisputed super middleweight title. The fight, held in Riyadh, saw √Ålvarez control the pace with powerful body punches while Scull frustrated him with constant movement. Immediately after the match, promotion began for a potential fight between √Ålvarez and Terence Crawford scheduled for September 12. √Ålvarez, fighting outside of the US or Mexico for the first time, expressed dissatisfaction with Scull's boxing style, but is now focused on the highly anticipated Crawford bout.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' program, which offered citizenship to foreign investors, deeming it a mere commercial transaction that undermines EU solidarity. The court argued that citizenship requires a genuine link with the country, not just a financial commitment. Malta's Prime Minister defended the scheme, which generated significant revenue, and pledged to rework it to comply with the ruling. The decision has sparked debate about 'golden visa' programs, which offer residence permits for investments, and raised concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption risks within the EU.</p>

          <p>Voters in South Texas overwhelmingly approved the formal organization of Starbase as a city, solidifying Elon Musk's vision for the SpaceX launch site. The vote, with 212 in favor and 6 against, establishes Starbase as an official municipality near the Mexico border. This move, celebrated by Musk, grants the facility increased control over local governance, including managing roads, utilities, and potentially closing Boca Chica Beach for launches.

          <p>Nigel Farage's right-wing populist party, Reform U.K., has made significant gains in recent local elections in England, signaling a potential disruption to the country's traditional two-party system. While the Labour and Conservative parties still dominate, Reform U.K.'s surge in support reflects a broader disenchantment among voters. Political analysts suggest that Reform's success could transform it from a protest party into a meaningful opposition force, particularly if it continues to energize voters with Farage's charismatic campaigning. The rise of smaller parties, including the Liberal Democrats and Greens, further complicates the political landscape, forcing both major parties to compete on multiple fronts.</p>
