          <p>"Dawson’s Creek" actor James van der Beek, who was diagnosed with stage 3 colorectal cancer, has shared that the primary warning sign he experienced was a subtle change in his bowel movements. The 48-year-old actor admitted he initially dismissed the symptom and was unaware that the recommended screening age had been lowered to 45. Medical experts interviewed for the article confirmed that changes in bowel habits are a key red flag, alongside fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal discomfort. They stressed the critical importance of early detection through screening, as many colorectal cancers develop silently until they are in advanced stages.</p>

          <p>Firefighters are making significant progress on the Canyon Fire in Ventura County, California, with containment reaching 62% as of Sunday morning. The blaze, which started during a heat wave, has burned 5,370 acres and destroyed seven structures near the Los Angeles and Ventura County lines. Evacuation orders for 2,700 residents have been lifted, though authorities remain vigilant due to high temperatures and potential wind gusts. Three firefighters have been injured battling the blaze, including one who was seriously hurt when his truck rolled over in steep terrain.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Apple's recent and remarkable 13% weekly stock advance was largely driven by a massive "short squeeze," where investors betting against the stock were forced to buy shares to cover their losses, pushing the price higher. Before the rally, many short-sellers targeted Apple, believing its stock was poised to fall due to a perceived lack of a clear AI strategy and potential financial hits from antitrust rulings. However, positive developments, including an apparent exemption from certain tariffs, reversed the stock's trajectory. This squeeze was so powerful it helped lift major market averages, obscuring negative trends elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actor Tom Hanks has paid a heartfelt tribute to astronaut Jim Lovell, who died at the age of 97. Hanks, who portrayed Lovell in the 1995 film "Apollo 13," described him as a leader who dared to dream and guide others to extraordinary places. The film depicted the perilous 1970 lunar mission that became a "successful failure" after an oxygen tank explosion forced the crew to abort their moon landing and navigate a safe return to Earth. In his tribute, Hanks praised Lovell's motivation as being driven by challenge rather than fame, concluding with "God speed you, on this next voyage, Jim Lovell."</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of "forest bathing," or shinrin-yoku, is gaining popularity as a mindfulness technique for improving focus and lowering stress. The practice involves intentionally immersing oneself in nature and engaging all senses to connect with the natural environment. Certified forest therapy guides lead walks that encourage quiet reflection and meditation, helping participants disconnect from the stresses of daily life and technology. Experts note that the benefits can be achieved even with short, 15-minute sessions in a local park or backyard. The trend has grown on social media, with many users sharing how it has improved their mental health.</p>

          <p>A TikTok video showing a strange airplane encounter has gone viral, amassing over 3 million views and sparking a debate on passenger etiquette. The video, filmed by Tori Wils, shows a hand from the seat behind her repeatedly reaching forward to pull down her window shade. Wils, who had paid for a window seat to enjoy the view, would pull the shade back up, only for the other passenger to pull it down again. Wils says that after she stopped filming and asked the woman to stop, they both laughed about it and the issue was resolved. The incident has prompted thousands of comments on sharing space in the air.</p>

          <h2>Expert Argues a Strong Personal Brand is a Crucial Career Tool for Introverts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Branding expert Goldie Chan, a self-described introvert, argues that developing a personal brand is a key strategy for career advancement, especially for those who are naturally less outspoken. She defines a personal brand as simply "something in your career that people know you for," which allows you to shape the narrative others have about your skills and talents. Chan advises starting with small, consistent actions, like sending one networking email a month or posting one weekly update online, to build comfort and momentum. She also emphasizes that offline activities, like hobby groups, can lead to unexpected professional opportunities.</p>

          <p>China conducted a large-scale rehearsal for its upcoming military parade, leading to the closure of central Beijing near Tiananmen Square from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. The parade, scheduled for September 3, will commemorate the 80th anniversary of what China marks as its victory over the Japanese invasion and the end of World War II. The rehearsal involved a "commemorative assembly" and tested the event's complex command operations and logistical support systems.

          <h2>A New Biography Explores the Theological and Comic Genius of Novelist Muriel Spark</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 10:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography, "Electric Spark" by Frances Wilson, re-examines the work of novelist Muriel Spark, arguing that her reputation as a comic wit obscures her identity as a major modern religious writer. The article suggests Spark's conversion to Roman Catholicism was central to her art, allowing her to explore themes of divine judgment and suffering through a darkly humorous lens. Spark's narrative technique, particularly her use of "auto-spoilers" that reveal a character's fate early on, is presented as a way of playing God with her characters. This forces the reader to focus not on what happens, but on why, mirroring theological questions about providence.</p>
