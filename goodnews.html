          <p>Following the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad, Syrian business owners are expressing renewed optimism as President Trump announced the end of U.S. sanctions on Syria. The sanctions, in place since the 1970s, were intended to pressure the Assad regime but have severely impacted the Syrian economy. Business owners who fled during the civil war are now drawing up plans to return and participate in rebuilding the country. While some worry about political hurdles, many see this as a chance to revitalize the war-torn nation.</p>

          <p>With rising interest rates and stricter lending requirements, many homeowners find their home equity "trapped." Experts suggest exploring alternative borrowing options like HELOCs or home equity loans to avoid refinancing at higher rates. Improving credit scores and stabilizing employment history can also increase access to equity. Homeowners should compare terms and eligibility requirements from various lenders to find the most cost-effective solution. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK economy has shown surprising resilience with a growth rate of 0.7% in the first three months of the year, beating expectations. While the figures may reflect erratic trade war factors and a bounceback from stagnation, they indicate a return to normal, healthy levels of growth. Despite the cost of living squeeze and pressure on small businesses, the impact of interest rate cuts and relative political stability may have been more important, leading to increased real incomes and consumer spending.</p>

          <p>Scientists have uncovered the DNA mystery behind ginger cats, particularly males, discovering they are missing a section of their genetic code. This missing code affects the melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin, eye, and fur tone, causing them to produce lighter colors. The scientists hope that solving the puzzle could also help shed light on whether orange colored cats are at increased risk of certain health conditions. This research was crowdfunded by thousands of cat lovers and conducted by teams in Japan and the US.</p>

          <p>As retailers slow down orders for foreign goods due to tariffs, companies that recirculate overstocked or returned items may help fill the gap. Reverse logistics companies like ReturnPro are preparing for a surge in demand for refurbished goods as retailers draw down inventories. These companies sort, clean, and repackage returned items, offering them for sale at discounted prices. The shift is driven by the expectation that fewer new goods will be imported, creating an opportunity for the secondhand market.</p>
