          <p>Elon Musk has announced the end of his tenure as a "special government employee," expressing gratitude to President Trump for the opportunity to cut wasteful spending. Musk led the Department of Government Efficiency, known as DOGE, tasked with reducing the size of the federal government. Musk believes DOGE's mission of reducing wasteful spending will continue to strengthen within the government, becoming a way of life throughout the government. He had previously criticized Trump's budget bill, saying it undermined DOGE's efforts. </p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts ordered the Trump administration to lift a pause on various immigration applications, protecting immigrants from Afghanistan, Latin America, and Ukraine. Judge Indira Talwani found the government's actions arbitrary and capricious, violating federal administrative law. The ruling impacts programs relying on legal immigration parole, which the Trump administration sought to curtail. The Justice Department has requested the Supreme Court to suspend this ruling, arguing it interferes with Trump's immigration agenda.</p>
