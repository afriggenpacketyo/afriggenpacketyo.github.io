          <p>Paramount Skydance is reportedly preparing an all-cash offer to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), with a potential bid expected as early as next week. This news caused WBD's stock to surge by over 28%, its best single-day performance ever, while Paramount Skydance shares also rose significantly. A merger would create a media giant, combining assets like CBS, MTV, and Paramount+ with WBD's portfolio, which includes CNN, HBO, and the Warner Bros. film studio. The potential consolidation reflects a broader trend of transformation in the media industry as companies navigate the shift from traditional pay TV to streaming-dominated consumption.</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have fallen for the second consecutive week, reaching an average of 6.35% for a 30-year term, their lowest level in almost a year. This decline is attributed to expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut and a cooling 10-year Treasury yield. The article advises potential homebuyers and those considering refinancing to evaluate their financial situations, as the current climate may present a valuable opportunity. However, it also cautions that rates are volatile and there is no guarantee they will fall further, making the decision to act now a calculated risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick announced that the U.S. and Japan will equally share profits from American projects funded by Tokyo's $550 billion investment until the initial amount is repaid. This investment is a key component of a new trade deal where Japan faces a 15% baseline tariff. After Japan recoups its investment, the profit-sharing model will shift heavily in favor of the U.S., with America receiving 90% and Japan 10%. The funds are intended to bolster U.S. domestic manufacturing in critical sectors like nuclear power and antibiotics, representing a strategic economic partnership between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>German Educators Debate Modernizing School Reading Lists to Better Reflect Student Diversity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 15:56:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway in Germany over whether classic literature by authors like Goethe should remain central to the school curriculum, or if reading lists should be updated to include more contemporary and diverse voices. Proponents of reform argue that current required texts, dominated by historical white male authors, fail to resonate with a student population where over 25% have an immigrant background. While some educators and student representatives call for more relevant material, others stress the importance of classics for understanding history and developing critical thinking. The discussion highlights a broader challenge within the German education system to balance tradition with the need to reflect modern society.</p>

          <p>The NFL has announced it will not take further action against Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson for shoving a fan who slapped his and a teammate's helmet during a game against the Buffalo Bills. The league stated that the matter was handled internally by the Ravens organization. The fan involved was ejected and has been banned indefinitely from all NFL stadiums. Jackson later expressed regret for his actions, acknowledging that he let his emotions get the better of him. The Ravens have implemented additional security protocols to better protect players from negative fan interactions in the future.</p>

          <p>Eastman Kodak has launched a new product, the "Kodak Charmera," a line of 1980s-inspired digital toy cameras that has quickly sold out online. The palm-sized cameras, created in collaboration with Reto, are marketed as fashion accessories and feature filters that mimic vintage film, tapping into Gen Z's nostalgia for retro technology. The strong initial sales provide a potential bright spot for Kodak, which has recently faced financial struggles and issued warnings about its ability to continue operations. The product's success highlights a growing consumer trend towards "analog wellness" and the popularity of blind box purchasing.</p>

          <p>The search for the next Federal Reserve chair is actively underway, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent meeting with several potential candidates, including former Fed officials Lawrence Lindsey, Kevin Warsh, and James Bullard. Bessent is also reportedly advocating for a reform agenda at the central bank, aiming to reduce its large bond portfolio and overall economic footprint in a non-disruptive manner. The process is occurring as the Trump administration continues to pressure the Fed for an interest rate cut. The selection will be crucial in shaping the future of U.S. monetary policy, with current Chair Jerome Powell's term expiring in May 2026.</p>

          <p>Belarus has freed 52 political prisoners, including prominent activists and journalists, as part of an agreement with the Trump administration to secure partial relief from U.S. sanctions. In exchange for the releases, the U.S. will allow the Belarusian national airline, Belavia, to purchase aircraft parts. Authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko framed the release as a humanitarian gesture aimed at rebuilding trade relations, which could include reopening the U.S. embassy in Minsk. While this marks a step towards diplomatic engagement, human rights groups note that over 1,000 political prisoners remain incarcerated in Belarus following widespread protests in 2020.</p>

          <h2>Social Security Benefits May See Slightly Higher Cost-of-Living Adjustment in 2026</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 14:46:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Based on the latest inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% to 2.8% in 2026. This would be a modest increase from the 2.5% adjustment in 2025 and would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by about $54. While higher than this year's increase, the projection is well below the record-high COLAs seen in 2022 and 2023 when inflation was surging. The official COLA will be announced in October, but retirees remain concerned that rising costs for essentials like Medicare premiums could outpace the adjustment to their benefits.
