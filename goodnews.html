          <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, average wage growth in the UK slowed to 4.7% in the three months to August, while the unemployment rate edged up from 4.7% to 4.8%. Analysts interpret the data as a sign of stabilization in the UK's volatile job market, although job vacancies continued to fall for the 39th consecutive period. Despite the slowdown, wage growth remains ahead of inflation, but economists suggest the persistent high growth may delay interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scottish Teenager Campaigns for Mandatory CPR Training in Schools After Losing Both Parents</h2>

          <p>After losing both of his parents to heart conditions within three years, 16-year-old Cameron McGerr is campaigning to have CPR training introduced in all Scottish schools. He believes that knowing CPR could have given him a chance to save his father, who died from a cardiac arrest earlier this year. His "Pulse of Life" campaign has already led to his own school implementing the training, and he has now presented his case to the Scottish Parliament, hoping to equip all young people with life-saving skills.</p>

          <p>The front pages of British newspapers on Tuesday are dominated by the recent ceasefire in Gaza and the accompanying exchange of hostages and prisoners. Headlines like "Freed from hell" and images of emotional reunions capture the joy and relief felt by both Israelis and Palestinians following the release of captives held for over two years. While celebrating the diplomatic breakthrough, attributed to Donald Trump, some publications also caution that achieving a lasting peace in the region remains a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Former UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is intensifying his call for a national screening program for prostate cancer, arguing it is affordable, deliverable, and would save "countless lives." As an ambassador for Prostate Cancer Research, Sunak is promoting a targeted approach focusing on high-risk groups, such as men with a family history and Black men. The proposal comes as the UK National Screening Committee reconsiders its current stance against routine screening, though some medical experts remain cautious about the risks of over-treatment.</p>

          <p>A team at Peking University has successfully restored "Rhapsody on the Luo River Goddess," a 4th-century Chinese love scroll by calligrapher Wang Xianzhi, using a combination of artificial intelligence and human expertise. With only about a quarter of the original 919 characters surviving, researchers analyzed the stylistic traits of the remaining text to train an AI model to replicate the complete work. This project showcases the potential of technology to preserve and revive ancient cultural heritage, giving new life to historical art forms in the digital age.</p>

          <p>In an effort to boost blood donor numbers, particularly among young people, the UK's Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) will now include a link to the blood donor registry in emails sent to driving licence applicants. The campaign, a partnership with NHS Blood and Transplant, aims to reach millions of potential donors annually, as more than half of current regular donors are over 45. The initiative hopes to replicate the success of the organ donor registration prompt, which has been part of the driving licence application since 1994.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' 2-1 win over the Milwaukee Brewers in the NLCS opener showcased the advantage of their record-breaking $415 million payroll. Despite stranding 11 runners and a costly baserunning error, the Dodgers secured the victory through key performances from their highly-paid stars, including a go-ahead home run from Freddie Freeman. The article suggests that the team's ability to purchase top-tier talent provides a significant buffer against mistakes and allows them to overpower less-resourced opponents.</p>

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Blake Snell delivered a masterful performance in a 2-1 victory against the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 1 of the NLCS, overcoming a bizarre inning-ending double play that cost his team a potential lead. Snell pitched eight scoreless innings, allowing only one hit and striking out ten batters in one of the best postseason starts in franchise history. His dominance on the mound was crucial, allowing the Dodgers to rally after a confusing play and ultimately secure the win with a late home run from Freddie Freeman.</p>
