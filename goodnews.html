          <p>The European Commission has approved Bulgaria's readiness to adopt the euro, paving the way for the country to join the eurozone on January 1, 2026, after reforms to reduce inflation. The decision confirms Bulgaria meets the necessary economic criteria, and the European Central Bank also assessed the economy as sufficiently prepared. While the move is expected to boost Bulgaria's economy by providing access to the ECB's monetary policy and simplifying cross-border transactions, it has faced backlash and protests over concerns about national sovereignty and economic stability. Despite political instability, Bulgaria has made steady efforts to align its economy with eurozone standards. </p>

          <p>Approximately 20,000 residents were evacuated from Cologne's city center as experts worked to defuse three unexploded bombs from World War II. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in Cologne since the war, required the closure of roads and the evacuation of hotels, care homes, and the railway station in Deutz. While the Cologne Cathedral was outside the immediate danger zone, Deutsche Bahn warned of train diversions and cancellations due to the operation. Bomb defusals are common in Cologne due to the city's heavy bombing during World War II. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exercising in smoky air poses health risks, and the safety of doing so depends on individual health conditions, workout intensity, and duration. Smoke from wildfires contains particulate matter that can irritate the lungs and exacerbate respiratory issues. Individuals with pre-existing heart or lung conditions should be particularly cautious and consider exercising indoors. Limiting the intensity and duration of outdoor workouts can also mitigate the risks associated with poor air quality. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that the Federal Reserve's June rate decision may not immediately impact mortgage rates, which are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield. While inflation is declining, it remains above the Fed's target, and the job market is solid, reducing the urgency for rate cuts. Experts anticipate rates will remain in the mid-to-upper 6% range through mid-2025, regardless of Fed actions. Some professionals recommend buying now if financially ready, citing less competition and the potential for home prices to continue rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Andrey Kurkov's Kyiv mysteries explore the surprising ambivalence of people living under occupation, focusing on policeman Samson Kolechko navigating chaos in war-torn Kyiv. The novels are more than crime thrillers, delving into the complexities of life under occupation, where violence and manipulation are commonplace. The protagonist struggles with the moral implications of serving the Bolsheviks, questioning whether order based on legalized violence is true order. The novel is a reflection on the challenges of maintaining neutrality in a conflict and the eventual need to locate one's moral compass. </p>

          <p>Private equity leaders are increasingly bullish on opportunities in Europe, reversing the negative sentiment from last year, according to discussions at the SuperReturn conference in Berlin. Factors driving this shift include falling interest rates, Germany's fiscal package, and increased political stability in key European nations. While institutional investors have shown lackluster appetite and M&A activity remains muted, some asset managers are building their European presence. Increased political stability in France, Germany, and the U.K. makes shifting money into Europe a reasonable bet. </p>
