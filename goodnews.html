          <h2>Study Shows Plastic Bag Bans and Fees Effectively Reduce Litter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-19 15:57:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that state and local plastic bag regulations significantly reduce plastic bag litter along U.S. shorelines. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups from 2017 to 2023, finding that plastic bag litter decreased by 25% to 47% in areas with bag policies compared to those without. The study highlights the effectiveness of these policies in curbing plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments. The findings suggest that fees on plastic bags may be more effective than bans, particularly partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter. The results offer a positive outlook on environmental conservation efforts and the potential for policy interventions to mitigate plastic pollution.</p>

          <p>Federal prosecutors in California have dismissed charges against Jose Manuel Mojica, a Los Angeles protester accused of assaulting border patrol agents, after footage emerged showing his arrest. Mojica, who maintained his innocence, said he was attacked by law enforcement during the protest against immigration raids. The dismissal follows scrutiny of the prosecutions, with civil rights advocates arguing that authorities misrepresented events and criminalized free speech. Mojica's attorney hopes this is the first of many dismissals for protesters charged simply for exercising their constitutional rights.</p>

Temperatures are expected to rise further, potentially reaching 33C, with some areas experiencing "tropical nights." Fire services have issued water safety warnings, and health organizations advise precautions for vulnerable individuals. The rising temperatures are attributed to an area of high pressure drawing in hot weather from Western Europe.</p>

          <p>Pixar faces challenges in achieving box office success with original animated films compared to sequels. The studio's latest original movie, "Elio," is projected to have a soft debut, highlighting the industry's trend of audiences gravitating towards familiar franchises. While Pixar remains committed to telling original stories, recent originals from Disney and other studios have struggled. The pandemic's impact on theatrical attendance and the rise of streaming have further complicated the landscape for animated films. Despite these challenges, Pixar aims to balance original content with sequels to maintain a fresh pipeline of stories.</p>
