          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 22:44:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing an expansion of the ban on bottom trawling in English waters, aiming to protect marine ecosystems. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible destruction of the oceans. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, would extend the prohibition from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK offshore areas already designated as protected. The move comes amid growing concerns about the environmental impact of bottom trawling, highlighted by figures like Sir David Attenborough, and seeks to safeguard rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats.</p>
