          <p>Family offices are experiencing rapid growth as the ultra-rich seek personalized wealth management services, but they face a significant challenge in finding qualified money managers. The article highlights that trust is a key criterion for family offices, often overshadowing other qualifications. This talent crunch is exacerbated by competition from banks, private equity firms, and hedge funds, along with a reluctance from younger employees due to the perceived lack of structure and career progression. Family offices are responding by offering higher compensation packages and incentives to attract and retain talent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices experienced their first monthly decline since October 2024, falling to an average of $5.12 per dozen in April, down from a record $6.23 in March. However, prices remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu, which has wiped out significant numbers of egg-laying hens. Despite the recent decrease, egg prices are still 79% higher than they were a year ago. The U.S. Department of Agriculture is investing to combat bird flu, and the U.S. has increased egg imports from other countries.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has defended his decision to accept a $400 million jumbo Boeing 747-8 jet from Qatar, citing delays in Boeing's production of the new Air Force One fleet. Trump argues that the U.S. should accept the gift, especially since the plane is offered to the Department of Defense for defending Qatar for many years. He states the current Air Force One is nearly 40 years old and less impressive compared to planes in other countries. Trump intends to retire the plane to the presidential library once the new Air Force One fleet is delivered.</p>

Both countries will retain a small percentage of tariffs for negotiation during the 90-day pause.

          <p>Scientists in Uganda have observed wild chimpanzees using medicinal plants to treat open wounds and other injuries, both on themselves and occasionally on each other. Researchers from the University of Oxford, working with a local team in the Budongo Forest, documented the animals dabbing plants on wounds or chewing them and applying the material to injuries. The study builds on previous findings that chimps self-medicate by eating certain plants. This research adds to the growing evidence that primates use natural medicines to stay healthy in the wild, suggesting a capacity for empathy among chimpanzees.</p>

Buttigieg's comments follow Biden's decision to drop out of the race after a poor debate performance against President Trump. Buttigieg also addressed speculation about his own potential presidential run in 2028, remaining coy about his future plans.</p>
