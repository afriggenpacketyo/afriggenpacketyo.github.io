          <p>Baker Mayfield led an electrifying 11-play, 80-yard drive, capped by Rachaad White’s two-yard touchdown run with only six seconds left, securing a thrilling 20-19 victory for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers over the Houston Texans. Mayfield was instrumental, throwing for 215 yards and two touchdowns, and notably converted a fourth-and-10 with a 15-yard scramble to keep the decisive drive alive. The Texans had taken a 19-14 lead late in the game, but their two-point conversion attempt failed, setting the stage for Tampa Bay's dramatic comeback. This win moves the Buccaneers to a 2-0 record, highlighting their resilience in the early season.</p>

          <p>Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index made history by surpassing the 45,000 mark for the first time, spearheading gains across Asia-Pacific markets on Monday. This significant milestone was buoyed by President Donald Trump's optimistic statements regarding the ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations, which also included a "framework" deal for the divestment of Chinese-owned TikTok. South Korea's Kospi continued its ascent, achieving a second consecutive record high after the government reversed a proposed capital gains tax hike on stocks. Meanwhile, major U.S. averages also closed higher, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite reaching new all-time highs as investors anticipated a key Federal Reserve meeting.

          <p>California is on the verge of designating Diwali, the Hindu "Festival of Lights," as an official statewide holiday, following the recent passage of Assembly Bill 268 by the state Legislature. This proposed law would permit community colleges and public schools to close in observance and allow state employees to elect to take the day off with pay. Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the bill's author, highlighted that this recognition would honor the festival's religious and historical significance, fostering greater inclusion for the Indian diaspora. If signed by Governor Gavin Newsom, California would join Pennsylvania and Connecticut in formally acknowledging this major annual religious event, reflecting the state's large South Asian population.</p>

          <p>A CBS News California Investigates report gathered insights from various candidates running for California governor, asking them to evaluate Governor Gavin Newsom's performance and outline their differing approaches. Democratic contenders, including Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra, lauded Newsom's confrontational stance against the Trump administration and his efforts in economic strengthening, while also identifying health care and housing as areas needing more urgent action. Conversely, Republican Chad Bianco offered sharp criticism, suggesting Newsom's actions were driven by presidential ambitions and expressing general dissatisfaction with the state Legislature. The article captures a spectrum of views on current state governance and future policy directions, from universal meals to addressing the housing crisis.</p>

          <p>Taiwan is set to receive long-awaited U.S. arms shipments, which will constitute the highest annual volume in years and are crucial for strengthening its deterrence and war-fighting capacity against mounting threats from Beijing. The island's defense ministry reported a backlog of US$21.54 billion across 18 active arms orders, with 15 on schedule, two delayed, and one ahead. Notable delays include the AGM-154C Joint Standoff Weapon, pushed back to 2026 due to production and testing issues, and the F-16V Block 70 fighter program. Despite these setbacks, the ministry maintains that all 66 F-16V jets will be delivered by the end of 2026, enhancing Taiwan's defensive readiness.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to remove Lisa Cook from the Federal Reserve's governing board, a decision coming just ahead of a key interest rate vote. The court upheld an earlier district judge's ruling, finding that Cook's firing would likely contravene the Federal Reserve Act, designed to safeguard the central bank's independence from political influence. Trump had moved to dismiss Cook based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which she vehemently denies. This article underscores the importance of this legal battle in preserving the Fed's autonomy and preventing presidential overreach in shaping its composition, particularly as another Trump nominee, Stephen Miran, was recently confirmed.

          <p>The FDA is currently evaluating the removal of "black box" warnings from specific menopause hormone therapies, a decision that could profoundly influence women like Isabel Kallman who are deliberating treatment due to safety concerns. Dr. Mary Rosser contends that a flawed 2002 study, the Women's Health Initiative, overstated breast cancer risks by focusing on older women, and subsequent research indicates that a woman's age at treatment initiation and the delivery method can substantially reduce risks. While an FDA-assembled panel has highlighted the benefits and suggested warning removal, numerous experts advocate for additional public input before any changes are finalized. This article underscores the dynamic scientific understanding of hormone therapy, stressing the critical need for individualized patient-doctor consultations to determine suitable treatment plans.</p>
