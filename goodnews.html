        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing an extension to the ban on destructive bottom trawling in English waters, increasing the protected area from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2. Environment Secretary Steve Reed emphasized the urgency of action to prevent irreversible damage to oceans. The announcement coincides with the UN Ocean Conference in France and warnings from Sir David Attenborough about the detrimental effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to safeguard rare marine animals and their habitats within 41 of the UK's 178 Marine Protected Areas, contributing to both nature and climate preservation.</p>
