This article fact-checks several narratives surrounding the proceedings, clarifying that Bolsonaro is already barred from the 2026 election due to prior convictions, making claims of political elimination misleading. It also examines allegations of judicial bias and refutes claims that Brazil is currently a dictatorship, pointing to the existence of public demonstrations and an functioning opposition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has released a preliminary list of 68 jobs across eight sectors that are expected to qualify for President Trump's newly signed tax cut on tipped wages. The policy, part of the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' will eliminate taxes on tips for workers in industries such as food service, hospitality, entertainment, and transportation. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated the tax cut aims to address the affordability crisis by providing real wage increases for working Americans, particularly the bottom 50% of earners. An official list will be released later for public comment.</p>

          <p>George Raveling, a Naismith Hall of Famer known for his trailblazing career as a Black basketball coach and his profound off-court impact, has died at 88. Raveling, who coached at USC from 1986 to 1994, was also a key figure at Nike, where he was instrumental in signing Michael Jordan to his historic endorsement deal. Notably, he was present for Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have A Dream" speech and was handed the original copy by Dr. King, which he later donated. He is remembered as a revered mentor who prioritized shaping his players' lives beyond the sport.</p>

          <p>Aircraft leasing firm Air Lease Corp. has agreed to be taken private by an investor group, including Japan's Sumitomo and SMBC Aviation Capital, in a deal valued at $7.4 billion. The acquisition, valued at approximately $28.2 billion including debt, reflects ongoing consolidation within the aircraft leasing industry, which owns over half of the world's passenger jets. The deal comes as high demand and aircraft shortages have driven rental rates to record levels, though some airlines are now reconsidering capacity plans amid softening profits. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2026.</p>

          <h2>Distinguishing Between Debt Consolidation Loans and Programs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When dealing with overwhelming credit card debt, consumers often consider consolidation, which can take the form of either a loan or a program. A debt consolidation loan involves taking out a new, single loan with a lower interest rate to pay off multiple existing debts, simplifying payments. A debt consolidation program, offered by a debt relief company, functions similarly but involves the company negotiating with creditors on the borrower's behalf. The best option depends on an individual's credit score and financial situation, as loans often require good credit while programs may offer more flexibility for those with credit blemishes.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates in September, financial experts are advising savers to avoid common mistakes with Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. Savers should avoid shopping around for too long, as banks may preemptively lower their rates, and instead lock in a high rate quickly. It is also crucial to monitor the rate climate closely and to have a plan for maturing CDs to prevent them from automatically rolling over into new accounts with lower returns. Acting strategically now can help maximize savings before the rate environment becomes less favorable for these accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican, has filed a discharge petition to compel a House vote on legislation that would require the Justice Department to release files related to Jeffrey Epstein. The bipartisan bill, co-sponsored by Democrat Ro Khanna, aims to bypass House leadership, which controls the floor schedule. The move comes as pressure for transparency grows following a DOJ internal review that found no "client list." House Speaker Mike Johnson criticized the effort as meaningless, stating that the administration and committees are already processing thousands of documents for public release.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin saw a modest increase on Tuesday, reclaiming the $111,000 level even as the broader stock market experienced a sell-off. The cryptocurrency's movement contrasted with that of gold, which surged to a new record high above $3,500 per ounce, reinforcing its traditional safe-haven status. Market analysts suggest that while Bitcoin benefits from some of the same geopolitical uncertainty driving gold, its performance has been tempered by a significant rotation of investment into Ethereum. The differing trends highlight a market seeking both safety and yield, with crypto increasingly competing with traditional assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve's Anticipated September Rate Cut May Have Muted Impact on Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-02 14:08:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut its benchmark interest rate in September, homeowners and buyers should temper their expectations for a significant drop in mortgage rates. The anticipated cut is only 25 basis points, a marginal change that many lenders may have already priced into their current offerings. Furthermore, mortgage rates are influenced by multiple factors beyond the Fed's actions, including the 10-year Treasury yield. Therefore, while the move is a step in a positive direction for borrowers, it is unlikely to cause a dramatic, immediate reduction in mortgage costs. (not investment advice)</p>
