          <p>Former Emperor Akihito of Japan, aged 91, was discharged from the University of Tokyo Hospital after undergoing a thorough examination of his heart condition. He had been admitted to the hospital following an earlier health checkup that revealed signs of myocardial ischemia. In 2022, Akihito received treatment for heart failure, marking a period of health concerns for the retired monarch. He abdicated the Chrysanthemum Throne in April 2019, becoming the first Japanese monarch to step down in approximately two centuries, signaling a significant shift in imperial tradition.</p>

          <p>Hainan, a duty-free island off China‚Äôs southern coast, is positioning itself as a prime shopping destination as the trade war with the United States intensifies. With special policies allowing duty-free stores to offer competitive prices, Hainan is set to launch its own separate customs regime, avoiding the retaliatory tariffs imposed by Beijing on American imports. The island hopes that the availability of cheaper iPhones and U.S. cosmetics will drive a surge in tourism, boosting its duty-free stores, which have struggled amid sluggish domestic consumption and a recovery in overseas travel.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-10 00:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has agreed to remove the 25 percent tariffs on steel imported from Britain, offering a respite to the struggling British steel industry, particularly for companies like Marcegaglia Stainless Sheffield. The tariffs, imposed earlier in the year, had significantly increased costs and complexities for British steelmakers already facing weak demand and high energy expenses. While the tariff removal brings cautious optimism, uncertainties remain regarding products processed in the European Union before being shipped to the United States. The Trump administration's unpredictable trade policies continue to create instability, making long-term planning difficult for businesses in the steel sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from implementing significant cuts and layoffs at numerous federal agencies, as part of the Department of Government Efficiency's (DOGE) cost-cutting initiative. Judge Susan Illston ruled that federal employee unions are likely to prove the administration's reorganization and downsizing efforts exceed its legal authority. The restraining order prevents agencies from laying off staff or placing workers on administrative leave to comply with the executive order. This decision underscores concerns about the administration's power to reorganize federal agencies without Congressional approval.</p>

          <p>Hawaii has reached a $700 million settlement with pharmaceutical companies over its lawsuit regarding the blood thinner Plavix. The settlement resolves claims about the efficacy and safety of Plavix, with the funds divided equally between Bristol Myers Squibb and Sanofi. The lawsuit alleged that the companies did not adequately update their labels despite knowing that about 30% of patients, particularly non-Caucasians, might have a "diminished response" to Plavix. Neither company has admitted wrongdoing, but the settlement marks a significant victory for the state.</p>
