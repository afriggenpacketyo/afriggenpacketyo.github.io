        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A panel of federal appellate judges has ruled that a Louisiana law mandating the posting of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, marking a victory for civil liberties groups. The ruling supports the separation of church and state, arguing the displays would isolate non-Christian students. Republicans, including President Trump, supported the law, claiming the Ten Commandments are historical and foundational to U.S. law. Louisiana's Attorney General disagrees with the ruling's scope and plans to appeal, while law experts anticipate the case will reach the Supreme Court, testing its stance on religion and government.</p>

Kroger anticipates a modest financial benefit from the closures and will invest the savings in customer experience initiatives. All employees at the affected stores will be offered positions at other Kroger locations, ensuring minimal job loss.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Columbia University graduate Mahmoud Khalil from ICE detention, where he was held for over three months due to his activism against Israel's war in Gaza. The judge stated that Khalil is not a flight risk or a danger to the community and that the government had not met the standards for detention. Khalil's arrest was widely criticized as a dangerous escalation against protected speech, and his release marks a defeat for the Trump administration's efforts to deport pro-Palestinian international students. Khalil's immigration case will proceed separately, while government officials have accused him of antisemitism and pro-Hamas advocacy without evidence.</p>

          <p>Tesla is set to launch its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, with the first driverless trip expected on June 28. The initial rollout will involve a limited number of Model Y vehicles, with access by invitation only. The service will operate within a geofenced area of the city, excluding airport trips, and will include a Tesla Safety Monitor in the front passenger seat. While Elon Musk has touted the robotaxi for years, analysts believe it could usher in a "golden era of autonomous" for Tesla, though the company faces competition from Waymo.</p>

          <p>President Trump indicated that his administration is close to reaching a "deal" with Harvard University, with an announcement expected soon. This statement came as a federal judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the administration's efforts to bar international students from attending Harvard. Trump's administration had previously taken actions against Harvard's international student program, citing the university's alleged failure to address antisemitism. The judge's order allows Harvard to continue enrolling international students while the case proceeds.</p>

          <p>President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" with Harvard University as a federal judge blocked the Department of Homeland Security from revoking Harvard's ability to enroll international students. The preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System. The Department of Homeland Security had previously accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the legal challenge. This development suggests a possible resolution to the ongoing conflict between the Trump administration and Harvard over international student policies.</p>
