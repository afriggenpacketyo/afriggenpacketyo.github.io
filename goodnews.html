          <p>Peloton announced a surprise fiscal fourth-quarter profit of $21.6 million, a significant turnaround from a $30.5 million loss a year prior, leading to a 6% rise in shares. This positive financial shift is largely attributed to better-than-expected sales and aggressive operating expense reductions, including a new round of layoffs impacting 6% of its staff. CEO Peter Stern outlined plans to cut an additional $100 million in expenses for fiscal year 2026, alongside a strategic return to physical retail with smaller micro-stores. The company also aims to diversify beyond its core bike and treadmill offerings into broader wellness categories like mental well-being and sleep, planning to integrate advanced AI technologies for personalized coaching to drive future growth.

          <p>Eli Lilly announced promising Phase 3 trial results for its experimental GLP-1 pill, orforglipron, which helped obese adults achieve an average weight loss of 27.3 pounds over a 72-week period. The drugmaker plans to submit orforglipron for FDA approval later this year, potentially making the oral medication available to consumers by 2026. While some investors reacted with disappointment that led to a stock dip, experts hail the pill as a potential "game changer" for its enhanced accessibility, being cheaper to manufacture and more convenient to take than injectable forms. The trial did note common side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, leading some participants to discontinue the treatment.</p>

          <p>President Trump is poised to sign an executive order that will direct the U.S. Secretary of Labor to review existing fiduciary guidance, effectively allowing alternative assets such as private equity, cryptocurrencies, and real estate into 401(k) plans. This move represents a significant win for the alternative asset industry, which has long lobbied for greater inclusion of these investments in defined contribution plans. Following the news, Bitcoin and private equity stocks saw an immediate uptick. While these assets have historically been excluded from 401(k)s due to higher fees, lack of transparency, and longer lockup periods, the order signals a major shift toward their broader adoption within the $8.7 trillion 401(k) market.

          <p>Manchester United has finalized a significant transfer agreement with Red Bull Leipzig to acquire 22-year-old Slovenian forward Benjamin Sesko for a deal valued at £73.7 million (85 million euros). The agreement includes a guaranteed payment of £66.3 million, with the remaining sum in performance-related add-ons, and Sesko is now set to complete his medical and formalize the move to Old Trafford. Sesko has been a prolific scorer for Leipzig, netting 39 goals in 87 appearances, and was also a target for Newcastle. This acquisition further strengthens United's attacking options, following the earlier signings of Matheus Cunha and Bryan Mbeumo this summer.</p>

          <p>Restaurant Brands International reported mixed second-quarter results, with adjusted earnings per share missing analyst estimates while revenue surpassed expectations, leading to a nearly 4% decline in shares. The company's performance was bolstered by robust international sales and strong demand at Tim Hortons, which saw same-store sales growth of 3.4%. Although Popeyes experienced a 1.4% decline in same-store sales, the company's international restaurants reported a healthy 4.2% growth. CEO Josh Kobza noted a modest improvement in the consumer environment compared to the first quarter, and Restaurant Brands reiterated its full-year forecast, aiming for long-term average growth of 3% same-store sales and 8% organic adjusted operating income.

          <p>Archaeologists at Pompeii have unearthed compelling new evidence indicating that survivors of the 79 AD Mount Vesuvius eruption returned to the devastated city and established a precarious settlement. These individuals, likely unable to afford relocation, were joined by others seeking valuable items left in the rubble. Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the site's director, described it as an "informal settlement" or "favela" where people lived without the typical infrastructure of a Roman city. The discovery shows former ground floors were repurposed into cellars with ovens and mills, offering unprecedented insights into post-disaster human resilience and adaptation before the area was completely abandoned in the fifth century.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England has reduced its key interest rate from 4.25% to 4%, marking the lowest level since March 2023, a move that will have varied impacts across the UK economy. For homeowners, those with standard variable rate mortgages could see their monthly repayments decrease by approximately £40. However, the cut spells less favorable news for savers, as average savings rates are expected to continue their decline. The Bank's decision aims to stimulate a struggling economy and a weakening job market, balancing these objectives against the persistent challenge of inflation. This intricate balancing act underscores the central bank's efforts to foster overall economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England recently cut interest rates despite inflation remaining above its 2% target, a decision that prompted a rare second vote among its Monetary Policy Committee members. Governor Andrew Bailey explained that the primary rationale was the expectation of reduced upward pressure on inflation from a weakening job market, evidenced by a fall in job vacancies and an increase in the jobless rate. The Bank also aims to stimulate the struggling UK economy, which is projected to have grown by only 0.1% in the second quarter. While acknowledging lingering inflation risks, the Bank anticipates gradual economic improvement, partly due to a new trade deal with the US boosting exports. (not investment advice)</p>
