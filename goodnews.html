          <h2>Scotland Faces Waste Export Surge Due to Landfill Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 04:02:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scotland is set to export up to 100 truckloads of waste daily to England due to an impending ban on landfilling biodegradable municipal waste. The Scottish government acknowledges a capacity gap in incinerators, leading to "bridging contracts" with English waste handlers. Concerns arise over increased emissions from transporting waste and stagnant domestic recycling rates. Despite initiatives to promote a circular economy, challenges persist in reducing household waste, highlighting the difficulties in achieving long-term environmental goals. The current plan is considered a temporary solution until more incinerators are built in the next few years.</p>

          <p>Shares of Kering, the parent company of Gucci and Saint Laurent, jumped 7% following reports that Renault CEO Luca de Meo is set to become the group's new CEO. This move comes as Kering seeks to revitalize its brands, particularly Gucci, which has experienced declining popularity. De Meo is credited with Renault's successful turnaround, with shares rising significantly during his tenure. Analysts note that while de Meo's brand management and marketing skills align with the luxury industry, he will face significant challenges in rejuvenating Kering's brands in a competitive market.
