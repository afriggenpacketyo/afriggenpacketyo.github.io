          <h2>Scottish Government Shelves Plans for New Misogyny Law</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 06:52:52 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Scottish government has decided to postpone plans for a new misogyny law until after next year's Holyrood election. Ministers cited the need to carefully consider the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman as the reason for the delay. Instead of introducing a standalone bill, the government intends to amend existing hate crime legislation to provide protections on the basis of sex. Legislation to end conversion therapy has also been delayed, with the government hoping for a UK-wide solution.</p>

          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's forecasts, although profits decreased compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's earnings were $1.76 per share, surpassing the expected $1.73, while revenue reached $83.13 billion, falling short of the anticipated $86.72 billion. Despite a 6% profit decline, Exxon's performance was bolstered by volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, coupled with cost-cutting measures. The company returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, with capital expenditures aligning with the projected $27 billion to $29 billion for 2025.

          <p>President Trump's trade policies have contributed to lower oil prices while increasing costs for oil and gas companies, leading to reduced first-quarter profits for major U.S. oil firms. U.S. crude prices have fallen below $60 a barrel, a level at which many companies struggle to profit from new drilling. Additionally, tariffs imposed by Trump have raised the cost of materials like steel for these companies. Some companies are already scaling back operations in response to these economic pressures.
