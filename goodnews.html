          <p>Iga Swiatek of Poland claimed her first Wimbledon women's singles championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova. The match, which lasted just 57 minutes, marked the first time in 114 years that a Wimbledon women's final ended with one player not winning a single game. This victory gives the 24-year-old Swiatek her sixth Grand Slam title overall and maintains her undefeated 6-0 record in major finals. For the 23-year-old Anisimova, this was her first Grand Slam final appearance following a career break in 2023 to focus on her mental health.</p>

          <p>The UK's Health Secretary, Wes Streeting, is scheduled to meet with the British Medical Association (BMA) next week to prevent a planned five-day strike by resident doctors in England. The BMA has stated that the strike, set to begin on July 25, will only be called off if the talks result in a credible pay offer. The government has maintained that it cannot improve upon its current 5.4% pay increase for the year. Resident doctors argue that their real-term pay has fallen by about 20% since 2008 and are seeking a clear plan for pay restoration.</p>

          <p>China's burgeoning private space sector presents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to establish itself as a vital hub for investment and innovation. The global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, driven by private enterprises in areas like satellite launches and space travel. Chinese companies such as i-Space and LandSpace are already making significant strides, with private investment in the nation's aerospace industry expected to grow dramatically. Hong Kong's financial expertise and international connections could play a crucial role in funding and supporting this next frontier of technological and economic development.</p>

          <p>China is strategically investing in what it terms "future industries" to secure a leading position in the global technology race and establish a new model for economic growth. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this initiative targets nascent sectors with immense potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, and large-scale AI data centers. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has released guidelines to foster development in these key areas. This focus on foundational and disruptive technologies is a core component of China's plan for industrial upgrades and long-term economic resilience.</p>

          <p>Start-ups like Better Dairy in the UK and Those Vegan Cowboys in the Netherlands are preparing to introduce lab-grown cheese to consumers within the next few years. These companies use precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk, without using any animals. While the final product aims to replicate the taste and texture of traditional cheese, it faces a market where plant-based cheese sales have recently declined. Companies believe they can overcome consumer skepticism by improving taste, matching prices, and highlighting the health and environmental benefits of their innovative products.</p>

          <p>The reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a significant resurgence in viewership, with its success being amplified by massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV audience figures are returning to 2022 levels, the show's official accounts have gained 1.8 million followers this year, with a million of those on TikTok alone. Content creators and fans note that short-form clips, recaps, and analysis make the show more accessible to busy viewers. However, some, including a former contestant, warn that this bite-sized consumption can lead to a distorted perception of the participants.</p>

Alternative methods like home-swapping, house sitting, and using credit card loyalty points for flights are also proving effective for travelers looking to make their getaways more affordable.</p>

Having won all three of their group matches, Sweden is now positioned for the quarter-finals, where they could potentially face England.

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from "indiscriminately" detaining individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling by U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong also bars officials from denying detainees access to legal counsel. The order stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" that officials were conducting unconstitutional "roving patrols" based on factors like race or speaking Spanish, rather than reasonable suspicion.</p>

While bulk reliever Emmet Sheehan earned the win, Ohtani's dominant start provided the momentum the team desperately needed.
