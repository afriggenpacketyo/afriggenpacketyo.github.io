          <p>Wealthy individuals are increasingly storing their gold in Singapore due to growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty. A facility called "The Reserve" has seen an 88% increase in orders to store gold and silver from the start of the year to April, compared to the same period in 2024, with sales for precious metals bars skyrocketing 200% year on year in that time. Singapore is viewed as a safe jurisdiction with political and economic stability, leading to its reputation as the 'Geneva of the East.' Clients are opting for physical gold bars over paper gold to mitigate counterparty and geopolitical risks, with concerns about the health of the global financial system also driving this trend.

He swam in frigid 47-degree water, enduring challenging weather conditions, including a nor'easter, making it one of his most difficult swims. Pugh, a United Nations Patron of the Oceans, emphasizes the critical need to protect sharks, highlighting that approximately 100 million sharks are killed each year, calling it an "ecocide."</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake, more than double the number detected in 2022. The company's policies on fake reviews have become more aggressive, particularly against "incentivized reviews." Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged approach involving auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most paid reviews originate in Asia, and rooting out these reviews is a constant "cat and mouse" game, but Tripadvisor is improving its detection methods every year, relying less on review content and more on posting behavior.</p>

          <p>Shares of Chinese automakers experienced a second day of decline due to fears of a price war and increased scrutiny from regulators. BYD's Hong Kong-listed shares fell after announcing price cuts on 22 electric and plug-in hybrid models, leading investors to turn cautious about stiffer competition in the sector. China's commerce ministry is reportedly meeting with industry bodies and automakers regarding the practice of marking cars as sold to meet sales targets. An analyst expects BYD's vehicle margin to be under pressure in the short term due to the need to hit sales targets, and regardless of whether its sales campaign is extended beyond its current deadline of June, the company will offset the impact via larger sales scale and battery cost staying low.</p>

Cumulative profits at major industrial firms climbed 3% compared to a year earlier, accelerating from a 2.6% growth in March. The boost in industrial firms' profits was largely owed to Beijing's efforts targeted at supporting the private sector, offsetting some of the negative impacts from the U.S. tariffs.

          <p>A couple in Sha Tin, Hong Kong, were shocked to find a 1-metre king cobra on their computer desk. A snake catcher was called to safely collect the reptile, which will be released back into the wild. Police received a report early Monday morning that the snake had entered the house.
