          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, leading the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, affirmed that pregnant women should take Tylenol if a doctor advises it, countering recent Trump administration remarks about an unproven link to autism. Medical experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, emphasize acetaminophen's safety for treating fevers during pregnancy, as uncontrolled fevers can pose significant health risks. While an FDA commissioner's open letter mentioned a potential association between acetaminophen and autism, it crucially noted that a causal relationship has not been scientifically established. Oz advocated for transparency in communicating scientific uncertainties, urging caution against self-medication without professional guidance, particularly given the ongoing medical debate.</p>

          <p>Health officials are warning of an anticipated autumn surge in both flu and COVID-19 cases, providing guidance on how to distinguish between the two viruses, which share many overlapping symptoms. Flu typically strikes suddenly with fever, body aches, and exhaustion, often more debilitating than a common cold. In contrast, COVID-19, with its evolving variants, can present with cold-like symptoms, a hoarse throat, or the more traditional fever, cough, and loss of taste/smell. Vaccination is highlighted as the most effective defense against severe illness, with authorities urging all eligible individuals to receive their recommended vaccines to protect vulnerable populations and alleviate pressure on healthcare systems.</p>

The People's Bank of China unveiled three new platforms at the center, including a cross-border digital payment platform and a blockchain service platform, all designed to accelerate the digital currency's internationalization. This strategic initiative aims to establish an alternative to the US dollar-dominated global financial architecture, reflecting China's ambition to reshape international monetary systems. The central bank emphasized its commitment to providing open, inclusive, and innovative solutions to enhance global cross-border payment efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Seattle Seahawks clinched their eighth consecutive victory over the Arizona Cardinals, winning 23-20 on a dramatic 52-yard field goal by Jason Myers as time expired. Quarterback Sam Darnold delivered an efficient performance with 242 passing yards and a touchdown, guiding the Seahawks' offense throughout the contest. Despite blowing a 14-point fourth-quarter lead, Seattle mounted a decisive final drive, capitalizing on a crucial kickoff penalty and a significant pass completion to position Myers for the game-winning score, redeeming an earlier missed attempt. The Cardinals, who mounted a spirited late rally, ultimately suffered their second consecutive loss, extending their struggles this season.</p>

He clarified that leading Ukraine in peacetime is not his personal ambition, reiterating his dedication to guiding his country through its current challenging period. Under the prevailing martial law, elections are currently prohibited, and his initial five-year term would have concluded in May 2024.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has publicly acknowledged that "left-wing parties, including my own," previously "shied away from people's concerns around illegal immigration," announcing plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme. Writing in The Telegraph, the prime minister stated that Labour must actively counter the "rise of the populist right," specifically citing Reform UK as a significant challenge for both major parties. He emphasized the necessity of "patriotic national renewal" grounded in enduring British values, while rejecting what he termed Reform's "toxic" solutions. This policy shift is a key component of Labour's strategy to address illegal immigration and mitigate the electoral threat posed by Reform UK's growing popularity.</p>

          <p>Raj Ganguly, co-founder and co-CEO of venture capital firm B Capital, forecasts that artificial intelligence is in the early stages of a 15-20 year "super cycle" that will profoundly transform every aspect of the world. He identifies three major shifts: Silicon Valley's strong return, the ability for sole founders to succeed without traditional programming skills due to AI, and a pivot towards "deep" tech like generative AI and advanced semiconductors. Ganguly also noted India's significant role in developing AI-native applications, which he anticipates will lead global markets. While acknowledging potential market "frothiness" from short-term expectations, he maintains AI's long-term, world-changing potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has preliminarily approved a $1.5 billion settlement between artificial intelligence company Anthropic and authors/publishers who alleged the company illegally pirated nearly half a million books to train its chatbots. U.S. District Judge William Alsup's approval follows efforts to ensure robust notice and fair distribution to all eligible parties, with payments of about $3,000 per covered book. The Association of American Publishers called it a "major step" in holding AI developers accountable for infringement, while the Authors Guild views it as a clear signal against the "theft" of works. Anthropic, however, highlighted that the court's earlier ruling on AI training as transformative fair use remains intact.</p>

          <p>A California Senate Bill (SB 576), introduced by Senator Tom Umberg, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services like Netflix and Prime Video, preventing them from being significantly louder than the main programming. The legislation was notably inspired by a baby waking up due to a blaring ad, highlighting a common consumer frustration. This bill addresses a current loophole in the 2010 federal Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act, which only applies to traditional broadcasters. Given California's significant market influence, this state-level initiative could effectively establish a national standard for streaming ad volume, despite opposition from the powerful Motion Picture Association.</p>

This initiative is crucial for patients battling blood cancers and disorders, as current capacity issues often delay vital transplants. The center seeks to ensure timely cell collection, which is paramount for patient recovery and survival, with the charity actively encouraging more individuals aged 16 to 30 to register as potential donors.</p>

Democratic candidates like Toni Atkins and Xavier Becerra generally praised Newsom's economic efforts and his firm stance against the Trump administration. In contrast, Republicans such as Chad Bianco and Steve Hilton were highly critical, with Bianco unable to name a single positive legislative achievement during Newsom's tenure. Candidates across the political spectrum identified key areas for improvement, including healthcare access, the state's persistent housing crisis, the high-speed rail project, and California's fiscal accountability.

          <p>Approximately 200 pieces of live coral, illegally smuggled from Indonesia and seized by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at JFK Airport, have found a new home and are undergoing recovery at the New York Aquarium. The trading of coral is highly restricted due to their protection under the Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The aquarium, acting as a "coral hospital," received the corals in poor health after five days in transit, with many having lost their color. Since then, many have recovered significantly and are now on public display, serving as "ambassadors for their species" and educating the public about conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>An aggressive squirrel in a California neighborhood has reportedly attacked several residents, sending two victims to the emergency room for bites and scratches. The incidents occurred in the Lucas Valley neighborhood of San Rafael, prompting a local humane society to confirm the attacks and a resident to post warning flyers. Officials suggest the unusual aggression stems from humans hand-feeding or hand-raising squirrels, which causes them to lose their natural fear of people and become aggressive when food is not provided. This rare behavior underscores the dangers of interacting with wildlife, as squirrels can also carry diseases, though rabies is uncommon in this species.</p>
