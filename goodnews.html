          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed near Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, resulting in injuries to all 15 people on board. The pilot reported engine trouble shortly after takeoff and was attempting to return to the airport when the aircraft went down in a wooded area. While some injuries were severe, officials expressed relief that there were no fatalities, attributing the effective emergency response to a recent mass casualty training exercise. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating, noting the same plane was involved in a previous landing incident in 2023.</p>

          <p>A recent survey has identified the best airports in the United States, with Portland International Airport (PDX) in Oregon taking the top spot. The ranking, based on reader responses and Yelp reviews, praised airports for features like natural light, local food options, unique decor, and ease of navigation. Other high-ranking airports included Long Beach (LGB) and Ronald Reagan Washington National (DCA). The analysis highlighted amenities such as therapy llamas at PDX, mountain views at Salt Lake City (SLC), and an underground LED tunnel at Detroit (DTW) as factors contributing to a superior travel experience.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-03 08:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed two new bills designed to accelerate housing construction by reforming the state's environmental review process. The legislation exempts most urban, multifamily housing projects from the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), a law often used to delay or block new developments through litigation. This move marks a significant philosophical shift for California Democrats, prioritizing housing abundance over the anti-growth sentiments that have historically influenced state policy. Proponents argue that facilitating denser urban housing is crucial for addressing the state's severe housing shortage and for achieving climate goals by reducing suburban sprawl.</p>

          <p>Ken Casey, founder of the band Dropkick Murphys, is using his platform to challenge the political alignment of his working-class fanbase with Donald Trump. In a recent interview, Casey recounted a concert where he engaged a Trump supporter, highlighting the foreign manufacturing of MAGA merchandise to critique the movement's authenticity. He expressed frustration that few other artists are speaking out against what he calls a "scam" that betrays American workers. Casey believes his band's long-standing pro-labor values compel him to stand against divisive politics, even if it means alienating some fans who misinterpret his stance as being an elitist shill for Democrats.</p>

          <p>The nostalgic ideal of a ‚Äúlazy summer‚Äù filled with unstructured, screen-free play is becoming increasingly difficult for modern parents to replicate. While some are attempting to give their children a '90s-style break with fewer scheduled activities, the reality is complicated by parental work schedules and the ubiquity of digital devices. Experts note that kids today have less unsupervised free time and that a bicycle has largely been replaced by a smartphone as their most prized possession. However, older teens are showing sophistication in managing their own screen time, suggesting that while the nature of downtime has changed, they can still find a balance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States and Vietnam have reached a trade agreement that will see the U.S. apply a 20% tariff on Vietnamese imports, a significant reduction from the previously imposed 46% rate. In return, U.S. exports to Vietnam will face no tariffs, and Vietnam has agreed to a 40% duty on transshipped goods from other countries, a practice often used to evade trade barriers. The deal provides a potential blueprint for other nations negotiating with the Trump administration, though analysts suggest the 20% tariff rate is higher than many expected. This agreement could influence upcoming trade talks with other emerging markets in Asia as well as the European Union. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has announced it will be discontinuing its free, ad-supported streaming service, Freevee, in August. The move is part of a broader strategy to consolidate its video content under the Prime Video platform. After the Freevee app is shut down, its library of shows and movies will be integrated into Prime Video, where they will remain available to watch for free with ads, even for users without a Prime subscription. This decision follows Amazon's introduction of an ad-supported tier to its main Prime Video service earlier this year, simplifying its streaming offerings for customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Casey Johnston's new book, "A Physical Education," challenges traditional diet culture by advocating for strength training as a means of empowerment rather than reduction. The book chronicles her personal journey from calorie-counting cardio to weight lifting, arguing that the practice reframes the goal of exercise from shrinking one's body to building functional strength. Johnston critiques the fitness industry's often misleading messages to women and explains how lifting requires a shift in mindset, particularly around nutrition, where eating more becomes necessary for progress. This approach fosters a healthier relationship with food and one's body, focused on capability over aesthetics.</p>

          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted new safety rules for carrying power banks on flights, effective June 28. The regulations ban any power banks that lack the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (3C) safety mark, deeming them substandard and a fire risk. This move has raised concerns among travelers about what devices are permissible and how to handle non-compliant ones. Airports are required to set up areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail ineligible power banks. The crackdown aims to enhance flight safety by ensuring all portable charging devices meet national quality and safety standards before being brought on board an aircraft.</p>
