          <p>Reform UK's deputy leader, Richard Tice, denies that the party is in chaos after chairman Zia Yusuf resigned and then returned in a different role. Tice explained that Yusuf was exhausted from the demanding job and will now focus on identifying spending cuts at councils. Yusuf's initial resignation followed criticism of Sarah Pochin, a Reform MP, for questioning the government about banning the burka. Party leader Nigel Farage said Yusuf had been subject to "pretty vile abuse" and overreacted to it, but the Liberal Democrats and Labour have criticized the situation as chaotic.</p>

Defense experts say the image confirms the J-36's three weapons bays and the dorsal intake for the third engine, suggesting additional thrust for cruising at supersonic speeds.

          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the most common reasons for relationship conflicts, including tone of voice, family relations, household chores, and communication styles. Contempt, signaled through a sour tone, is a significant predictor of divorce, while arguments about family often reflect unmet needs and misalignments. Uneven distribution of household labor and ineffective communication can also lead to conflict, with the psychologist offering strategies such as naming the effect, reassuring one another, and using a designated time-out signal to navigate these issues. The psychologist also suggests working together to redistribute tasks and trying to see eye-to-eye before airing grievances.</p>

Docter also noted that Jobs had a habit of calling producers at any time, day or night, a practice he hopes to avoid himself.

The pervasiveness of technology is seen as a threat to the close-knit community that small residential liberal-arts colleges strive to create. Despite these efforts, the college's leadership has not yet aligned itself with those advocating for reduced technology use.</p>

          <p>Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused First Minister John Swinney of running a "dishonest and disgraceful" campaign ahead of the recent Holyrood by-election, claiming the SNP pushed voters towards Reform UK. Swinney defended his "two-horse race" remark, stating that Labour's vote share had collapsed and his party's data showed a surge for Reform. Labour's Davy Russell won the seat in Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse, defeating the SNP. Reform UK finished third, with their campaign attracting criticism for a controversial advert.</p>

          <h2>Trump Weakens US Threat of Peaceful Evolution for China, Opinion Piece Argues</h2>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that President Trump's policies have diminished the perceived threat of "peaceful evolution" to China. The author, who grew up in China during the 1960s, notes that Mao Zedong warned of American conspiracies to subvert the Communist Party through peaceful means. However, the author suggests that Trump's shift away from nation-building and lecturing other countries on governance has lessened the impact of this threat, as China has emerged as a major economic and global power.</p>

          <h2>Poem: Under a Supermoon</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-08 08:30:00 EDT</div>

          <p>Arthur Sze's poem "Under a Supermoon" reflects on observations of nature and life. The poem contrasts the desire for space exploration and deep-sea exploration with a focus on the minutiae of everyday life, such as the gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of split pi√±on and juniper. It references Blake's quote about persisting in folly to become wise, and captures the experience of life having both exploding and birthing stars within it. The poem emphasizes perseverance and finding wonder in the present moment.</p>

          <p>An advice column addresses a reader's dilemma about her husband's interest in ethical non-monogamy while she prefers monogamy and desires more of his attention. The columnist emphasizes the importance of open communication and clearly stating one's needs, drawing on Erich Fromm's philosophy of love as an active striving for the other's freedom, balanced with self-respect. The columnist advises the reader to explore her own feelings about non-monogamy, strengthen the emotional security in her marriage, and communicate boundaries to her husband, suggesting strategies for easing into non-monogamy if both partners are willing.</p>
