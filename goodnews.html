          <p>Harry Kane starred as Bayern Munich defeated Boca Juniors 2-1 in a high-energy Club World Cup match in Miami, securing their spot in the knockout stage and marking the first time a European team has beaten a South American opponent at the tournament. Kane scored one goal and assisted on another, earning him the Superior Player Of the Match award in a game filled with physical play and dramatic moments. Boca Juniors put up a strong fight, equalizing in the second half before Bayern ultimately clinched the win with a late goal from Michael Olise. The match, played in front of a sell-out crowd, was a rare 9pm kick-off to accommodate the South Florida heat.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University activist, was released from an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention facility in Louisiana following a federal judge's order to free him while his immigration proceedings continue. Khalil, a green card holder, had been detained for months as the Trump administration attempted to deport him due to "foreign policy" concerns. The judge determined that Khalil is not a threat to the community or a flight risk, criticizing his detention as "highly unusual." Upon his release, Khalil stated that the Trump administration had "chosen the wrong person for this," and expressed his excitement to reunite with his wife and newborn son after being denied temporary release to attend the birth.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, but President Trump hinted at a potential "deal" to resolve the conflict. The judge's preliminary injunction prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. Trump stated that his administration is working closely with Harvard and a deal may be announced soon. The Department of Homeland Security had previously told Harvard it was revoking its student visa system certification due to alleged failures in addressing campus antisemitism.</p>

Purchases of anime and manga-related goods totaled an estimated 54.3 billion yen last year, a 53% increase from 2016.

The White House maintains Khalil engaged in "fraud and misrepresentation" and conduct detrimental to American foreign policy interests.

However, recent incidents on Chinese social media, where young people refused to give up courtesy seats to elderly individuals on public transportation, have sparked debate about the erosion of these values. These incidents have prompted discussions about entitlement, boundaries, and basic decency, highlighting the challenge of preserving traditional moral values in a fast-paced, individualistic society.

          <p>Scientists are trying to solve a decade-long mystery by determining the identity of anomalous signals detected from below ice in Antarctica, which seem to defy the laws of physics. The strange radio waves emerged during a search for high-energy cosmic particles known as neutrinos, using NASA‚Äôs Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) experiment. The signals came from below the horizon, suggesting they had passed through thousands of miles of rock, but the radio waves should have been absorbed by the rock. Larger, more sensitive detectors may be able to solve the mystery.</p>
