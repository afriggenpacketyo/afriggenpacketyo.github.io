          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 12:52:24 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging application that functions without an internet connection. The app uses a Bluetooth mesh network to create local communication clusters, allowing for encrypted, ephemeral messages to be passed between nearby devices. This design ensures functionality even during internet shutdowns or in areas without cell service, reflecting Dorsey's ongoing interest in censorship-resistant technology. Bitchat does not require personal information like phone numbers or emails, positioning it as a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream platforms like WhatsApp.</p>

          <p>The film "F1: The Movie" has become Apple's most successful theatrical release to date, earning over $293 million at the global box office. Distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, the racing movie has outperformed previous Apple-backed films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." A significant portion of its revenue, approximately $60 million, has come from IMAX screenings, thanks to a strategic partnership that secured a three-week exclusive run in IMAX theaters. Despite its high production and marketing costs, the film's success marks a major milestone for Apple's growing ambitions in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive timeline of the high-profile Karen Read case details the events from the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, to her recent retrial. After an initial mistrial, Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges but convicted of driving under the influence. The defense successfully argued that Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, a claim that gained significant public attention. The case was marked by intense legal battles, allegations of evidence tampering, and the firing of the lead state police investigator, concluding a dramatic and widely followed legal saga.</p>

          <p>In Pakistan's Punjab province, authorities have confiscated 18 lions that were being illegally kept as pets in a crackdown on the practice. The operation was initiated after a lion escaped from a residence in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children. Keeping exotic animals is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, but it is an offense punishable by up to seven years in jail without the proper legal permits. Officials are now inspecting over 500 lions and tigers held in private homes and breeding farms across the province to ensure compliance with regulations.</p>

          <p>A new podcast from Boise State Public Radio explores the multifaceted outcomes of reintroducing wolves into ecosystems where they were previously eradicated. The series, titled "Howl," delves into both the intended ecological benefits and the unintended consequences that arise from these conservation efforts. It examines the challenges of human-wildlife coexistence, particularly for ranchers and rural communities who are directly impacted by the predators' return. The program aims to provide a nuanced look at the complexities involved in managing wolf populations and balancing environmental goals with local concerns, based on extensive research and interviews.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wimbledon officials have implemented changes to the Hawk-Eye electronic line-calling system to prevent a recurrence of an operator error that occurred during a recent match. The incident involved the ball-tracking technology being accidentally deactivated for a game, leading to a controversial point replay that drew criticism. In response, the All England Lawn Tennis Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system, ensuring such a mistake cannot be repeated. The club is also considering the implementation of a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments, for future championships.</p>

          <p>South African cricket captain Wiaan Mulder chose not to pursue the all-time record for the highest individual score in a Test match, declaring his innings while at 367 not out. Mulder was just 33 runs short of the 400-run record set by West Indies legend Brian Lara in 2004. He explained the decision was made both for the team's strategic advantage against Zimbabwe and out of respect for Lara's legendary status, stating that some records should be held by icons of the sport. The move was a display of sportsmanship, prioritizing team victory and honoring cricket history over a personal milestone.</p>

          <p>While Apple celebrates the major box office success of its movie "F1," an analysis suggests the company faces significant challenges in the field of artificial intelligence. The hit film demonstrates Apple's strength in long-term investment and marketing, but its recent AI announcements have underwhelmed Wall Street and consumers. The company's voice assistant, Siri, has seen little fundamental improvement in over a decade, lagging behind competitors like Google and OpenAI. This strategic gap has led to reports that Apple may consider licensing AI technology from rivals, a move that would contradict its core strategy of owning its key technologies.</p>

In the deal, the Clippers will also send a 2027 second-round draft pick to Utah, while the Jazz will receive Kyle Anderson and Kevin Love from the Heat. The move provides the Clippers with needed frontcourt size and youth in the 6-foot-9 Collins, who averaged 19.0 points and 8.2 rebounds last season.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Former England fast bowler James Anderson has strongly advocated for the inclusion of Jofra Archer in the upcoming third Test match against India at Lord's. Archer, who has been sidelined by injuries for over four years, recently made his red-ball comeback and is part of the current England squad. Anderson, now a fast-bowling consultant for the team, believes it is too crucial a game in the tied series to delay Archer's return any longer. He argues that England has "got to" play the pace bowler, rather than waiting to build up his overs later in the series.</p>
