          <p>President Donald Trump has approved a "partnership" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, reversing President Joe Biden's previous block on the acquisition due to national security concerns. Trump stated that the deal will create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the U.S. economy, with U.S. Steel's headquarters remaining in Pittsburgh. The bulk of the investment is expected to take place over the next 14 months. U.S. Steel shares surged following Trump's announcement. </p>

          <p>Billy Joel has canceled all upcoming concerts, including a large-scale tour, due to a brain disorder known as normal pressure hydrocephalus. The condition has led to problems with hearing, vision, and balance, exacerbated by recent concert performances. Normal pressure hydrocephalus, or N.P.H., is a rare condition that occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing symptoms that include trouble walking and controlling one‚Äôs bladder. Joel, 76, expressed his sincere apologies to his audience and thanked them for their understanding as he undergoes physical therapy and refrains from performing during his recovery.</p>

          <p>The Quilcene School District in Washington state has voted 3-2 to maintain sports competition based on athletes' birth gender, defying a state policy that allows transgender students to participate based on their gender identity. The ruling goes against the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association (WIAA) policy enacted in 2007. Board member Ron Frantz cited Title IX as the basis for keeping sports based on birth gender, while another member, Vivian Kuehl, deemed it "immoral" to exclude transgender females from girls' sports. This decision reflects ongoing debates and proposed legislation regarding transgender athletes' participation in sports.</p>

          <p>Investing in gold can be a smart move, particularly in uncertain economic times, but beginners should be aware of key considerations. It's important to understand the different types of gold assets, such as physical gold, gold ETFs, and gold mining stocks, each with varying risks and benefits. The price of gold is influenced by multiple factors, and it's best to view gold as a long-term hedge rather than a quick profit opportunity. Investors should be cautious of scams and high premiums, sticking to reputable dealers and well-known platforms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a series of executive orders aimed at overhauling the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and accelerating the deployment of new nuclear power reactors in the U.S. The orders call for a "total and complete reform" of the NRC, forcing decisions on reactor licenses within 18 months. The focus is on small, advanced reactors, but the administration also supports building large plants. These actions aim to jump-start uranium mining and expand domestic uranium enrichment capacity.</p>

          <h2>Billy Joel Cancels Concerts Due to Brain Disorder: Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus Explained</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Billy Joel has canceled upcoming concerts due to normal pressure hydrocephalus (N.P.H.), a brain disorder affecting hearing, vision, and balance. N.P.H. occurs when excess cerebrospinal fluid builds up in the brain, causing symptoms like trouble walking, balancing, and controlling one‚Äôs bladder. The condition is rare but more common with age, and can be diagnosed through brain imaging and spinal taps. Treatment typically involves surgery to insert a shunt that drains excess fluid from the brain, and early diagnosis can lead to better outcomes.</p>

          <p>Lebanon‚Äôs government will begin disarming armed Palestinian factions in refugee camps on its territory in June, a step toward bringing all weapons under state control. This move is considered a trial run before addressing the more significant challenge of disarming Hezbollah. The decision follows a weakening of Iran-backed militias in the region and aims to assert the Lebanese state's authority. An agreement has been reached with the Palestinian Authority to support the disarmament of the camps.</p>

          <p>New Jersey is holding gubernatorial elections this year, with contested primaries set for next month, and experts suggest the race could be a bellwether for the mood of the country ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The election will test Democratic backlash against the Trump administration and indicate shifting partisan allegiances in New Jersey. Issues at stake include immigration enforcement, sanctuary cities, and the cost of housing. Trump has endorsed Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli, adding another layer of significance to the race.</p>
