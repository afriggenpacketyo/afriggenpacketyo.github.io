          <h2>Roses Were Originally Yellow, Not Red, Study Suggests</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 01:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the common association of roses with the color red. The study, which examined domesticated and wild rose samples, found that the common ancestor of roses most likely had single-petal flowers with a yellow hue. This discovery challenges the traditional perception of roses and provides insights into the evolutionary history of one of the world's most cultivated ornamental flowers.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly catching up to and, in some areas, surpassing the United States in key technologies, particularly in artificial intelligence, and excelling in the dissemination, commercialization, and manufacturing of tech. While the US has long held a lead, China has swiftly developed state-of-the-art competitors, like the DeepSeek AI model, and is making its technology freely accessible, fostering global adoption. The authors argue that to win the race for the future of technology, the US must discard the belief that it is always ahead and learn from China's successes. This article discusses the implications of China's rise in the tech world.</p>
