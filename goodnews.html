          <p>Singapore's economy expanded by 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter of 2025, outperforming economists' forecasts and accelerating from the previous quarter's growth. The manufacturing sector was the primary driver of this expansion, growing by 5.5%. Despite the positive results, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious, citing significant uncertainty and downside risks from global trade tensions, particularly U.S. tariff policies. The country's central bank had previously loosened monetary policy due to economic outlook risks, but low inflation could support a potential rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Alicia Tournebize, a 17-year-old player for the French women's national team, executed a notable dunk during the FIBA U18 Women’s EuroBasket 2025 third-place game against Belgium. The 6-foot-4 athlete stole the ball and completed the dunk on a breakaway in the fourth quarter. Tournebize finished the game with 19 points and 12 rebounds, helping France secure a 72-47 victory and its fifth consecutive podium finish in the tournament. This was not her first in-game dunk, as she has previously accomplished the feat in league play, a rarity in women's basketball.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks defeated the Connecticut Sun 92-88, driven by a powerful offensive performance from their frontcourt. The trio of Rickea Jackson, Dearica Hamby, and Azurá Stevens combined for a dominant showing, contributing to a 57-point surge that the Sun could not overcome. The Sparks' offense was fluid, resulting in 22 assists as they controlled the game from the start. Despite a late push from Connecticut, key free throws by Stevens in the final seconds secured the win for Los Angeles, improving their season record to 6-14.</p>

          <p>Australia is navigating a complex geopolitical landscape by enhancing its strategic and defense partnership with the Philippines while managing its crucial trade relationship with China. As part of a civil maritime cooperation program, Australia is increasing its investment in the Philippines, providing patrol boats, training, and educational scholarships. This move strengthens ties between the two nations, which are preparing to celebrate 80 years of diplomatic relations in 2026. Analysts note that both countries are motivated to deepen their partnership, reflecting a broader regional strategy to counterbalance other influences in the Indo-Pacific.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly choosing technology and engineering-related fields for their university studies. This trend is driven by a state-led focus on technological advancement amid intensified competition with the United States. Subjects like information and communications technology and vehicle engineering have become top choices, supplanting formerly popular majors like international trade and urban planning. This change reflects a strategic national effort to funnel talent into key industrial sectors, reshaping the academic priorities of a new generation of students in China.</p>

          <p>Banyan Group founder Kwon Ping Ho, a 30-year veteran of the luxury hotel industry, observes that modern tourists have vastly different expectations than previous generations. He notes that younger travelers, already well-traveled with their parents, are now seeking deeper, more authentic experiences and interactions with local communities rather than just sightseeing. Ho also highlights the rise of 'rainbow tourism,' where travelers come from a diverse range of developing nations, a stark contrast to the primarily Western-to-East travel flow of three decades ago. This shift demands a move away from one-size-fits-all offerings toward more tailored and experiential hospitality.</p>

          <p>Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is marking a major scientific milestone: 230 years of continuous, unbroken daily weather observation. This handwritten data sequence, which began on July 14, 1795, is the longest of its kind in the UK and Ireland. Unlike modern automated stations, the observatory maintains the tradition of a human observer manually recording temperature and air pressure. This extensive historical record provides invaluable insights into long-term climate patterns and has documented major weather events, contributing significantly to the science of meteorology over more than two centuries.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the MLB season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory against the San Francisco Giants, securing a key series win. Despite a season marked by both high points and frustrating slumps, the team holds the best record in the National League at 58-39. Starter Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a stellar seven-inning scoreless performance, but the bullpen faltered in the ninth before the offense rallied in the 11th. The win solidifies their first-place standing in the NL West, even as the team acknowledges the need for improvement in the second half.</p>

The victory was a significant turnaround from the French Open final just a month prior, where Sinner lost to Alcaraz in a grueling five-set match.
