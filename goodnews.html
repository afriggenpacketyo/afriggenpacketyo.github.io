          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to formalize a deal allowing TikTok to operate in the U.S. under a new corporate structure, aiming to address national security concerns. This agreement designates it a "qualified divestiture," pushing back enforcement of a congressional ban by 120 days to finalize terms. Under the deal, Oracle will provide comprehensive security by hosting U.S. user data and reviewing TikTok's proprietary content recommendation algorithm, which will be retrained specifically for the American user base. The new U.S.-based entity is valued at $14 billion, with a majority of American investors and board members, though China-based ByteDance will retain a 19.9% ownership stake. This resolution aims to ensure the popular platform can operate safely and securely for its millions of users.</p>

          <p>Acclaimed music producer Jack Antonoff, known for his work with Taylor Swift, publicly criticized Live Nation Entertainment CEO Michael Rapino's assertion that concert tickets are "underpriced." Antonoff, advocating for fan fairness, proposed making it illegal to sell tickets above face value, arguing this would eliminate market chaos and restore control to artists. His comments come as the Federal Trade Commission has sued Live Nation and its subsidiary Ticketmaster for alleged illegal ticket resale tactics and antitrust violations. Antonoff emphasized that the current system often exploits audiences, and his team actively seeks innovative solutions to make concert experiences more affordable for fans.</p>

          <p>Alexandra Grant, Keanu Reeves's longtime girlfriend, publicly debunked recent wedding rumors in an Instagram post, sharing a photo of them kissing at Roden Crater. She clarified that the image was "not an engagement photo or an AI wedding announcement... simply a kiss!" The rumors had circulated after Grant was seen with a ring at a movie premiere in June 2025. Grant used the opportunity to caution against "fake news" while sharing a moment of "real happiness," reiterating that the couple has not tied the knot.

          <p>Bryson DeChambeau has undergone a significant transformation, emerging as a "gladiator" figure for the American Ryder Cup team, shedding his past image of individualism. Despite his controversial move to LIV Golf, his strong performances in major championships, including a 2024 US Open victory, secured his automatic qualification. Teammates and captain Keegan Bradley now commend his renewed team-first approach and "fiery" energy, a notable shift from previous ambivalence. DeChambeau's growing YouTube presence and association with former President Trump further amplify his profile, positioning him as a potential unifying force and talisman for the U.S. side as they seek to reclaim the trophy.</p>

Amazon, while admitting no wrongdoing, will also implement clearer disclosures during enrollment and an easier cancellation process. This "monumental win" for the FTC, under the Trump administration, aims to protect consumers from manipulative subscription practices, despite Amazon stating many changes were already in place.

          <p>U.S. new car sales have received an unexpected boost heading into the fourth quarter, prompting Cox Automotive to revise its 2025 sales forecast upward to 16.1 million units. This surprising resilience in demand is largely attributed to consumers accelerating their purchases, driven by fears of impending tariffs and anticipated higher prices. Additionally, a surge in electric vehicle (EV) sales occurred ahead of the expiration of federal tax credits at the end of this month. While this "pull-ahead" effect benefits the automotive industry in the short term, analysts predict a slowdown in sales for the fourth quarter and into the upcoming year. (not investment advice)</p>
