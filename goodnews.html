          <p>During a heated Game 4 playoff matchup between the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Indiana Pacers, Cavaliers forward De'Andre Hunter shoved Pacers guard Bennedict Mathurin to the ground in the first quarter.

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang, a professor at Peking University, discusses the ongoing trade war between the US and China, noting that both sides are realizing the unsustainable nature of the conflict. Yao suggests that tariffs over 100% are essentially an embargo, hurting both economies. He believes a deal is likely, with the first step being a rollback to around the original 34% tariff level. The US may also demand China buy more American goods like farm products, energy, and Boeing planes.</p>

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally recognized for supporting a long-lived population, is facing significant strain due to a shrinking workforce and an aging population. This issue is becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and erode public trust in the government. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government is seeking funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing to increase the burden on patients with high medical costs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly in discussions with the Qatari government regarding the potential donation of a luxury Boeing 747 airplane. This offer, which could temporarily serve as Air Force One, has raised legal and ethical concerns, particularly as it has been suggested that the plane would be donated to Trump's presidential library after he leaves office. While White House officials state that any gift from a foreign government will be accepted in compliance with all applicable laws, some Democrats have questioned the legality of the arrangement, with one senator suggesting it could be seen as a cash payment in exchange for favors.</p>

          <p>The United States has suspended all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison from Mexico due to concerns about the northward spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized that this decision is about food and animal safety, not politics. The New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds or mucous membranes of animals, feeding on their flesh and blood. The USDA said cases have surged in parts of Central America and are now being detected in some "remote farms" in Mexico about 700 miles from the U.S border.</p>

          <p>CVS Caremark has decided to exclude Zepbound in favor of Wegovy for weight loss, a move that will force many Americans to switch to a drug that may be less effective for them. This decision highlights the impact of deals between drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs), which can restrict patient access to certain treatments despite research indicating that Zepbound results in more weight loss. The company claims the decision was made to lower drug prices, but critics argue it prioritizes profits over patient care.

The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer Eli Lilly, involved 750 obese individuals.

          <h2>UK Government Announces New Migration Rules</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 19:44:28 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is introducing new measures to control migration levels, including stricter English language tests for adult dependents of foreign workers and restrictions on care homes recruiting staff from abroad. The government aims to seize the narrative from Reform UK, a party that has gained traction by advocating for tighter immigration controls. Migrants will need to earn the right to stay, with priority given to those who pay taxes, work in the public sector, have high-skilled jobs, or volunteer. Automatic settlement and citizenship after five years of UK residence will end, and migrants must wait ten years to become British.</p>

          <h2>US Suspends Live Cattle Imports from Mexico Over Screwworm Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-11 19:38:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States is suspending imports of live cattle from Mexico through southern border ports for at least two weeks to review the joint strategy against the screwworm parasite. Secretary Brooke Rollins cited the recent detection of screwworm in remote farms as far north as Oaxaca and Veracruz. The suspension aims to protect U.S. animals and the nation's food supply. Mexico's Agriculture Secretary expressed disagreement but confidence in reaching an agreement soon. The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of warm-blooded animals, causing severe damage and potentially fatal lesions.</p>

          <p>The Argentine Supreme Court has discovered documentation associated with the Nazi regime among its archives, including propaganda material used to spread Adolf Hitler's ideology. The material was found while preparing for a museum with historical documents. The items are believed to be related to packages that arrived in Buenos Aires in 1941, sent by the German embassy in Tokyo. The president of the Supreme Court has ordered the preservation of the material and a thorough analysis. Argentina has the largest Jewish population in Latin America and was a destination for Nazis and sympathizers after the war.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he will sign an executive order directing the Department of Health and Human Services to tie Medicare payments for certain medications to the lowest price paid by other nations. This ‚Äúmost favored nation‚Äôs policy‚Äù aims to lower healthcare costs for Americans. The proposal, which targets drugs administered in a doctor's office, is expected to face strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry. The industry argues that lower prices will hurt profits and affect innovation. This is a revival of a failed effort from his first term.</p>

          <p>A team of neuroscientists and neurosurgeons in Switzerland have developed a "digital bridge" to help paralyzed individuals regain movement and other critical bodily functions. This technology bypasses spinal cord injuries, sending signals wirelessly from the brain to the healthy part of the spinal cord to enable movement and regulate blood pressure, bladder function, and body temperature. Clinical trials are underway to assess the safety and efficacy of this therapy, with the hope of making it widely accessible. Researchers are also exploring the potential of spinal cord stimulation to improve mobility in people with Parkinson's disease.</p>
