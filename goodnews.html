          <p>The final Test match between England and India is poised for a dramatic conclusion, with England needing 35 more runs and India requiring four wickets to win. Play was halted on the fourth day due to rain and bad light, leaving the series outcome on a knife-edge. Centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root had put them in a strong position before a late comeback from India's bowlers created a tense finale. The series will be decided on the final morning, with England leading 2-1.</p>

          <p>Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan stated that his bank's economists do not foresee a recession or further interest rate hikes this year, despite market speculation. He addressed the impact of tariffs, suggesting their main effect is creating business uncertainty rather than immediate price shocks. Commenting on the firing of the BLS chief, Moynihan suggested the government's data collection methods, which rely on surveys, are outdated and could be improved with better technology, which might reduce the large revisions that create doubt.

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of mis-sold car finance, with potential payouts estimated to be under £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that found some hidden, large commissions paid to dealers were unfair, though it did not deem all such commissions unlawful. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion and cover agreements dating back to 2007. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major restaurant chains are turning up the heat, adding a wave of new spicy menu items to attract Gen Z and Gen Alpha customers. Companies like Chipotle, Cava, and Taco Bell are launching spicy sauces, sides, and main dishes, which are often easier and cheaper to implement than entirely new proteins. This trend is fueled by social media, where spicy food challenges and reaction videos perform well, and by younger generations' preference for bolder, more adventurous flavors. Around 95% of U.S. restaurants now feature at least one spicy item on their menu.</p>

          <p>China's third and most advanced aircraft carrier, the Fujian, appears to have conducted its first test of its electromagnetic catapult launch system. Footage aired on state broadcaster CCTV as part of a military anniversary series showed what looked like a successful launch, a key milestone for the vessel. The Fujian is China's first carrier equipped with this modern technology, which allows for launching heavier and more varied aircraft compared to the ski-jump ramps on its other carriers. The ship is expected to officially enter service with the People's Liberation Army Navy later this year.</p>

          <p>A new report has identified several mid-sized U.S. cities as leading hubs for employment and income growth, challenging the dominance of major coastal metropolises. Raleigh, North Carolina, topped the list, followed by Nashville, Austin, and Salt Lake City. The ranking, based on metrics like labor force growth, unemployment rates, and household income, highlights the shifting geography of opportunity in the country. Researchers note that while salaries may be lower than in cities like New York or LA, the affordability of these mid-sized areas means money often goes further. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Divorce attorneys suggest two key strategies for protecting personal finances within a marriage, especially if the relationship becomes unstable. The first is maintaining full awareness and access to all joint financial accounts, assets, and liabilities to ensure transparency. The second is considering a postnuptial agreement, which functions like a prenup but is created after the wedding, to define how assets, particularly those from a business started during the marriage, would be divided in a divorce. These steps can provide security and clarity for both partners should the marriage end.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A parenting expert who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships shares seven calming phrases that can help manage a child's tantrums by fostering connection rather than control. Instead of punishing or dismissing a child's outburst, phrases like "You're having a big feeling. I'm right here with you" and "Your feelings make sense" validate their emotions and make them feel safe. This approach, which focuses on emotional attunement, helps a child's nervous system regulate more quickly and builds long-term trust and emotional resilience.</p>

          <p>The UK government is accelerating plans to evacuate seriously ill or injured children from Gaza to receive medical care in Britain. The scheme, which could be operational within weeks, may allow up to 300 children, each accompanied by a guardian, to enter the UK for free treatment. This official government initiative follows smaller, privately-funded evacuations organized by charities. The move comes after a Foreign Affairs Committee report criticized the government for previously declining to support such a medical evacuation program.</p>
