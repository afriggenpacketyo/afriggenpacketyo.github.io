          <p>Apple, in conjunction with President Trump, announced it will increase its U.S. spending by an additional $100 billion over the next four years, bringing its total commitment to $600 billion. The investment aims to bolster the domestic supply chain, with a significant $2.5 billion expansion planned for its partnership with Corning, the manufacturer of iPhone glass in Kentucky. This move comes amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs, with Apple aiming to reshore more of its manufacturing and component sourcing to the United States. The company stated the investment would support numerous U.S.-based partners and expand data center operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a money market account for a $10,000 investment. While current interest rates are similar, a CD offers a fixed rate, guaranteeing returns and protecting against potential future rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. In contrast, money market accounts have variable rates that would likely decrease if the Fed lowers rates as anticipated. The analysis concludes that while the immediate earning difference is minimal, the CD provides greater security and predictability for maximizing returns over the six-month period.

          <p>Indiana Fever guard Sophie Cunningham has been fined $1,500 by the WNBA for publicly criticizing referees for a second time, just days after receiving a $500 fine for similar comments. The latest fine was issued after she discussed the league's officiating on her new podcast, stating that while she understands the job is difficult, the inconsistency is a major issue. Cunningham has gained increased attention this season, partly for her vocal defense of teammate Caitlin Clark. She acknowledged on her podcast that she anticipated the second, larger fine for her continued commentary on the referees.</p>

          <p>A human foot found inside a hiking boot on the shore of Fish Lake, Utah, has been identified as belonging to David White, a man who went missing 28 years ago. The Sevier County Sheriff's Office linked the boot, a model made for only one year in 1996, to White's 1997 disappearance. White had gone fishing alone after plans with friends fell through, and his empty boat was found later. DNA from the remains was matched to his daughter with 99.9994% certainty, bringing a long-awaited sense of closure to his family and the law enforcement officers involved in the original search.</p>

          <p>Southern Brave secured a dramatic one-wicket victory over Manchester Originals in The Hundred, thanks to a late surge from their tail-end batters. Chasing 132, the Brave were in a difficult position, needing 26 runs from the final 11 balls with only two wickets remaining.

          <p>The Los Angeles County District Attorney's office has dropped a felony weapons possession case against rapper Soulja Boy, citing insufficient evidence. The artist, whose real name is DeAndre Cortez Way, was arrested early Sunday after police stopped a vehicle in which he was a passenger and discovered a firearm. After his release, the rapper posted a video to social media celebrating his "first day out." The dropped charge offers a legal reprieve for the musician, who has faced other legal issues, including a recent civil verdict finding him liable for sexual assault and abuse.</p>
