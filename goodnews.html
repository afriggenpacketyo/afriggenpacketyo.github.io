          <p>A 92-year-old man, Ryland Headley, has been convicted of the sexual assault and murder of 75-year-old Louisa Dunne in Bristol, a crime that occurred in 1967. The case, considered the oldest cold case solved in the UK, remained unsolved for nearly six decades until investigators re-examined evidence. A crucial breakthrough came from modern DNA testing performed on a semen swab from the original crime scene, which positively identified Headley, a previously convicted serial offender.</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wages are set to rise in Alaska, Oregon, and Washington, D.C., along with twelve other cities and counties across the United States. According to the Economic Policy Institute, these increases will benefit over 800,000 workers, providing an average annual wage boost ranging from $420 to $925. The analysis also indicates that women and minority workers will disproportionately benefit from the pay hikes, which come as the federal minimum wage has remained unchanged since 2009.</p>

By rescinding the tax, Canada aims to de-escalate the trade dispute and allow negotiations with the United States to resume.</p>
