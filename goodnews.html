          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration from revoking Harvard University's ability to enroll international students, which is part of an ongoing dispute between the president and the university. The judge's order prevents the government from cutting off Harvard's access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, a federal database for student visa applications. This ruling follows a previous temporary restraining order against a separate order barring most international students from studying at Harvard. The administration had accused Harvard of failing to address campus antisemitism, leading to the initial attempt to revoke its student visa system certification.</p>

          <p>Meta is partnering with Oakley to introduce new AI-powered smart glasses called Oakley Meta HSTN, designed for athletes and everyday use. These glasses, part of Meta's collaboration with EssilorLuxottica, feature built-in cameras for hands-free video recording, Bluetooth speakers for music and podcasts, and the ability to send and receive texts and calls. Equipped with a personal AI assistant, the glasses respond to questions prompted by "Hey Meta," providing information such as wind speed for athletes. Meta is leveraging sports figures like Kylian Mbapp√© and Patrick Mahomes to promote the new eyewear line, set to launch this summer with a starting price of $399.</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported better-than-expected earnings and revenue, projecting solid growth for fiscal 2026. Despite concerns about consumer spending, CEO Rick Cardenas noted continued spending on casual dining, with Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse reporting strong same-store sales growth. The company is considering "strategic alternatives" for the Bahama Breeze brand, including a potential sale, and has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program. Darden's fine dining segment experienced a sales decline, but the company is seeing improvement in guest traffic from higher-income households.</p>

          <p>Kroger's shares increased after the supermarket operator raised its full-year sales outlook, indicating that consumers are increasingly seeking lower-priced store brands and alternatives to dining out. The company now expects identical sales to increase between 2.25% and 3.25% year over year, driven by pharmacy, e-commerce, and fresh groceries. Interim CEO Ron Sargent stated that Kroger is catering to value-minded shoppers by simplifying promotions, lowering prices, and emphasizing its private brands. The company is also closing approximately 60 stores over the next 18 months while planning new locations in higher-growth areas.</p>

          <p>Circle's shares continued their rally after the Senate approved the GENIUS Act, a proposed stablecoin legislation, with the stock rising over 20%. Coinbase, which receives half of the revenue from interest earned on Circle's USDC reserves, also saw its shares climb. Stablecoins, cryptocurrencies pegged to assets like the U.S. dollar, are gaining traction due to potential regulatory clarity and interest from banks and payment firms. The GENIUS Act seeks to establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, potentially making payments faster and cheaper, and attracting interest from major companies like Amazon and Walmart.</p>

          <p>The median home sale price in the U.S. reached a record high of $396,500, but data indicates that buyers are paying less than the asking price. Buyers are paying about 6%, or $26,000, less than sellers' median asking price, as high housing costs and economic uncertainty have impacted demand. With more sellers than buyers, sellers may be more flexible on price, especially for homes not in perfect condition.

          <p>Meta approached Perplexity AI about a potential takeover before ultimately investing $14.3 billion into Scale AI, according to sources familiar with the matter. The negotiations between Meta and Perplexity did not result in a finalized deal, with one source indicating a mutual dissolution and another suggesting Perplexity opted to walk away. This move highlights Meta's aggressive strategy to strengthen its AI capabilities amid intense competition from OpenAI and Google parent Alphabet. Mark Zuckerberg is reportedly keen to enhance Meta's AI efforts to compete effectively in both underlying AI models and consumer-facing applications.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The interest-earning potential of CDs and money market accounts is similar but not identical, especially in the current rate environment. CD rates are fixed based on the lender and term length, while money market accounts have variable rates that change over time. Currently, money market account rates top out around 4.32%, while the highest rates on CDs are topping out around 4.49% for 6-month CDs. Savers must weigh the guaranteed interest of a CD versus the potential for slightly higher earnings with a money market account, considering the volatility of rates. (not investment advice)</p>
