          <h2>China's Export Growth Defies US Tariffs, Fueled by Southeast Asia</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 00:22:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a surprising surge in April, growing by 8.1% despite the imposition of tariffs by the United States. This growth was largely driven by a significant increase in shipments to Southeast Asian countries, effectively offsetting a sharp decline in exports to the U.S. President of Pinpoint Asset Management Zhiwei Zhang suggests this resilience may be due to transshipment through third countries and pre-tariff contracts, but anticipates a gradual weakening in trade data in the coming months. The Chinese government has been encouraging exporters to focus on the domestic market to mitigate the impact of tariffs, a move that could potentially lead to deflation.</p>

          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by news of a new trade agreement between the US and the UK, hailed as 'historic' by both Prime Minister Starmer and President Trump. While the deal aims to alleviate some tariffs imposed by the US, a 10% levy on most goods remains, causing some to view the agreement as limited in scope. The Daily Telegraph reports that the deal includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim the government dismisses. The papers also reflect on commemorations for the 80th anniversary of VE Day and the selection of a new Pope, Leo XIV.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion piece discusses the United States' renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by strategic and geopolitical considerations. Greenland's location is crucial due to its proximity to both Russia and the European heartlands, making it significant in the nuclear age and for monitoring international transport routes. The Arctic is warming rapidly, granting Russia easier access to open waters, which Russia has been quick to exploit, including extensive energy and mineral resources. The author suggests a resolution to tensions within NATO by applying the "Compact of Free Association" model, similar to agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau, to ensure NATO security interests while moderating concerns among international partners.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has suggested that US tariffs on goods from China may decrease as trade officials from both countries prepare for talks in Switzerland. Trump referred to the current tariff level of 145%, indicating it is likely to be reduced. China has also expressed confidence in managing trade issues with the US. Analysts caution that these talks mark the beginning of potentially lengthy negotiations and that any initial tariff cuts are likely to be minor. The announcement of these talks has been welcomed as a positive step towards easing trade tensions.</p>
