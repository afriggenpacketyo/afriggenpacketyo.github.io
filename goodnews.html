          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stated that equity prices appear to be "fairly highly valued" by many metrics. Speaking in Rhode Island, Powell clarified that while the central bank monitors overall financial conditions, it does not currently see elevated risks to financial stability. He explained that markets often price in anticipated interest rate changes, which has contributed to the recent rally in stocks and other assets following the Fed's latest rate cut. Powell's comments provide insight into the Fed's perspective on current market levels, balancing the observation of high valuations with a lack of immediate stability concerns.</p>

Twelve bears, including last year's champion Grazer, are competing for the title, with their progress streamed on live webcams as they feast on salmon from the Brooks River. The event, a partnership between the National Park Service and explore.org, has grown into a global phenomenon, drawing millions of viewers and over a million votes annually.

          <p>In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, Chicago-based artist Liz Flores has designed a special jersey for the Chicago Cubs that merges Latino cultural motifs with the team's identity. The design, which features the word "Cachorros" (Cubs in Spanish), incorporates folk art patterns while retaining the team's traditional red and blue colors. Flores, whose heritage is Cuban and Mexican, aimed to create a design that allows fans to proudly display both their team loyalty and their Latino identity. The special-ticket jerseys for the heritage night at Wrigley Field have already sold out due to high demand, prompting the creation of a T-shirt with similar designs for wider availability.</p>

          <p>The New York Giants are expected to make a significant change at quarterback, with reports indicating that rookie Jaxson Dart will start in their upcoming Week 4 game against the Los Angeles Chargers. The decision follows a difficult performance by veteran Russell Wilson, who threw two interceptions in a recent loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, drawing boos from the home crowd. Head coach Brian Daboll had previously left the door open for a change, stating the team was evaluating everything to improve the passing game. Dart, a first-round pick from Ole Miss, will get his first major opportunity to lead the offense against an undefeated Chargers team.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly has announced plans to build a new $6.5 billion manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas. The plant is designated to produce the company's pipeline of small molecule drugs, including its highly anticipated experimental oral obesity pill, orforglipron. This investment is part of a larger strategy to bolster domestic production, with the company committing billions to new U.S. plants amid threats of tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. The new Houston site is expected to create over 600 permanent high-skilled jobs and 4,000 construction jobs, significantly boosting Eli Lilly's capacity to meet massive potential demand for its new weight-loss treatments.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has mandated that the Trump administration must restore $500 million in federal grant funding to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). The funds, primarily for medical research, were suspended by the administration over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. U.S. District Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, ruling that the government likely violated federal law by failing to provide specific reasons for the cuts. This decision is the latest in a series of legal battles between universities and the administration over its use of federal funding to influence campus policies on diversity and speech.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has fallen to 6.13%, its lowest level in three years. For a $350,000 mortgage, this translates to a principal and interest payment of approximately $2,128 per month. This is about $210 less per month compared to the payments on the same loan at the beginning of 2025, when rates were above 7%. Over the life of the loan, this lower rate could save a borrower more than $75,000 in total interest. The more favorable rate environment has also created attractive refinancing opportunities for current homeowners looking to lower their monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

He mentioned that he is considering taking some profits in one of the Investing Club's bank holdings following their significant gains. The sector's rally is largely attributed to the expectation that the Federal Reserve will continue to cut interest rates. Cramer emphasized that while it's tempting to lock in profits, the strategy is not to sell winners to fund underperforming stocks, especially if the interest rate environment remains favorable for banks.
