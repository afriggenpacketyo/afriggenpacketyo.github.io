          <p>The search for the thylacine, or Tasmanian tiger, which was declared extinct in 1986, has become a national obsession in Australia, fueled by thousands of reported sightings. While enthusiasts use trail cams and analyze potential tracks, a high-tech de-extinction project is also underway. Scientists at the University of Melbourne, in partnership with Colossal Biosciences, are attempting to resurrect the species by editing the DNA of its closest living relative, the dunnart. Despite skepticism from some experts about the project's feasibility, the quest reflects a deep-seated hope and collective remorse over the animal's extinction.</p>

          <p>Renowned German filmmaker Werner Herzog, now 82, is known for his decades-long career of creating unconventional films that explore the edges of human sanity and the indifference of nature. In a recent interview, he reflected on the extreme lengths he has gone to for his art, such as hauling a 340-ton steamship over a mountain for his film "Fitzcarraldo." Herzog, who describes his approach as requiring "good criminal energy," continues to work on new projects and teaches his philosophy to aspiring filmmakers. He believes his prose and poetry will ultimately outlive his extensive filmography.</p>

          <p>China has lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 after Japan began releasing treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision follows an agreement to establish long-term international monitoring and independent sampling, which Chinese authorities said showed no abnormalities. The move is seen as an effort by Beijing to improve relations with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. However, restrictions on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, will remain in place.</p>
