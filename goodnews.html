          <p>New York Mets pitcher Nolan McLean made franchise history with a dominant performance against the Philadelphia Phillies, securing his third consecutive MLB win in his first three starts. McLean pitched eight scoreless innings, striking out six, contributing to the Mets' 6-0 victory and bringing them within four games of the National League East lead. His impressive 0.89 ERA over these initial starts is the lowest for a Mets rookie, surpassing Tom Seaver's long-standing record from 1967. Teammates and manager Carlos Mendoza praised McLean's electric stuff, pitchability, and confident demeanor on the mound, highlighting his significant impact on the team's recent resurgence.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV has secured a "short-term extension" in its contract dispute with Fox, preventing an immediate blackout of Fox channels for subscribers. The agreement allows negotiations to continue, averting disruptions to programming like college football and Fox News. While YouTube TV stated Fox was demanding excessive payments, Fox accused Google of exploiting its influence. The Federal Communications Commission chairman urged a resolution, highlighting the importance of access to news and sports. This temporary deal follows a similar dispute in 2021 when YouTube TV briefly lost Disney content, underscoring the ongoing challenges in carriage agreement renewals within the streaming industry.</p>

          <p>Dick's Sporting Goods surpassed second-quarter earnings expectations and subsequently raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance. The company reported a 5% increase in comparable sales and revenue, driven by growth in average ticket and transactions. CEO Lauren Hobart attributed the strong performance to effective long-term strategies and consistent execution. While the full-year revenue outlook was slightly below estimates, the raised profit guidance includes the impact of current tariffs. The upcoming $2.4 billion acquisition of Foot Locker, expected to close next month, aims to enhance Dick's position in the athletic footwear market, despite Foot Locker's ongoing business struggles.

This milestone is crucial for NASA's Artemis III mission, which plans to return American astronauts to the moon by 2027 using Starship's lunar lander variant. NASA officials expressed confidence in beating China, emphasizing the importance of this breakthrough. However, analysts caution that despite this success, China's consistent momentum in space exploration could still enable Beijing to establish the first lunar base, highlighting the intense competition and the need for sustained progress in the US space program.</p>

          <p>Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum announced she would ask the United States to share the $15 billion forfeited by convicted drug lord Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada with Mexico's poorest people. Zambada, a Sinaloa cartel co-founder, pleaded guilty to murder and drug trafficking, agreeing to the forfeiture to avoid the death penalty. Despite speculation about the cartel's decline following Zambada's and "El Chapo" Guzman's arrests, Mexico's Security Secretary insists the organization remains formidable. The cartel, declared a terrorist group by Washington, operates extensively across the U.S.-Mexican border. This case highlights the vast wealth accumulated by drug cartels and the potential for international cooperation in addressing both crime and poverty.</p>

          <p>The UK Department for Transport has announced the first electric vehicle models, including Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier, eligible for a £3,750 discount under a new government grant scheme. This initiative aims to encourage the transition from petrol and diesel cars, with 26 other models receiving a £1,500 discount. The grants, part of a £650 million scheme, will be automatically applied at the point of sale for eligible vehicles costing up to £37,000, with more models expected to follow. This policy addresses upfront cost as a major barrier for drivers, striving to make EVs more affordable and aligning with the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>

          <p>Columnist Margaret Sullivan applauds California Governor Gavin Newsom's strategy of "mercilessly trolling" President Trump with unhinged social media posts and self-promotional merchandise, effectively flipping Trump's own political script. This combative approach, which has garnered approval from figures like Barack Obama and even Steve Bannon, is seen as an energetic departure from the Democratic Party's traditional "go high" strategy. Sullivan suggests Newsom's tactics, combined with efforts like redistricting to benefit Democrats, could be a crucial part of a "radical change" needed to counter authoritarianism and revitalize the party. The article frames Newsom's actions as not just humorous, but potentially important in a polarized political landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump's assertion that Beverly Hills is beset by crime, claiming residents leave car doors and garages open to prevent vandalism, has been met with surprise and skepticism by city officials and locals. While police data show a rise in low-value vehicle thefts, overall crime in Beverly Hills reportedly fell in 2024, with the focus typically on retail crime in luxury areas. Residents expressed feeling safe, and a local Democratic club leader suggested Trump used Beverly Hills for publicity due to its name recognition. The comments are seen as part of a broader pattern of Trump's rhetoric on urban crime, raising questions about the validity and intent behind such statements.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is advocating for state legislation, SB 346, to compel short-term rental platforms to share property data, enabling the city to crack down on illegal rentals and collect millions in uncollected tax revenue. With nearly 72% of Airbnb listings in L.A. County estimated to be operating illegally, the city faces a significant challenge in enforcing its 2018 ordinance, which limits short-term rentals to primary homes. The lack of data hinders efforts to address party houses, protect rent-controlled apartments, and recover crucial "bed tax" revenue needed for vital programs like housing and infrastructure. This measure is seen as essential for fair business practices and supporting local services amid budget deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

The Brea Mall location, the first in California, offers 70 games, including a small retro section with titles like "Tron" and "Ms. Pac-Man," in a darker, '80s-inspired ambiance. Unlike traditional Chuck E. Cheese venues, it lacks pizza and alcohol, focusing solely on gaming and prize machines, particularly Funko figurines. While the company hopes to tap into a booming kidult market, some question if the limited retro offerings and lack of food/drink truly deliver on the adult arcade experience, despite its strategic mall food court location.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom asserts that the fundamental challenge facing the Democratic Party is "weakness," driving his combative political strategy. His approach includes mocking President Trump on social media, engaging with right-wing influencers, and pushing for a redistricting measure in California to gain more House seats. Newsom aims to break the cycle of Democrats passively reacting to conservative grievances, instead setting their own assertive agenda. Drawing parallels to former President Clinton's analysis of voters preferring "strong and wrong to weak and right," Newsom emphasizes the need for the party to assert itself and prove its strength to the American people, especially as he considers a 2028 presidential bid.</p>
