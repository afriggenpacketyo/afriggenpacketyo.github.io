          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old state assemblyman, is poised to win the New York City mayoral primary after running a progressive campaign and upsetting former Governor Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's victory is seen by some Democrats as a potential model for revitalizing the party with a focus on economic issues and social media savvy. Republicans, however, are eager to highlight Mamdani's socialist ideas as evidence of the Democrats' shift to the left. While Mamdani's win provides energy and ideas, questions remain about applying lessons from a local primary in a heavily Democratic city to the national stage.</p>

          <p>The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has directed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to consider cryptocurrency as an asset in single-family mortgage loan risk assessments. This move signals the integration of crypto into traditional financial infrastructure, allowing digital assets to be included without borrowers needing to liquidate them into U.S. dollars before closing. FHFA Director William J. Pulte stated the move aligns with President Donald Trump's vision to make the United States the crypto capital of the world. Previously, cryptocurrency was excluded due to volatility and regulatory uncertainty.</p>
