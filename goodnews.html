          <p>According to a spokesperson, former President Joe Biden last underwent a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test in 2014, which aligns with current medical guidelines for men over 70. Current recommendations suggest men aged 55 to 69 should discuss the benefits and harms of PSA testing with their doctor, while those 70 and older generally should not receive PSA-based screening due to the risk of false positives. After Biden announced he had an aggressive form of prostate cancer, former President Donald Trump questioned the timing of the announcement, but Biden's representatives clarified that doctors discovered a small nodule in his prostate during a routine physical last week. A PSA screening is not a perfect test, as the risk of false positives increases with age, but some people with cancer might still have good PSA scores.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed that the company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco soon after. The robotaxi service will initially include about 10 Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of FSD (Full Self-Driving) Unsupervised software. Musk has been promising fully self-driving cars for years, but Tesla does not yet offer a vehicle safe to use without human supervision. Musk stated that starting with a small number of vehicles is prudent to confirm everything is running smoothly before scaling up to thousands of vehicles.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has issued temporary restrictions on flights in and out of Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent technology outages, air traffic controller staffing shortages, and runway construction. The new restrictions will cap flights at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with continued limits on weekends through December, and then increase to 34 departures and 34 arrivals per hour until Oct. 25. United Airlines, which operates about 70 percent of flights at Newark, welcomed the restrictions. The FAA aims to relieve the inconvenience to travelers from excessive flight delays and has announced incentives to recruit and retain air traffic controllers to address nationwide staffing shortages.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced the construction of a "Golden Dome" missile defense system to protect the American homeland from missile attacks. The project, similar to Israel's Iron Dome, will receive $25 billion in initial funding and is expected to cost $175 billion overall, with a major phase completed in under three years. Space Force Gen. Michael Guetlein will oversee the project, which aims to intercept missiles launched from anywhere in the world, including space. Hegseth emphasized the system's importance in responding to growing threats from countries like Russia and China, while Guetlein highlighted the need to protect the American way of life from increasingly capable adversaries.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with House Republicans to urge support for a massive budget package, emphasizing the need for party unity and threatening to oust those who oppose the bill. House Speaker Mike Johnson faces challenges in securing enough votes due to divisions among conservatives, moderates, and those concerned about the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. Conservatives seek deeper spending cuts and changes to Medicaid, while moderates resist cuts to the program, and Republicans from blue states demand adjustments to the SALT deduction. Trump insisted that Medicaid cuts would only target waste, fraud, and abuse, and urged Republicans to pass the bill, with Johnson working to address remaining concerns within the conference.</p>

          <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will permit the use of COVID vaccines for adults over 65 and those with certain medical conditions this fall, but will require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders cited evidence suggesting uncertain benefits for younger individuals who have already been vaccinated or had COVID. The FDA's scientific advisers are set to meet to decide on the composition of the COVID vaccine to be made available in the fall. Some experts worry the new criteria are overly restrictive, while others agree with the agency's rationale but fear the restrictions will limit access for healthy Americans at high risk due to their jobs or other reasons.</p>
