          <p>Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage, was reunited with his family after spending 584 days in Hamas captivity, thanks to a deal brokered by the Trump administration. Alexander's parents recounted the emotional moment they received the call about his impending release and their frantic journey to Israel for the reunion. Edan is now receiving medical attention for minor injuries sustained during the Oct. 7 attack and is slowly sharing details about his captivity. The family remains deeply concerned for the 58 hostages still held in Gaza and is urging for an end to the conflict.</p>

          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped over 18% in their Hong Kong trading debut, reflecting investor confidence in the company's ability to capitalize on the electric vehicle boom. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion), reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aimed at supplying batteries to European automotive clients. The company's expansion into Europe comes amid increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU, which have placed tariffs on EVs made in China. (not investment advice)</p>

As of May 19, the Minnesota fires cover about 30,000 acres, with the Jenkins Creek and Camp House Road fires being managed jointly as the "Brimson Complex." The Camp House Road Fire has destroyed dozens of structures, while the Munger Shaw Fire is nearly 100% contained.

          <p>Manchester United's Europa League final against Tottenham is being described as a crucial moment for the club, with potential financial implications exceeding ¬£100 million. Champions League qualification, the prize for winning the Europa League, is vital for United to generate revenue from tickets, broadcast money, and sponsor bonuses. Failure to win could jeopardize their future in Europe and limit their ability to invest in new players, while success would alleviate financial pressures stemming from the club's debt. While the Champions League benefits apply to both Spurs and United, it is more crucial for United as they have recorded larger annual losses.</p>

          <p>The number of billionaires in the UK has slightly decreased, but their collective wealth continues to rise, according to the UBS Billionaire Ambitions Report. While the UK remains ahead of many European peers, it trails Switzerland and Germany in billionaire rankings, with over two-thirds of UK billionaires being self-made. However, some of the wealthiest residents are relocating abroad due to the abolition of the non-dom tax status, moving to countries such as Switzerland, the UAE, Singapore, and the United States. Globally, billionaire wealth is booming, with Western Europe and the UAE seeing significant increases.</p>

          <p>China attracted a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, defying the challenges posed by President Trump's trade war. This influx contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and the market volatility following Moody's downgrade of the US sovereign credit rating. The changing global investment dynamics are seeing investors move away from US dollar assets, with analysts predicting further foreign investment in Chinese assets.</p>
