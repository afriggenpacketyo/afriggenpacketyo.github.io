          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-21 03:06:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS plans to implement DNA testing for all newborn babies in England to assess their risk of developing hundreds of diseases. This initiative follows an earlier study that analyzed the genetic code of up to 100,000 babies. Health Secretary Wes Streeting believes this gene technology will enable the health service to proactively address illnesses rather than react to them. The 10-year plan aims to alleviate pressure on NHS services by utilizing genomics and AI for early disease detection and personalized healthcare, with funding supporting Genomics England's research database expansion to over 500,000 genomes by 2030, building on recent studies screening newborns for genetic conditions.</p>

          <p>Chinese brands are increasing their presence and popularity in Europe through strategic advertising and sports sponsorships. Xiaomi, for instance, initially struggled with its image but is now planning to open 500 new retail stores outside China this year, particularly in developed markets, aiming for 10,000 stores overseas in the next five years. The company adjusted its retail strategy in France to better align with consumer purchasing behaviors. Slick advertising campaigns and sponsorships have contributed to boosting the fortunes of Chinese brands in the European market, overcoming previous perceptions of lower quality.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Parliament has backed a bill to allow assisted dying in England and Wales, marking a significant social change comparable to the Abortion Act of 1967. The bill will now proceed to the House of Lords, where it is expected to face scrutiny and potential amendments. While opinion polls suggest strong public support for the change, some opponents believe the bill should be called "assisted suicide" or "assisted killing." The government anticipates that hundreds of people will seek an assisted death in the early years, potentially rising to around 4,000 annually after a decade, with preparations underway to implement the legislation effectively.</p>

          <p>Several towns and cities in eastern Germany are offering free stays to attract new residents and combat depopulation. The "trial living" scheme in Guben, for example, provides people with the opportunity to live in the city for up to four weeks without charge. Anika Franze, who now manages the project, moved to Guben after participating in the scheme and appreciates the quiet environment and affordable housing. These initiatives aim to counteract the demographic changes resulting from declining birth rates and emigration, while also addressing the image problem of right-wing extremism in eastern Germany.</p>
