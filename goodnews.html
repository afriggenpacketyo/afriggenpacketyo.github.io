          <p>Best Buy reported stronger-than-expected second-quarter results for fiscal year 2026, showing a modest sales recovery with revenue increasing and comparable sales achieving their highest growth in three years. Despite this positive performance, the company maintained a cautious full-year forecast due to significant uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on consumer purchasing behavior, particularly for appliances and high-value tech items. To mitigate these challenges and spur future growth, Best Buy has launched a new third-party marketplace and implemented strategic, "surgical" price adjustments on some products. The retailer's adjusted earnings per share surpassed analyst predictions, indicating effective operational management amidst external pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced the initial electric vehicles eligible for new grant-based discounts, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Under the scheme, certain EV models, including Ford's Puma Gen-E, qualify for a significant £3,750 reduction, while 26 other models receive a £1,500 discount. This initiative, funded by a £650 million program over three years, seeks to narrow the price gap between electric and traditional vehicles. Despite the push, high upfront costs and insufficient charging infrastructure remain considerable barriers for potential EV buyers, according to the article.</p>

          <p>YouTube TV and Fox have secured a short-term extension in their ongoing carriage agreement dispute, averting an immediate blackout of Fox channels for subscribers. The disagreement centers on payment terms, with YouTube TV asserting Fox demands excessive fees, while Fox accuses Google of leveraging its market influence. This temporary resolution prevents disruption to popular networks like Fox Sports, News, and the Big Ten Network, which were at risk of becoming unavailable. The FCC chairman had publicly urged a resolution, highlighting the importance of access to news and sports. The article notes Fox recently launched its own streaming service, Fox One.</p>

Shorty, who was on tour during Katrina and evacuated to Dallas, reflects on the enduring importance of New Orleans as his home.

          <p>The Mississippi Civil Rights Museum has acquired J.W. Milam's .45 pistol, the weapon used in the brutal 1955 murder of Emmett Till, marking a significant moment in historical preservation. The article reflects on the profound unease the gun evokes and the critical importance of confronting painful pasts, especially as the Trump administration reportedly pressures institutions like the Smithsonian to revise history exhibits.
