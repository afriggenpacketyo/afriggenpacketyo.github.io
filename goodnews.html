          <p>In a recent interview, Jennifer Lopez reflects on her leading role in the new movie musical "Kiss of the Spider Woman," calling it the part she has been waiting for her entire life. She discusses filming during a difficult personal period, noting that her divorce from Ben Affleck was finalized the same month the movie premiered, and describes the experience as a catalyst for necessary personal growth. Lopez also touches on her early career struggles, including sleeping on a bench at a dance studio before her breakthrough. The film is described as a love letter to the Latin and queer communities, using the escapism of movies to tell a powerful story.</p>

          <p>Iraqi President Abdullatif Jamal Rashid has declared that his country is entering a new phase of stability and is now "100% safe" for business and investment. In an interview, he stated that Iraq is focused on rebuilding its infrastructure and wants to strengthen trade and energy partnerships with the United States as U.S. troops begin their final withdrawal. Despite ongoing threats from ISIS cells and Iran-aligned militias, Rashid downplayed concerns about Iranian influence, insisting that Iraq maintains its independence in decision-making. He highlighted the upcoming parliamentary elections as a sign of the nation's democratic stability and progress.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-28 10:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is implementing a new industrial manufacturing model, known as a "pull system," to mass-produce rockets and satellites with the same efficiency and cost-effectiveness as cars. This approach reverses the traditional "push" system, where components are made based on forecasts, often leading to delays and waste. In the new model, final assembly lines will "pull" components from suppliers on an as-needed basis, ensuring consistent quality and flexibility. Chinese researchers believe that mastering this scalable production method will be crucial for dominating the rapidly growing global space industry, which is projected to expand exponentially by 2045.</p>

          <p>As national chain stores continue to close, rising vacancy rates in U.S. shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses. With the national shopping center vacancy rate climbing to 5.8%, landlords are becoming more flexible, allowing independent retailers, wellness practitioners, and service-based businesses to negotiate favorable rents and lease terms in previously unaffordable locations. While overall rents are still increasing, the rate of growth has slowed, providing an opening for entrepreneurs to revitalize these spaces. This trend is fostering a more diverse retail landscape, though experts note the opportunities vary significantly by geographic market.</p>

          <p>Rudy Giuliani has settled a $1.3 billion defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over his false claims about the 2020 presidential election. The terms of the settlement, filed in federal court, are confidential. As Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Giuliani was a prominent figure in spreading baseless conspiracy theories that Dominion's voting machines were manipulated to rig the election against Trump. This marks Dominion's third major settlement related to election lies, following a $787.5 million agreement with Fox News in 2023 and a $67 million settlement with Newsmax, resolving key legal battles over election misinformation.</p>

          <p>David Kaczynski, who turned his brother Ted Kaczynski (the Unabomber) in to the FBI in 1996, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of his brother's bombs in 1987. After Ted's capture, David felt a responsibility to apologize to the victims and reached out to their families, with Wright being one of the few who responded. Over the years, their shared journey of healing has blossomed into a close bond, and they now make joint public appearances to speak about compassion and reconciliation. Their story offers a powerful example of finding peace and humanity in the aftermath of profound violence.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan at the party's annual conference, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. This initiative is central to Labour's ambitious goal of building 1.5 million new homes by 2029. The plan emulates the post-war Labour government's new town developments, aiming to create not just houses but entire communities.</p>

          <p>An expert who has helped hundreds of Americans move abroad addresses six common misconceptions about expatriate life, urging prospective movers to look beyond idealized portrayals. Key myths include the belief that living abroad is always cheap, as housing costs are rising globally, and the fear that Americans are unwelcome, which is often conflated with anti-tourism sentiment. Other debunked ideas are that you will inevitably be lonely, that life abroad is perfect, that your first move must be permanent, and that it's too late in life to relocate. The reality is a complex experience that requires research, patience, and a willingness to adapt to both challenges and rewards.</p>

Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, increased use of automatic sprinkler systems, and safer consumer products like fire-resistant furniture and self-extinguishing cigarettes.
