          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Russian truck drivers involved in transporting equipment used in a recent drone attack on Russian warplanes were unaware of their cargo's true purpose. According to Zelenskyy, the drivers were simply performing their jobs, unaware that the mobile cottages and containers they transported were equipped with drones intended to strike Russian airfields. Ukraine has claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that it damaged over 40 Russian bombers, a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet. Zelenskyy also emphasized that the operation was conducted using only Ukrainian-made weapons, without relying on equipment from allied nations. Ukraine wanted to make sure that the weapons used were made in Ukraine and that the line was clearly drawn as to which nation was responsible.</p>

          <p>Grant Hardin, a former police chief known as the "Devil in the Ozarks," was recaptured nearly two weeks after escaping from an Arkansas prison, where he was serving sentences for murder and sexual assault. Hardin escaped by impersonating a law enforcement officer, but was apprehended a short distance from the Calico Rock prison by Arkansas law enforcement and U.S. Border Patrol agents. Authorities confirmed his identity through fingerprint analysis, assuring the public that there is no longer an active threat. Hardin had been imprisoned since 2017 after pleading guilty to first-degree murder and later being convicted of the 1997 sexual assault of a teacher, crimes detailed in the HBO documentary "Devil in the Ozarks."</p>

Dawson's inclusion reflects England's need for improvement in left-arm spin bowling and a move away from solely relying on pace, recognizing his consistent performance in franchise cricket.

          <p>Milan Kovac, Tesla's vice president of Optimus robotics, announced his departure from the company after joining in 2016. Kovac expressed gratitude to Elon Musk for his mentorship and contributions to his engineering principles.

Kovac previously served as Tesla's director of Autopilot software engineering before leading the Optimus unit. His departure leaves a void in the Optimus division, but the company is expected to continue its development efforts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Welsh rarebit, a beloved national dish of Wales, has varied origin stories, ranging from a poor farmer's substitute for meat to an English joke mocking the Welsh. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves suggests that cheese was a vital part of European diets, especially in Wales, where the dairy industry thrived, and that melted or roasted cheese became popular across all social classes. The name Welsh rarebit appeared later, with early English cookbooks using terms like Welsh rabbit for similar cheese on toast recipes. Rose Geraedts, who runs the International Welsh Rarebit Centre, believes that the dish became popular due to Wales' connection to cheese-making, despite its name being a sarcastic English joke, and it is a dish that many people enjoy.</p>

          <p>Walmart is launching new initiatives to attract younger shoppers, including a fresh advertising campaign, a clothing brand for tweens, and expanded drone deliveries, even as tariffs drive prices higher. CFO John David Rainey stated that tariffs have not changed consumer spending patterns, with shoppers prioritizing groceries over discretionary items. CEO Doug McMillon defended the decision to announce price increases due to tariffs, emphasizing the company's responsibility to communicate with shareholders. The retailer plans to offset cost pressures by selling more higher-margin items, such as apparel and home decor, and believes the new investments can help it win new consumers who have an outdated view of the retailer. Walmart is hoping to change how people perceive the store.</p>

The technology faces hurdles, including public concern following accidents involving self-driving vehicles, and the need for more specific applications like low-speed, last-mile delivery trucks.

          <p>Yoga classes have resumed at a San Diego beach following a federal appeals court ruling that a city ordinance restricting such activities was unconstitutional, deeming the teaching of yoga as ‚Äúprotected speech‚Äù. The court overruled a San Diego judge and sided with instructors who sued over the law banning yoga classes of four or more people at shoreline parks and beaches. The city argued that the rule wasn‚Äôt specific to yoga but commercial activity, as the classes drew donations. A yoga instructor resumed teaching classes, stating that the group was targeted because wealthy homeowners in the area did not want people disturbing their oceanfront views, which has brought the community together.</p>
