          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop following Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar, as the absence of reported casualties raised hopes for de-escalation in the Middle East conflict. U.S. crude oil fell by 7.22% to $68.51 per barrel, while Brent crude decreased by 7.18% to $71.48, reaching their lowest levels since Israel started bombing Iran. Qatar confirmed that its air defenses intercepted the Iranian missiles, resulting in no casualties, further easing concerns about supply disruptions. Energy Secretary Chris Wright credited President Trump's foreign policy for the potential de-escalation, contributing to a more stable outlook. </p>

Manager Dave Roberts emphasized the importance of establishing a solid foundation and erring on the side of caution, with no set timeline for Ohtani to be fully stretched out like a traditional starter. The Dodgers are also considering adjustments to Ohtani's batting order and base-stealing activity to manage his workload effectively. </p>

          <p>As summer 2025 arrives, homeowners may consider using home equity for expenses like vacations or tuition, but should do so strategically. Understanding the differences between home equity loans and HELOCs is crucial, as loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates while HELOCs provide a revolving credit line with variable rates. Shopping around for rates and terms can lead to better offers, and using equity for financially sound purposes like debt consolidation is advisable over discretionary spending. By making informed decisions, homeowners can leverage their equity effectively to improve their financial standing. (not investment advice) </p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a socialist and Queens assemblyman, is running for New York mayor with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America, challenging establishment figures like Andrew Cuomo. Mamdani's campaign emphasizes clear messaging focused on economic issues such as affordable housing and free childcare, while also using high-quality video production to reach wider audiences. His success in mobilizing a grassroots movement offers lessons for the western left in combating economic insecurity and far-right authoritarianism. Despite facing attacks and smears, Mamdani's campaign highlights a strategy for the left to take on the establishment, even in adverse circumstances. </p>
