          <p>Tesla's stock is showing signs of recovery in pre-market trading after a significant drop triggered by a public disagreement between Elon Musk and President Trump. The stock experienced an 18% plunge during trading hours but is now up by 4.5% before the market opens. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives believes the feud was unsettling for investors, emphasizing the mutual need for cooperation between Musk and Trump. Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's long-term prospects, particularly its autonomous technology, suggesting the stock's overselling is an opportunity. Optimism remains high that Tesla's stock will continue to be bullish moving forward. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the U.S. economy added 139,000 jobs in May, exceeding expectations despite concerns about tariffs and a potential economic slowdown. The unemployment rate remained at 4.2%, and worker pay saw greater than expected growth, increasing by 0.4% for the month and 3.9% year-over-year. The healthcare and leisure and hospitality sectors contributed significantly to the job growth, while the government sector experienced job losses due to federal workforce reductions. Despite the positive headline numbers, revisions to previous months' data revealed some underlying weaknesses in the labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has dismissed his public dispute with Elon Musk, stating he is "not particularly" interested in speaking with him following Musk's criticism of Trump's policies. Despite reports of being "bummed" about the fallout, Trump focused on positive economic indicators like decreasing inflation and increasing foreign investment, while mentioning his upcoming visit to China. The exchange was sparked by Musk's disapproval of Trump's tax and immigration bill, leading to accusations and threats from both sides. Musk briefly softened his stance after a user suggested cooling off, retracting his threat to decommission SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft. The White House has called the feud "an unfortunate episode".</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from detaining Yunseo Chung, a Columbia University student and lawful permanent resident, who participated in anti-Israel protests. ICE attempted to arrest Chung in March, but the court has now barred them from doing so without prior approval. The ruling ensures Chung remains free while her legal case proceeds and requires the government to provide 72 hours' notice before any detention attempt not related to deportation. Chung's attorneys argue the government's actions are an assault on her First Amendment rights, while the Trump administration claims her protest activity poses a foreign policy risk.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk initially announced that SpaceX would decommission its Dragon spacecraft after a public fallout with President Trump, who threatened to cancel government contracts with Musk's businesses. However, hours later, Musk reversed his decision following pleas from social media users. NASA relies on SpaceX's Dragon spacecraft to transport astronauts to the International Space Station. The dispute began after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, leading to accusations of "ingratitude" from Musk and claims from Trump that Musk was "wearing thin" in his White House role.</p>

          <p>Wes Anderson's new film, *The Phoenician Scheme*, explores themes of wealth, power, and morality through the story of a tycoon trying to save his fortune. Anderson notes that while the character was initially inspired by old-fashioned European magnates, modern influences, including current political figures, inevitably filtered in. The film follows the tycoon and his estranged daughter as they travel the globe, forcing the protagonist to confront deeper human truths. Anderson emphasizes the film's blend of whimsy and serious subjects, and the evolution of the characters during the writing process.</p>

Despite its discovery in London, large-scale production of the antibiotic had struggled to take hold in Britain.

The documents highlight efforts to boost quantities of the antibiotic, with plans made for casualties from the frontline in France to be brought back to coastal hospitals in Britain for treatment.</p>

          <p>The article explores the corrosive effects of resentment on relationships and provides strategies for addressing it. Resentment stems from broken expectations or feeling inferior, and it often leads to bitterness and contempt. The author recommends communicating needs directly and using "I statements" to express feelings without blaming others. Workplace resentments are more complex due to power imbalances, but it is crucial to address them constructively or seek therapeutic support. It is important to assess the situation and determine if it is worth addressing the issue or letting it go.</p>

Initially motivated by concerns about losing family land and wanting to instill a sense of cultural identity in her children, she joined a hƒÅlau, or hula school, in suburban Washington, D.C. Through learning the dances, chants, and history, she found a deeper understanding of her kuleana, or sacred duty, to honor her ancestors and pass on their stories.
