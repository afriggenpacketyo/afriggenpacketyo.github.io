          <p>Sony Group shares experienced volatile trading, rising approximately 2% after announcing a 250 billion yen share buyback and exceeding operating income estimates. The company's operating income for the last quarter beat analyst expectations but was down 11% from the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit through dividends to shareholders. The company's outlook for the current financial year was lackluster, forecasting only a slight increase in operating profit due to the impact of tariffs, but clarified that this estimate did not reflect the recent trade deal.</p>

          <p>Family offices are struggling to find qualified money managers despite rapid growth in the ultra-rich seeking personalized wealth management services. The talent crunch is attributed to a lack of qualified candidates, selectivity by family offices emphasizing trust, and competition from other financial institutions. Family offices often seek candidates who can combine roles like chief investment officer and CFO, which is difficult to fill. To attract talent, some families are willing to pay a premium, while European family offices are raising compensation packages with bonuses and co-investment opportunities.</p>

          <p>Iranian officials have proposed a joint nuclear-enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to demands that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff during talks in Oman, though Witkoff's spokesman denied the proposal was discussed. The plan involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to Arab countries for civilian use, with representatives from other countries providing oversight. This proposal aims to offer a permanent solution compared to the 2015 nuclear deal, potentially satisfying President Trump's desire for a more lasting agreement.</p>

          <p>U.S. retail egg prices fell in April, marking the first decline in months, but remain near historic highs due to a persistent outbreak of bird flu impacting egg-laying hens. The average price for a dozen Grade A eggs decreased to $5.12 after reaching a record $6.23 in March. Despite the drop, prices are still significantly higher than a year ago, prompting efforts from President Trump and the U.S. Department of Agriculture to stabilize the egg supply through biosecurity measures and increased imports. The antitrust division of the U.S. Department of Justice is also investigating Cal-Maine Foods, the largest U.S. egg producer.</p>

Researchers from the University of Oxford observed the animals dabbing plants on wounds and chewing them up to apply the material to injuries, building on previous discoveries of chimps self-medicating with certain plants. The research adds to the growing evidence that primates use natural medicines in various ways to stay healthy in the wild. The scientists studied footage of a young chimpanzee tending to its mother's wound and found records of chimpanzees helping unrelated animals.</p>
