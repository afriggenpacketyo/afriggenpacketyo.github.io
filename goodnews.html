        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has dropped its criminal case against restaurant company FAT Brands and its chair, Andy Wiederhorn. The indictment, filed in May 2024, included charges of wire fraud and tax evasion related to an alleged $47 million "sham" loan scheme. Wiederhorn, who has consistently maintained his innocence, expressed relief and a desire to focus on the company's growth. The dismissal follows a leadership shake-up at the DOJ, though the company still faces a separate civil complaint from the SEC over the same allegations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. apartment rental market is showing signs of cooling as a surge in new supply pushes vacancy rates to a multi-year high of 7.1% in July. According to a report from Apartment List, this oversupply has stalled rent growth during the peak moving season, with the national median rent remaining flat at $1,402. Rents are down 0.8% year-over-year, with the most significant declines seen in southern and Mountain West cities like Austin, Texas. This shift creates a more favorable market for renters, though macroeconomic uncertainty complicates the long-term outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new bipartisan bill, the "Keep Call Centers in America Act of 2025," aims to protect American jobs and enhance consumer transparency. The proposed legislation would require companies to notify the Department of Labor before offshoring call center jobs and would make those that do so ineligible for certain federal benefits. For consumers, the bill mandates that agents disclose their physical location and whether AI is being used, with an option to transfer to a U.S.-based human representative. The act addresses concerns about job displacement from AI and the security of private information.</p>

          <p>Adult summer camps are experiencing a significant rise in popularity, with search interest increasing by nearly 350% this year according to Yelp. These camps offer adults a chance to disconnect from daily pressures, engage in activities like rock climbing and water sports, and build new friendships. Camp owners attribute the trend to a growing desire for simpler times and a way to combat rising levels of burnout and loneliness. For an average price of around $800, attendees can enjoy a planned weekend experience that fosters community and a sense of nostalgia.</p>

          <p>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has published a letter detailing his vision for artificial intelligence, framing it as a tool for "personal empowerment" rather than just automation. This comes as Meta invests billions to hire top AI talent and establishes a new "Meta Superintelligence Labs" to compete with rivals like OpenAI and Google. Zuckerberg's letter emphasizes a future where superintelligence enhances individual capabilities, a path he sees as distinct from a centralized, automated future. The significant spending echoes Meta's earlier multi-billion dollar pivot to the metaverse, raising investor interest ahead of its earnings report.</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy demonstrated surprising resilience by growing at a 3% annual rate in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' forecasts. This rebound follows a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter and was largely driven by a sharp 30.3% drop in imports, a consequence of the Trump administration's tariffs. Consumer spending also increased by 1.4%, though a key metric for underlying private sector demand showed a slowdown. The strong headline number prompted President Trump to renew his call for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a groundbreaking discovery, scientists have found vibrant communities of chemosynthetic creatures, such as tube worms and clams, at depths of over 31,000 feet in the Pacific Ocean. These ecosystems, located in the Kuril-Kamchatka and Aleutian trenches, do not rely on sunlight but instead derive energy from chemical-rich fluids seeping from the seafloor. The discovery pushes the known depth limit for such life by nearly 25%, revealing an "oasis in the vast desert of the deep sea." The findings expand our understanding of how life can flourish in extreme environments on Earth and potentially elsewhere.</p>

          <p>As the Ethereum network marks its 10th anniversary, its outlook is viewed as increasingly bright, despite its native token, ether, having underperformed in recent years. Growing institutional interest is being driven by new U.S. crypto legislation, the IPO of stablecoin issuer Circle, and a boom in corporate adoption for tokenizing traditional assets. While it has faced competition from faster blockchains like Solana, experts believe Ethereum's core strength of decentralization remains its key advantage. This positions it well to become the foundational platform for the next wave of institutional finance on the blockchain. (not investment advice)</p>

BBC Director-General Tim Davie emphasized the importance of combining the BBC's journalism with the Met Office's scientific intelligence, especially as extreme weather events become more common.
