          <p>Irish boxer Katie Taylor defeated Amanda Serrano for the third time, winning by a controversial majority decision at Madison Square Garden to defend her super lightweight titles. The fight was highly contested, with one judge scoring it a draw while two others favored Taylor, marking another contentious result in their trilogy. Despite the controversy surrounding the scorecards in all three bouts, Taylor celebrated the satisfying victory, solidifying her status as one of the greatest female boxers. Following the win, Taylor improved her record to 25-1 but remained non-committal about her future in the sport, stating she has nothing left to prove.</p>

          <p>Chelsea is set to face Paris Saint-Germain in the Club World Cup final, with manager Enzo Maresca reportedly planning to maintain an ambitious, attacking style rather than a defensive one. Despite PSG's formidable form, Chelsea sees the match as a key opportunity to validate their youth-focused project and progress. The club is pleased with its strategic direction, having returned to the Champions League and invested heavily in young talent and data analytics. While acknowledging the challenge posed by PSG's high-pressure tactics, Chelsea's players express confidence in their own offensive capabilities and are determined to play their own game.</p>

          <p>Poland has finalized a deal for a second batch of 180 South Korean K2 tanks, part of a larger 2022 agreement that will ultimately total nearly 1,000 units. The acquisition highlights Poland's significant military modernization in the face of Russian aggression and cements South Korea's status as a major global arms supplier. As wars in Ukraine and Gaza strain U.S. stockpiles, American allies are increasingly looking to Seoul for advanced weaponry. The deal also includes technology transfer for a Polish variant of the tank, further boosting Warsaw's domestic defense industry and its position as a key NATO frontline state.

          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. The agreement involves licensing fees and compensation, but Google is not taking an equity stake in Windsurf, which remains independent. This move highlights the intense competition for top AI talent among tech giants, with companies like Meta and Microsoft also making high-profile hires and acquisitions. Windsurf, known for its popular 'vibe coding' tools, had previously been in acquisition talks with OpenAI, underscoring the high demand for its technology and personnel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion house Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisans after facing criticism for showcasing sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when Prada presented the footwear at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian cultural origins. Following a social media outcry and calls for recognition from an Indian trade chamber representing 3,000 artisans, Prada engaged in discussions about future collaboration. The chamber hailed the initiative as a potential model for respectful partnership between global fashion brands and traditional communities, and plans to patent the design.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to halt certain Trump administration immigration raids across several Southern California counties, including Los Angeles. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU and other groups, which alleged that federal agents were using unconstitutional tactics like racial profiling. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims and enjoined agents from making stops based solely on factors like race, accent, or presence at specific locations. The decision provides a temporary reprieve for immigrant communities and requires the government to provide detained individuals with access to legal counsel.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that a lawsuit filed by two voice-over artists against AI voice startup Lovo Inc. can move forward. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company unlawfully cloned their voices and used them for commercial purposes after hiring them for work that was supposed to be for internal research only. While the judge dismissed federal copyright claims related to their voices, claims of breach of contract, deceptive business practices, and copyright infringement related to the AI's training data were allowed to proceed. The decision is seen as a significant victory for artists challenging the misuse of their work by AI companies.</p>

          <p>Dozens of Chinese pharmaceutical companies are developing generic versions of popular weight-loss drugs like Ozempic, as the patent for its key ingredient, semaglutide, is set to expire in China next year. This is expected to create a highly competitive market, potentially driving down prices and increasing access for patients with obesity and diabetes. Analysts predict that up to 20 generic drug makers in China will compete for a share of the rapidly growing weight-loss market, which is valued at over $150 billion globally. The development promises more affordable treatment options for patients who currently face high costs for these medications. (not investment advice)</p>

Officials expressed confidence that the investment is crucial for the long-term strength of America's supply chain, despite current drops in container volume at both the Long Beach and Los Angeles ports.

The band's frontman, Ben Schneider, attributes the song's enduring appeal to its relatable theme of wistful reflection on a past relationship. Its slow-burning success is a rare example of a non-hit track finding a massive new life years after its release.</p>
