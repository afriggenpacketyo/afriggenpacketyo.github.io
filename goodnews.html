          <p>Verizon has named former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman as its new chief executive, succeeding Hans Vestberg, who has led the telecommunications company since 2018. Schulman, who has served on Verizon's board since 2018, is credited with significantly growing PayPal's revenue and customer base during his tenure. The leadership change comes as Verizon aims to redefine its strategy, focusing on increasing market share and delivering long-term growth for shareholders, while also finalizing its acquisition of Frontier Communications. Vestberg will remain on the board and serve as a special advisor to ensure a smooth transition.</p>

The acquisition will integrate SciTec's software, which specializes in missile warning, tracking, and defense systems, into Firefly's existing space and launch services. This strategic move follows a recent rocket explosion during a ground test for Firefly but comes as the company continues to secure key government contracts, including one with NASA and a significant investment from Northrop Grumman.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates and more reductions anticipated, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) are becoming a more affordable financing option for homeowners. A new analysis calculates the potential monthly payments for a $150,000 HELOC, showing costs are now lower than in previous months, with a 15-year term costing around $1,424 per month at current rates. The article explains that because HELOCs have variable rates, future Fed cuts could further decrease borrowing costs for homeowners looking to leverage their equity. (not investment advice)</p>

Weiss, a former editor at The New York Times and a vocal critic of mainstream media, is known for her publication's focus on scrutinizing left-leaning culture and its staunchly pro-Israel stance. The move signals a significant shift for CBS News, as Paramount aims to broaden its ideological diversity and appeal to a wider audience, with Weiss expected to shape the network's editorial direction while The Free Press maintains its independent brand.</p>

          <p>Iraq's Supreme Judicial Council announced that over 35,000 individuals have been released from prisons under a comprehensive amnesty law enacted earlier this year. The law, aimed at reducing severe prison overcrowding, covers offenses such as corruption and theft, and even some terrorism-related crimes, though it excludes those convicted of killings. Spearheaded by Sunni lawmakers who claim their community has been unfairly targeted by terrorism charges, the legislation also allows for retrials in cases where confessions may have been coerced, and has resulted in the recovery of over $34 million in restitution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To qualify for a reverse mortgage, senior homeowners typically need to have at least 50% to 60% equity in their property, though this is not a strict FHA rule. The actual amount a homeowner can borrow is not the full equity amount but is instead determined by factors such as the borrower's age, current interest rates, and FHA lending limits. For those who don't meet the equity threshold, options include paying down the existing mortgage, waiting for the home's value to appreciate, or considering a HECM for Purchase to downsize into a new home.</p>
