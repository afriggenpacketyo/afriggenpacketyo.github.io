          <p>HSBC has announced a proposal to take its subsidiary, Hang Seng Bank, private in a deal valuing the latter at over $37 billion. The offer represents a significant premium on Hang Seng's recent average share price, leading its shares to surge nearly 30% while HSBC's shares saw a decline. HSBC's leadership framed the move as a strategic investment to grow both banks and a demonstration of confidence in Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub. The deal aims to resolve governance issues associated with parent-subsidiary double listings and strengthen HSBC's overall presence in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former President Trump announced that Israel and Hamas have reached an agreement on the first phase of a peace plan intended to end the two-year conflict. The deal involves Hamas releasing all remaining hostages in exchange for Israel withdrawing its troops to an agreed-upon line. Mediators from Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey were instrumental in brokering the agreement, which also involves a significant prisoner exchange. While procedural details are still being finalized, the initial steps could see hostages released within days, marking a major diplomatic development in the long-standing war.</p>

          <p>The recently announced ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas could become the most significant diplomatic achievement of Donald Trump's presidency, though many critical details remain unresolved. This initial phase focuses on the exchange of hostages for a limited Israeli military withdrawal, but more contentious issues like the demilitarization of Hamas and the future governance of Gaza have yet to be negotiated. The deal's success hinges on navigating the political pressures faced by both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and Hamas leadership. This article suggests the outcome will heavily depend on Trump's ability to maintain momentum and prevent the fragile agreement from collapsing.</p>

          <p>Derrick Groves, the last of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Parish Justice Center in May, has been captured in Atlanta following a multi-agency manhunt. He was found in the crawl space of a home after a brief standoff with a SWAT team, which used gas canisters to apprehend him without incident. Groves, a convicted murderer facing a life sentence, had been on the run for months. His capture concludes a high-profile case that highlighted significant security and design flaws at the New Orleans jail facility, prompting relief from local law enforcement and the community.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that a collective bid by cities in China's Greater Bay Area, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Shenzhen, to host the Olympic Games presents a unique opportunity for regional integration. The author suggests that co-hosting would do more than just showcase advanced infrastructure; it could foster social cohesion and a shared identity among the distinct communities. By promoting collaboration in sports and enhancing cross-boundary movement, the Olympics could help dismantle cultural barriers. The piece frames the potential bid as a powerful catalyst for unifying the economically dynamic region in a way that transcends commerce.</p>

          <h2>Details of Trump's Proposed 20-Point Gaza Peace Plan Revealed</h2>

          <p>A 20-point peace plan proposed by the Trump administration outlines a phased approach to ending the Israel-Hamas war, beginning with an immediate ceasefire and hostage release. The plan requires Hamas to free all remaining hostages within 72 hours, in exchange for Israel releasing nearly 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and withdrawing troops to an agreed-upon line. Governance of Gaza would be transferred to a temporary, apolitical Palestinian committee overseen by an international board chaired by Trump, with security managed by an Arab-backed stabilization force. The proposal also calls for the complete demilitarization of Gaza and a significant influx of humanitarian aid and economic redevelopment.</p>

          <p>Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, once listed as a persistently dangerous school with declining enrollment, has undergone a remarkable transformation by integrating debate into every academic class. Principal Benjamin Honoroff, a former debate coach, implemented the strategy, which has led to significant increases in test scores, enrollment, and student engagement. The school's debate team recently won a national championship, highlighting the program's success. The approach encourages students to explain their reasoning in all subjects, from math to English, which has deepened their conceptual understanding and academic performance.</p>

          <p>Priscilla, which had briefly reached hurricane strength, has been downgraded to a tropical storm as it moves parallel to Mexico's Baja California Sur peninsula. The storm is bringing high surf and gusty winds to the region, prompting a tropical storm watch for the area from Cabo San Lucas to Cabo San Lazaro. Forecasters expect Priscilla to continue weakening over the next two days as it remains offshore. However, authorities are warning that large swells generated by the storm are likely to cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the coast.</p>

          <p>Terri Lesley, a former library director in Campbell County, Wyoming, who was fired amid a contentious dispute over books with LGBTQ+ and sexual content, has won a $700,000 settlement.

          <p>Manchester United defender Maya Le Tissier continues to build a strong case for a starting position on the England national team after another commanding performance, including scoring the winning penalty in the club's Champions League debut. Despite being one of the most consistent defenders in the Women's Super League and holding the record for consecutive appearances, she has received limited playing time for the Lionesses. With key injuries to England's defense, many believe it is time for the 23-year-old, described by her club manager as a "rock," to be given a significant opportunity on the international stage.</p>
