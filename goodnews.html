          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words in the past year, many of which originated from internet culture and social media trends. Terms such as "skibidi," "delulu" (short for delusional), and "tradwife" are among the new entries, reflecting the evolving nature of the English language. Lexicographers noted that they only add words they believe will have lasting power and significance. The inclusion of these words highlights how online discourse and celebrity culture are increasingly shaping mainstream vocabulary and communication.</p>

          <p>Conservative media network Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims aired about the 2020 presidential election. This settlement follows a similar, larger agreement between Fox News and Dominion in 2023. A Delaware judge had previously ruled that Newsmax did defame the voting technology company, leaving a jury to decide only on the issue of malice and damages. Despite the settlement, Newsmax maintained in a statement that its coverage was fair and balanced, highlighting the ongoing legal and financial fallout from election-related misinformation.</p>

However, when combined, European nations have collectively spent more, totaling around $165.7 billion. The article clarifies that aid from both the U.S. and Europe has consisted of a mixture of grants and loans, addressing claims made during recent diplomatic talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The US Open's mixed doubles tournament has been revamped this year, featuring a condensed schedule, increased prize money, and a star-studded lineup of top singles players. Pairings like Carlos Alcaraz with Emma Raducanu and Novak Djokovic with Olga Danilovic have generated significant buzz for an event often overlooked. While the changes have excited many fans and singles players, they have drawn criticism from doubles specialists who were largely excluded due to the entry criteria favoring singles rankings. The new format is seen as a business-driven move by the USTA to boost the event's profile.</p>

          <p>New research published in JAMA Network Open reveals that the availability of over-the-counter birth control pills is successfully reaching its target demographic. The study found that nearly a third of people who obtained the pill without a prescription had previously been using no method of contraception at all. An even larger portion, 41%, switched from less effective methods like condoms. These findings suggest that removing the prescription barrier is a powerful tool for improving reproductive autonomy and access to care, particularly for younger, uninsured, and rural individuals who face the greatest obstacles.</p>

          <p>An investment advice column highlights the power of dividend reinvestment plans, or DRIPs, as a simple yet effective strategy for wealth accumulation. By automatically using stock dividends to purchase more shares of the same stock, investors can harness the power of compound interest over the long term. The article uses the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) as an example, showing its total return was significantly higher with dividends reinvested compared to its price return alone over a decade. While not suitable for those needing dividend income for expenses, DRIPs offer a passive way to ensure investment returns are continuously working to generate further growth.
