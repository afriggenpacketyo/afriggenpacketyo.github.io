          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez have commenced their wedding festivities in Venice, Italy, drawing a host of high-profile celebrities. Guests including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Kim Kardashian attended a reception on Thursday ahead of the main ceremony. The large-scale event, with around 200 guests expected, has not been without controversy, sparking protests from some Venice locals concerned about the impact of tourism and high-profile events on the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos and S√°nchez, who both divorced their previous spouses in 2019 before their relationship became public.</p>

          <p>Chinese electronics company Xiaomi saw its shares surge to a record high following the successful launch of its new electric SUV, the YU7. The vehicle is priced to directly compete with Tesla's Model Y in China, starting at 10,000 yuan cheaper and receiving over 200,000 orders within three minutes of its launch. While the YU7 is touted as superior to the Model Y on several metrics, it reportedly falls short on driver-assist technology. The launch is part of Xiaomi's aggressive push into the competitive EV market and was accompanied by the release of other tech products, including AI-connected glasses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced it is retiring the infamous "Blue Screen of Death," a notorious error message that has been a part of the Windows operating system for over four decades. The company will replace the blue background with a black one and streamline the displayed text to be more condensed. This change is part of a broader initiative to improve the resilience of Windows and help users recover more quickly from unexpected system restarts. The new, simplified error screen is scheduled to be rolled out to all Windows 11 devices later this summer, marking the end of a well-known, and often frustrating, era in personal computing history.</p>

          <p>The White House has indicated that President Donald Trump may extend the 90-day pause on his reciprocal tariff scheme, which is set to expire in early July. A spokesperson stated the deadline is "not critical" and that an extension is possible, a decision that rests with the president. This comes as Japan's top tariff negotiator arrived in Washington for another round of talks, aiming to secure concessions on the higher duties. The pause applies to country-specific tariffs on about 60 trading partners, including an additional 14% on Japan, but does not affect the baseline 10% duty on global imports.

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers made a series of trades to move up in the second round of the NBA draft, ultimately acquiring 6-foot-8 Arkansas forward Adou Thiero with the 36th pick. To secure the pick, the Lakers first traded their 55th pick and cash to the Chicago Bulls for the 45th pick, then sent that pick and more cash to the Minnesota Timberwolves. Thiero is viewed by the team as a highly athletic wing player who can address a need for athleticism alongside Luka Doncic. In other team news, guard Austin Reaves reportedly declined a four-year, $89 million maximum contract extension offer from the team.</p>

          <p>A large, bright meteor, known as a fireball, was witnessed streaking across the daytime sky over the southeastern U.S. before exploding above Georgia. The event generated a pressure wave that created audible booms heard by residents on the ground. According to NASA, the meteor was about three feet in diameter, weighed over a ton, and released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT upon explosion. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the sighting. Experts suggest the fireball may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, making it a rare and spectacular daytime celestial event.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Chelsea, Massachusetts, a city particularly vulnerable to the urban heat island effect, a local environmental group is testing solutions on a single "cool block." The project, led by GreenRoots, involves planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter, heat-reflecting colors, and painting rooftops white to reduce heat absorption. These measures are designed to combat the dangerously high temperatures found in dense, less-green urban areas, which can be up to 20 degrees hotter than surrounding leafy suburbs. This urban laboratory provides a potential template for other cities looking for practical ways to mitigate extreme heat as climate change intensifies.</p>

Fito, leader of the "Los Choneros" gang and wanted in both Ecuador and the U.S., was found hiding in the basement of a house in his hometown of Manta. His escape in early 2024 triggered a wave of extreme violence across Ecuador, including riots, kidnappings, and an armed attack on a TV station. His recapture is a major victory for President Daniel Noboa's government, which has declared war on the country's powerful criminal gangs.</p>

The scheme involved channeling money through his mother and a close friend.
