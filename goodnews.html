The energy company has seen a surge in orders from hyperscalers, with $900 million in electrical equipment orders from the sector this year, up from $600 million in all of 2024. While GE Vernova's third-quarter results beat expectations, its stock fell as the company did not raise its 2025 forecast, though Wall Street remains optimistic about its role in powering the AI boom.

          <p>Newly appointed Nottingham Forest manager Sean Dyche stated that winning games is more important than adhering to a specific fashionable style of play. Taking over a team in the relegation zone, Dyche emphasized the need to play "effective football" to stabilize the club's situation in the Premier League. His philosophy marks a shift from his predecessor, Ange Postecoglou, whose focus on expansive, attacking football failed to produce results. Dyche aims to build on the team's past successes while instilling a practical, winning mentality.</p>
