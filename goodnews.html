          <p>A growing number of young adults in Europe are seeking ways to reduce their smartphone usage, with a British survey indicating that almost half would prefer a world without the internet. A Dutch startup, The Offline Club, organizes smartphone-free meetups to encourage real-world interactions. Studies show that many young people feel worse after spending time on social media and desire digital curfews.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform UK has pledged to fully reinstate winter fuel payments to pensioners and scrap the two-child benefit cap. This move is intended to appeal to left-leaning voters and pressure the Labour government, which has also faced calls to address these issues. Reform UK plans to fund these policies by cutting net-zero projects and ending the use of hotels for asylum seekers. The commitments highlight divisions within Labour regarding welfare policies.</p>

          <p>The World Exposition in Osaka is facing a challenge with swarms of midges causing distress to visitors. The small flies are found on walls and pillars, with visitors struggling to avoid swallowing them. While these midges do not bite, the dead ones can cause asthma and allergic reactions if inhaled. The expo organizer is spraying insecticide and installing insect repellent lights to combat the problem, and the Osaka governor has sought assistance from an insecticide maker.</p>
