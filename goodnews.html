          <p>The UK government is preparing to announce its spending plans for the next four years, and the BBC interviewed several residents with varying income levels about their priorities. A young delivery driver earning ¬£850 a month wants better job opportunities for young people, while a couple earning ¬£52,500 seeks more childcare support. Another couple with a ¬£71,000 income advocates for more apprenticeships and lower rail fares, and a woman living on ¬£700 a month through Universal Credit emphasizes the need for stronger welfare support. A well-off GP earning ¬£96,000 suggests subsidizing fresh produce, while a pensioner living on ¬£20,000 a year believes the government should focus on saving money. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Eurostar is planning to introduce direct train services from London to Frankfurt and Geneva by the early 2030s, investing around ‚Ç¨2 billion in a new fleet of up to 50 trains. The firm anticipates travel times of approximately five hours to Frankfurt and five hours and 20 minutes to Geneva. However, the expansion hinges on securing sufficient depot space in east London, which is also being sought by rival companies. The Office of Rail and Road is currently reviewing proposals to determine how the depot space will be allocated, a decision that could significantly impact Eurostar's expansion plans. The company hopes to provide additional options for passengers traveling across Europe.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has proposed selling U.S.-made cars in Japan through its domestic dealership network to support trade negotiations between Japan and the United States. Chairman Akio Toyoda informed Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba of Toyota's willingness to sell vehicles manufactured by U.S. automakers through its extensive network of over 4,000 stores in Japan. This proposal aims to help narrow the U.S. trade deficit, a key concern for President Donald Trump, and potentially ease tariff pressures. Japan has been affected by Trump's tariffs on automobiles and is seeking concessions through ongoing ministerial-level talks. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in California has ruled that the Trump administration cannot enforce executive orders that would block grant funding to LGBTQ+ groups based on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies or acknowledgement of transgender individuals. Judge Jon Tigar stated that the executive orders reflected an effort to censor constitutionally protected speech and services. The ruling favored pro-LGBTQ+ nonprofits who argued that the orders violated the Constitution. Lawyers for the government argued that the president is permitted to align government funding with his policies, but the judge's order will remain in effect while the legal case continues, though an appeal is likely. </p>

The solution is simple: mix 1 part refined white sugar with 4 parts water, and clean the feeder every two to three days with hot water or a vinegar solution. </p>
