          <p>Former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha lauded the new Champions League format, highlighting the exciting and unpredictable nature of the competition after PSG's win. He noted that teams playing each other only once added a unique dynamic, allowing lesser teams to showcase their energy and skill. Journalist Nicky Bandini emphasized that the format allowed PSG to develop throughout the season, providing a more entertaining journey for viewers. The article suggests that the new format benefits teams by allowing them to find form at the right time, as demonstrated by PSG's late resurgence and eventual triumph.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. The incident occurred early Friday morning, causing the hives to come off the truck and release the bees. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area and stay at least 600 feet away. Beekeepers assisted in the rescue effort, aiming to re-hive as many bees as possible. By Saturday, the hive boxes were recovered and restored, and most bees were expected to return to their hives.</p>
