          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms that the court has shifted politically and is enabling an expansion of executive power. She asserted that she decides cases based on legal questions rather than political labels and must tune out external criticism from both the right and left. Discussing her new book, "Listening to the Law," Barrett reflected on the Dobbs decision, stating it returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process, and refrained from commenting on specific pending cases regarding presidential powers, emphasizing the need for a judge to maintain an open mind until a case is fully presented.</p>

          <p>Comedian Nate Bargatze, currently the country's highest-grossing stand-up comic, reflects on his career trajectory from dropping out of community college to selling out arenas. In a recent interview, he discussed his commitment to family-friendly, "clean" comedy, a style he feels is a calling that allows him to maintain the trust of a broad audience. Bargatze, who recently hosted "Saturday Night Live" and is set to host the Primetime Emmy Awards, also shared his ambitions beyond stand-up, including acting and developing a family-oriented theme park in his hometown of Nashville. He views his work as part of a larger purpose, guided by his faith.</p>

          <p>Two winning tickets have been sold for the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest prize in the game's history. The winning tickets were purchased in Missouri and Texas, ending a three-month period without a grand prize winner. The winning numbers drawn were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The jackpot had grown after 41 consecutive drawings failed to produce a winner, with this drawing setting a new record for the longest streak. Winners can choose between an annuitized prize paid over 29 years or a lump sum cash payment estimated at $826.4 million before taxes.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 09:15:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed a breakthrough method for removing microplastics from wastewater using a specially engineered hydrogel. This innovative material acts as an autonomous shuttle, sinking to collect microplastic particles from deep water and then floating back to the surface where the pollutants can be treated and removed. The hydrogel's movement is self-regulating, driven by its own chemical properties as it captures and releases gas, creating a continuous purification cycle. Researchers believe this buoyancy-driven system is broadly adaptable and could be used to remediate other environmental threats beyond microplastics, opening new pathways for sustainable pollution removal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Eagles women's rugby team has been eliminated from the World Cup despite a commanding 60-0 victory against Samoa. Their fate was sealed when Australia held England to a 47-7 score, allowing the Wallaroos to advance to the quarter-finals on a superior points differential. While disappointed, the team's performance highlighted the emergence of promising young talent who are expected to be central to the squad's future. Players like 22-year-old flanker Freda Tafuna, who scored four tries against Samoa, represent a bright future for American rugby, signaling growing strength from the U.S. college system and new domestic leagues.</p>

          <h2>Pediatrician Emphasizes Healthy Sleep Habits as Key to a Child's Future Success</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleeping habits is the most critical action new parents can take to foster their children's long-term health and success. Known as "sleep hygiene," these practices are foundational for a baby's physical, mental, and emotional development, impacting everything from cognitive function to emotional regulation later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with white noise and swaddling, rather than complete silence. He also suggests that routines should be flexible and that non-breastfeeding partners can play a key role in settling the baby, helping to build resilient sleep patterns from infancy.</p>

          <h2>Commentary Argues Solar Power Aligns with Conservative and Prepper Ideals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 09:00:22 EDT</div>

          <p>This opinion article posits that solar energy should be embraced by right-wing preppers and conservatives, not for environmental reasons, but for its alignment with principles of self-sufficiency and independence. While fossil fuels require complex, vulnerable supply chains, a solar panel and battery system offers a resilient, long-term power source that is disconnected from any grid, making it ideal for surviving societal disruptions. The author argues that solar power is the ultimate energy for hyper-individualists, providing a simple, durable, and decentralized source of power that makes a home a true, defensible castle. The piece calls for bipartisan support to reduce regulatory hurdles for solar installation.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, he addressed reports of friction with his former NFL team, confirming he has banned New England Patriots scouts from attending UNC practices. Belichick stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their staff is not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure. The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss to TCU, with Belichick noting a higher level of determination from his team.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Continued Use of Coal Power Serves as a 'Shock Absorber' for Renewable Energy Grid</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that China's strategy of expanding coal power capacity is not a reversal of its climate policy but rather a pragmatic approach to support its massive renewable energy rollout. While China is adding record amounts of solar power, its grid faces challenges with curtailment, where clean energy is generated but cannot be used, and instability from intermittent sources like hydropower. In this context, coal plants function as a crucial backup or "shock absorber," ensuring grid stability during peak demand and preventing blackouts. This allows grid operators the confidence to continue connecting unprecedented levels of new renewables without risking the energy supply.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vinted, the popular online marketplace for secondhand clothing, originated from a simple problem faced by co-founder Milda Mitkutė: too many clothes and not enough space after moving to a smaller apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly developed a website to sell her unwanted items, which rapidly gained popularity through word of mouth. Despite early mistakes, such as initially forgetting a "buy" button and a failed attempt to add commission fees, the platform expanded internationally. The company, which focuses on sustainability by extending the life of clothing, eventually became Lithuania's first tech unicorn, now valued at over a billion dollars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the recent $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, a data analysis shows how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize due to varying state tax laws. While all winnings are subject to a 37% federal tax, some states impose additional income taxes, while others do not. States like California, Florida, and Texas do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep the most money. In contrast, states with high income taxes, such as New York, would see the lowest after-tax payout. This breakdown highlights the considerable financial difference for winners depending on where the lucky ticket was purchased. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England cricketer Jacob Bethell has admitted that he probably should have played more domestic cricket during a challenging first home summer in the international setup. The 21-year-old all-rounder, who made a strong impression during his debut Test series last winter, found himself in a limited role this season. After missing a Test against Zimbabwe due to his IPL commitments, he lost his spot in the starting XI and only returned for the final match against India. Bethell acknowledged that the lack of consistent playing time was a learning experience and that he is now looking forward to a busy schedule of upcoming matches.</p>
