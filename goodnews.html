          <p>Romania is holding a re-run of its presidential election after the original November vote was annulled by the courts due to irregularities and allegations of Russian interference. The annulled vote saw far-right, pro-Russian candidate Calin Georgescu surprisingly win the first round, prompting an investigation into his campaign's financing and organization. George Simion, a Georgescu ally from the hard-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR), is expected to progress to a second-round run-off. The decision to annul the election and ban Georgescu from the re-run was criticized by US Vice President JD Vance and US President Donald Trump's advisor Elon Musk, as well as the Kremlin which has publicly supported Georgescu's candidacy.</p>

          <p>China's Canton Fair, the country's oldest and largest trade exhibition, is experiencing a significant increase in foreign buyers, with over 200,000 attendees from various corners of the globe. This surge in international participation comes as rapidly intensifying tariffs from the US are throwing the established trade order into disarray, making the presence of American buyers seem less prominent compared to previous fairs. Organizers and exporters are reportedly focused on providing premium service to overseas buyers, with language support available in Spanish, Russian, and Arabic. The fair highlights China's efforts to diversify its trade relationships amid ongoing trade tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>Nigel Farage's ambition to become prime minister is gaining credibility following Reform UK's recent electoral successes, shaking up the UK's political landscape. Reform UK won its first parliamentary by-election and mayoral race, signaling a potential shift in the two-party system. While Labour focuses on proving its effectiveness in government, the Conservatives face the challenge of remaining relevant, as Reform UK gains traction by tapping into public disillusionment with the traditional parties. Reform's success has prompted politicians in both major parties to consider the depth of public dissatisfaction with the political system and the need to address it effectively.</p>

Increased scrutiny of property deals and geopolitical friction are discouraging some buyers, leading them to seek friendlier investment alternatives.
