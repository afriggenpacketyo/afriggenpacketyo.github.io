          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder Jacob Young made a remarkable catch against the New York Mets, securing a crucial out in the fifth inning. After tracking a deep fly ball, Young collided with the wall, juggling the ball off his glove before kicking it back into the air with his foot to complete the catch. The play stunned the crowd and impressed his teammates, contributing to the Nationals' narrow 3-2 victory. The win was a setback for the Mets, who are currently competing for a National League Wildcard playoff spot.</p>

This marks the first trip by House of Representatives members to China since 2019 and is part of an effort to re-establish military contacts, which were severed by Beijing in 2022. The U.S. lawmakers emphasized the need to recalibrate diplomatic, economic, and security relations.

          <p>Sociologist Christina Cross's new book, "Inherited Inequality," examines the outcomes of Black children raised in two-parent households, challenging a long-held policy assumption that marriage is a primary solution to racial inequality. Her research reveals that these children still face significant disadvantages compared to their white counterparts from similar family structures, and fare only about as well as white children from single-parent homes. Cross argues that the singular focus on promoting two-parent families overlooks the impact of structural racism and diverts resources from more effective interventions, such as direct cash assistance and child care subsidies.</p>

          <p>Build-A-Bear Workshop is experiencing significant growth, with its stock up roughly 60% year-to-date, defying broader retail downturns caused by tariffs and declining mall traffic. The company's success is attributed to its strategic focus on "kidulting," marketing nostalgic experiences to adults who grew up with the brand. By diversifying its locations beyond malls and planning ahead for tariff impacts, the company posted record revenue in the first half of the fiscal year. Analysts note that its constantly evolving product line also allows for discreet price increases, further bolstering its financial performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chicago Bears quarterback Caleb Williams delivered a standout performance, leading his team to a 31-14 victory against the Dallas Cowboys. After an inconsistent start to the season, Williams connected with coach Ben Johnson's offensive strategy, throwing for four touchdowns with no sacks. A key moment was a 65-yard flea-flicker pass to Rome Odunze, the longest completed pass of the season so far. While the Cowboys' defense is currently struggling, the game provided a much-needed glimpse of hope for the Bears franchise and its long-suffering fans.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is facing significant opposition from the city's wealthiest residents and real estate developers, who are actively trying to block his path to victory. Fearing his proposals to freeze rent and increase taxes on the top 1%, powerful donors are spending millions to support his opponent, former governor Andrew Cuomo. Despite this financial push, which included a meeting to "plot his path to City Hall," polls show Mamdani holding a commanding lead. The situation highlights a clash between grassroots progressive support and established financial interests in the city's politics.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While both exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds offer diversified investment baskets, they have key differences in trading, tax efficiency, and cost. ETFs trade like stocks throughout the day, whereas mutual funds are priced once at the end of the day. A significant advantage for ETFs is their tax efficiency, as their "in-kind" transaction structure rarely generates the capital gains taxes that are common with mutual funds held in taxable accounts. Furthermore, ETFs generally have lower annual expense ratios, making them a cheaper option for many investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A survey by Citi Private Bank reveals that investment firms for the ultra-wealthy, known as family offices, are optimistic about their returns for 2025, with many anticipating gains between 5% and 10% or more. These firms continue to favor direct investments in private companies, particularly those aligned with long-term trends like AI and new infrastructure. However, their enthusiasm has cooled slightly since last year, and they are showing less interest in seed or early-stage funding, preferring the perceived safety of growth-stage investments.

          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion, privately-financed plan to bring Gatwick Airport's northern runway into regular use, effectively creating a second runway. The government and proponents argue the expansion will create thousands of jobs, boost economic growth, and offer more flight choices at lower costs for travelers. However, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental groups and local communities concerned about increased noise, pollution, and climate impacts. The project aims to increase the airport's flight capacity from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 annually.</p>

          <p>Climate activist Bill McKibben argues in his new book that despite the bleak political landscape under a second Trump administration, there is reason for optimism about climate change. The key driver is economics: solar and wind are now the cheapest energy sources globally, and their adoption is accelerating rapidly, particularly in places like California and even Texas. While the Trump administration's policies are ceding leadership in green technology to China, the sheer cost-effectiveness and local benefits of renewables are creating a powerful momentum that can outrun political opposition.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party is calling for mandatory, cigarette-style health warnings on social media apps to alert young users to the potential risks to their mental health. Citing concerns over "addictive algorithms," the party also proposes a two-hour daily cap on "doomscrolling" through short-form video feeds for individuals under 18. The proposal aims to protect children from issues like anxiety, sleep disruption, and shortened attention spans linked to excessive social media use. This move is part of a broader political discussion in the UK about regulating technology to ensure online safety for minors.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved an implantable device that treats rheumatoid arthritis by stimulating the vagus nerve, offering a new option for patients who do not respond to drugs. The device, made by SetPoint Medical, sends electrical pulses to the nerve for one minute each day, which signals the brain and spleen to reduce the production of inflammatory proteins. In clinical trials, the treatment provided meaningful improvement for a significant portion of patients with severe, drug-resistant arthritis. This approval marks a potential turning point for bioelectronic medicine in treating autoimmune diseases.</p>
