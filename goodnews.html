          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has announced that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to protect players from high temperatures. This decision follows concerns raised during the current Club World Cup in the US, where conditions were described as dangerous. Infantino highlighted that venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver will be prioritized for daytime kick-offs. He also declared the revamped 32-team Club World Cup a major financial success, generating over $2 billion in revenue and marking the start of a "golden era of global club football."</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Świątek achieved a decisive victory in the Wimbledon women's final, defeating American Amanda Anisimova with a rare 6-0, 6-0 scoreline in under an hour. This historic win marks only the second "double bagel" in a Wimbledon final during the Open era and makes Świątek the first Polish singles champion at the tournament. The match was a significant moment for Anisimova as well, who was the first American woman to reach the final since 2019 after taking a break from tennis for mental health reasons. Świątek graciously praised her opponent's performance throughout the tournament during the trophy ceremony.</p>

          <p>The British and Irish Lions rugby team is finalizing its lineup for the first Test against Australia, with several key positions still under consideration. An injury to center Garry Ringrose has opened an opportunity for Scotland's Huw Jones, who delivered a standout performance in a recent tour match. Coach Andy Farrell faces difficult choices, particularly in the back-row, where Jac Morgan has been highly impressive. The recent arrival of Owen Farrell adds another layer of intrigue, with the veteran fly-half likely to secure a spot on the bench after a strong cameo appearance, his first since early May.</p>

          <p>Milwaukee Brewers' pitching prospect Jacob Misiorowski has been named a Major League Baseball All-Star after just five career games, a move that has generated significant debate. The 23-year-old, known for his 103-mph fastball, has been impressive in his limited starts, but his selection is the fastest for any player making their first All-Star team. While some commend MLB for promoting a young star, many critics argue the spot was unearned. They point to more established pitchers like Philadelphia's Christopher Sanchez, who has a lower ERA over many more starts but was not selected for the prestigious game.</p>

          <p>The Wahlburgers restaurant chain has closed 79 locations this year, but the company's CEO, Randy Sharpe, has clarified that the move is not a sign of financial distress. The closures are primarily due to the end of a franchise agreement with the Hy-Vee grocery store chain, which involved small food court kiosks rather than full-service restaurants. Sharpe emphasized that the decision reflects a strategic pivot towards ensuring quality over quantity and maintaining strong partnerships. To reinforce its brand, Wahlburgers recently updated its menu with new summer-themed items, signaling a focus on continued innovation and growth.</p>

          <p>Amid rising trade war uncertainty, companies are increasingly using U.S. Customs-sanctioned Foreign Trade Zones (FTZs) and bonded warehouses to delay or reduce the financial impact of tariffs.

This strategy helps preserve cash flow and provides flexibility in a volatile trade environment. However, a recent executive order by President Trump has eliminated the "inverted tariff" benefit for FTZs, which previously allowed companies to pay a lower duty rate on the finished product.
