        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index indicates a 1.5% decrease in used vehicle prices from April to May, although prices remain 4% higher than the previous year. This shift follows a period of heightened consumer demand driven by fears of tariff-related price increases. Retail prices have not declined as rapidly as wholesale prices, and changes in new vehicle prices, production, and demand indirectly impact the used car market. Despite the recent dip, inventory levels remain low compared to historical averages due to consumers holding onto their vehicles longer and reduced production in recent years.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study suggests that fecal transplants may introduce unintended health risks by allowing microbes to hijack the host environment. Researchers found that "mismatches" between donor fecal matter and the recipient's gut could negatively impact immune and metabolic function. The study, conducted in mice, human tissue samples, and a small volunteer group, indicates that microbes can "terraform" the intestinal tract. Experts recommend greater care in designing fecal transplants to target specific microbes for the intestines, and further research is needed to assess the potential negative health outcomes of fecal transplants.</p>
