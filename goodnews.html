          <p>New York-listed shares of Canada Goose saw a significant 15% surge in premarket trading following reports that its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, has received bids to take the company private. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have reportedly submitted verbal offers, valuing the winter-clothing maker at approximately $1.35 billion. Bain Capital, advised by Goldman Sachs, is currently holding off on a decision, anticipating additional offers to roll in. This development highlights a potential major shift in the company's ownership structure and has provided a substantial boost to its current market valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Workers at BlueOval SK, a nearly $6 billion joint venture between Ford Motor Co. and SK On producing electric vehicle batteries in Kentucky, are currently voting on whether to join the United Auto Workers (UAW). This crucial decision tests organized labor's expanding influence in the American South, following recent UAW victories at other EV battery plants in Tennessee and Ohio. Pro-union workers highlight the importance of guaranteed pay, benefits, and improved on-the-job safety, while the company prefers to maintain direct employee relationships. The outcome is significant for both the UAW's strategic growth and the future labor landscape of the rapidly developing domestic EV battery production industry.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in overall sales growth during its fiscal second quarter, with its namesake brand's sales falling 5%. However, the company's teen-focused Hollister brand significantly outperformed, achieving a 19% sales increase, its best-ever second-quarter growth. Despite narrowly beating Wall Street expectations, the company raised its full-year revenue outlook but tightened its earnings forecast, partly due to increased net tariff costs, nearly double previous estimates. This article notes Abercrombie's strategic shift into new categories and partnerships, like with the NFL, to maintain relevance and growth amidst a challenging retail environment.

          <p>After a period of uncertainty, a key indicator of commercial real estate (CRE) activity, JLL's global Bid Intensity Index, improved in July for the first time this year.

The improvement is attributed to resilient property sector fundamentals and stable asset valuations, despite earlier weaker investor sentiment.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In Pakistan's remote Chitral district, families continue the ancient practice of "chiro bash," or junior right, where the youngest son inherits the family home. This custom, also known as ultimogeniture, ensures parents are cared for in their old age and promotes family continuity, contrasting with Western primogeniture. While older siblings typically seek their fortunes elsewhere, the article notes the practice can cause friction, particularly among women who may prefer Shariah-based inheritance laws. However, with increasing urbanization and modern aspirations, the long-standing tradition faces growing pressure and an uncertain future.</p>
