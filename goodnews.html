          <p>Singapore's inflation rate eased to a cooler-than-expected 0.6% in July, marking its lowest point since January 2021, with core inflation also dipping to 0.5%. This moderation in price pressures occurs as the city-state prepares for an anticipated growth slowdown later in the year. The Monetary Authority of Singapore has already adjusted its monetary policy twice this year to mitigate the impact of weaker global trade and rising trade tensions. The article notes that a baseline 10% reciprocal tariff from the Trump administration on Singapore's exports to the U.S. is a contributing factor to the economic outlook. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of China's state-backed Dongfeng Motor Group skyrocketed to an eight-year high after its parent company announced plans to take the automaker private, reportedly valuing it at about $7 billion. This strategic move aligns with a directive from China's State Council to consolidate and enhance the competitiveness of major state-owned carmakers. The Wuhan-based company is also preparing to spin off and list its electric-vehicle unit, VOYAH, in Hong Kong. Despite a nearly 15% drop in overall vehicle deliveries in the first half of 2025, sales of pure electric and plug-in hybrid models climbed significantly, making up roughly a quarter of total deliveries.

          <p>Asian stock markets experienced a significant surge on Monday, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index climbing over 2% and nearing a four-year high, driven primarily by Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish signals. His remarks at the Jackson Hole conference indicated a potential easing of monetary policy next month, boosting investor confidence. The tech sector was a key contributor to Hong Kong's gains, alongside strong performances from Chinese property developers. Analysts at Goldman Sachs suggest that maturing time deposits could shift into equities, sustaining momentum and potentially triggering a capital rotation from the U.S. to China, further fueling market gains.

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani demonstrated an unexpected and memorable act of sportsmanship by high-fiving a persistent heckler after hitting his 45th home run of the season. The unique interaction occurred during the ninth inning of the game against the San Diego Padres, which the Dodgers ultimately won 8-2. Ohtani, celebrated as a "unicorn" in MLB for his elite dual pitching and hitting abilities, joined the Dodgers with a record $700 million deal. This spontaneous gesture, described as "very out of character" by his manager, showcased Ohtani's engaging personality amidst the intense rivalry between the two teams.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its strongest level in over nine months, a direct response to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's dovish remarks. Powell's comments at the closely watched Jackson Hole conference hinted at a potential interest rate cut in September, signaling a shift in the Fed's stance against easing. This dovish pivot has led to increased market bets on rate cuts, causing the U.S. dollar index to fall to a four-week low and the offshore yuan to climb significantly. The article indicates that markets have "almost locked in" a September rate cut. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, has formed southeast of Bermuda and is slowly gaining strength. Located about 320 miles east of Bermuda, it currently has maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and is moving north-northeast. Forecasters predict Fernand will continue to strengthen through Monday before likely beginning to weaken late Monday or Tuesday. The storm is expected to remain over the open ocean, posing no immediate threat of landfall. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which formed in a similar area earlier in August.</p>

          <p>The airline industry is on the cusp of a major transformation in its booking systems, moving from traditional reservation models to modern digital retail experiences akin to Amazon or Spotify. Companies like Flyr are developing "offer and order management" systems to allow for flexible "shopping cart" functionality, enabling passengers to customize bookings with different seat classes, luggage, and even ancillary services like hotels and car rentals. Saudi Arabia's Riyadh Air will launch as the world's first "digitally native" airline without legacy passenger service system technology. This shift aims to personalize offers, enhance customer experience, and increase airline revenue.</p>
