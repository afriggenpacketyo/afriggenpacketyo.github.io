        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement as a condition for receiving certain emergency preparedness grants. The decision sides with 20 states that argued the policy unlawfully held critical disaster funds from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) hostage to compel compliance with immigration agent requests. U.S. District Judge William Smith deemed the administration's requirement to be "both arbitrary and capricious and unconstitutional." This ruling marks a significant setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to financially penalize cities and states with "sanctuary" policies that limit local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE.</p>

          <p>The annual Fat Bear Week competition has officially begun, with Katmai National Park and Preserve revealing the 12 brown bears competing for the title of 2025 champion. The popular online contest allows the public to vote for the bear they believe has best prepared for winter hibernation by gaining the most weight. The event highlights the natural cycle of the bears along the Brooks River, who can gain hundreds of pounds by feasting on salmon. It serves as an accessible way for people worldwide to learn about the park's ecosystem and the importance of a healthy, fat bear for surviving the harsh winter months.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying leucovorin, a generic drug derived from folic acid and typically used to mitigate chemotherapy side effects, as a potential treatment for some children with autism. The theory suggests that the drug can bypass a blockage that prevents folate from reaching the brain, which may contribute to neurological issues, including speech delays. Some parents report remarkable progress, with nonverbal children beginning to speak shortly after starting the off-label treatment. While preliminary studies are positive, researchers stress the need for larger clinical trials to confirm its efficacy, establish correct dosages, and gain FDA approval for this specific use.</p>

          <p>A moderately strong earthquake with a magnitude of 6.2 struck western and northern Venezuela, according to the US Geological Survey. The epicenter was located near the oil town of Mene Grande in Zulia state, at a shallow depth of about 7.8 kilometers. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties from the sparsely populated region. Venezuela is situated on a major tectonic plate boundary, making it susceptible to seismic activity. The country also holds the world's largest proven crude oil reserves, and its primary production areas are located in the western part of the nation.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel returned to his late-night show, addressing the controversy that led to his temporary suspension by ABC. In his opening monologue, he clarified that he never intended to make light of the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk but stopped short of a full apology for his remarks about the political reaction. Kimmel detailed his disagreement with the network's decision to pull the show but expressed gratitude for being reinstated. The incident has sparked a significant national debate on free speech, censorship, and the role of government regulators in media, with some station groups continuing to preempt the show.</p>

          <p>In a historic moment, Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa addressed the U.N. General Assembly, marking the first such appearance by a Syrian head of state since 1967. Al-Sharaa declared that Syria is rejoining the international community after decades of dictatorship under the Assad family, whose rule collapsed last year. He discussed ongoing security negotiations with Israel, pledged justice for sectarian violence, and highlighted the new government's efforts to dismantle the large-scale drug trade that funded the previous regime. The speech signals a major shift in Syria's foreign relations following the dramatic end of the 14-year civil war's previous phase.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The return of "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" drew an exceptionally large audience of 6.26 million viewers, a significant increase from its season average, according to Nielsen data. The high viewership came despite major station groups Nexstar and Sinclair preempting the broadcast in markets covering 23% of U.S. households. The episode, in which Kimmel addressed his controversial suspension, also garnered over 26 million views for its monologue across YouTube and social media platforms. The strong ratings indicate widespread public interest in the free speech debate sparked by the show's temporary removal from the airwaves following comments about a conservative activist's murder.</p>

          <p>Luke Donald, the captain of Europe's Ryder Cup team, suggested his players are driven by pride and legacy rather than financial incentives, in a comment seen as a subtle critique of their American rivals. His remarks came after it was revealed that for the first time, U.S. players will each receive a $500,000 stipend for participating, with a portion designated for charity. Donald emphasized that his team is "fuelled by something money can’t buy," such as purpose and representing their flag. The decision to pay the American players has drawn criticism, though U.S. team members have defended it as an opportunity to support their communities.</p>

          <p>A senior U.S. State Department official has reaffirmed that the administration continues to view India as a crucial democratic partner and a strategic counterweight to China in the Indo-Pacific region.

The official emphasized that the relationship with New Delhi remains strong and is fundamental to the regional strategy. Plans are reportedly underway for a Quad leaders' summit to be held in New Delhi, which would bring together the leaders of the U.S., India, Japan, and Australia to further solidify the alliance.</p>

          <p>President Trump's continued attacks on ABC and host Jimmy Kimmel have placed him at odds with several prominent conservatives who, while critical of Kimmel, have defended his free speech rights. Figures like Senator Ted Cruz and commentator Ben Shapiro voiced concerns after the FCC chair, a Trump appointee, suggested regulatory action against stations airing Kimmel's show. They warned that using federal power to silence disagreeable speech sets a dangerous precedent that could later be used against right-leaning voices. The situation has ignited a complex debate about the First Amendment, political retribution, and the limits of government influence over media.</p>

          <p>The NFL's finance committee has approved the sale of a 2.35% minority stake in the Chicago Bears, establishing a new league record valuation of $8.9 billion for the franchise. The stake, previously held by the estate of the late Andrew McKenna, was sold to the team's existing majority owners, the McCaskey and Ryan families. This valuation significantly exceeds previous estimates and reflects the soaring financial worth of NFL teams, driven by lucrative media deals and potential new stadium developments. The deal highlights the high demand for ownership in the league, even for non-controlling shares. (not investment advice)</p>
