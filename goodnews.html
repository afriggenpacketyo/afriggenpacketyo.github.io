The Teal Wand, developed by Teal Health, allows women to collect a vaginal sample at home using a swab, which is then mailed to a lab for HPV testing. A U.S.-based study found at-home screening to be as effective as in-office screenings, with women overwhelmingly preferring the self-screening method.
