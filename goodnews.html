          <p>Initially dismissed by critics, reality television has evolved into one of the most popular genres, now attracting serious academic and psychological analysis. The article explores how the format has become more demographically diverse than other media, potentially serving as a tool for greater social understanding and empathy. Some experts suggest that by offering a glimpse into different lives and prompting discussions on complex topics like coercive control and racism, these shows can help viewers build new perspectives, even if the reality presented is sometimes constructed by producers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, fueled by social media influencers and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, is causing global supplies of the green tea powder to dwindle. Record-breaking heatwaves have damaged crops in key growing regions like Kyoto, and Japan faces a long-term shortage of tea farmers. This combination of soaring demand and strained production, along with new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods, is leading to significant price hikes and forcing retailers to limit customer purchases.</p>

          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian musicians are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, prompting an analysis of the Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) industry. The article explores how CCM is more of a media ecosystem than a specific genre, mirroring mainstream styles without what some consider objectionable content. Experts discuss how megachurches drive the genre's sound and the economic machine behind it, and what the rise of this faith-flavored music might reveal about masculinity, politics, and the search for faith in the current moment.</p>

          <p>With the $8-billion merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global nearing its closing date, the media industry is bracing for significant changes at iconic brands like CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. The new ownership, backed by RedBird Capital Partners, has promised $2 billion in cost savings, signaling layoffs and restructuring. Key questions remain about the future of the Paramount+ streaming service, the viability of traditional broadcast TV, and whether the new owners' relationship with President Trump will impact creative freedom at news and entertainment divisions.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will release $5.5 billion in education funds to states after abruptly withholding them just before their scheduled distribution. The White House had initially frozen the funds, claiming they were being misused to subsidize a "radical left-wing agenda." The decision to release the money followed widespread outrage from educators and significant pushback from a bipartisan group of senators, who argued the funding was essential for longstanding programs that support students and local economies.</p>
