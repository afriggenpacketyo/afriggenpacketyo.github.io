          <h2>Africa's Solar Capacity Surges with Record Imports of Chinese Panels</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Africa is experiencing a rapid expansion in solar energy capacity, driven by a record influx of Chinese-made solar panels. An Oxford Economics study revealed a significant increase in imports during the first seven months of this year, with South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria leading the surge. This growth is largely attributed to massive energy plants developed by Chinese firms and the declining costs of the technology. China's dominant role in global solar production makes these imports a key indicator of Africa's accelerating transition to renewable energy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing declining cranberry prices, rising costs, and extreme weather, Massachusetts cranberry farmers are increasingly participating in a state program to restore unproductive bogs into wetlands. This initiative, run by the Massachusetts Division of Ecological Restoration, pays farmers for the conversion, which helps preserve their land and provides ecological benefits like water filtration and storm resilience. The program has already restored over 500 acres, with another 500 planned, offering a sustainable alternative for a generation of farmers nearing retirement.</p>

          <p>Oscar-winning actor Matthew McConaughey is starring alongside his 93-year-old mother and 17-year-old son in "The Lost Bus," a film depicting the harrowing 2018 California wildfires. The movie recounts a school bus driver's efforts to navigate children and their teacher to safety through the inferno, emphasizing realism by using non-actors and practical effects. Director Paul Greengrass aimed for the most realistic cinematic experience of fire, highlighting the global danger of wildfires and the film's universal message about grappling with critical decisions.</p>

          <p>Orange County officials are cross-referencing voter rolls with pet registration data to ensure no animals are registered to vote, following charges against a woman who allegedly registered her dog and cast ballots. Supervisors are debating the severity of the issue, with some calling it a sign of broader voter roll problems and others deeming it an isolated incident. The Registrar of Voters has initiated checks, finding no other pet registrations in initial reviews, while also working to confirm the identities of other unconfirmed voters.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's highly anticipated return to ABC after a temporary suspension drew an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, marking his highest ratings in years, despite being preempted by many affiliates. The suspension followed comments Kimmel made regarding the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. While not issuing a blanket apology, Kimmel clarified his intention was never to make light of the murder. Donald Trump, who had previously celebrated the show's cancellation, criticized ABC for rehiring the host.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot constitutionally require states to cooperate with immigration enforcement to receive Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) grants. This decision, a setback for the administration's efforts against "sanctuary" jurisdictions, sided with 20 states arguing the policy was arbitrary, capricious, and unconstitutional. The judge stated that withholding critical disaster preparedness funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety and disaster response, potentially depriving states of billions annually.</p>
