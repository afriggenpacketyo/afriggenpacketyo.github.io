          <p>Dame Jane Goodall, the pioneering conservationist and world's foremost expert on chimpanzees, has passed away at the age of 91. Her groundbreaking research in Tanzania in the 1960s revolutionized the scientific understanding of primates, revealing their complex social structures and tool-using abilities. Tributes have poured in from global figures like former President Barack Obama and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who praised her as a hero for the planet and an inspiration for generations of women in science. Dr. Goodall remained a tireless advocate for environmental protection and animal welfare until her death, leaving behind an extraordinary legacy through her work and the Jane Goodall Institute.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has made history by becoming the first person ever to have a net worth exceeding $500 billion, according to the Forbes billionaires index. This milestone was achieved through a recovery in Tesla's stock price and significant increases in the valuations of his other major ventures, SpaceX and xAI. Musk's wealth, which is heavily tied to his ownership stake in Tesla, was boosted by a more than 14% year-to-date gain in the company's shares. The surge reflects renewed investor confidence as Musk has reportedly refocused his attention on his businesses after a period of heavy involvement in politics during the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Despite gold prices reaching record highs, consumers in Hong Kong and mainland China continue to purchase gold jewelry, particularly for traditional wedding ceremonies. Global gold prices have surged over 48% this year, with local prices in Hong Kong rising in tandem, yet demand for items like dragon and phoenix bracelets remains strong as couples feel compelled to uphold cultural traditions. According to a spokesperson for major jeweler Chow Tai Fook, consumers have gradually adapted to the new, higher price levels since the surge began last year. This sustained demand highlights the cultural significance of gold, which often outweighs purely financial considerations for major life events like weddings.</p>

Shares for Samsung and SK Hynix climbed over 4% and 11%, respectively, reflecting strong investor optimism about the deal's potential. The market's positive performance occurred despite September's consumer price index rising 2.1% year-on-year, slightly exceeding economists' expectations for inflation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles city attorney's office has declined to file criminal charges against actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role in "Breaking Bad," following a confrontation over a parking spot. Cruz was detained by police last month after three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water while he was washing his car in front of his home. According to his agent, Cruz had asked the women to move their car, which was parked very close to his, to avoid getting it wet. The agent stated that any water that splashed on the women was incidental and not intentional, a position apparently accepted by prosecutors.</p>

          <p>In a new marketing campaign, the 133-year-old Maxwell House coffee brand has humorously rebranded itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to connect with a generation priced out of homeownership. The tongue-in-cheek advertisements acknowledge the unaffordability of the U.S. housing market, where the median age of first-time homebuyers has risen to a record high of 38. The campaign, designed by the Rethink advertising agency, aims to strengthen the brand's appeal among renters by offering the "same affordable coffee you love, now with an even more affordable name." The move reflects a broader cultural and economic shift where homeownership has become an increasingly distant goal for many Americans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has once again dismissed a lawsuit filed by Spencer Elden, the man who appeared as a naked baby on the cover of Nirvana's 1991 album "Nevermind." Elden had claimed the image constituted child pornography and caused him lifelong harm, but Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the photo pornographic, comparing it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." This marks the second time the case has been thrown out, with the judge freeing the surviving band members and Kurt Cobain's estate from what their lawyer described as a "meritless case" and "false allegations."</p>

          <p>A central claim in the government shutdown debate is the Republican assertion that Democrats are seeking to provide free healthcare to immigrants in the U.S. illegally, a charge Democrats deny. This article clarifies that the Democratic funding proposal aims to restore Medicaid eligibility for noncitizens who are in the country legally or with government permission, such as refugees, asylees, and parolees. This would reverse a recent law signed by President Trump that significantly restricted their access. Federal law already prohibits taxpayer funds from covering non-emergency medical care for undocumented individuals, and the Democratic plan does not propose changing this long-standing rule, focusing instead on restoring previous eligibility standards.</p>

In Argentina, Chery is considering an investment in a plug-in hybrid pickup truck line at Renault's facility.

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from diverting or withdrawing $34 million in anti-terrorism funding intended for New York's transportation system. Judge Lewis A.

The judge cited New York's history as a target for terrorism, from the 9/11 attacks to more recent incidents, underscoring the critical need for the security grants. The ruling came after New York sued the Department of Homeland Security over the proposed cuts, which the NYPD commissioner called a "profound mistake."</p>
