          <p>President Trump announced a new "Trump Savings Account" program as part of a GOP megabill, which would provide $1,000 to each newborn in a tax-deferred, low-cost index fund. The account would allow additional contributions up to $5,000 annually from family, friends, and others, with the funds intended to be used for college or a down payment on a home when the child reaches adulthood. House Speaker Mike Johnson praised the policy as a "transformative" measure to give American children a financial head start. Trump expressed optimism that the accounts would contribute to the lifelong success of millions of babies. (not investment advice)</p>

The appointment would mark Tottenham's fourth permanent manager since June 2021, highlighting the club's recent instability. </p>

          <p>Rugby league legend Billy Boston is set to receive a knighthood at Buckingham Palace, marking the sport's first such honor in its 130-year history. The Cardiff-born player, 90, was a star for Wigan and Great Britain in the 1950s and 1960s. The knighthood is being awarded early due to concerns over Boston's health, and follows frustration over the lack of rugby league knighthoods or damehoods. Boston's accomplishments include winning three Challenge Cups and scoring 24 tries in 31 appearances for Great Britain. </p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400m defamation lawsuit against his former co-star Blake Lively. Lively filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios in December 2024, alleging she was sexually harassed on set and that Baldoni retaliated against her for bringing those complaints, among other allegations. The judge determined that Baldoni and his company had not proved defamation because the "Wayfarer Parties have not alleged that Lively is responsible for any statements other than the statements" in her lawsuit, which are privileged. Judge Liman said Baldoni would be allowed to amend and refile his allegations related to interference with contracts by 23 June. </p>
