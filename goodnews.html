          <p>Retired Army General Stanley McChrystal spoke on "Face the Nation" about his new book, "On Character: Choices That Define a Life," emphasizing the importance of character at the individual level. He argues that national leaders are a symptom, not the cause, of a decline in trust and values. McChrystal also addressed the role of the military, aligning with Secretary Hegseth on the need for a strong warrior ethos but differing on the impact of DEI programs, viewing them as a distraction. The General also expressed disappointment with decisions regarding Afghan allies, stressing the importance of upholding American values and commitments. He also suggests that America needs to harness talent from every corner of our society, everyone.</p>

The article questions the show's future, particularly regarding Weekend Update hosts and political lampooning. Despite a Kamala Harris cameo, SNL hasn't quite figured out a consistently groundbreaking way to lampoon modern politics, but that's okay. Despite inconsistent episodes, SNL remains a powerful brand in comedy, with plans for a six-episode version on British TV next year.</p>

Nike hoped the Air Jordan would net them $3 million over four years, but they sold $126 million in year one. The Jordan Brand, a standalone division within Nike, generates some $7 billion for Nike annually. Jason Mayden, chief design officer for the Jordan Brand, says Jordan is still involved with the Air Jordan brand.

The future of lei making is in peril due to suburban sprawl, climate change, and dwindling flower stock.

          <p>Max Verstappen won the Emilia-Romagna Grand Prix, marking Red Bull's 400th grand prix, amidst a see-sawing battle between McLaren drivers for second place. Two caution periods, triggered by Esteban Ocon and Kimi Antonelli's incidents, led to strategic pit stops and tire changes. Lando Norris eventually overtook Oscar Piastri for second place, with Lewis Hamilton finishing closely behind in fourth. The timing of the safety cars impacted the race, especially for Aston Martin and Fernando Alonso, who finished outside the points after a strong qualifying position. The closing laps were compelling viewing, with the field alternating position between drivers on old tyres and those on fresh.</p>
