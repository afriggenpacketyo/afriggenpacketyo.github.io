          <p>The European Court of Justice has ruled against Malta's 'golden passport' program, the last of its kind in the EU, which offered citizenship to foreign investors. The court found that such schemes undermine the principle of solidarity among member states, as nationality should not be a mere commercial transaction. While Malta claims the program generated significant revenue for charitable causes, critics argue that it cheapens citizenship and raises concerns about security, money laundering, and corruption. The ruling has sparked debate about 'golden visa' programs, which offer residency permits for investments and also pose similar risks to the EU.</p>

          <p>The South Texas facility and launch site of Elon Musk's SpaceX, known as Starbase, has been formally approved as a city following a local vote. The vote, largely supported by SpaceX employees, allows Starbase to operate as an official municipality. While SpaceX officials have not detailed the reasons for seeking city status, it is believed to provide greater control over local infrastructure and operations, including streamlining beach closures during launches. Critics worry about the potential for increased control by Musk and the impact on public access to the nearby Boca Chica Beach and State Park.</p>

          <p>A recent survey in Japan indicates that nearly 30% of individuals in common-law relationships have chosen not to legally marry due to the requirement to adopt the same surname. The survey, conducted by a nongovernmental organization advocating for separate surnames for married couples, found that this rate is even higher among people in their 20s. While the main opposition party supports allowing separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling party oppose the change, citing concerns about traditional family values.</p>

          <p>China is undergoing a transformation as it increasingly embraces a technocratic elite in its government. This shift, where engineers, biologists, and physicists are ascending to leadership positions, signals a move away from traditional political patronage toward a system valuing competence and technical expertise. The trend is particularly evident among the younger cohort of Communist Party officials, with nearly half holding PhDs and many graduating from elite institutions like Tsinghua University. This emphasis on technocratic meritocracy is expected to be a significant factor in China's rivalry with the United States.</p>
