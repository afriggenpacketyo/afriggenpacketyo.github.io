          <h2>How to Secure a Summer Job with No Prior Work Experience</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:39 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many young people struggle to find summer jobs due to a lack of previous work experience, creating a frustrating "vicious cycle." However, careers experts suggest several ways to stand out to employers in retail, hospitality, and other sectors. Applicants should highlight transferable skills gained from volunteering, sports teams, or even home responsibilities on a simple, one-page CV. Experts also advise tailoring cover letters, preparing for interviews with specific examples, and not being afraid to speculatively drop off a CV at local businesses, as it shows initiative.</p>

          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA), designed to help people under 40 save for a first home or retirement with a 25% government bonus, is a product that divides opinion. While some savers have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, others criticize its significant drawbacks. Key concerns include a penalty for early withdrawal that can cost savers some of their own money and a property price cap of £450,000 that has not been updated since 2017. Critics, including financial expert Martin Lewis, argue these rules are unfair and are calling for reforms to make the product more flexible for savers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hundreds of runners participated in a 15-mile "Run Against ICE" through Los Angeles to protest recent immigration raids by federal agents. The event was designed to show solidarity with immigrant communities and call for an end to enforcement actions that have created a climate of fear. The route passed through significant neighborhoods like Koreatown and Chinatown, as well as near the Metropolitan Detention Center where detainees are held. Participants expressed a mix of outrage and defiance, aiming to make their opposition to the government's aggressive immigration policies visible and to support those affected.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid secured a place in the Club World Cup semifinal against Paris Saint-Germain after a dramatic 3-2 victory over Borussia Dortmund. Madrid controlled most of the match, with goals from academy products Gonzalo García and Fran García, but faced a chaotic final 10 minutes. A stunning acrobatic goal from new superstar Kylian Mbappé sealed the win, though a late red card for defender Dean Huijsen will see him miss the upcoming semifinal. The match offered a glimpse into new manager Xabi Alonso's vision for the team, blending youth development with star power.</p>

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards conducted 350 rescues on a chaotic Fourth of July, as powerful rip currents created hazardous swimming conditions. In one dramatic incident, a "monster rip current" pulled more than 10 people far from shore, requiring a large-scale rescue effort involving lifeboats and helicopters. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous surf and strong rip currents along the Southern California coast for the holiday weekend. The event serves as a stark reminder of ocean dangers, even for experienced swimmers, during periods of elevated surf.</p>

          <p>Sonay Kartal, the shortest player in the women's singles draw at 5ft 4in, is making an impressive run at Wimbledon, reaching the fourth round of a Grand Slam for the first time. The 23-year-old British player says she makes up for her lack of height with exceptional speed and power, skills she has deliberately honed throughout her career. After overcoming injuries and a period of self-funding her career, Kartal has rapidly climbed the world rankings. She will now make her Centre Court debut, a dream for any young player, crediting her success to hard work and self-belief.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's aggressive, "no draws" cricket philosophy, known as "Bazball," is facing its most significant challenge in the second Test against India. Needing an almost impossible 536 runs on the final day for a win, the team must decide whether to risk defeat by chasing the target or attempt to bat out the day for a draw to preserve their series lead. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick has hinted for the first time that the team may be flexible on its win-at-all-costs mantra, acknowledging a draw is a possible and logical outcome. The decision will be a crucial test of the team's identity under coach Brendon McCullum.</p>

          <h2>Subaru Overtakes Toyota as Most Reliable Car Brand in Consumer Reports Survey</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 15:25:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a notable shift, Subaru has been named the most reliable car brand for 2025 by Consumer Reports, surpassing perennial leaders Toyota and Lexus. The survey, based on data from over 300,000 vehicles, gave Subaru the top score, likely due to its conservative redesigns, shared components across a smaller model lineup, and strong individual model ratings. The Subaru Forester received a near-perfect reliability score of 98 out of 100. While Toyota and its luxury division Lexus still ranked second and third, their overall scores were impacted by reliability issues with the redesigned Tacoma and Tundra pickup trucks.
