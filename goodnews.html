          <p>President Trump's military parade is not unprecedented, but such events are rare in the U.S.  Past parades often celebrated war victories or troop returns, like the 1991 Gulf War parade.  Earlier parades, particularly during the Cold War, sometimes featured military equipment during presidential inaugurations.  However, parades with military equipment became less common after the Vietnam War due to public sentiment.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The idea for Trump's military parade originated from an Army live-action show.  Army officials saw the potential for a large-scale televised event to celebrate the Army's 250th anniversary.  The event's high cost has drawn criticism, with some calling it a waste of taxpayer money and self-aggrandizing.  Despite the criticism, the parade will proceed as planned, featuring various military equipment and personnel.</p>
