          <p>The United Kingdom is preparing for U.S. President Donald Trump's state visit, which is anticipated to offer a distraction from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer's mounting domestic issues. The visit will include royal engagements with King Charles III and Queen Camilla, followed by bilateral meetings focused on trade and economic partnerships. Amidst Starmer's low approval ratings and recent cabinet reshuffles, the UK hopes to secure further trade deals and investments, including significant AI and nuclear energy partnerships. This article highlights the strategic importance of the visit for both leaders.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is projected to increase by 4.7% in April, potentially adding over £500 annually for new state pensioners. This rise is based on the "triple lock" policy, which guarantees the pension increases by the highest of 2.5%, inflation, or average earnings growth. The Office for National Statistics reported a 4.7% total pay growth for the three months to July, which is likely to be the determining factor. This article also raises concerns that the ongoing freeze in tax thresholds will draw more pensioners into the income tax net. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-awaited "Hillsborough Law" bill, the Public Office (Accountability) Bill, will be introduced to Parliament, compelling public officials to be truthful during investigations into major disasters. This landmark legislation will impose a professional and legal "duty of candour," with criminal sanctions for breaches. Campaigners, including families of the 97 football fans who died at Hillsborough in 1989, have welcomed the move, hoping it will end a "culture of cover-ups" and ensure justice for victims of future state-related tragedies like Grenfell Tower and the Post Office Horizon scandal.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers suffered a 6-5 extra-inning loss to the Philadelphia Phillies, hindering their chances for a first-round playoff bye. Despite fighting back from multiple deficits, the Dodgers ultimately fell to a 10th-inning sacrifice fly. This article details the game's back-and-forth scoring, including home runs from Max Muncy and Andy Pages. The Dodgers are now 5½ games behind the Phillies for the No. 2 seed, making their path to a postseason bye more challenging with only 12 regular season games remaining.</p>
