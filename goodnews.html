          <p>As artificial intelligence rapidly advances, Hong Kong firms are being encouraged to proactively address AI security risks, particularly concerning personal data privacy. International declarations, such as the Bletchley Declaration and UN resolutions, emphasize the need for safe, secure, and trustworthy AI systems. China's Global AI Governance Initiative promotes a people-centered approach to AI development, highlighting the importance of balancing innovation with security.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A leaked memo indicates that Angela Rayner's department urged Chancellor Rachel Reeves to consider tax increases prior to the Spring Statement. The memo proposed various measures to raise ¬£3-4 billion annually, including increasing corporation tax on banks, extending the freeze on the 45% tax rate threshold, and reinstating the lifetime pensions allowance. While Reeves did not implement these suggestions, the memo highlights ongoing debates within the Labour party regarding tax and spending decisions, particularly in light of welfare cuts and defense spending increases. The discussion underscores internal tensions regarding fiscal policy and alternative funding strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Thames Water has suspended its 'retention scheme' intended to award substantial bonuses to senior executives linked to securing a ¬£3 billion rescue loan. The decision follows criticism from Downing Street, which deemed rewarding executives for mismanagement as unacceptable. The company will await guidance from the regulator Ofwat to ensure its approach aligns with turnaround objectives and public expectations. This action comes amid heavy scrutiny of Thames Water's performance, marked by sewage discharges, leaks, and financial instability, as the government remains prepared to place the company under special administration. Regardless of the company's future, water supplies and waste services will continue uninterrupted.</p>

However, engaging with the president does not guarantee protection from his anger, as some companies have learned, suggesting that public commitments to U.S. jobs may be more about enhancing Trump's image than safeguarding their own profitability.</p>

          <p>Japan's agriculture minister resigned Wednesday because of political fallout over recent comments that he "never had to buy rice" because he got it from supporters as gifts. The resignation comes as the public struggles with record high prices of the country's traditional staple food. Politically, the gaffe could be further trouble for Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's already struggling minority government, which faces a crucial national election in July. Media reports say Eto's successor will be popular former Environment Minister Shinjiro Koizumi, the son of a former prime minister.</p>
