          <p>Okinawa marked the 80th anniversary of the end of the World War II battle between Japan and the United States with a ceremony at the Peace Memorial Park in Itoman. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Okinawa Gov. Denny Tamaki attended the service, where 342 names were added to the list of war dead, bringing the total to 242,567. Tamaki emphasized the importance of preserving the lessons of the battle and passing them on to future generations, highlighting the island's enduring desire for peace. Ishiba acknowledged the tragedy of the war and pledged to work towards a peaceful and prosperous Okinawa, while also addressing the ongoing issue of the U.S. military presence and the need to reduce the burden on the prefecture. The day served as a somber reminder of the island's history and its continued pursuit of peace. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>At the annual NATO summit, the U.S. is urging allies to increase their defense spending to 5% of their GDP, comprised of 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some member states are close to or willing to meet this target, others are struggling to reach the previously agreed 2% threshold. The U.S. seeks concrete plans and commitments from allies, but some European nations may attempt to dilute their pledges. The summit occurs amidst ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East, making it potentially the most consequential in NATO's history, and European aerospace and defense companies are eager for concrete government procurement contracts to scale up production. The article reflects the tensions and expectations surrounding defense spending within the alliance. </p>

          <h2>NHS Considers Ketamine Clinics for Treatment-Resistant Depression</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 01:13:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NHS Lothian is considering establishing a ketamine clinic to treat severe depression, offering an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, costing ¬£6,000 for a program of infusions and psychotherapy. Ketamine, known recreationally, has shown promise in making patients more receptive to psychotherapy, with one patient reporting improved mood and increased activity. While esketamine nasal spray is approved for moderate to severe treatment-resistant depression in Scotland, intravenous ketamine is not, but can be prescribed 'off-label,' and the Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on psychedelics later this year. The exploration of ketamine as a treatment option offers hope for those with difficult-to-treat depression. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the U.S. joining the conflict between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, with investors viewing the situation as contained. The MSCI World index experienced only a slight decline, and safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen and gold traded mixed. Some analysts believe the strikes on Iran have reduced the nuclear threat in the region, leading to minimal risks of wider conflict. While acknowledging the gravity of the situation, experts do not see it as a systemic risk to global markets. Market reactions have been less aggressive compared to when Israel launched airstrikes against Iran, suggesting a degree of investor confidence in the containment of the conflict. </p>

          <p>New York City will use ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to voters' second choices. This process continues until one candidate has a majority, and the system aims to ensure that the elected candidate has broad support. The tabulation process will not begin until July 1 due to mail-in ballots, and the results will not be official until July 15. The article explains the mechanics and potential benefits and drawbacks of ranked choice voting. </p>

One image reveals colorful gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years from Earth, and the observatory is equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera. The telescope is expected to transform our understanding of the universe, potentially discovering a ninth planet, detecting killer asteroids, mapping the Milky Way, and answering questions about dark matter. The observatory will conduct a continuous 10-year filming of the southern night sky, capturing vast amounts of data. </p>
