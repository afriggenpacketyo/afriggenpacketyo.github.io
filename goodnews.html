          <p>Spotify has announced a major leadership transition, with co-founder Daniel Ek stepping down as CEO to assume the role of executive chairman, effective January 1, 2026. He will be succeeded by the company's current co-presidents, Gustav Söderström and Alex Norström, who will serve as co-CEOs in a move designed to ensure continuity. Ek stated that the change formalizes the way the company already operates and that his new role will focus on long-term strategy and supporting the senior team. The announcement of the planned succession was followed by a roughly 4% dip in Spotify's share price. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pilar Sanders, the mother of Cleveland Browns quarterback Shedeur Sanders, has publicly responded to critical comments made by former NFL head coach Rex Ryan. Ryan had criticized the rookie quarterback for stating he could play better than some NFL starters while remaining third on the depth chart and not seeing any game time. In a now-deleted social media post, Pilar Sanders described Ryan's comments as "impotent, cancerous, envious energy" and suggested his remarks have no place in sports. The controversy stems from Sanders' expressed confidence despite his lack of playing time for the struggling 1-3 Browns.</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the federal government shuts down on October 1. Since these benefits are covered by mandatory spending, payments are not subject to the annual appropriations process that is currently stalled in Congress. However, the Social Security Administration's operating budget does require congressional approval, meaning a shutdown could disrupt other important services. According to the agency's contingency plan, services like benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and the issuance of replacement Medicare cards would be halted for the duration of the shutdown.</p>

Siminoff, who describes himself as "pro public safety," also oversaw the reintroduction of a tool allowing police to request footage from users through a partnership with Axon.

          <p>The salvage company Queens Jewels has announced the recovery of more than 1,000 silver coins, five gold coins, and other artifacts from the 1715 Treasure Fleet shipwreck off Florida's Treasure Coast. The discovery was made by the crew of the vessel "Just Right" near Wabasso Beach and is considered a historically significant find. This recovery is part of a successful summer season that has yielded artifacts valued at around $1 million. The recovered coins, which date from 1698 to 1714, will now be conserved and cataloged before being processed through a federal admiralty court.</p>

          <p>A coalition of 35 unions representing federal workers has sent a letter to Democratic congressional leaders, urging them to hold their ground in budget negotiations with Republicans, even at the cost of a government shutdown. The unions state that their members are willing to forgo paychecks to protect critical public services from funding cuts and to oppose what they term "unconstitutional executive overreach." This unified stance provides Democrats with significant political cover and an opportunity to align with organized labor, reframing the shutdown battle as a fight for economic justice and the preservation of essential government programs.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is actively working to integrate artificial intelligence across its entire operation, with the ambitious goal of becoming a "fully AI-connected enterprise." The bank has developed a proprietary platform called LLM Suite, which harnesses models from OpenAI and Anthropic to automate processes and assist employees. The long-term vision includes providing every employee with a personalized AI assistant and every client with an AI concierge, fundamentally rewiring the bank's internal and external processes. This initiative could significantly boost productivity and change the nature of corporate labor, potentially reducing the need for junior staff for tasks like creating investment banking presentations.

          <h2>Experts Suggest an October Fed Rate Cut May Not Significantly Lower Mortgage Rates</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-30 09:57:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While the Federal Reserve is widely expected to cut interest rates again in October, financial experts caution that this may not lead to a substantial drop in mortgage rates for homebuyers. Mortgage rates are more directly influenced by Treasury yields and market anticipation, meaning the expected 0.25% cut may already be priced in by lenders long before the official announcement. However, rates could still fall before the Fed's meeting if new economic data indicates slowing growth or cooling inflation. For homeowners who secured mortgages at higher rates in recent years, even a modest dip could make refinancing a worthwhile consideration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Milorad Dodik, the long-serving nationalist leader of Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, has withdrawn from all official roles, ending a months-long confrontation with the state judiciary. His decision follows a court ruling that barred him from politics for six years for defying the authority of the international High Representative, Christian Schmidt. Dodik, who had repeatedly threatened secession and challenged state institutions, has now asked the entity's assembly to appoint an interim president ahead of a new election. His departure marks a significant political shift after nearly three decades of his dominant, and often divisive, rule.</p>

          <p>A Chinese national, Zhimin Qian, has been convicted in the UK for illegally acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency in connection with a massive fraud scheme. The investigation led to the seizure of 61,000 bitcoin, currently valued at over £5 billion, which is believed to be the world's largest single crypto seizure. Between 2014 and 2017, Qian orchestrated a scam in China that defrauded over 128,000 victims before she fled to the UK and attempted to launder the proceeds by purchasing property. Her conviction is the culmination of a seven-year international investigation into the global money laundering operation.</p>
