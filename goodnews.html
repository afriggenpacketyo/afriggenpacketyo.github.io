          <p>Nvidia has refuted reports that it is sending graphics processing unit (GPU) designs to China to circumvent U.S. export controls. The company clarified that it is not modifying GPU designs in China to comply with these restrictions. This statement follows reports that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang discussed a potential research and development center in Shanghai with the city's mayor to assess ways to meet U.S. restrictions while catering to the local market; however, the company insists that production and design will continue outside of China.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave, an artificial intelligence infrastructure provider, has seen its shares surge nearly 60% this week, boosting its market cap to approximately $38 billion. The company's value has more than doubled since its IPO in late March, fueled by a 420% revenue growth reported in its first earnings report as a public company. The article mentions that Nvidia holds a 7% stake in CoreWeave, now worth about $2 billion, further bolstering investor confidence.
