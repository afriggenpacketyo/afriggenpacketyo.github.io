          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, expresses hope for technological progress in AI and biotech, despite geopolitical tensions and the threat of technological decoupling between the US and China. He emphasizes that scientific breakthroughs in one country benefit humanity as a whole, given the universality of human biology, math, physics, and chemistry. Diamandis contrasts this cosmopolitan vision with the current political climate in the US, where there have been cuts to scientific funding and restrictions on international student visas. He expresses concern that these cuts will hinder the speed of scientific discoveries. The article maintains a balanced view, highlighting both challenges and opportunities.</p>
