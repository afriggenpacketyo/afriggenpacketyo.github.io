          <h2>Trump to Issue Executive Order on National Standards for College Athlete Compensation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 23:07:55 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is planning to sign an executive order to establish national standards for the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program. This move follows a House subcommittee's advancement of a bill intended to supersede the patchwork of state laws currently governing student-athlete compensation. The action addresses the massive financial shift in college sports since 2021, when the NCAA began allowing athletes to profit from endorsements after facing significant legal and political pressure. The executive order aims to bring federal oversight to this rapidly evolving and lucrative landscape.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, which he states includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian imports into the U.S. and tariff-free access for American goods into Indonesia. The deal also reportedly includes commitments for Indonesia to purchase billions in U.S. energy and agricultural products, as well as Boeing aircraft. However, the Indonesian government has not yet officially confirmed these terms, creating some uncertainty around the finality of the agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump successfully intervened after a group of 13 House Republicans unexpectedly joined Democrats to block a procedural vote on several cryptocurrency regulation bills. Following a meeting at the White House, Trump announced that the holdouts had agreed to reverse their position and would now support the legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation. This quick turnaround highlights the president's significant influence over the Republican conference, and the initial failure of the vote had caused a temporary dip in crypto-linked stocks.

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced that 20 leading technology and energy firms have committed to over $90 billion in new investments in Pennsylvania. The investments are aimed at developing a new artificial intelligence economy in the state by building energy-intensive data centers and an innovation and training hub. The initiative seeks to leverage Pennsylvania's energy resources, including natural gas and nuclear, to power the future of AI. The announcement was met with some protests from environmental and anti-authoritarian activists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that 2,000 of the 4,000 California National Guard members deployed to Los Angeles will be released from federal duty. The troops were federalized by President Trump last month, over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, to respond to protests related to immigration enforcement. The administration stated the move was possible because "lawlessness is subsiding," while Newsom called for the return of the remaining troops, labeling their deployment a political maneuver. The initial deployment had led to a legal battle between the state and federal government.</p>

The statement was released on the opening day of a major supply chain expo in Beijing. Xi vowed that China would continue to promote trade and investment liberalization while opposing "maximum pressure" tactics.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged local governments in China to use their legislative powers to foster economic and social development. The piece highlights that since 2015, more cities have been empowered to draft local laws tailored to their specific needs, particularly in areas like urban development and environmental protection. The article suggests that creating stable, rule-of-law-based systems encourages market activity and is a more effective governance tool than relying solely on top-down directives. This reflects a shift towards more systematic local economic management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming season: an all-gold "Charger Power" look and a navy blue "Super Chargers" set. The gold uniforms have generated mixed reactions online, with some comparing them to mustard or the Minions characters. The navy blue uniform is a modern throwback to the team's look from the 1990s and early 2000s, an era that included their only Super Bowl appearance. The team will also add powder blue pants as an option for their regular home and away jerseys.</p>

          <p>Central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are increasingly buying gold directly from local mines rather than on the international market, according to the World Gold Council. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. It is also often cheaper and supports the domestic mining industry. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire to hedge against geopolitical and financial risks.

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who spent over 20 years in prison for a murder he did not commit. Torres was convicted in 2001 despite having a strong alibi and evidence suggesting his innocence, including shaky witness testimony. His conviction was overturned in 2021 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022. The settlement resolves his civil lawsuit, which alleged that sheriff's detectives had failed to disclose evidence pointing to another suspect.</p>

          <p>An independent review in the UK has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned amid safety concerns, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors and states they should not be diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs they believed were doctors. While patient advocates welcome the clarity, the British Medical Association argues the review should have gone further.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set for a major £50 million renovation that will require its closure for five years starting in 2027. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the iron structure, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants. A key goal of the project is to make the building net-zero in emissions by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps. The renovation is necessary due to the toll the building's hot, humid internal climate has taken on its Victorian-era structure.</p>

The watchdog found that the ad, which promoted ingredients like magnesium and L-theanine, implied benefits that are not permitted on the official register for food and supplement marketing. The ASA also found a claim about "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate. The company has been ordered not to run the ad again and to cease making claims that its drinks can treat disease.</p>
