          <h2>Trump Enacts First Major Federal Cryptocurrency Legislation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 16:18:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing the first major federal regulatory framework for cryptocurrency, specifically targeting stablecoins. The bipartisan bill aims to increase public trust and mainstream adoption by making it easier for banks to issue these digital currencies, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. However, the legislation has drawn criticism from some Democrats, like Rep. Maxine Waters, who raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest, pointing to a crypto firm with strong ties to the Trump family that could directly benefit from the new law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States has secured the release of ten Americans detained in Venezuela, including a former Navy SEAL, through a complex prisoner swap. The exchange involved El Salvador returning 252 Venezuelan nationals who had been deported from the U.S. earlier this year over alleged gang ties. In return for the release of the Americans and some Venezuelan political prisoners, El Salvador transferred the Venezuelan detainees from its custody. The initial U.S. deportation of the Venezuelans under the Alien Enemies Act had been a point of contention, with families denying the gang affiliations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency market saw a significant reaction to President Trump signing the GENIUS Act, with Ether (ETH) leading the gains and reaching its highest price since January. Ether-tracking ETFs experienced record inflows, surpassing those of Bitcoin ETFs for the first time, signaling a potential shift in crypto market leadership. While Bitcoin's price remained relatively flat, the new law, which provides a regulatory framework for stablecoins, has bolstered investor confidence in the broader digital asset space. The development is seen as a major symbolic and practical victory for the crypto industry in the world's largest financial market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a move that gives it a significant stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The deal was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the region. The decision is a major strategic victory for Chevron, resolving uncertainty that had weighed on its stock. While Exxon stated it respects the ruling, its shares fell on the news, highlighting the high stakes involved in controlling the lucrative Guyanese oil project.</p>

          <p>The broadcast booth at The Open Championship experienced a moment of unexpected chaos when a bat flew into the tower during the second round. The incident prompted hilarious and contrasting reactions from NBC announcers Dan Hicks and Kevin Kisner, which were captured on camera. While Hicks laughed and waved his hands at the creature, Kisner, a known hunter, comically ducked for cover under his jacket. The lighthearted interruption provided a brief moment of levity for the broadcast team as they contended with the invading animal while golfers outside battled rainy conditions on the course.</p>

          <p>At a White House ceremony, President Trump signed the GENIUS Act, landmark legislation creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins. The president hailed the bill as a key achievement, joking that it was named after him and recounting how he personally persuaded Republican holdouts to secure its passage. The event was attended by top crypto executives, whom Trump praised for their perseverance, declaring the law a "massive validation" of their industry. The signing was part of a broader "Crypto Week" in Congress that also saw the passage of bills to regulate other digital assets and prevent a retail central bank digital currency.</p>

          <p>With President Trump signing the Genius Act, stablecoins are set to play a larger role in the U.S. financial system. This article explains that stablecoins are a type of cryptocurrency designed to be less volatile by pegging their value to a stable asset, most commonly the U.S. dollar. The new law establishes federal regulations and consumer protections, creating a legal framework for banks and other institutions to issue their own stablecoins. Supporters believe this will enable faster, lower-cost transactions, while major financial players like Citigroup and JPMorgan are already exploring how to integrate the technology into their services.</p>

          <p>A recent study reveals that even high-income individuals, earning $300,000 or more, often struggle with credit card debt, largely due to "lifestyle creep" where expenses rise with income. This article outlines several debt relief strategies tailored for these earners, who can leverage their strong credit scores and financial standing. Options include using a debt consolidation loan to secure a lower interest rate, or transferring balances to a card with a 0% introductory APR. The article also suggests negotiating directly with creditors for a lower rate or working with a financial advisor to create a disciplined, personalized payoff plan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This feature article explores the long and varied history of queerness, challenging the modern perception of a strict gender binary as a historical norm. It highlights periods of acceptance, such as in ancient Greece and Rome where same-sex relationships were common, and points to figures like Leonardo da Vinci who likely had male lovers. The article contrasts this with eras of persecution, often justified by religious doctrine, which criminalized non-normative identities. It also discusses the recognition of a third gender in many cultures, from the Hijras in South Asia to the Muxes in Mexico, providing a global perspective on gender diversity through time.</p>

          <p>American Express reported strong second-quarter spending, indicating its affluent customer base continues to spend freely on its cards. Overall spending rose 7%, driven by transactions for goods and services, which has helped insulate the company from fears of a broader economic slowdown. However, a notable weak spot has emerged in travel, with spending on airline tickets coming in flat compared to last year, specifically due to a decline in domestic economy-class airfare purchases. While premium cabin and luxury hotel bookings remain strong, the stall in airfare spending could be a concern for the rewards-focused company. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article compares the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into a long-term certificate of deposit (CD) versus a money market account. While a money market account currently offers a slightly higher variable interest rate and greater flexibility, a CD provides a fixed, guaranteed return over its term. Calculations show that based on current rates, a money market account would earn slightly more over several years, but this assumes rates will not fall. The article concludes that savers must weigh the guaranteed, albeit slightly lower, return of a CD against the potentially higher but uncertain returns of a money market account.

          <p>Shares of Texas Roadhouse have recently underperformed the market, partly due to accelerating beef inflation, a significant cost for the steakhouse chain. Beef prices rose approximately 15% year-over-year in the second quarter, putting pressure on the company's operating margins. Despite this headwind, some analysts remain bullish, raising their price targets based on the company's strong customer traffic and continued market share gains in its category. The long-term outlook remains positive, though investors will need to be patient as the cattle industry works to rebuild inventory and stabilize prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book by author Philippa Langley challenges the centuries-old story that the two young princes, Edward and Richard, were murdered in the Tower of London by their uncle, Richard III. After a decade-long research project, Langley claims to have found significant evidence that both princes survived and lived on in secret. The project uncovered documents supporting a rebellion led by a boy "called" a son of King Edward IV, suggesting this was the elder prince, Edward V. This new thesis reframes one of history's most famous cold cases as a missing persons investigation, shifting the burden of proof onto those who maintain the traditional murder narrative.</p>
