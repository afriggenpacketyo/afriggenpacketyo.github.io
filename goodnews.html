          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 10:53:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As year-end approaches, older Americans facing Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) from pretax retirement accounts have several strategic options if they do not immediately need the money. Financial experts suggest reinvesting these RMD proceeds into brokerage accounts, with exchange-traded funds (ETFs) often preferred for their tax efficiency and ease of tax-loss harvesting. For charitably inclined individuals, a qualified charitable distribution (QCD) offers a direct transfer from an IRA to an eligible non-profit, satisfying RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income, a method some call the IRS's "best-kept secret." Lastly, RMDs can also be used for legacy planning by contributing to 529 college savings plans for family members, potentially securing state tax breaks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United striker Alexander Isak is reportedly resolute in his desire to depart the club and join Liverpool this summer, despite Newcastle rejecting a substantial £110 million bid from the Reds. Although BBC Sport could not independently confirm claims of his absolute refusal to represent Newcastle again, it is widely understood that his primary ambition is to join the Premier League champions before the transfer deadline. Newcastle manager Eddie Howe has publicly acknowledged the uncertainty surrounding Isak's future, indicating that the striker cannot be integrated into the team's current plans, which implies he will miss the upcoming Premier League opener. Isak, a prolific scorer with 27 goals last season, still has three years remaining on his existing contract with the Magpies.</p>

          <p>UFC CEO Dana White has confirmed plans for a historic professional mixed martial arts event to be staged at the White House on July 4, 2026, commemorating America's 250th anniversary. White stated that discussions with President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump are underway to finalize logistical details and venue renderings for this unprecedented location. This announcement coincides with the UFC's groundbreaking seven-year streaming deal with Paramount, valued at an average of $1.1 billion annually, which signifies a significant shift from its traditional pay-per-view model, with select events to be simulcast on CBS. The event would mark an extraordinary milestone for the sport, placing it alongside other major sporting spectacles broadcast on CBS, such as the Masters Tournament and the Super Bowl.</p>

This strategic move underscores the escalating competition among leading artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and xAI, to establish and deepen their relationships with key government policymakers and agencies. The article highlights that Anthropic has previously developed specialized Claude Gov models for national security clients and, alongside tech giants like Google and OpenAI, recently secured a substantial Department of Defense contract for AI development. This aggressive pricing strategy aims to embed Anthropic's technology within federal operations and win crucial government customers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Liverpool is reportedly intensifying its efforts to sign Marc Guehi, the highly-regarded Crystal Palace captain and England centre-back, who has only one year remaining on his current contract. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has previously signaled a willingness to sell Guehi this summer to prevent his departure on a free transfer in 12 months. Sources close to the situation indicate that Liverpool has initiated preliminary discussions, aiming to secure the 25-year-old defender before the summer transfer window concludes. While Crystal Palace is understood to be seeking around £40 million for Guehi, Liverpool is reportedly looking to negotiate a lower fee. This potential acquisition would add to Liverpool's substantial summer spending, which could exceed £400 million if they also successfully sign Alexander Isak.</p>

          <p>E.l.f. Beauty experienced a 30% decline in net income during its first fiscal quarter following the implementation of President Donald Trump's tariffs, which caused a temporary dip in its share price. Despite this challenge, CEO Tarang Amin emphasizes the company's remarkable achievement of 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth, alongside its ongoing international and retail expansions. A significant development is the company's new $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode. E.l.f. attributes its sustained success to its strategy of offering affordable yet premium products, effective viral marketing on platforms like TikTok, and strong engagement with Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and millennial consumers. The Rhode deal, financed with $600 million of debt, is poised to introduce E.l.f. into Sephora stores this fall, with experts expressing cautious optimism regarding its potential accretive value given Rhode's rapid growth.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group's shares experienced a significant jump following its first quarterly earnings report as a publicly listed company, revealing a 53% increase in second-quarter revenue. This substantial growth was primarily fueled by the strong expansion of its USDC stablecoin circulation, which surged 90% year-over-year to $61.3 billion. Despite reporting a net loss attributed to non-cash IPO-related charges, CEO Jeremy Allaire underscored the robust validation for Circle's pivotal role in converging the internet and financial systems. The article highlights that stablecoins are attracting increased interest from traditional banks and payment firms, particularly as the Trump administration adopts more supportive crypto legislation, exemplified by the recently signed GENIUS Act. Circle also announced the upcoming launch of Arc, a new blockchain specifically designed for stablecoin payments and capital markets applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Mortgage Rates Unlikely to Fall Below 6% Soon, Experts Advise Buyers to Consider Current Market</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While current 30-year fixed mortgage rates have seen a slight decrease to approximately 6.75%, financial experts contend that a return to rates below 6% is improbable in the immediate future, potentially not occurring until mid-to-late 2026. This article explains that such a significant drop would necessitate major economic changes, such as a substantial increase in unemployment or a widespread geopolitical crisis. Experts also emphasize that bond market yields, rather than solely Federal Reserve policy, will serve as a more accurate barometer for future mortgage rate movements. Despite the current elevated rates, the article outlines several advantages to purchasing a home now, including potentially lower sales prices, the opportunity to build equity immediately, and the flexibility to refinance when rates eventually decline.

Key players such as Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose, and Tommy Fleetwood have already secured their places, with Robert MacIntyre and Tyrrell Hatton also expected to qualify. The article further discusses the intricate situation surrounding Jon Rahm's potential inclusion, complicated by his move to the LIV Tour and ongoing legal challenges with the European Tour Group, highlighting the strategic decisions facing the captain.</p>

          <h2>Princeton Review Identifies Top 10 Colleges for Financial Aid Generosity in 2025-26</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 09:02:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Princeton Review has released its comprehensive list of the top 10 colleges for financial aid in the 2025-26 academic year, showcasing institutions renowned for their generous award packages and high levels of student satisfaction with the aid received. The article highlights that while total college costs are approaching $100,000 at some institutions, very few families actually pay the full sticker price, with average out-of-pocket expenses closer to $31,000. It emphasizes that a combination of parent income, savings, and substantial "free money" from scholarships and grants covers the majority of educational costs, with student loans typically making up the rest. Schools such as Washington and Lee University and Princeton University exemplify this generosity, offering significant need-based scholarships that substantially reduce the effective cost for attending students and directly address pervasive affordability concerns.
