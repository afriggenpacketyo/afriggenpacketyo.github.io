This policy shift converts what was previously a grant into a non-voting equity position for the American public, reflecting a new approach to federal investments in the semiconductor industry. The move aims to ensure taxpayers benefit from the financial support provided to bolster domestic chip manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign producers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Southern California family has found a unique solution to fill the grandparental void in their children's lives by connecting with a "surrogate grandmother" through a Facebook group. The Turner family, raising twin boys, felt their children were missing the wisdom and presence of grandparents, while Janet Firestein Daw longed for grandchildren her own children were not planning to have. After connecting online, they formed a deep bond, with "Nana J" becoming an integral part of the family's life.

          <p>Air Canada has announced it will gradually restart flights after reaching a tentative agreement with the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants, ending a strike that began over the weekend. The labor disruption affected approximately 130,000 travelers daily during the peak summer season. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is guaranteed pay for work performed while planes are on the ground. The airline cautioned that a full restoration of its regular schedule could take a week or more and asked for customer patience during the transition.</p>

          <p>In an economy marked by inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to earn returns that can outpace rising costs. This article provides an overview of current CD interest rates, noting that online banks typically offer more competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs) than traditional brick-and-mortar institutions. It also explains the phenomenon of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs currently provide higher rates than long-term ones. To maximize returns, savers are advised to compare rates from different banks and consider strategies like CD laddering. (not investment advice)</p>

However, the company saw encouraging signs, including a rise in big-ticket transactions and improving sales trends throughout the quarter. The report reflects a gradual recovery in home improvement activity as Home Depot awaits a more significant market pickup. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new budget law has moved up the expiration dates for several popular clean energy tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act. Homeowners and consumers now have a shorter window to claim credits for purchases like electric vehicles, rooftop solar panels, heat pumps, and other energy-efficient home upgrades. For instance, the 30% credit for residential solar installations will now end on December 31, 2025, instead of 2032. This article outlines the key available credits and their new deadlines, urging interested individuals to act before the incentives are phased out. (not investment advice)</p>
