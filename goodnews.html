          <p>Tom Dundon, the owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, has reached a tentative agreement to acquire the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers from the estate of late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. While the financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, the franchise was recently valued at approximately $3.65 billion. The team has been managed by Allen's sister, Jody Allen, since his death in 2018, who previously declined a reported $2 billion offer from Nike co-founder Phil Knight in 2022. The sale is pending approval from the NBA, marking a significant ownership change for the Portland-based team.</p>

Prosecutors stated that Betro, disguised in a niqab, attempted to shoot Sikander Ali at point-blank range, but the handgun jammed. The attack was part of a bitter family feud involving her co-conspirators, who had hired her for the hit. Betro, who was extradited from Armenia, denied the charges, claiming it was a case of mistaken identity, but was ultimately convicted and will be sentenced on August 21.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including meat, milk, and frozen foods, amid concerns about rising prices due to tariffs. The 10% discount, previously limited to produce and general merchandise, will now apply to 95% of store items for its 1.6 million U.S. employees after 90 days of employment. The move comes as Walmart has warned that price increases from tariffs are inevitable and more than the company can absorb. The expanded benefit is intended to help employees with their budgets and may also encourage them to shop more at Walmart.</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like produce, dairy, and meat in over 1,000 U.S. cities and towns. The service, which will be available to Prime members for free on orders over $25, aims to integrate grocery shopping with the platform's broader retail offerings, allowing customers to order food alongside electronics or household goods. This expansion positions Amazon to compete more directly with services like Instacart and Walmart+, with plans to reach a total of 2,300 new locations by the end of 2025, enhancing convenience for its vast customer base.</p>

          <p>A new forecast from the Senior Citizens League estimates that the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 could be 2.7%. This would be a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment beneficiaries received for the current year. The official COLA is determined by the Social Security Administration in the fall, based on inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has remained below 3% in 2025, some economists express concern that the projected adjustment may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to factors like tariffs.

          <p>Traffic to major pornography websites in the United Kingdom has seen a significant decline since new, stricter age verification rules came into effect on July 25. According to data analytics firm Similarweb, leading site Pornhub experienced a 47% decrease in traffic in the two weeks following the change, losing over one million daily visitors. The Online Safety Act mandates that adult sites implement robust age checks to prevent access by minors. While compliant sites have seen a drop, data suggests some smaller, less-regulated sites have seen an increase in visits, and VPN usage has surged.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their A-level, T-level, and BTec results, with expectations that the proportion of top grades will be similar to last year. This follows several years of grade fluctuations due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a subsequent effort to return to pre-pandemic standards. The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, predicted a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement. This cohort received lower GCSE grades as part of the grade deflation plan, a factor universities are expected to consider in their admissions decisions.</p>

          <p>With interest rates remaining elevated and the potential for future rate cuts, financial experts suggest that now may be an opportune time to consider investing in annuities for retirement income. This article suggests that annuities can provide a stable, guaranteed income stream, offering a hedge against market volatility and inflation. The amount to invest depends on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, and existing income sources, with experts often recommending an allocation of 20% to 50% of a portfolio. Acting now could allow retirees to lock in higher payout rates before they potentially decrease. (not investment advice)</p>
