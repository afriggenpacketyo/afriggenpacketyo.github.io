          <p>Tropical Storm Jerry has formed over the central Atlantic Ocean, marking the tenth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Currently far from land, the system is tracking westward and is expected to strengthen into a hurricane in the coming days. While no coastal watches or warnings are in effect yet, forecasters at the National Hurricane Center anticipate that the northern Leeward Islands may require them soon. The storm is projected to pass near or north of these islands by Thursday or Friday, generating life-threatening surf and rip currents even if it does not make direct landfall, continuing a relatively quiet hurricane season.</p>

          <p>Jordi Alba, the decorated Spanish left-back, has announced he will retire from professional football at the conclusion of Inter Miami's current MLS season. The decision comes as a surprise, as the 36-year-old had signed a contract extension with the club through 2027 just five months ago. Alba joined Inter Miami in 2023, reuniting with former Barcelona teammates Lionel Messi and Sergio Busquets, who also recently announced his retirement. Over his illustrious career, Alba won numerous titles with Barcelona, including five La Liga championships and the Champions League, and was a key part of Spain's dominant national team.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines three crucial rights that borrowers possess when dealing with third-party debt collectors, as established by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). These protections include the right to be treated fairly and without harassment, prohibiting tactics like threats, profane language, or public shaming. Borrowers also have the right to demand and verify information, forcing collectors to prove the debt is legitimate before resuming collection efforts. Finally, consumers have the right to control communication, including the ability to demand in writing that a collector cease all contact, providing crucial breathing room to assess their options.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The World Trade Organization has significantly increased its forecast for global trade growth in 2025 to 2.4%, up from a previous estimate of 0.9%. This upward revision is attributed to strong U.S. import demand, favorable macroeconomic conditions, and a surge in demand for AI-related goods like semiconductors. However, the outlook for 2026 is less optimistic, with the WTO slashing its growth prediction to just 0.5%. This anticipated slowdown is due to the cooling global economy and the delayed but full impact of widespread trade tariffs, which have become a major headwind for international commerce.

          <p>Renowned chef Sean Brock, a pivotal figure in modern Southern cuisine, has opened his first West Coast restaurant, Darling, in West Hollywood.

          <p>Arsenal Football Club is conducting internal discussions about a potential expansion of Emirates Stadium to increase its capacity. The talks are in the preliminary stages, with no concrete plans finalized, but the club is considering options to add thousands of seats. One possibility discussed includes temporarily relocating home matches to Wembley Stadium while construction takes place. With a current capacity of just over 60,000, the Emirates is the fifth-largest club stadium in England, and an expansion would help the Gunners keep pace with rivals like Manchester United and Tottenham, who have larger venues.</p>

          <h2>Psychology Expert Outlines Five Rules for Happiness Independent of Wealth</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 11:51:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to research for the book "The Art of Spending Money," true happiness stems from contentment rather than the endless pursuit of wealth. The article outlines five key principles for achieving psychological well-being without needing a lot of money. These include finding beauty in ordinary life, understanding that contentment is more valuable than riches, and recognizing that desire for what one lacks only highlights current unhappiness. The author argues that managing expectations is crucial, as happiness is ultimately the gap between one's circumstances and what one expects from them, making contentment the true measure of wealth.</p>

          <p>Tesla has fueled investor excitement with a series of cryptic teasers pointing to a major announcement, just as it released an updated version of its full self-driving supervised technology.

The announcement comes as Tesla seeks to shift focus from a multi-quarter sales slump toward its future as a robotics and autonomous vehicle company. The company has not released a new model since the Cybertruck in late 2023, and investors are eager for fresh products.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is increasing its position in GE Vernova, purchasing 20 additional shares of the power equipment manufacturer. The move is based on a long-term conviction in the growing demand for energy infrastructure to power artificial intelligence data centers. Following OpenAI's recent announcement of new partnerships to deploy massive AI data centers, the club sees a significant opportunity for power suppliers like GE Vernova. Despite softness in the company's onshore wind business, the core business of providing gas turbines and grid solutions is seen as a compelling investment in the AI-driven future.
