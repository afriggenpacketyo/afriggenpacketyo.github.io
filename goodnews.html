          <p>Commentator Dan Hardy has labeled the upcoming PFL lightweight title rematch between Paul Hughes and Usman Nurmagomedov as the most significant fight in the promotion's history. He noted that Hughes's confidence was a key factor in their first encounter, where the Northern Irishman pushed the undefeated champion further than any previous opponent. While Nurmagomedov won the initial bout by unanimous decision, the dramatic and competitive nature of the fight has created immense anticipation for their second meeting in Dubai. Hardy expects Nurmagomedov to adopt a more wrestling-heavy strategy this time.</p>

          <p>A new wave of Chinese restaurants is transforming the culinary scene in Paris, offering authentic, regional dishes that cater to a younger and more diverse clientele. Establishments like Tonton Mao are moving beyond traditional Cantonese fare, specializing in specific cuisines such as northeastern China's kaochuan meat skewers. This trend is driven by a new generation of Chinese immigrants who are bringing specialized chefs and culturally specific decor to the French capital. The shift marks a significant expansion of the city's Chinese culinary footprint, providing more authentic and varied dining experiences.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan to prevent the collapse of Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. The investors state that this plan would rebuild the utility without requiring taxpayer funding or government support, which has been on standby for a potential temporary nationalization. The plan also stipulates that no dividends will be paid to shareholders during the turnaround period.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Imelda made landfall in Bermuda as a Category 2 storm, bringing powerful winds and heavy rain to the island before weakening to a Category 1 and moving out into the Atlantic. As of early Thursday, the storm's center was moving away from Bermuda, with maximum sustained winds of 90 mph. The National Hurricane Center expects Imelda to continue weakening and become an extratropical cyclone. While a hurricane warning remained in effect, there were no immediate reports of significant damage from the storm, which was forecast to drop 2 to 4 inches of rain.</p>

          <p>AI leader OpenAI has completed a secondary share sale valued at $6.6 billion, allowing employees to sell stock at a new company valuation of $500 billion. This transaction solidifies OpenAI's position as the world's most valuable privately held company, surpassing SpaceX. While up to $10.3 billion in shares were authorized for sale, only about two-thirds were sold, which is reportedly seen internally as a sign of employee confidence in the company's future. The sale provides liquidity for long-term employees and helps OpenAI retain talent amid intense competition without pursuing a public stock offering.</p>

          <p>In preparation for future lunar exploration, Chinese researchers are training and testing four-legged robotic dogs in environments that simulate underground caves on the moon. The tests are being conducted in a lava tube cave in Heilongjiang province, chosen for its resemblance to potential lunar underground structures. These robots are designed to act as scouts, navigating narrow passages inaccessible to humans to perform surveying tasks. This research aims to advance the embodied intelligence technologies necessary for deep-space exploration and the potential establishment of human bases on the moon.</p>

          <p>Major European defense companies, including Saab, BAE Systems, and Rheinmetall, have welcomed the political momentum behind establishing a multi-layered "drone wall" along the continent's eastern flank. The initiative aims to counter increasing security threats, particularly from Russia, following recent airspace incursions reported by several NATO member states. While the companies stand ready to contribute technology and expertise, some industry experts express concern that the project could be slowed by bureaucracy. The plan reflects a growing consensus in Europe on the need for collaborative defense against unmanned aerial systems.</p>

He argues that these systems are designed to predict the most likely next word and often align with user prompts, which is contrary to the contrarian thinking that drives major breakthroughs. Wolf suggests that scientists who achieve revolutionary insights often challenge existing consensus with unlikely but true ideas. He believes current AI will serve as a valuable "co-pilot" for research rather than an independent source of groundbreaking scientific innovation.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has described the two-child benefit cap as having a "devastating impact" and indicated there is a "real urgency" to address it. The policy, introduced by the Conservatives, restricts Universal Credit and child tax credit payments for third or subsequent children born after April 2017. The government is reportedly considering options to reform or replace the limit in the upcoming budget, with ideas like a tapered system being explored. Campaigners and think tanks argue that scrapping the cap would be a highly effective way to lift hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty.</p>
