The independent candidate, strongly backed by major left-wing parties, pledged in her acceptance speech to be an inclusive president for all citizens. She committed to being a voice for peace, upholding neutrality, addressing the existential threat of climate change, and recognizing extensive work across the country. Her triumph, officially declared at Dublin Castle, signifies a clear mandate from the people and a notable win for the combined opposition against the established parties.</p>

Johnson explains that she wears dresses in which she feels beautiful and comfortable, acknowledging that not every bold style works for her. Her fashion-forward approach has occasionally led to amusing on-screen moments, yet she consistently embraces her fun and sexy personal style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Compelling footage captured in Yellowstone National Park illustrates how a pack of wolves successfully collaborated to drive a grizzly bear away from a bison carcass. While a lone grizzly can typically displace one or two wolves, the coordinated efforts of the 8 Mile Pack proved too much for the bear. The wolves worked as a team, alternately nipping at the male grizzly's hide to keep him confused and unable to mount an offensive. This observation highlights the complex and dynamic predator interactions within the park, where pack numbers can significantly alter typical interspecies dominance over food resources.</p>

          <p>Germany's Defense Minister Boris Pistorius observed a reconnaissance flight demonstrating how Boeing P-8 Poseidon aircraft detect Russian submarines, a system Germany will acquire eight of for its navy. These military planes, based on the Boeing 737, are equipped with highly sensitive radar and sonar to monitor the North Atlantic and Baltic Sea alongside NATO allies. The initiative aims to enhance European security, protect critical infrastructure like submarine cables, and signal increased responsibility to both Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin regarding defense efforts. This acquisition is part of Germany's broader commitment to strengthening NATO's European component and significantly increasing its defense budget.</p>

          <p>Kamala Harris has strongly indicated she is not done with politics, leaving open the possibility of another presidential run in a wide-ranging BBC interview. Promoting her new book, "107 Days," she reflected on her 2024 election loss to Donald Trump, whose presidency she described as authoritarian, validating her earlier campaign warnings. While not committing to a 2028 bid, she expressed a firm belief that a woman would eventually be president in her grandnieces' lifetime. However, recent polls in her home state of California show less than a third of voters support her having another presidential try.</p>

          <p>The "VOO and chill" strategy of passive investing through S&P 500 ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO) is reportedly losing its appeal, even with stocks at all-time highs, due to growing diversification concerns. Investors are actively seeking broader market exposure beyond concentrated indexes, as technology now accounts for over 35% of the S&P 500, a record high, while defensive sectors are at an all-time low weight of 19%. This imbalance is driving renewed interest in small-cap stocks, with the Russell 2000 recently hitting an all-time high and significantly outperforming the S&P 500. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced the EU's firm commitment to ending its reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are critical for modern technology and military applications. China's recent export curbs have severely impacted European industries, prompting the EU to urgently seek alternative sources and strengthen its "toolbox" for responding to such pressures. The comprehensive strategy involves recycling up to 95% of critical raw materials, boosting domestic production and post-processing capabilities, and establishing strategic partnerships with countries like Ukraine, Australia, Canada, and Greenland. This initiative is part of a broader push for greater European independence in key strategic sectors.</p>

          <p>Billionaire investor Mark Cuban advocates that for the average person, smart money moves often involve practical savings like bulk shopping rather than attempting to pick the right stock. He highlights that saving 40% on $2,000 worth of annual household consumables can yield $800 in tangible savings, which he considers a superior investment. Cuban strongly emphasizes paying with cash to avoid accumulating credit card debt, which he views as one of the biggest financial mistakes. His advice underscores that sometimes the most effective investment is in everyday cost-cutting and responsible spending, not complex market speculation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One year after the historic removal of four hydroelectric dams on the Klamath River, the ecosystem is demonstrating remarkable recovery, inspiring river restoration movements globally. Threatened coho salmon and Chinook salmon have returned to upstream habitats for the first time in decades or even a century, and diverse wildlife, including bald eagles and beavers, is flourishing. Indigenous youth, who were the first to kayak the entire river post-removal, are now advocating for other rivers worldwide, demonstrating that large-scale ecological restoration is achievable.

          <p>The Octagon, one of Washington D.C.'s oldest homes completed in 1801, serves as a museum and event space with a rich history and a notable reputation for being haunted. Designed by the U.S. Capitol's first architect, this significant landmark temporarily housed President James Madison and Dolley Madison after the White House burned in 1814, where Madison notably signed the Treaty of Ghent. The building, which also reveals the lives of enslaved people who worked there, is known for unexplained occurrences like flickering lights and security alarms.
