          <p>The stock market experienced a modest increase following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom. The S&P 500 gained 0.6% to close at 5,664, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6% to 41,368 points, and the Nasdaq Composite added 1.1%. Bitcoin and crude oil prices also climbed, while gold prices dipped, signaling rising investor confidence in riskier assets. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, especially in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers that unfairly discriminated against American products. Trump encouraged Americans to buy stocks, anticipating further trade deals and the passage of the reconciliation bill.</p>

          <p>The United States and the United Kingdom have reached an agreement to reduce import taxes on a set number of British cars and allow some steel and aluminum into the country tariff-free. While leaders from both countries hailed the agreement as significant, analysts suggest it does not substantially alter the terms of trade between the two nations. The US has agreed to reduce the import tax on 100,000 cars a year to 10%, while tariffs on steel and aluminum have also been slashed, and there's an agreement for reciprocal access for beef exports. The deal is seen as a potential win for US ranchers.</p>
