          <p>The Budapest Pride march is proceeding despite legal threats from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. A new "child protection" law restricts pro-LGBTQ gatherings, and attendees face potential fines up to ‚Ç¨500, with organizers facing possible prison time. Despite the pressure, organizers and participants, including EU officials, are defying the ban, with Budapest's liberal mayor asserting the event is legal as it is co-organized by the city. The event highlights the growing tension between Hungary's conservative government and civil rights advocates within the country and the broader European Union.</p>

          <p>While dive bars are vanishing across America, they remain vibrant community centers in Montana, characterized by their unique decor and diverse clientele. The article explores several establishments, from the peanut-shell-covered floors of the Haufbrau in Bozeman to the clean, community-run Dusty's Bar in Brady. These bars serve as more than just places to drink; they are spaces for connection, storytelling, and mutual support, where locals from all walks of life gather. Despite the rising costs that prevent new dive bars from opening, these existing institutions thrive on a sense of belonging and shared history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial planners suggest that paying for a laundry service can be a smart decision for some, but it requires careful consideration. Experts advise asking four key questions: if the service costs less than your personal hourly rate, if outsourcing the chore will genuinely boost your emotional wellbeing, if you are truly comfortable with the premium price, and if the expense will not compromise your long-term financial goals like retirement savings. The core idea is to treat personal finances like a business, strategically outsourcing tasks to free up time and mental energy for more valuable activities without sacrificing future security.

          <p>This opinion article argues that Zohran Mamdani's surprising victory in the New York City mayoral primary is intrinsically linked to his vocal support for Palestinian liberation. The author contends that years of grassroots activism by Palestinians and their allies have shifted public opinion, making his stance an asset rather than a political liability. The campaign's success was built on a coalition of organized people, including student activists and groups like Jewish Voice for Peace, who were drawn to his rejection of the pro-Israel Democratic establishment. This victory is presented as evidence that Palestine has become a central issue in domestic progressive politics.</p>
