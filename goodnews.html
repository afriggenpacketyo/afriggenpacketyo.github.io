        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A welterweight boxing match between Jack Catterall and Harlem Eubank ended prematurely when an accidental clash of heads in the sixth round caused a severe cut above Catterall's eye. The bout was stopped at the start of the seventh round and went to the judges' scorecards, where Catterall was awarded a technical decision victory. While Catterall controlled the fight, neither boxer took significant risks, leading to a cautious bout. The outcome marked the first professional defeat for Eubank, who immediately called for a rematch, though promoters suggested Catterall will now move back toward world title contention.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent online discussion has highlighted that many millennial women are experiencing perimenopause without prior knowledge of the condition, which they describe as 'puberty 2.0.' Women shared a wide range of symptoms, including irregular periods, mood swings, hormonal acne, insomnia, and brain fog, often beginning in their late 30s. Many expressed frustration over the lack of information from medical professionals and in public education, forcing them to advocate for their own health. The conversation underscores a significant gap in women's health awareness, with many feeling isolated and confused by the changes.</p>

          <p>Many young people in the UK are struggling to find summer jobs due to a common paradox: needing experience to get experience. This article provides practical advice for job seekers, emphasizing that employers don't expect a packed resume from teenagers. Experts suggest highlighting transferable skills from volunteering, sports, or even home responsibilities. Other tips include keeping CVs simple, tailoring cover letters to the job description, and showing initiative by dropping off resumes in person at smaller businesses. The guidance aims to help young applicants stand out and overcome the initial barrier of having no formal work history.</p>

          <h2>UK's Lifetime ISA Program Draws Both Praise for Homebuying and Criticism for Penalties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 19:09:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Lifetime ISA (LISA) is a financial product that divides opinion, offering a 25% government bonus for savings toward a first home or retirement but imposing stiff penalties for early withdrawal. While some users have successfully used it to fund a home purchase, others have been penalized, losing a portion of their own savings. A key criticism is the £450,000 property value cap, which has not been updated since 2017 despite rising house prices. Critics argue this threshold is unfair and deters potential savers, calling for reforms to eliminate the penalty for those who exceed the property limit. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green, a Republican from Tennessee, has officially announced his resignation from Congress, a move that will further shrink the GOP's already slim majority in the House of Representatives. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving to start a private sector business aimed at helping the U.S. compete against China. His departure leaves House Speaker Mike Johnson with an even smaller margin for passing legislation, a challenge that was evident during recent struggles to pass a major spending bill. His resignation will be effective July 20.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the formation of a new political party called the 'America Party,' stating it will give Americans 'back your freedom.' The move follows a public falling out with President Donald Trump over a massive government spending bill that Musk vehemently opposed. The billionaire, who was a major donor to Trump's 2024 campaign, suggested the new party could focus on a small number of congressional seats to act as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The announcement signals a dramatic split from his former ally and an attempt to create a new force in U.S. politics.</p>

The all-day event, dubbed the 'heavy metal Live Aid,' also featured performances from rock icons like Metallica and Guns N' Roses, who paid tribute to Black Sabbath's influence.

          <p>Newport Beach lifeguards performed 350 rescues on the Fourth of July holiday due to dangerous surf and strong rip currents. One particularly large 'monster rip current' pulled more than ten swimmers far from shore, requiring a significant rescue effort involving lifeboats and aerial support. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for dangerous swimming conditions across Southern California beaches for the holiday weekend, with elevated surf creating powerful currents that can pull people out to sea. The high number of rescues highlights the ocean's potential dangers during peak season.</p>
