          <p>China's largest trade fair, the Canton Fair, experienced a surge in overseas attendance and overall transaction volume, despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States. The spring edition of the fair saw a 17.3% year-on-year increase in overseas buyers, reaching a record high of 288,938, with a notable absence of American participants. Transaction volume also rose by 3% to US$25.44 billion, driven primarily by countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative, which accounted for over 60% of the total transaction volume. The article notes that while the fair's performance was impressive, transaction volumes remain below pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>The UK government is allocating ¬£102 million to over 1,000 GP surgeries for upgrades and expansions, aiming to improve patient access and reduce waiting times. Health Secretary Wes Streeting emphasizes that this investment will help transform the NHS by providing additional space for doctors to see more patients. This marks the largest public investment in GP facilities in five years, addressing the issue of long waiting times and the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments. The article also notes a decline in patient satisfaction with GP services since the pandemic, driven by fewer in-person appointments.</p>
