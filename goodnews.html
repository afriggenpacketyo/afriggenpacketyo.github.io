        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has formally terminated its sanctions program against Syria through an executive order, fulfilling a promise made by the president in May. This move follows the collapse of the Assad regime and the establishment of a new transitional government, which has been advocating for sanctions relief to aid in reconstruction and stabilize the country. While the general sanctions are lifted to encourage new investment, specific sanctions will remain on former president Bashar al-Assad, his associates, and entities linked to human rights abuses, terrorism, and chemical weapons. This policy shift is supported by regional allies like Turkey and Saudi Arabia, who see an opportunity to realign Syria's foreign policy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dating app Tinder is now requiring users in California to verify their identity using a facial recognition feature called "Face Check" when creating a new profile. This pilot program aims to combat the rise of fraud and romance scams by ensuring users are real people and match their profile photos. The technology, powered by FaceTec, scans a short video selfie to confirm authenticity and prevent impersonation, awarding verified users a blue checkmark. While Tinder states the data is deleted after an account is closed, the move raises ongoing discussions about privacy and the use of biometric data in technology services.</p>

          <p>The first six months of 2025 serve as a lesson in maintaining investment discipline despite market volatility, according to this market analysis. Initial selloffs, prompted by fears over President Trump's tariff policies, ultimately gave way to strong gains for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq. The article suggests that Trump's aggressive negotiation style often leads to less severe outcomes than initially feared, creating buying opportunities for discerning investors.

          <p>The White House has declared that Canada "caved" to pressure from President Trump by revoking its planned digital services tax (DST). The reversal came after Trump threatened to terminate trade negotiations if the tax, which would have primarily affected U.S. tech companies, was implemented. A top economic aide suggested the U.S. will now push other countries to drop similar taxes. Canada stated the move was to advance broader trade negotiations, with both countries now aiming to reach a new trade deal by late July, demonstrating the Trump administration's aggressive use of trade leverage to influence foreign tax policy.</p>
