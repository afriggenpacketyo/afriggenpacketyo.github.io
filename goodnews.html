This article features personal testimonies and research suggesting that approximately 15% of users experience reduced libido, potentially linked to the pill's impact on testosterone levels. While the contraceptive pill has revolutionized women's sexual autonomy, it can also lead to physical symptoms like vaginal dryness and emotional fluctuations for some.

          <p>Former Deputy Prime Minister Sir Nick Clegg has voiced strong criticism regarding UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's perceived deference to US President Donald Trump, describing their relationship as "slightly cringey." Speaking at the Liberal Democrat conference, Clegg urged the Prime Minister to assert British values and openly challenge aspects of the Trump administration's policies, including its lukewarm attitude towards NATO. He contended that the UK government's efforts to court Trump are based on a "miscalculation" that Britain can avoid choosing between the US and the EU. The article also notes Clegg's recent return from Meta and his endorsement of calls for social media health warnings for children.</p>

          <p>Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has granted approval for a £2.2bn privately-funded second runway at London Gatwick Airport, a decision aimed at stimulating economic growth. The project entails repositioning the existing Northern Runway by 12 meters to facilitate its regular operation, projecting an increase to approximately 389,000 annual flights and 80 million passengers by the late 2030s. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves anticipates substantial job creation and investment, environmental groups, including the Green Party, have condemned the expansion as a "disaster for the climate crisis." The approval came after Gatwick committed to stringent noise controls and enhanced public transport usage targets, reflecting the contentious balance between economic development and environmental protection.</p>
