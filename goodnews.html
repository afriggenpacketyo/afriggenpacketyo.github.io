          <h2>Tesla's Australian Sales Surge in May Amidst Global Headwinds</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla experienced a significant rebound in Australian sales during May, reaching a nearly 12-month high, driven by record sales of the revamped Model Y compact SUV. While Model Y sales soared, sales of the Model 3 declined, but overall deliveries in Australia increased substantially compared to April. Despite this positive performance, Tesla's year-to-date sales in Australia remain lower compared to the previous year, and global sales were down in the first quarter. While the Australian rebound is a positive sign, it does not yet indicate a broader global recovery for the company. </p>

          <p>Authorities in Cologne, Germany, evacuated approximately 20,000 people as experts worked to defuse three unexploded World War II bombs discovered in the city center. The operation, one of the largest of its kind in Cologne, led to the closure of significant areas, including the old city, hotels, care homes, and railway stations. Cologne was heavily targeted by Allied forces during the war, resulting in frequent discoveries of unexploded ordnance. The defusal operation was successful, and residents were allowed to return to their homes. </p>

          <p>Max Muncy's performance in the Dodgers' game against the Mets was a mix of highs and lows, starting with a two-run home run in the first inning, followed by a costly error in the fifth. He redeemed himself with a game-tying home run in the ninth, setting up Freddie Freeman's walk-off double in the tenth. Muncy's recent offensive surge has been significant, but his defense remains a concern. His offensive contributions proved crucial to the Dodgers securing a win and avoiding a three-game losing streak. </p>
