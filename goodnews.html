          <p>Intel announced better-than-expected revenue for the third quarter, indicating a recovery in demand for its x86 processors. This marks the company's first earnings report since the U.S. government became a top shareholder with an $8.9 billion investment, which was reflected in a per-share loss. Intel also secured a $5 billion investment from Nvidia, aiming to integrate its CPUs with Nvidia's AI graphics processors to boost its data center business. The company expects chip demand to outpace supply next year and is expanding its Intel Foundry operations, despite needing substantial capital investment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump has canceled plans to deploy federal troops to San Francisco for an immigration crackdown, reversing an earlier decision that had drawn widespread condemnation from California leaders and prompted protests. The president announced the change after discussions with San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie and Silicon Valley leaders. Governor Gavin Newsom and Attorney General Rob Bonta had strongly opposed the deployment, with Newsom calling it "right out of the dictator's handbook." Local leaders, while relieved, remain vigilant and are preparing rapid response networks, as clarity is still sought on broader federal immigration enforcement plans.</p>

          <p>The World Intellectual Property Organization's (Wipo) annual Global Innovation Index (GII) has placed Switzerland at the top for the 15th consecutive year, while China ranked 10th despite its significant scientific and technological output. This ranking has led to questions and skepticism among some Chinese internet users regarding the index's methodology and authority. The persistent top position of Switzerland over major economies like China, which has a strong sci-tech output, fuels discussions about potential biases in global innovation assessment metrics.</p>

The company's chief privacy and compliance officer for product, Michel Protti, announced the cuts, which are part of broader organizational restructurings, including layoffs in its Superintelligence Labs AI unit. Meta stated that its revamped system utilizes basic automation to apply legal and policy requirements, reducing human error and increasing reliability. This move reflects a growing trend among major companies like JPMorgan Chase and Salesforce to leverage AI to streamline operations and reduce workforce.</p>

          <p>Apple has lost a landmark lawsuit in the UK's Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT), which ruled the tech giant abused its dominant position by charging "excessive and unfair" App Store commission fees. Lawyers for the academic who brought the case estimate Apple could owe around £1.5 billion in damages to approximately 36 million iPhone and iPad users in the UK for purchases made over the last decade. Apple, which faces similar regulatory pressures globally, plans to appeal the decision. The ruling signals a significant victory for consumer rights and competition in the digital marketplace, potentially impacting how major tech companies operate.</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company exceeded Wall Street's third-quarter earnings expectations but reduced its 2025 guidance due to a supplier fire impacting production of its profitable large trucks and SUVs. The fire at an aluminum supplier plant is expected to cost Ford $1.5 billion to $2 billion, though much of this will be mitigated by increased production next year. Ford plans to add 1,000 workers to its Michigan and Kentucky plants to recoup lost units. Despite the setback, the company's "Ford+ plan" for turnaround and cost-cutting is on track, with strong performance in its commercial and traditional operations. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite facing the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced him to close for a year and incur significant debt, Singh's resilience, honed from a challenging childhood, drove him to attend barber school and reopen. Today, with three barbershop locations and his marketing agency, Singh continues to work 15-16 hours daily and plans to launch a third business, Barber's Network.</p>

Sales had dropped in 2019, but Reuss's comments highlight the difficult decisions involved in transitioning to EV production.

          <p>The price of gold recently experienced its largest single-day decline in over a decade, falling 6% to $4,131.47 per ounce, prompting questions about investment opportunities. This article explores whether purchasing gold from retailers like Costco is worthwhile during this dip. It suggests that most gold types are worth considering now, as price declines are often temporary, and many Costco buyers have already seen significant gains. Costco offers an accessible, vetted option for physical bullion without shipping costs for members, though sales are final. For broader investment strategies, specialized gold investing companies offer more diverse options and tailored support. (not investment advice)</p>
