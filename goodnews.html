          <p>During a trip to Asia, former President Donald Trump stated he is "open" to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un at the demilitarized zone, highlighting his previously established relationship. Trump also acknowledged North Korea as being "sort of a nuclear power," recognizing their significant weapons arsenal. White House officials have since clarified that while Trump remains open to dialogue without preconditions, reflecting the approach of his three previous summits with Kim, no such meeting is officially scheduled for this particular trip. The statement underscores a continued, albeit informal, diplomatic channel between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>A family in West Virginia has experienced a medical ordeal after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, exhibited developmental delays and was diagnosed after an MRI, requiring brain surgery that dramatically improved her disposition. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after displaying various symptoms, leading to multiple successful surgeries for the family. Neurosurgeons noted that while a genetic link exists in about 10% of cases, seeing it affect four siblings is highly unusual.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the United Kingdom have uncovered and dismantled the country's first known illicit factory producing counterfeit weight loss drugs in Northampton. The operation resulted in the largest-ever single seizure of trafficked weight loss medicine globally, according to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Officials seized thousands of unlicensed pens for drugs like Retatrutide and Tirzepatide, along with raw ingredients and manufacturing equipment, valued at over £250,000. The MHRA warned that these untested and unauthorized products pose a potentially deadly risk to public health and urged consumers to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview, former Vice-President Kamala Harris suggested she might run for president again, stating she is "not done" with her career in public service. Speaking with the BBC, Harris confirmed it was "possibly" her who could be the first female president, signaling her strongest intention yet for a potential 2028 bid after her loss to Donald Trump. She dismissed unfavorable polling numbers, asserting that she has defied polls throughout her career. Harris also heavily criticized former President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" and claiming he has weaponized federal agencies against political critics, fulfilling warnings she made during her campaign.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock value from Fluor's significant holding in nuclear technology firm NuScale Power. Starboard argues that Fluor's approximately 39% stake in NuScale, which constitutes over 60% of Fluor's market capitalization, is causing the core business to be severely undervalued. The activist investor is pushing for a separation, suggesting options like a tax-free spinoff or an open-market sale of the NuScale shares. This move could re-rate Fluor's stock, potentially unlocking significant upside for shareholders by highlighting the strength of its core operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital city of Tbilisi for attempting to illegally purchase two kilograms of uranium. The suspects allegedly planned to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material with the intention of smuggling it to China via Russia. According to the agency, the operation was coordinated by other group members from China and involved bringing experts to Georgia to search for uranium. The arrests were made during negotiations over the details of the illicit transaction, preventing the transfer of the highly sensitive radioactive material.</p>

          <p>A recent Charles Schwab survey found that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments, such as private equity and real estate, to supplement traditional portfolios of stocks and bonds. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) provide an accessible and liquid way to gain exposure to these typically complex and illiquid asset classes. This trend aligns with record inflows into U.S.-based ETFs this year, particularly those focused on gold and cryptocurrency. While younger investors especially are exploring alternatives, experts recommend limiting such holdings to a small portion of a portfolio, emphasizing that traditional, diversified investing remains a proven strategy for long-term goals.

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. Powell, who was dismissed from the cabinet in September, ran on a platform promising to give grassroots members a stronger voice and advocating for a "bolder" direction for the government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer. In her victory speech, she pledged to be an ally to Starmer but emphasized the need for the party to change its approach and better connect with its core values.

          <p>Former President Donald Trump abruptly canceled the planned deployment of federal agents to San Francisco following a direct phone call with Mayor Daniel Lurie and lobbying from billionaire tech CEOs. Trump's decision highlights an unusual approach to domestic policy, where a potential military or law enforcement action was seemingly determined by personal appeals and relationships rather than strategic assessment. In his social media posts, Trump explicitly mentioned that "friends of mine" had influenced his choice. While the immediate crisis for San Francisco is averted, the incident raises concerns about the capricious nature of such decisions and the influence of powerful private citizens on national security matters.</p>

          <p>Negotiators from Afghanistan and Pakistan are scheduled to meet in Istanbul to strengthen a fragile ceasefire along their shared border following recent deadly clashes. The violence erupted after Afghanistan's Taliban rulers blamed Pakistan for explosions in Kabul and launched cross-border attacks, which prompted retaliatory strikes from Islamabad. A second truce, mediated by Qatar and Turkey, is currently holding, and the talks aim to establish mechanisms to ensure its stability. Pakistan seeks to address what it calls terrorism emanating from Afghan soil, while the Afghan government is focused on maintaining its territorial integrity amidst the tensions.</p>

          <p>Traditionalist Catholics are expressing hope for a more sympathetic Vatican leadership after American Cardinal Raymond Burke was granted permission to celebrate the old Latin Mass in St. Peter's Basilica. This approval from the new Pope Leo XIV is seen as a significant gesture of reconciliation following Pope Francis's 2021 crackdown on the traditional liturgy, which had restricted its use. Organizers of the traditionalist pilgrimage to Rome view the event as a sign of dialogue and listening from the new pontiff. The move comes after years of liturgical divisions within the Church, which intensified after Francis reversed the more permissive policies of his predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI.</p>

          <p>In a significant moment for conservation, trail cameras in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park have captured the first-ever footage of a female Bornean clouded leopard with two cubs. This rare sighting is particularly important because the species has a low reproduction rate, and documenting a breeding female successfully raising two offspring indicates the park provides a healthy, protected habitat. Bornean clouded leopards are a threatened species facing population decline due to deforestation. The footage, shared by the Orangutan Foundation, provides valuable data for researchers and has been met with enthusiasm from conservation supporters online.</p>

          <p>According to a Goldman Sachs report, major Chinese companies are strategically shifting their focus away from the United States and toward less-developed markets like Southeast Asia. This pivot involves moving up the value chain to produce more sophisticated, higher-margin goods. Since 2018, Chinese exports to non-U.S. markets have grown at a compound annual rate of 7.5%, while exports to the U.S. have seen a slight decline. This trend allows Chinese firms to leverage their cost advantages while building new supply chains and diversifying their export destinations in response to geopolitical and trade pressures.

          <p>A new large-scale artificial surf park is set to be developed in the coastal city of El Segundo, California, an unusual location for such a facility which is typically built inland. A company linked to billionaire Vinny Smith, an investor in the Palm Springs Surf Club, purchased 10 acres of a former aerospace campus for $54 million. The planned $175 million project will feature a 2.2-acre lagoon capable of generating consistent, machine-powered waves. Proponents believe the controlled environment will lower the barrier to entry for new surfers and provide a reliable alternative to the often-crowded and unpredictable conditions of the ocean.</p>
