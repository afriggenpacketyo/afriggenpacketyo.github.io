          <p>The Oklahoma City Thunder defeated the Indiana Pacers 123-107 in Game 2 of the NBA Finals, tying the series at one game apiece. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander led the Thunder with 34 points, supported by strong performances from Alex Caruso and Aaron Wiggins off the bench. The Pacers struggled with their three-point shooting, which allowed Oklahoma City to take control of the game. Every Indiana starter scored in double figures, but their combined efforts were not enough to overcome the Thunder's strong offensive showing as the series now heads back to Indiana for Game 3.</p>

The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and delicate seabed habitats. Environmental groups like Greenpeace UK and The Wildlife Trust have welcomed the proposal, emphasizing its potential benefits for both nature and the climate.</p>
