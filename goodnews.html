          <p>A Mexican Navy training ship, the Cuauht√©moc, sustained damage after its masts collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. The incident occurred during a festive visit to the US, with footage showing the ship's towering masts clipping the bridge as it passed underneath. Parts of the masts reportedly fell onto the deck, and while initial reports suggested multiple injuries, the Mexican Navy confirmed the damage and initiated an investigation into the cause of the collision, although they did not report on the injury reports. The incident prompted a response from New York City's Emergency Management.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, two prominent figures in women's basketball, addressed a heated moment following a flagrant foul during the Indiana Fever's dominant 93-58 win against the Chicago Sky. Clark was called for the flagrant foul after a hard foul on Reese, leading to an exchange between the two players. Both Clark and Reese downplayed the severity of the incident after the game, characterizing it as a routine basketball play. The game marked Clark's WNBA debut, where she achieved a triple-double with 20 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.</p>

Liu, who had voluntarily signed up and was assigned to an armed police force, repeatedly requested to leave the army. As a result, he is now banned from working for the government or state-owned enterprises, must pay a fine of 38,000 yuan (US$5,300), and is restricted from traveling abroad, studying, opening a business, or accessing preferential loan policies for two years.

          <p>For the third consecutive year, the United Kingdom's Eurovision entry faced disappointment, with Remember Monday finishing in 19th place. Despite strong vocals and harmonies from the group, the song was criticized for being a "manic mish-mash of musical styles" that lacked consistency. While the professional juries recognized the clever British touches and witty lyrics, the song failed to resonate with the public vote. The staging, designed to highlight the band's friendship, was considered too busy and lacking the impact of other performances.</p>

          <p>President Trump has criticized Walmart for blaming tariffs on increased prices, urging the retail giant to "eat the tariffs" instead of passing the costs onto consumers. This follows Walmart's warning that prices on various goods could increase due to import duties. Trump insisted that foreign producers should pay for the tariffs and that companies should absorb the additional expenses. A Walmart spokesperson stated that the company aims to keep prices as low as possible, but there is a limit to what they can bear given small retail margins.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler surged to the lead at the US PGA Championship after a third-round 65, placing him three shots ahead of Alex Nor√©n. Scheffler's round was highlighted by an eagle on the 14th hole and birdies on 15 and 17, demonstrating his strong form. The third day was delayed due to scattered thunderstorms, but the change did not slow down Scheffler's momentum. Only four players this century have won the US PGA Championship after coming from three or more behind at the 54-hole stage, making Scheffler the favorite heading into the final round.</p>

A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month.

The survey also indicated that 73 percent of the respondents believe that a shift in how top management views the issue is needed to increase the number of women in senior roles.</p>
