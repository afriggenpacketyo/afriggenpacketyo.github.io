          <p>Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, has made significant gains in recent English local elections, positioning itself as a major challenger to the traditional parties. The party won hundreds of seats, seizing control of several councils from the Conservatives and even displacing Labour in some areas. Farage declared that Reform UK has overtaken the Tories as the main opposition to Labour, signaling a potential shift in the British political landscape. The article notes the Conservatives suffered heavy losses, while Labour also saw its vote share dented by Reform UK, reflecting a fragmentation of the political landscape.</p>

          <p>The blood of a US man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades has led to an "unparalleled" antivenom, say scientists. Antibodies found in Tim Friede's blood have been shown to protect against fatal doses from a wide range of species in animal tests. The antivenom has shown protection against multiple species of mambas, cobras, taipans and kraits. Current therapies have to match the specific species of venomous snake anyone has been bitten by.</p>
