          <p>Bijan Robinson delivered a standout performance, rushing for a career-high 170 yards and scoring an impressive 81-yard touchdown, propelling the Atlanta Falcons to a 24-14 victory over the Buffalo Bills. This defeat marks the Bills' second consecutive loss, prompting questions about the true strength of their early-season record against less formidable opponents. Quarterback Josh Allen faced difficulties, throwing two crucial interceptions, while Atlanta solidified its win with a decisive late-game drive and robust defensive efforts. The article meticulously recounts the key moments and individual contributions that defined the outcome of this NFL matchup.</p>

          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers executed an astonishing and unusual double play in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. With bases loaded and one out, a deep fly ball was initially mishandled but recovered, leading to a force out at second base. Subsequent confusion on the bases then allowed the catcher to tag third for the final out, dramatically preventing the Dodgers from scoring. This article highlights the rare defensive gem, though the Brewers' offense remained limited, eventually losing the game to a Dodgers home run.</p>

However, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) warned that growth is likely to moderate in 2026 as activity normalizes in trade-related sectors. Manufacturing and construction showed slower growth, while global AI investment is expected to support manufacturing. This article outlines the current economic performance and future outlook, with the MAS maintaining its policy settings despite significant declines in inflation.</p>
