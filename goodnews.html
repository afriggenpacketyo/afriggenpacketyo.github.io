          <p>Astronomers have detected 3I/ATLAS, the third known interstellar object to enter our solar system, identified as a comet approximately 670 million kilometers from the sun. While much remains unknown about its precise origin and composition, current projections indicate it poses no danger to Earth, passing by at about 240 million km in October. Scientists continue to monitor its trajectory and activity, with new telescopes like the Vera Rubins expected to detect several more such objects over the next decade. The European Space Agency is also developing a "Comet Interceptor" spacecraft, scheduled for launch in 2029, to intercept distant comets and asteroids.</p>

          <p>A cardiologist, drawing on 20 years of treating heart disease, advises against feeding children five specific processed foods due to their long-term health risks and the damage they can inflict. These include microwave popcorn (PFAS, harmful flavorings), flavored yogurts (high sugar, artificial dyes), processed meats (sodium, nitrates, impact on blood vessel health), sugary cereals/drinks (excessive sugar, blood sugar crashes), and deep-fried foods (harmful compounds from reused oils, taste bud training). The article emphasizes making smarter, unprocessed choices like air-popped popcorn, plain Greek yogurt with fruit, lean proteins, and air-fried vegetables, encouraging parents to lead by example for healthier dietary habits.</p>

          <h2>Deciding if Hiring Movers is Worth the Cost: Key Considerations</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When considering hiring professional movers, financial experts suggest evaluating four key questions to determine if the cost is justified. These include assessing the value of items that would be expensive to replace, calculating whether the cost is worth the time saved, considering the benefit to one's peace of mind and stress levels, and ensuring that outsourcing the move does not jeopardize long-term financial goals. The average cost for a local two-to-three-bedroom move is $1,250, while a long-distance move can average $4,890. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>New Philosophy Advocates for Valuing Women's Bodies for Functionality</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 09:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two recent book reviews propose a philosophy that shifts the focus from women's bodies as aesthetic objects to valuing them for their functionality and capability. Casey Johnston's book on weightlifting emphasizes building muscle and rejecting diet culture, transforming one's relationship with their body through strength training, which can improve physical well-being and daily ease. Similarly, Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson's biography of designer Claire McCardell highlights fashion that prioritizes practicality and comfort, seeing women as "doers" rather than just subjects of appearance. This approach encourages valuing physical capabilities over superficial appearances, promoting a healthier and more empowering self-perception.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists at the Magna Roman Fort in Northumberland, northern England, have unearthed a collection of "unusually large" 2,000-year-old shoes, including one measuring nearly 13 inches. This discovery is puzzling, as only a small fraction of existing Roman shoe collections are of similar size, but about a quarter from the Magna site are. Researchers are now investigating which regiments might have been stationed there, considering the broad diversity of the Roman Empire, to explain the prevalence of such large footwear. This finding offers new insights into the daily lives and physical characteristics of people living at the fort two millennia ago.</p>

          <p>Apple recently achieved a major box office success with its film "F1," demonstrating its strong long-term investment in services and cultural impact. However, the article highlights significant concerns about Apple's lagging artificial intelligence advancements, particularly with Siri, which remains a rigid question-and-answer system despite generative AI breakthroughs. Wall Street analysts express low expectations for Apple Intelligence to drive an upgrade cycle, noting rivals like Google and Meta are aggressively integrating sophisticated AI. Reports suggest Apple may even consider using external AI technology, a departure from its core strategy.</p>

          <p>The article compiles a list of five "feel-good" TV shows recommended by Atlantic writers and editors for unwinding after a hard day. These include "Bones," praised as an uplifting love letter to public service and scientific knowledge despite its copaganda elements; the absurd and culinary-focused "Hannibal"; Season 3 of "The Office," which marked a shift towards more comfort and less cringe; the "evergreen and endearingly of its time" mockumentary "Parks and Recreation"; and the deeply satisfying sketch comedy "Portlandia." Each show offers a unique blend of humor, comfort, or underlying positive themes.</p>

          <p>Large parts of the Czech Republic experienced a major power blackout on Friday, confirmed by grid operator CEPS, affecting areas including the capital, Prague, and halting train lines in five districts. The cause was identified as a fallen power line, and electricity supply was quickly restored to most impacted areas within minutes to half an hour. Police stated there was no information suggesting a cyber or terror attack, distinguishing this incident from past blackout fears in Europe. Prime Minister Petr Fiala described the situation as "extraordinary and unpleasant," but the rapid resolution mitigated widespread disruption.</p>

          <p>An essay reflects on re-reading Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own" and finding its continued relevance to modern feminism, despite initial skepticism. The author, a working-class Latina, initially felt alienated by what seemed like a privileged white feminist discourse but now appreciates Woolf's insights on women's need for personal space and financial independence to create art. The article draws parallels between Woolf's observations on societal limitations and contemporary issues of economic disparity, stereotypes in storytelling, and the scarcity of time for women, highlighting the ongoing struggle for equity.</p>

          <p>The article explores how the American Revolutionary War, under General George Washington, laid the foundations for a national American identity among diverse and often provincial colonists. Initially viewing his troops as "dirty & nasty people," Washington came to respect their sacrifice, fostering unity through shared suffering and new traditions like celebrating his birthday and adopting a unifying flag. The war's veterans, many becoming Federalists, later championed a strong central government, believing it essential for the nation's future. This historical account highlights the messy, ongoing process of defining what it means to be American.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously approved a ban on "disaster tourism" buses in the Pacific Palisades fire zone and other disaster areas, following reports of commercial tour operators profiting from the destruction. This measure aims to stop the unsettling and potentially hazardous trend for ongoing recovery crews, as the area continues to clear fire debris. The ban will remain in effect for the duration of emergency responses, with consideration for permanent restrictions in the Palisades due to its narrow, winding streets, which are unsuitable for large buses even under normal circumstances.</p>
