          <h2>Universities Face Course Cuts Amid Financial Challenges, Collaboration Urged</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 20:58:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Universities in England are facing financial strain due to a drop in international students and rising costs, leading to course cutbacks and closures. A government review is underway to address long-term funding for higher education, while the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) supports collaboration among universities to navigate these challenges. A Universities UK report suggests greater collaboration could prevent subject "cold spots," where students lack local access to desired courses. The CMA acknowledges the financial problems and aims to support collaboration, such as sharing back-office functions and discussing mergers, to promote efficiency and maintain educational opportunities for students. The review will be published before the summer.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete from California, competed in the CIF track-and-field finals, winning first place medals in both high jump and triple jump and placing second in the long jump event.

Following a rule change by the California Interscholastic Federation, a co-winner was named in each of the three events in which Hernandez placed. Some high school coaches offered their support for Hernandez, emphasizing the importance of grace and understanding for a high schooler navigating a complex situation.

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her role in the U.S. Capitol Insurrection, is refusing and returning her pardon. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, stated that the pardons contribute to a false narrative and that those involved were guilty. She has sought assistance from her Republican senator to formally refuse the pardon and believes it damages Americans' views of the federal government. Hemphill's actions stand in contrast to other Jan. 6 defendants who have embraced their pardons and utilized them in court arguments. Hemphill expects her protest to garner attention from the president.</p>
