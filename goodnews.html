          <p>Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren S√°nchez celebrated their wedding in Venice, Italy, attracting a star-studded guest list that included prominent figures from business, entertainment, and media. The lavish, multi-day festivities were held amidst tight security, with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, and Bill Gates in attendance. However, the event also drew criticism and protests from some local Venetians, who organized a "No Space for Bezos" campaign to voice concerns over tourism's impact on the city. This marks the second marriage for both Bezos, 61, and S√°nchez, 55, following their respective divorces in 2019.</p>

          <p>Authorities have successfully recaptured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a high-profile jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey, 33, was apprehended at a residence in New Orleans following a collaborative effort by multiple law enforcement agencies. The mass escape occurred when inmates exploited a faulty cell door and a hole behind a toilet, an incident that has drawn criticism toward the jail's management. With Massey's capture, only one fugitive, Derrick Groves, remains at large, while over a dozen individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he believes a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip is close and could be finalized within the next week. This statement comes after weeks of efforts by his administration to broker a pause in the fighting, which has so far been unsuccessful. A previous proposal for a 60-day ceasefire was rejected by Hamas as unacceptable. The conflict, which began with Hamas's attack on October 7, 2023, has resulted in a significant number of casualties on both sides, with over 56,000 people killed in Gaza according to the territory's health ministry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The S&P 500 index closed at a new record high of 6,173, signaling a significant market recovery after a sharp downturn in April. Investor confidence has been bolstered by signs of easing global trade tensions and forecasts of potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The market has rebounded approximately 24% since the April plunge, which was triggered by concerns over the Trump administration's tariff policies. Recent positive trade headlines, including a reported agreement with China and potential shifts in tariff deadlines, have further fueled the rally, though some analysts warn of underlying complacency regarding trade issues.

          <p>A federal judge has struck down a presidential executive order aimed at punishing the law firm Susman Godfrey, declaring it unconstitutional. The order, which targeted the firm for representing Dominion Voting Systems in its defamation suit against Fox News, sought to sanction the firm by restricting access to federal buildings and targeting their clients. U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan ruled that the order violated the First and Fifth Amendments, calling it a threat to the independence of the bar. This decision marks another legal defeat for the Trump administration's campaign to use executive power against law firms perceived as political adversaries.</p>

          <p>Prominent financial advisor Ric Edelman is now recommending that investors allocate between 10% and 40% of their portfolios to cryptocurrencies, a significant increase from his previous advice of a low single-digit percentage. Edelman cites the evolution of the crypto industry, including its growing mainstream adoption and regulatory clarity, as key reasons for his updated guidance. He also argues that the traditional 60/40 stock-and-bond model is obsolete due to increased human longevity, making higher-return assets like crypto essential. He points to Bitcoin's lack of correlation with traditional assets as a way to improve portfolio diversification. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On July 1, minimum wage rates are set to increase in two states, Alaska and Oregon, as well as in Washington, D.C., and twelve other cities and counties. The Economic Policy Institute estimates that these hikes will benefit over 800,000 workers, putting more money into their pockets to help with the cost of living. The increases are the result of ballot measures and automatic inflation adjustments, standing in contrast to the federal minimum wage, which has remained at $7.25 per hour since 2009. Alaska's wage will rise to $13.00, while Oregon's will increase to $15.05.</p>

Trump hailed the agreement as a "glorious triumph" and stated the U.S. would apply pressure, including financial penalties, to ensure compliance. The agreement also reportedly allows for U.S. access to the DRC's significant mineral deposits, including gold, copper, and lithium, which are critical for various industries.</p>

This follows an earlier rejected bid of ¬£45 million plus add-ons for the 25-year-old Cameroon international. United is seeking to strengthen its attack, having already signed another forward this season. Sources suggest Brentford is holding out for a larger upfront fee for Mbeumo, who scored 20 goals last season and has one year remaining on his contract.

While many of its popular products, like Uncrustables, are already free of these additives, some items such as sugar-free jams, ice cream toppings, and certain Hostess snacks still contain them.

          <p>California legislators have voted to more than double the state's annual film and television tax credit program, increasing the cap from $330 million to $750 million. The move is a significant victory for Hollywood studios, unions, and workers who have lobbied for state intervention to remain competitive against other states and countries offering more generous incentives. Governor Gavin Newsom and industry leaders argued the expansion is crucial to bring productions back to California and support the local economy. A related bill aims to broaden eligibility for the credits and increase the potential offset for qualified production expenses.</p>
