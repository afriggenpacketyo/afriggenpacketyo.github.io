          <p>With interest rates remaining high, savers face a choice between the guaranteed returns of a certificate of deposit (CD) and the higher growth potential of the stock market. Financial experts advise that the decision depends heavily on individual goals, timeline, and risk tolerance. CDs are recommended for short-term, specific goals where preserving principal is key, as they offer a fixed, predictable return. In contrast, stocks are better suited for long-term objectives like retirement, offering higher average returns but with significantly more volatility and risk. (not investment advice)</p>

Experts note that while both products have similar rates at present, they function differently. HELOCs typically have variable rates tied to the Federal Reserve's actions, making them unpredictable but potentially beneficial if rates fall later this year. In contrast, home equity loans usually have fixed rates, offering stability and predictability, with their rates behaving more like traditional mortgages tied to the bond market.
