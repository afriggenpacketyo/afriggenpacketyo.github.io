          <p>The charity Thin Blue Paw is advocating for pensions for retired police dogs to help cover their often-complicated medical needs, including chronic health issues and injuries sustained during service. Laura Meller, who has adopted three retired police dogs, estimates she has spent ¬£12,000 on their care. Concerns are growing that rising vet costs and the lack of support could deter potential adopters, possibly leading to euthanasia for older dogs. The Home Office stated that service animals are managed by individual police forces, relying on charities and volunteers, with no current plans to change the retirement process.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition by promoting decentralized solar power, potentially creating a model for other countries in the Global South. The Renewables First report argues that China must choose between its coal-fired plants financed in Pakistan and its solar panels sold to the country, as both cannot succeed simultaneously. However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive, while the report emphasizes the importance of developing indigenous manufacturing to mitigate rising global trade tensions. The increasing influx of cheap Chinese solar panels is undercutting demand for power from Chinese-financed coal plants, creating a cycle of stranded assets.</p>
