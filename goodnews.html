        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Dietary Guidelines are anticipated to remove the recommendation that adults limit alcohol consumption to one or two drinks per day. The updated guidelines, still under development, will likely encourage moderation or limiting intake due to health risks, but without specific daily limits. While current guidelines advise one drink or less per day for women and two or less for men, the scientific basis for these specific limits is considered limited. This change follows lobbying efforts by major alcohol industry players and varying conclusions from studies on alcohol's health effects, with some linking moderate drinking to increased cancer risk and others to potential cardiovascular benefits.</p>

          <p>A year-long battle of loudspeakers along the inter-Korean border has ceased after the new South Korean president, Lee Jae Myung, ordered a stop to South Korea's broadcasts, with North Korea reciprocating within hours. The broadcasts, which included propaganda and unsettling noises, disrupted the lives of villagers near the border. Lee's decision marks a shift from his predecessor's emphasis on "peace through strength" and aims to alleviate military tension and restore trust. Some argue that the broadcasts, which conveyed information about South Korea's advancements, were effective in influencing North Koreans.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Metro is facing challenges in securing the $2 billion needed to lease a fleet of 2,700 buses for the 2028 Olympics, a key component of its "transit first" plan. The plan relies on these buses to transport people between venues and alleviate traffic congestion, but the federal government has yet to respond to the funding request. Other challenges include training bus operators, providing housing for them, and addressing potential supply problems with clean energy buses. The success of the plan hinges on encouraging Angelenos to use public transit, with leaders hoping the Olympics will leave a legacy of increased Metro ridership.</p>

          <p>A US federal judge has blocked the Trump administration's ban on gender-neutral passports, ordering the State Department to continue issuing passports with "X" as a gender designation. The ruling states that the ban likely violates the constitutional rights of transgender Americans by discriminating on the basis of sex. The ACLU had filed a lawsuit challenging the policy, which was part of an executive order directing the government to recognize only male and female genders.

          <p>A new study suggests that endangered sharks, rays, and native oysters could thrive in warmer UK waters as species move habitats due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened marine species will respond to climate change, predicting new biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. However, static creatures like the ocean quahog, a long-living clam, could struggle to adapt, potentially impacting ecosystems and food chains. The movement of these species could affect coastal communities, potentially leading to bigger fish catches.</p>
