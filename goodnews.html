          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees who fled to the Democratic Republic of Congo following the 1994 genocide have returned to Rwanda, facilitated by the UN refugee agency. The repatriation occurred after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of eastern Congo, prompting many refugees, mostly women and children, to seek return to their homeland. The returnees were transported to a transit center for assistance and reintegration support. The repatriation is part of a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and the UNHCR, aiming to address the long-standing displacement caused by regional conflicts and instability.</p>

          <p>President Trump's recent diplomatic tour in the Middle East has underscored a shift in US foreign policy, with Israel seemingly taking a backseat as the administration focuses on brokering deals with Gulf nations. Trump's actions, such as engaging with Syria's new leader and seeking agreements with Iran and Yemen, have occurred without significant involvement from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. While the US maintains its historic ties with Israel, this new dynamic reflects a focus on economic and strategic interests in the Gulf, potentially altering the traditional US-Israel relationship and raising concerns among Israeli officials. Despite assurances from the Trump administration, the shift has prompted discussions about the future of US-Middle East relations.</p>

          <p>Britain and the European Union are cautiously moving towards renewed cooperation, marked by a summit in London. The meeting is expected to yield a defense and security agreement to fortify European military security, especially as the United States recalibrates its global role under the Trump administration. The summit will also address economic cooperation, with Britain aiming to ease trade controls, particularly on food exports. The UK is looking to find a place in the European schemes, while some EU countries, notably France, want to limit British participation. This event underscores a mutual commitment to tackle shared challenges in an increasingly uncertain world.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a new fiber-optic gyroscope designed to enhance the stability of navigation systems across a wide range of temperatures. The device, created by the Tianjin Navigation Instruments Research Institute and Jinan University, aims to offer a more reliable means of measuring orientation for vehicles such as aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. Fiber-optic gyroscopes, which rely on the movement of light in optical fibers, provide an alternative to traditional mechanical gyroscopes, offering potential benefits for military and security applications by reducing reliance on external signals.</p>

          <p>The demand for live shows in China is spurring a surge in tourism spending, as fans travel across the country to attend in-demand concerts and music festivals. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling tickets with discounts on hotels, dining, and tourist attractions, aiming to boost domestic consumption. This strategy aligns with Beijing's economic agenda to promote internal spending amid trade tensions. With domestic consumption high on Beijing‚Äôs economic agenda this year as trade tensions make export growth less reliable, local governments are bundling spots at popular shows with discounted hotel, dining and tourist bookings to encourage people to buy more than a ticket.</p>

          <p>In Minneapolis, Minnesota a 1993 crime scene investigation into the murder of 35-year-old Jeanie Childs revealed bloody bare footprints, which were a rare clue. The police determined that the footprints belonged to the killer because the victim was wearing socks. Years later, in 2015, DNA was found on the comforter, a towel, a washcloth, a T-shirt, and on the bathroom sink. Investigators then turned to investigative genetic genealogy and found a match to Jerry Westrom. Westrom was found guilty and given a life sentence, though his lawyers continue to maintain his innocence.</p>

          <p>President Trump publicly criticized Walmart after the retailer warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices for consumers.

Walmart responded by reiterating its commitment to keeping prices as low as possible but cautioned that it could not fully offset the tariff pressures, as they are not in the business of losing money. The exchange highlights the ongoing tension between the administration's trade policies and their impact on consumer prices, with potential implications for inflation and economic stability.

          <p>A decades-old murder case in Minneapolis has been solved through advancements in DNA technology and footprint analysis. The 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs remained unsolved for years until forensic scientists re-examined evidence and identified an unknown DNA profile at the crime scene. This DNA was linked to Jerry Westrom through investigative genetic genealogy. Further analysis of bloody footprints found at the scene confirmed Westrom's presence, leading to his arrest and conviction.

          <p>Journalism came from behind to win the 150th running of the Preakness Stakes, despite being bumped by Goal Oriented near the quarter pole. Journalism shrugged off the contact, burst through the lane, and ran right by Gosger to give trainer Michael McCarthy his second win in a Triple Crown race. Umberto Rispoli became the first jockey from Italy to win any of the Triple Crown races. Journalism paid $4 to win, $2.80 to place and $2.40 to show.</p>

          <p>Michael Gove stated that there could be a second Scottish independence referendum if the public show "overwhelming support" for one. Gove said that the UK is a 'living thing' and added that politicians had to continually demonstrate that the union was working. Gove said that he didn't think a second referendum was "necessary at the moment", but added that if there was "an overwhelming desire on the part of the Scottish people for one then we'd have to review the decision."</p>

          <p>Thanks in part to TikTok, Netflix and stars like Kim Kardashian - the Menendez brothers have a new generation of supporters. This week, a Los Angeles judge reduced the brothers' sentence to include the possibility of parole, which could be granted at a hearing next month. Prof Phillips said a "hurricane" of interest and support was created by the Netflix drama to Kardashian's op-ed.</p>

          <p>A photographer has spent a decade carrying out "garden safaris" in order to capture the diversity and beauty of Britain's back garden wildlife. The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found "under our noses", said Andrew Fusek Peters. "I wanted to celebrate the everyday stories and reveal the beauty of our birds, mammals and insects that live alongside us," the Shropshire photographer added. The book was also a "rallying cry" to transform "over-manicured spaces into more wildlife friendly havens," he said.</p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down late Saturday, capping four decades of operation in line with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in southern Pingtung County ended operations as the self-ruled island moves to phase out nuclear power following Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster.</p>
