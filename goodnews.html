          <p>President Trump highlighted a "blockbuster agreement" between U.S. Steel and Nippon Steel, asserting it would maintain U.S. Steel's presence in Pittsburgh and involve significant investments across multiple states. Trump claimed Nippon would invest $14 billion in U.S. Steel, earmarking $2.2 billion for increased production in Pittsburgh and $7 billion for modernizing mills and expanding facilities in other states. He also announced plans to double tariffs on steel imports to 50% and pledged that U.S. Steel headquarters would remain in Pittsburgh, ensuring no layoffs or outsourcing, and even promising a $5,000 bonus for each U.S. steelworker. He emphasized U.S. Steel would be "controlled by the USA" under the deal, though specifics on the ownership structure were not provided. Optimism is tempered by the lack of specific details and the prior opposition to the deal.</p>

          <p>The BBC Three drama "What It Feels Like For A Girl," based on Paris Lees' memoir, portrays a gender-questioning teenager's coming-of-age in a working-class town near Nottingham in the early 2000s. The series delves into themes of identity, class, and the challenges faced by trans individuals, particularly those from working-class backgrounds, as Byron navigates a difficult home life, explores his identity in nightclubs, and becomes involved in an exploitative sex work industry. The show doesn't shy away from difficult subjects such as grooming and child abuse, but also emphasizes the importance of humor and heart in the face of adversity. The production explores the complexities of Byron's journey as he begins to transition, highlighting the need for safe spaces and the impact of societal pressures on self-discovery. The series aims to authentically represent the experiences of trans individuals and the intersectionality with working-class struggles.</p>

New funding for defence will be partially sourced by reducing UK overseas aid from 0.5% to 0.3% of gross national income. (not investment advice)</p>

The Rugby Football League spokesperson stated it is surprising and disappointing that no one has been deemed worthy of such an honor. Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Speaker of the House of Commons, added that the lack of rugby league knighthoods is unjust compared to other sports like rugby union. Concerns have been raised that the lack of recognition may be linked to class prejudice and the working-class backgrounds of many rugby league players.</p>

The agreement ends a long legal battle with Tamara Lanier, who claims to be a descendant of two people in the photos. The images, taken in 1850, are daguerreotypes commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz as part of discredited research to prove the superiority of white people. Harvard said it had always hoped the photos would be given to another museum.</p>
