          <p>The Republican National Committee holds a significant cash advantage over the Democratic National Committee, with nearly five times more funds on hand. This disparity, amounting to a $57 million gap, marks the widest difference between the two parties since at least July 2020. The RNC reported $72 million in its coffers at the end of May, while the DNC had only $15 million. Some Democrats express concern that the fundraising gap reflects deeper issues within the party, while the DNC highlights a surge in grassroots support, raising roughly $40 million in individual donations since February.
