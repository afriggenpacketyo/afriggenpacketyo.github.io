        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The animated musical "Kpop Demon Hunters" has achieved remarkable global success, becoming Netflix's most-viewed film ever with over 236 million watches since its June release. This surprise hit, produced by Sony Pictures Animation, follows a fictional K-pop girl band, Huntr/x, as they use their music and fighting skills to protect humanity from demons. The film has been widely praised for its eye-catching animation, its authentic depiction of Korean culture, and especially its catchy K-pop songs, some crafted by industry veterans. Its soundtrack has broken records, with multiple tracks topping Spotify and Billboard charts, even surpassing real-life K-pop giants. The immense popularity has already led to Netflix releasing a sing-along version and talks of a sequel.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading on Wednesday as investors reacted to new economic data, diverging from Wall Street's performance. China's industrial profits saw a significant recovery in July, declining by only 1.5% year-on-year, the slowest pace in five months. Concurrently, new U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian exports took effect, raising overall duties to 50%, with Indian markets closed for a holiday. Japan's Nikkei 225 edged higher, boosted by Nikon, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 saw slight movements. Hong Kong's Hang Seng and mainland China's CSI 300 also rose, with some analysts noting "irrational exuberance" in the latter, though not yet a bubble. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington D.C. is launching a "We the People DC" tourism campaign to enhance its image, even as National Guard troops, deployed under President Trump's crime emergency plan, are seen performing cleanup duties in public parks. Approximately 110 Guard members are assigned to a "Safe and Beautiful Task Force" for litter removal, an unusual sight that underscores the city's public relations challenges. Despite a record 27.2 million visitors in 2024, international tourism is projected to decline in 2025. City officials are banking on America's 250th anniversary in 2026, with major museum renovations and new attractions, to draw millions more and counter the political narrative surrounding the capital's condition.</p>

          <p>Third seed Coco Gauff demonstrated significant resilience to overcome Ajla Tomljanović in a challenging first-round match at the US Open, winning 6-4, 6-7 (2), 7-5 in nearly three hours. Despite a shaky serving performance, marked by 10 double faults and six breaks of serve, Gauff managed to secure her victory under the lights of Arthur Ashe Stadium. She squandered several opportunities to close the match earlier, including serving for it at 5-4 in the third set, but broke back immediately to seal the win. This article highlights her continued progress, as she remains in contention for the world No. 1 ranking if she can achieve a deep run in the tournament.</p>

          <p>China's industrial profits experienced a notable recovery in July, with a year-on-year slip of just 1.5%, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months. This improvement follows Beijing's efforts to combat price wars and enhance corporate margins. For the first seven months of the year, profits at major industrial firms fell by 1.7%. While state-backed firms saw a larger drop, businesses with foreign investments recorded a 1.8% increase in profits. The mining industry continued to struggle, but manufacturing and utilities sectors showed profit improvements, attributed by the statistics bureau to government policies aimed at stabilizing consumer prices and boosting profitability.

          <p>Less than eight months after the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires destroyed 16,000 buildings, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is preparing to clear the final residential parcel that opted into the federal cleanup program in Los Angeles County. Federal contractors have removed 2.5 million tons of fire debris from nearly 10,000 properties, completing the work approximately four months ahead of the initial January 2026 goal. This rapid response is being hailed as the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history, showcasing strong partnership and commitment to community recovery. While some homeowners initially reported issues with sloppy work, the significant progress has now paved the way for communities to enter the rebuilding phase, with hundreds of construction permits already issued.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on its tenth test flight, marking a significant achievement after a series of previous failures. The 40-story-tall vehicle, the most powerful ever built, performed as planned, with its Super Heavy first stage executing a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. The Starship upper stage reached a suborbital trajectory, successfully deployed eight Starlink satellite simulators, and reignited an engine in space. Despite some reentry heating damage to a protective skirt and a control flap, the Starship maintained control and made a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This article highlights the critical nature of this success for SpaceX's ambitions to colonize Mars and NASA's reliance on Starship for future moon landings, though many technical hurdles and a challenging timeline remain.</p>
