        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A settlement has been reached in the civil lawsuit filed by three crew members of the movie "Rust" against the film's producers, including Alec Baldwin. The plaintiffs alleged negligence and sought compensation for emotional distress following the fatal on-set shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in 2021. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. This civil case is separate from the criminal proceedings, which saw armorer Hannah Gutierrez-Reed convicted of involuntary manslaughter. Baldwin, who was holding the firearm when it discharged, has consistently maintained that the shooting was a tragic accident.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris delivered a stunning performance to claim pole position for the Austrian Grand Prix, outpacing his nearest competitor by more than half a second. Ferrari's Charles Leclerc will start second, with championship leader and fellow McLaren driver Oscar Piastri in third. Norris's exceptional lap provides a crucial boost as he seeks to close the 22-point gap to his teammate in the championship standings. The result marks only the second time this season that a Ferrari has secured a front-row start, suggesting recent car upgrades may be proving effective for the team.</p>

          <p>British authorities have intercepted a massive 2.4 metric ton shipment of cocaine at the London Gateway port, with an estimated street value of ¬£96 million ($132 million). The drugs were discovered hidden beneath shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. The Home Office confirmed this is the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the UK. Officials stated that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle narcotics into the country. The seizure highlights ongoing efforts to dismantle international drug trafficking operations targeting the UK, which is one of Europe's largest cocaine markets.</p>

          <p>Tens of thousands of people participated in the annual Budapest Pride march, defying threats of legal consequences from Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The event proceeded despite a police ban issued under a new law restricting gatherings deemed to promote homosexuality. Attendees, including EU Equalities Commissioner Hadja Lahbib and other European politicians, marched in solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community and in protest of the restrictive legislation. Organizers hoped for record attendance as a powerful statement for diversity and fundamental rights in the face of mounting pressure from the nationalist conservative government.</p>

          <p>Israel's ambassador to Japan, Gilad Cohen, has confirmed he will attend the August peace ceremony in Nagasaki marking the 80th anniversary of the U.S. atomic bombing. The city did not invite Israel to the 2024 ceremony due to the conflict in Gaza, a decision which prompted other G7 ambassadors to withdraw in protest. For this year's event, Nagasaki's government has adopted a more inclusive approach, inviting all diplomatic missions in Japan. The move signals a step towards de-escalating the diplomatic friction from the previous year's event and focusing on the shared message of peace.</p>

          <p>According to a veteran Chinese expert on the Middle East, Iran may seek military support from China amid its escalating conflicts with Israel and the United States, but Beijing is likely to respond with caution. China's primary interests lie in maintaining a delicate balance in the region, which includes its relationships with Israel and other Western-aligned Gulf states. The expert, Pan Guang, noted that while the direct Iran-Israel conflict is unlikely to become a full-scale war, retaliatory actions could continue. China's cautious approach reflects its complex economic and strategic interests, which temper its partnership with Tehran.</p>

          <p>A real estate broker with a decade of experience suggests that prospective homebuyers use the "80-10-10 Rule" to determine if a property is the right fit, as no house is ever perfect. According to this industry guideline, the ideal home should have 80% of the features you love and cannot change, such as location and architectural style. Another 10% should consist of elements you can improve over time, like paint or fixtures. The final 10% represents things you can live with, such as a neighbor's fence, which shouldn't be deal-breakers.</p>

          <p>Dr. Amy Acton, who gained a national profile as Ohio's health director during the early COVID-19 pandemic, is running for governor as a Democrat. Acton, known for her calm and compassionate daily briefings, became a polarizing figure for her role in implementing lockdowns and school closures. Her likely Republican opponent, Vivek Ramaswamy, has already branded her an "Anthony Fauci knockoff." Acton's candidacy presents a unique test of how voters have processed the pandemic, pitting her public health credentials against conservative criticism of government overreach in a state that has shifted significantly to the right.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is concluding a week marked by several significant victories on both domestic and international fronts. Key achievements include brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Iran after a successful U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities, and securing a commitment from NATO allies to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP. Domestically, a Supreme Court ruling curbed the power of lower courts to block his executive orders nationwide. These events have provided the president with substantial political momentum, allowing him to project an image of a successful dealmaker and effective world leader.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Petroleum analysts are forecasting that U.S. consumers could see the lowest summer gas prices since 2021, with the national average potentially dropping below $3 per gallon by September. A recent spike in oil prices, attributed to the conflict between Israel and Iran, is expected to be temporary following a ceasefire agreement. The anticipated price drop follows typical summer trends, where increased refinery production and a leveling-off of consumer demand contribute to a slow decline. According to experts, when adjusted for inflation, current gas prices are already near a 20-year low. (not investment advice)</p>
