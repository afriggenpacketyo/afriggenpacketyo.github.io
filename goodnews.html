          <p>Shares of Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD experienced a decline after the company announced price cuts on 22 of its electric and plug-in hybrid models until the end of June, with the Seagull hatchback's price reduced by 20% and the Seal sedan's price cut by 34%. Citi analysts anticipate that BYD's price reductions will result in a significant increase in foot traffic at its dealerships, while other Chinese automakers also saw their shares decline due to investor concerns about increased competition and a potential price war in the EV sector. Despite the price cuts, Citi analysts remain optimistic about the sales growth of new energy vehicle companies priced below 200,000 Chinese yuan, citing relatively mild competition in that segment.

The goal is to address rocket noise before it becomes a pervasive problem, especially with the upcoming Starship, which is expected to be the loudest rocket ever.
