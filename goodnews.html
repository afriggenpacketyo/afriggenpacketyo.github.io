          <p>The Tall Ships Races, described as Europe's largest free family event, has commenced in Aberdeen, Scotland, drawing dozens of vessels from around the world. Organizers anticipate hundreds of thousands of visitors for the four-day festival, which features live music, including a performance by the band Deacon Blue. However, the event faces a potential challenge from a Met Office yellow warning for heavy rain. The city council is monitoring the weather and will provide updates on any impact to the festivities, which celebrate international friendship and youth sailing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>To curb impulsive spending and promote financial wellness, experts recommend asking a series of introspective questions before making a purchase. Financial therapist Aja Evans suggests evaluating if the purchase is an attempt to fill an emotional need, such as hunger, anger, loneliness, or tiredness. It is also crucial to consider if spending has become a pattern and whether the desire for an item is driven by a need to impress others. Additionally, Consumer Reports reporter Brian Vines advises conducting research to ensure product quality and price fairness, rather than assuming a higher price guarantees better performance.</p>

          <p>The victory of Zohran Mamdani in New York City's Democratic mayoral primary is being hailed as a landmark moment for Muslim and South Asian Americans. His campaign, which focused on affordability and Palestinian rights, resonated with a diverse coalition of voters and was bolstered by strong grassroots organizing. Despite facing Islamophobic attacks, Mamdani's rise is seen by many as a sign of growing political power for communities that have historically been marginalized and subjected to surveillance. His success challenges long-held assumptions about who can represent a major American city, reflecting a broader shift in the Democratic base's priorities.</p>

          <p>British MMA world champion Dakota Ditcheva has expressed frustration over the lack of challengers following her dominant 2024 PFL flyweight tournament victory. After securing the title in November, the 26-year-old has faced an eight-month wait for her next fight, as her decisive victories made it difficult for the promotion to find a suitable opponent. Ditcheva is now set to face American Sumiko Inaba at a historic PFL Champions Series event in Cape Town, South Africa. Despite the frustrating layoff, she hopes the anticipation will create more excitement for her return to the cage.</p>

          <p>Following a poor showing at the Club World Cup, Los Angeles FC aims to win back fan support in a crucial derby match against its rival, the LA Galaxy. While LAFC sits fourth in the Western Conference, the Galaxy is at the bottom of the table, but coaches from both sides insist that records are irrelevant in such an intense rivalry. The match is marked by several key absences for LAFC due to injury and a planned protest by LA Galaxy supporter groups, who will not attend. This game represents a key moment for both clubs before they begin their Leagues Cup campaigns later in the month.</p>

          <p>A 65-year-old grandmother, Deborah Mason, has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for orchestrating a sophisticated drug trafficking operation worth up to £80 million. Known as "Gangsta Debbs," Mason recruited her four children, sister, and their partners to transport large quantities of cocaine across England. The family-run gang was monitored by the Metropolitan Police for seven months, leading to their arrests. The court heard that Mason played a leading role, directing the operation and using the profits to fund a lavish lifestyle that included designer accessories for her cat while she simultaneously received state benefits.</p>

          <p>Ahead of the highly anticipated heavyweight title rematch, boxing experts have offered their predictions for the fight between Oleksandr Usyk and Daniel Dubois. While Usyk defeated Dubois in their first encounter, the 27-year-old British fighter has since won three consecutive fights and captured the IBF world title. Some analysts, like Eddie Hearn, believe Usyk's experience and skill will lead him to another victory, likely by decision. Others, such as former champion Carl Frampton, are backing Dubois, citing his incredible power and recent form as key factors that could lead to an upset at Wembley Stadium.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a new, more accessible method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a promising treatment for blood cancers and other serious illnesses. The conventional approach is complex and extremely expensive, but this new technique uses gene therapy tools to produce the specialized anticancer cells directly inside the patient's body. A study published in The Lancet detailed the successful treatment of four multiple myeloma patients using this innovative method. This breakthrough could significantly reduce the cost of the therapy, which is currently estimated to exceed US$139,200 per treatment.</p>

          <p>Over 250 Venezuelan migrants, who were detained in a notorious El Salvador prison after being arrested in U.S. immigration raids, have been released and returned to Venezuela. Their release was part of a prisoner swap deal that also secured the freedom of ten Americans held by Venezuelan authorities. The migrants' detention was controversial, as the Trump administration claimed they were gang members but provided little evidence. Human rights groups have documented severe abuse inside the prison, and one released detainee described being beaten and held incommunicado for months while his family had no information on his whereabouts.</p>

The SAMR instructed the companies to adhere to all relevant laws, including those concerning anti-unfair competition and food safety.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Tyler Glasnow delivered a strong performance in his second start since returning from the injured list, though the team ultimately lost 2-0 to the Milwaukee Brewers. Glasnow pitched six innings, allowing only one run while striking out six, showcasing increased fastball velocity and a more athletic, less mechanical approach on the mound. This outing is a positive sign for the Dodgers, who are counting on the high-priced pitcher to bolster their rotation for the second half of the season. Despite Glasnow's solid start, the Dodgers' offense was stifled by Brewers pitcher Quinn Priester, who recorded ten strikeouts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed the GENIUS Act into law, establishing a federal regulatory framework for stablecoins, which are cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar. The legislation is a major victory for the crypto industry, which has long advocated for clear rules to legitimize the technology for payments and finance. Proponents, including the Treasury Secretary, argue the law will reinforce the dollar's global status and expand its accessibility. However, critics express concern that the law lacks strong anti-money laundering provisions and could make the U.S. financial system vulnerable to exploitation by criminals.
