        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article details the current interest rates for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans, positioning them as notably more affordable borrowing options compared to high-interest personal loans and credit cards. It provides specific average rates for various loan terms as reported by Bankrate, while also noting the potential for these rates to decrease further if the Federal Reserve implements interest rate cuts later in the year. Homeowners can leverage their substantial home equity for these products, which offer attractive tax benefits for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations. However, borrowers must carefully consider that their home serves as collateral, making careful selection crucial. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares surged over 20% on Wednesday after the retailer announced fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, despite an overall decline in sales and ongoing leadership transitions. The company narrowed its full-year sales guidance to a more optimistic range and revised its earnings per share outlook upwards, signaling confidence in its operational improvements. This positive financial performance comes amidst strategic efforts to reduce inventory, lower expenses, and enhance customer engagement, including expanding its successful Sephora partnerships across all stores, aiming to reverse years of revenue decline.</p>

          <p>This article provides a comprehensive overview of current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates, highlighting their effectiveness as a secure savings vehicle that can help combat persistent inflation by offering returns often exceeding the current rate. It details national average yields for various terms and emphasizes that significantly higher rates are available from online banks, particularly for short-term CDs, a phenomenon linked to the inverted yield curve. The article advises strategies like CD laddering to capitalize on these high rates while maintaining long-term savings goals and benefiting from FDIC/NCUA insurance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reports the current market price of gold at $3,374.77 per ounce and thoroughly explains the numerous factors that contribute to its constant fluctuation. Key influences include the fundamental principles of supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, inflationary pressures, and interest rate movements, which often have an inverse relationship with gold prices. Geopolitical uncertainty, currency strength (especially the U.S. dollar), overall market sentiment, and central bank policies also play significant roles, solidifying gold's traditional status as a safe-haven asset and a hedge against economic instability for investors.

          <p>SpaceX has successfully completed a crucial test flight of its Starship rocket, marking a significant and much-needed comeback after a series of prior failures. The world's largest and most powerful rocket executed a nail-biting 60-minute flight from Texas, with its Super Heavy booster separating as planned and the Starship spacecraft reaching a maximum height of almost 200km above Earth. This achievement is vital for NASA's Artemis program, which plans to use a modified Starship to send humans to the Moon by 2027, and for Elon Musk's ambitious long-term goals of human travel to Mars.</p>

          <p>A Reddit post has brought to light a family dispute stemming from a grandmother's insistence on a "meat-based nutritionist's" carnivore diet for her 6-month-old grandchild, even suggesting feeding the baby a stick of butter for sleep. The mother, who advocates for a broad, healthy diet, expressed her disagreement and sought advice online. While experts like Dr. Ken Berry acknowledge the importance of healthy fats and nutrient-dense animal foods for infant development, they emphasize that these should be incorporated within a varied diet alongside plant-based foods to ensure comprehensive nutrition and healthy eating habits.</p>

Now moving into its practical validation phase after a decade of design and testing, RDEs are revolutionary due to their highly efficient combustion process, which utilizes detonation to convert chemical energy into mechanical energy. This innovation requires significantly fewer complex mechanical components, resulting in a more compact and lightweight structure, holding substantial potential for integration into future weapon systems and marking a key area of scientific competition between the US and China.</p>

          <p>This article provides expert forecasts for gold prices in fall 2025, noting that the precious metal is currently in a "holding pattern" after an earlier surge to record highs above $3,400 per ounce. Experts suggest that potential catalysts, such as Federal Reserve interest rate cuts, continued geopolitical uncertainty, and ongoing central bank gold purchases, could drive prices higher. Some analysts, including J.P. Morgan Research, project gold could reach $4,000 per ounce by the second quarter of 2026. Conversely, a strengthening economy with cooling inflation and a firmer dollar could exert downward pressure on prices. (not investment advice)</p>

Abercrombie is actively pursuing new growth strategies, including expanding into categories like dresses and bridal wear, enhancing international presence, and forming partnerships such as becoming the NFL's first "official fashion partner" to maintain relevance and sales momentum.</p>

The piece highlights that many undervalued jobs can be surprisingly profitable, and maintaining an "information diet" about wealth is a common strategy to prevent judgment, unsolicited advice, or financial solicitations from others, fostering a sense of quiet success.</p>

While some artists fear that "contentment is a creativity killer," the article highlights examples of other prominent female artists, such as Madonna and Beyoncé, who have successfully evolved their sound and themes after significant life changes like marriage and motherhood. It suggests Swift might explore new narrative approaches or mature themes, potentially leading to a fresh and acclaimed chapter in her already illustrious career, rather than a decline in creativity.</p>
