The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives for the descendants of victims and the Greenwood community. The package seeks to revitalize the area and provide opportunities for those affected by the historical injustice. The plan is being praised as a significant step toward reconciliation and healing in Tulsa. This historical event is a step in the right direction in terms of righting the wrongs of the past. </p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former supporter of Donald Trump who was pardoned for her involvement in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing to accept the pardon. Hemphill pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge for her role in the events of that day. She believes the pardons are inappropriate and contribute to a false narrative about the events of January 6th. Hemphill has sought assistance from her Republican senator to formally refuse and block the pardon issued to her. Her actions stand in contrast to other Jan. 6 defendants who actively sought and celebrated their pardons. Hemphill said that she couldn't live with herself taking a pardon when she knew she was guilty. </p>

          <p>Salman Rushdie discusses censorship in America, noting that it comes from both the left and the right. He argues that a growing orthodoxy, particularly among young people, views censorship as a good thing.

He shares his personal experiences with censorship, stemming from the fatwa issued against him in 1989.

          <p>An examination of why Australia, despite its relatively small population, produces a disproportionate number of successful actors. The article highlights the influence of institutions like the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) and the Sydney Theatre Company.

The training at NIDA also includes accent work, enabling actors to seamlessly transition into international roles. The Australian film industry and soap operas provide a testing ground for emerging talent. The article also touches on the down-to-earth attitude of Australian actors and the benefits of being geographically removed from Hollywood.

          <p>Germany‚Äôs new Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called President Xi Jinping to propose a deal: help end the war in Ukraine. Merz told Xi that Russia‚Äôs war of aggression on Ukraine has a bearing on Germany‚Äôs national security and urged Beijing to throw its weight behind joint US-European efforts for a ceasefire. The call included appeals to common cause on climate, trade, and stability. Xi lauded the partnership between the two nations and emphasised the need for ‚Äúsound and stable‚Äù ties in a time of global flux. This signals a conscious pivot from values-based idealism to strategic realism. </p>

          <p>England captain Harry Brook has praised Joe Root, saying he is ‚Äúonly getting better with age‚Äù. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals. He came to the crease in the first over, and withstood all of West Indies' pressure when England were on the ropes at 133-5. A 98-ball century was raised having barely broken a sweat. Brook added a counter-attacking 85 for the third wicket with Root. </p>
