          <p>Former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is facing scrutiny for potentially violating New York City campaign finance rules by using his campaign website to seemingly coordinate with a super PAC supporting his mayoral bid. The practice, known as 'red-boxing,' involves posting strategic information publicly for outside groups to act upon, circumventing campaign finance limits. The New York City Campaign Finance Board has warned against this practice, and a formal investigation has been requested by one of Cuomo's opponents. Cuomo's lawyer denies any wrongdoing, stating that the super PAC has not acted on the information provided.</p>

          <p>SpaceX employees have been elected to run the newly incorporated company town of Starbase, Texas, near the SpaceX launch facility. Bobby Peden, a SpaceX vice president, will serve as mayor, while Jenna Petrzelka and Jordan Buss, also SpaceX employees, will be commissioners. Elon Musk began acquiring land for SpaceX in Boca Chica a decade ago, with the first integrated Starship vehicle launching from the site in April 2023, though it exploded mid-flight. The town's incorporation aims to build a better community for those working on space exploration, though SpaceX has faced scrutiny for environmental violations in the area.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is continuing to defend U.S. rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone, following the path of the previous Biden administration. The Department of Justice filed a brief in Texas federal court urging a judge to dismiss a lawsuit by Republican-led states challenging the FDA's actions. The filing argues that Texas is not the proper venue for the lawsuit and that the states lack standing to sue. This stance aligns with Trump's previous statements indicating he did not plan to ban or restrict access to mifepristone.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration is transitioning to digital Social Security cards, a move that experts view with cautious optimism.

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order to incentivize prescription drug manufacturing in the U.S., streamlining the path for pharmaceutical companies to build new production sites stateside as potential tariffs on imported medicines loom. The order directs the Food and Drug Administration to reduce the amount of time it takes to approve manufacturing plants in the U.S. and directs the agency to raise inspection fees for foreign manufacturing plants. Trump stated that he will announce pharmaceutical-specific tariffs within the next two weeks. The U.S. imported $203 billion in pharmaceutical products in 2023 alone, with 73% coming from Europe, primarily Ireland, Germany and Switzerland.</p>
