          <p>California State Senator Sabrina Cervantes was cited on suspicion of driving under the influence after a car collision near the state Capitol. Cervantes vehemently denies the allegations, stating that hospital lab results will prove she had no alcohol in her system. She claims she was 'falsely accused' and 'accosted' by police officers while being treated for minor injuries at the hospital. The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office is awaiting toxicology results before making a decision on filing charges in this 'deeply distressing' incident.</p>

          <p>Representative Gerald E. Connolly of Virginia, a nine-term congressman, died at his home in Fairfax County, Va., at the age of 75 after battling esophageal cancer. Connolly was known for his vigorous defense of government workers and his opposition to efforts to weaken civil service job protections, particularly during President Trump's first term. He also led efforts to block the Trump White House from adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census, viewing it as a politically motivated attempt to intimidate immigrants. Connolly was a key figure in Virginia's shift from a reliably red state to one that leans blue in federal elections.</p>

Rutter stated that these allegations are false and disregard the transparently audited financial reports.

The cryptocurrency was trading flat at $106,678.74 after reaching $109,857 earlier in the day. Analysts attribute bitcoin's rise to softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin have surpassed $40 billion. On-chain data indicates lower selling pressure and increased liquidity in the crypto market.

          <p>The Defense Department said Wednesday it has accepted a Boeing jet from Qatar that will be retrofitted and used to transport President Trump. Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth accepted the Boeing 747 'in accordance with all federal rules and regulations.' Hegseth's acceptance of the plane comes days after sources confirmed that the Qatari royal family would be donating aircraft for Mr. Trump's use. Valued at $400 million, the jumbo jet will be donated to Mr. Trump's future presidential library just before he leaves office.</p>
