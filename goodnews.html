          <p>Samsung Electronics announced it has signed a major $16.5 billion contract to supply semiconductors, causing its shares to rise over 2%. The deal, effective from July 26, 2024, is set to run until the end of 2033. Citing a request from the counterparty to protect trade secrets, Samsung has not disclosed the name of the other company involved. This long-term agreement comes as a significant development for Samsung's foundry service, the second-largest globally, which manufactures chips based on designs from other firms, even as the company faces challenges in the competitive AI chip market.</p>

          <p>Chinese swimming prodigy Yu Zidi, aged 12, is making a significant impact at the World Aquatics Championships in Singapore. She is a contender for a medal in the 200m individual medley, which could make her the youngest medalist at a major international event in nearly 90 years. While 18-year-old world record holder Summer McIntosh is the favorite, Yu's performance has already drawn global attention. Having emerged on the national scene in China in 2024, Yu has rapidly become one of the world's fastest in multiple events, with strong prospects in the 200m butterfly and 400m medley.</p>

          <h2>Shenzhen Introduces Leniency Policy for Failed State-Funded Innovation Projects</h2>

          <p>Authorities in Shenzhen, China's technology hub, have implemented new rules mandating leniency for innovators whose government-funded projects fail to meet their goals. The policy applies to universities, hospitals, and companies, stating that individuals should not be punished if mistakes were made without misconduct or abuse of power. Exemptions cover failures due to technical difficulties, market changes rendering products unviable, or incomplete research from exploring new methods. The move aims to encourage researchers to boldly explore new frontiers without fear of their careers being hindered by unsuccessful but well-intentioned projects.</p>

          <p>The LAPD's Pacoima station was temporarily evacuated after a couple brought in military-grade explosive devices they had found while cleaning a deceased relative's home. The incident occurred on Saturday afternoon, prompting officials to also evacuate nearby homes as a precaution. The department's bomb squad was deployed and used a robot to assess the box, which contained several military ordnances. After determining the devices were safe to move, they were transferred to a secure storage facility for collection by the U.S. military, resolving the situation without incident.</p>

          <p>The influential emo band My Chemical Romance played its iconic 2006 album "The Black Parade" in its entirety at a sold-out Dodger Stadium show. This tour marks a new peak for the band, which reunited in 2019, as they now headline stadium-sized venues without new music, benefiting from a broader rock resurgence. The performance of the concept album was framed as a satirical commentary on political authoritarianism, but the enduring power of the songs themselves remained the main draw. The concert underscored the band's lasting influence on a generation of artists and their deep connection with a dedicated fanbase.</p>

          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his witty and incisive songs in the 1950s and '60s, has passed away at the age of 97. Lehrer, who was also a mathematician and university lecturer, rose to fame with darkly humorous tracks that targeted subjects like politics, nuclear war, and pollution. After achieving underground success and contributing to the NBC show "That Was The Week That Was," he largely retired from public performance in the 1970s to focus on teaching. His work has been cited as a major influence by generations of comedy songwriters, including "Weird Al" Yankovic, for its clever subversion of musical genres.</p>

          <p>Excavations at the Keeladi village in Tamil Nadu, India, have uncovered artifacts from a sophisticated urban settlement dating back to around 580 BCE, challenging established narratives about early Indian civilization. Archaeologists suggest these findings indicate a literate, urban society in southern India that was contemporaneous with the well-known Vedic period in the north. This has fueled regional pride and a political debate over historical narratives, with some claiming the discoveries link to the Indus Valley Civilization and prove the antiquity of the Tamil language. The site has become a flashpoint in the cultural and political divide between India's north and south.</p>

He emphasizes the importance of rigorous research for his show's deep dives, which blend investigative journalism with humor to illuminate systemic problems. Despite his sharp critiques, Oliver, now a U.S. citizen married to an Iraq War veteran, insists his comedy comes from a place of love for his adopted country and a desire for it to improve.</p>

The race also turned on pit strategy, with Piastri opting for medium tires while Norris chose hards, a decision that ultimately left him unable to close the gap despite a late charge.

Despite strong performance in its aerospace and automation businesses and a strategic plan to split into three companies, the stock has underperformed. Potential reasons for the decline include the complexity of the company's structure, the long timeline for the planned spinoffs creating "spin purgatory," and a lack of significant exposure to the booming data center market.
