          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that anti-discrimination laws in the United States apply equally to all employees, regardless of their race, sexual orientation, or any other protected characteristic. The justices rejected the notion that members of a majority group must present more evidence of discrimination to win a lawsuit. The ruling revives a lawsuit by an Ohio woman who claimed she was demoted and discriminated against by her lesbian supervisor. Experts suggest the decision will streamline litigation processes and eliminate the need for additional proof from majority groups in certain regions. </p>
