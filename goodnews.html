          <p>Brazil's Supreme Court has sentenced former President Jair Bolsonaro to 27 years and three months in prison after finding him guilty of orchestrating a military coup plot to unlawfully remain in power following his 2022 election defeat. The court's panel also barred the 70-year-old politician from holding public office until 2033. Bolsonaro, who was under house arrest during the trial, has denied the charges, with his lawyers calling the sentence excessive and vowing to appeal. The conviction also implicated several of his close allies, including senior military officers and former ministers.</p>

          <p>An opinion article argues that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) provides a crucial alternative to the current global multilateral system, which is described as faltering and increasingly sidelined by unilateral actions and trade conflicts. The author posits that as institutions like the United Nations face challenges, the SCO offers a platform for cooperation among countries with diverse political systems and cultures. It is framed as a stabilizing force in a world at risk of fragmentation, where negotiation is being replaced by sanctions and tariffs, promoting a different approach to international governance.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For parents struggling with children who are fussy eaters, a child nutritionist suggests several strategies to make mealtimes less stressful and more positive. Key recommendations include allowing children to choose whether to eat, avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad," and focusing on making the dinner table an enjoyable place for conversation and connection. The expert also advises being mindful of a child's fluctuating appetite and involving them in food preparation to foster familiarity and curiosity. These approaches aim to build a healthier long-term relationship with food by reducing pressure and conflict.</p>

          <h2>Ed Sheeran's New Album 'Play' Receives Mixed Reviews for Its Blend of Global Sounds and Pop Formula</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 20:09:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth album, "Play," is being reviewed as a direct response to a difficult personal period, aiming to create joy by exploring Asian and Middle Eastern musical cultures. While the record incorporates instruments like the sitar and tabla and features a duet with Indian superstar Arjit Singh, critics note that these influences are often assimilated into Sheeran's familiar, commercially safe pop style. Some tracks are praised for their adventurousness and raw emotion, but much of the album is seen as retreating to the safety of his established formula of love ballads and frictionless pop.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stock markets across the Asia-Pacific region traded higher, tracking overnight gains on Wall Street as investor sentiment was boosted by easing inflation pressures and expectations for upcoming interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both saw notable increases, continuing a global equity rally. This momentum is attributed to monetary stimulus from various central banks and the growing anticipation that the Fed will soon join them in implementing easier monetary policies, which typically encourages investment in stock markets.

          <p>Over the past 25 years, Denmark has transformed its cancer care, dramatically improving survival rates and moving ahead of countries like the UK. This success was driven by a long-term national strategy that included massive investments in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, setting strict targets for rapid diagnosis and treatment, and enhancing the overall patient experience. The Danish model, which also incorporates at-home chemotherapy and mental health support, is now being studied by UK policymakers as a potential blueprint for reforming and improving the National Health Service.</p>

          <p>The iconic mockumentary band Spinal Tap is returning for a sequel, "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," more than 40 years after the original film. The movie reunites the original cast—Michael McKean, Harry Shearer, and Christopher Guest—as the hilariously inept British rockers who are contractually obligated to perform one last gig. Directed again by Rob Reiner, the film also features cameos from music legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John. The sequel explores what the band members have been doing since their split and their chaotic journey to a reunion show.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has overturned an apartheid-era law, ruling that husbands now have the right to take their wives' family names upon marriage. The court declared the previous legislation, which only permitted women to change their surnames, was a discriminatory "colonial import" that violated the constitutional right to gender equality. The case was brought by two couples who challenged the Department of Home Affairs. The government has been given two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the landmark decision, which has sparked a mix of praise and debate.</p>
