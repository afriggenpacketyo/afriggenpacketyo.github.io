          <p>Singapore's passport has once again been named the most powerful in the world, according to the latest Henley Passport Index for 2025. The ranking, which assesses passports based on the number of destinations holders can access without a prior visa, shows the city-state maintaining its top position. Meanwhile, the report highlights a continued decline for both the United States and the United Kingdom, with the U.S. passport slipping to 10th place. The top of the list remains largely dominated by European nations, alongside key Asian economies like Japan and South Korea, which tied for second place.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a significant trade agreement with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff rate on Japanese exports, a notable reduction from the previous 25% on automobiles. The deal also involves a reported $550 billion investment from Japan into the United States and opens Japanese markets to more U.S. goods, including agricultural products. Following the announcement, Japanese automotive stocks surged, with major companies like Toyota and Mazda seeing significant gains. This agreement is seen as a political victory for Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, potentially strengthening his leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of major Japanese automakers, including Toyota, Honda, and Nissan, experienced a significant surge following the announcement of a new U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports from 25% to 15%, providing substantial relief to Japan's cornerstone export industry. The news prompted an immediate and strong positive reaction in the market, with some auto stocks jumping by over 10%. This development is a crucial boost for the Japanese auto sector, which had seen exports to the U.S. decline in previous months under the pressure of higher tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams achieved a historic milestone at the DC Open, becoming the second-oldest woman in the professional era to win a tour-level singles match. At 45 years old, Williams defeated Peyton Stearns, who is 22 years her junior, in straight sets. This marked her first singles victory in nearly two years, following a significant period away from the sport for surgery. The only older player to win a match was Martina Navratilova at age 47 in 2004. Williams displayed flashes of her classic power, advancing to the second round of the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have placed relief pitcher Tanner Scott on the injured list with elbow inflammation, though the team remains optimistic that the injury is not season-ending. Scott exited a recent game with a "stinging sensation" in his forearm, but reports indicate he felt better the following day. The injury underscores the team's need to acquire another high-leverage reliever before the trade deadline, especially with several other key bullpen arms already on the injured list. In Scott's absence, manager Dave Roberts plans to use a closer-by-committee approach while awaiting a full medical evaluation.</p>

          <p>England's journey to the Euro 2025 final has been significantly boosted by the performance of substitutes Chloe Kelly and Michelle Agyemang, drawing comparisons to the famous "super sub" duo of Russo and Toone from Euro 2022.

Nineteen-year-old Agyemang scored the stoppage-time equalizer against Italy, while Kelly scored the extra-time winner.

          <p>A shipwreck discovered on the Scottish island of Sanday has been identified as the Earl of Chatham, a vessel with a rich history dating back 250 years. The ship began its life as HMS Hind, a Royal Navy frigate that saw action in the American War of Independence, before being sold and repurposed as an Arctic whaling ship. Researchers used a combination of dendrochronology on its oak timbers and archival records to trace its identity after it was uncovered by a storm. The investigation was a collaborative effort between archaeologists and the local island community, who helped recover the historic timbers.</p>
