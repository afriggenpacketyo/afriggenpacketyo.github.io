          <p>The London Spirit's winning streak in The Hundred women's cricket tournament has ended with a 33-run defeat to the Trent Rockets. Propelled by an unbeaten 51 from England captain Nat Sciver-Brunt, the Rockets set a challenging target of 150. In response, the Spirit's batting lineup struggled, collapsing to 116 all out against a strong bowling performance, with spinner Kirstie Gordon taking four wickets. This victory marks the first for the Rockets this season, shaking up the tournament standings and leaving Welsh Fire as the only winless team.</p>

          <p>The City of Wolverhampton Council has retracted its plan to introduce a 20% surcharge for wider burial plots following significant public criticism and a BBC investigation. The proposal, which was labeled a "fat tax" by a local funeral director, aimed to address the increased demand for larger graves due to rising obesity rates. Residents and critics argued the policy was discriminatory and would place an unfair financial burden on grieving families. After initially defending the move, the council announced it would not proceed with the controversial extra charges.</p>

In a coordinated effort, the Treasury Department also announced economic sanctions, and the State Department offered rewards totaling $26 million for information leading to their arrests.

          <p>Aviva's chief executive, Amanda Blanc, has confirmed the insurer's unwavering commitment to its net zero climate goals, despite increasing political pushback in the U.S. and UK. Blanc emphasized that addressing climate change is crucial for the company's core business of insuring properties against the rising frequency of extreme weather events like wildfires and floods. The statement comes as some major U.S. and UK banks have withdrawn from climate alliances, and it coincides with Aviva reporting a 22% jump in operating profit, which pushed its shares to their highest level since 2008.</p>

          <p>The average interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage in the U.S. has fallen to 6.58%, its lowest point in nearly ten months. This marks the fourth straight week of declines, offering a potential boost to the housing market by increasing purchasing power for prospective buyers. The drop in rates is linked to falling yields on 10-year Treasury bonds, influenced by speculation about a potential Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Despite the recent dip, economists generally expect mortgage rates to remain above 6% for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Economist Marc Sumerlin has confirmed that he is a contender for the position of Federal Reserve chair and stated his belief that an aggressive interest rate cut is warranted. Sumerlin, a former senior economist in the George W. Bush administration, argued that current economic conditions could easily accommodate a 50-basis-point cut without disruption. He confirmed contact from the White House regarding the position but stressed that his acceptance would depend on being "in synch" with the president while maintaining the Fed's crucial independence.

          <p>In Virginia's 2025 gubernatorial race, Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger has launched her first Spanish-language radio ad to appeal to the state's growing Latino electorate. The ad focuses on economic issues, with Spanberger promising to lower costs for families, a key concern for Latino voters according to recent polling. This early outreach reflects a broader Democratic effort to reconnect with this demographic after seeing diminished support in the 2024 elections. Her opponent, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, is simultaneously running ads positioning Spanberger as a "Washington insider."</p>

          <p>Researchers at MIT have utilized generative artificial intelligence to invent two new potential antibiotics that have successfully killed drug-resistant bacteria, including MRSA and gonorrhea, in laboratory and animal tests. The AI designed the molecular structures of the drugs from scratch, a significant step beyond previous methods that only screened existing chemicals. While these compounds require years of further refinement and clinical trials before they can be used in humans, the breakthrough suggests that AI could usher in a new era of antibiotic discovery to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance.</p>

          <p>This year's A-level results in the UK show a slight increase in the proportion of top grades (A* or A) to 28.3%, with boys outperforming girls for the first time since 2018. However, the data also reveals a growing regional gap in England, with students in London achieving significantly more top grades than those in the North East. Despite a smaller A-level cohort, a record number of 18-year-olds secured their first-choice university place, particularly at more selective institutions. Meanwhile, enrollment in vocational T-levels has increased, though dropout rates for the qualification remain high.</p>
