          <p>President Trump announced a significant shift in his Ukraine policy, stating his belief that Ukraine, with European Union support, can "fight and WIN all of Ukraine back in its original form." This marks a departure from his previous calls for Ukraine to relinquish some territory occupied by Russia. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also indicated Trump's patience with Russia is not infinite, hinting at potential further economic costs or offensive weaponry sales if peace is not achieved. This article highlights a major policy reversal from the president, suggesting a more aggressive stance towards Russia's ongoing aggression.</p>

          <p>Oregon state police announced a potential breakthrough in the nearly 80-year-old cold case of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," whose dismembered body parts were found in 1946 along the Willamette River. The remains, discovered under an "Unknown Woman 1946" headstone, are now subject to advanced forensic testing, offering hope to finally identify the victim. This case, which involved the discovery of various body parts and a determination of blunt force trauma, had gone cold in the 1950s due to missing evidence. Authorities express optimism about restoring the victim's name and identity to history.</p>
