          <p>The rapid expansion of AI is creating an unprecedented demand for electricity, placing energy company GE Vernova in a critical position. Tech giants require massive power for their data centers, leading to a surge in orders for GE Vernova's gas-fired turbines, with the company's manufacturing capacity largely sold out for years. This demand has caused the company's stock to soar, reflecting its pivotal role in powering the ongoing technological revolution. Despite the windfall, the company is cautiously expanding production, mindful of a past boom-and-bust cycle in the early 2000s. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Liverpool's 16-year-old forward, Rio Ngumoha, is generating significant excitement after a standout performance in a pre-season friendly at Anfield. The England Under-17 international scored one goal and assisted another against Athletic Bilbao, continuing his impressive form throughout the summer. His performance has led fans and pundits to speculate whether he could earn a regular spot in the first-team squad this season. Ngumoha, who joined from Chelsea's academy last year, became Liverpool's second-youngest player ever in an FA Cup match in January and appears poised for a potential breakthrough.</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Stock Surges After Donald Trump's Endorsement of Sydney Sweeney Ad</h2>

          <p>Shares of retailer American Eagle experienced a 20% surge after Donald Trump posted his support for the company's controversial ad campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. The campaign had previously faced criticism, but Trump's praise, in which he called it the "hottest ad out there," appeared to trigger a rally in the company's stock. The event highlights the volatile intersection of culture wars, celebrity endorsements, and market performance. The surge in interest and stock price provides a potential boost for the retailer, which has been struggling with declining sales in recent months. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Scientists Identify Bacterial Cause of Decade-Long Sea Star Wasting Epidemic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 13:16:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified the cause of a devastating sea star wasting disease that has killed over five billion sea stars along North America's Pacific coast since 2013. The culprit is a bacteria, Vibrio pectenicida, which was also found to infect shellfish, solving a long-standing ecological mystery. The epidemic has critically endangered species like the sunflower sea star, leading to cascading effects on the ecosystem, such as the destruction of kelp forests by unchecked sea urchin populations. This discovery provides a crucial first step toward developing interventions, such as captive breeding programs, to help restore the vital sea star populations.</p>

          <h2>Study Finds Eating Minimally Processed Meals Leads to Double the Weight Loss Compared to Healthy Ultraprocessed Foods</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 13:04:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new clinical trial has found that people lost twice as much weight on a diet of minimally processed, home-style meals compared to a diet of ultraprocessed foods, even when the latter were designed to be nutritionally healthy. Over an eight-week period, participants on the minimally processed diet consumed fewer calories and lost more weight and body fat. This research, the largest of its kind, suggests that the level of food processing itself plays a significant role in calorie intake and weight management. The findings reinforce the benefits of diets based on whole foods, cooked from their natural state.</p>

          <h2>European Union Suspends Retaliatory Tariffs on U.S. Goods for Six Months</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 12:45:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced it will delay its planned retaliatory tariffs against the United States for six months, pushing back a deadline that was set for this week. The move is intended to provide time for both sides to implement a trade agreement reached in late July between European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and President Trump. That political agreement, which set a 15% tariff on most EU goods entering the U.S., is seen as a step toward restoring stability in transatlantic trade relations. The suspension of the EU's countermeasures provides a temporary de-escalation in the ongoing trade dispute.</p>
