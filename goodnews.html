          <p>A potential tragedy was averted at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport when police arrested a 49-year-old man, Billy Cagle, who allegedly threatened to "shoot it up." His family alerted authorities after seeing his social media livestream, leading to his swift apprehension inside the terminal. Officers located an AR-15 assault rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his parked pickup truck. Police Chief Darin Schierbaum credited the community's vigilance and law enforcement's rapid coordination for preventing a mass shooting, noting the suspect's known mental health challenges and prior felony record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's renewed calls to deploy the National Guard to San Francisco are creating tension amidst the city's post-pandemic resurgence, largely fueled by the artificial intelligence boom. San Francisco is experiencing significantly reduced crime rates, increased tourism, and a booming residential and commercial real estate market, with AI venture funding surpassing previous records. While local officials tout the city's improved safety, Trump insists on deployment, though Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, who initially supported the idea, has since retracted his stance. The city's mayor, Daniel Lurie, emphasizes San Francisco's positive direction and economic opportunities.</p>

          <h2>Cannabis-Infused Beverages Gain Popularity as Alcohol Consumption Declines</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-20 17:19:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As Americans consume less alcohol, cannabis-infused beverages, containing THC and sometimes CBD, are experiencing a surge in demand. These drinks, including seltzers, juices, and teas, are projected to grow from $1.1 billion to nearly $5.6 billion in sales by 2035. While many brands market them as nonalcoholic, zero-calorie alternatives, doctors caution about potential side effects like anxiety, paranoia, and impaired coordination. The patchwork of state regulations allows legal sales in 44 states, with major retailers like Target now testing the market. This trend is particularly appealing to women in their 30s and 40s seeking healthier alternatives to alcoholic drinks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Controversial Confederate monuments, including a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee and a graffitied equestrian sculpture of Lee and Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson, are now central to a new art exhibition in Los Angeles. The 'Monuments' show, curated by Hamza Walker, displays these decommissioned figures alongside contemporary art, aiming to challenge the 'Lost Cause' ideology that romanticizes the Confederacy. The exhibition opens amidst President Donald Trump's calls for reinstallation of such monuments, highlighting the ongoing debate over American history and racial narratives. One notable piece is Kara Walker's 'Unmanned Drone,' a reconstructed, zombie-like sculpture of Stonewall Jackson.</p>

          <p>A United Airlines Boeing 737 en route from Denver to Los Angeles International Airport was forced to make an emergency landing in Salt Lake City after its windscreen shattered mid-flight. The incident, which occurred near Moab, Utah, resulted in a pilot sustaining a bloodied and cut arm. All 140 passengers and crew aboard Flight 1093 landed safely and were subsequently transferred to a different aircraft to continue their journey. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of the windscreen damage.</p>

          <p>A groundbreaking clinical study has shown that a tiny eye implant combined with special glasses can help some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy read again. Out of 32 patients, 26 demonstrated meaningful improvement in visual acuity 12 months after receiving the photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA). The treatment involves a hair-thin implant under the retina and glasses that project images via infrared light. While the device is not yet licensed, this breakthrough offers significant hope for the approximately 5 million people worldwide affected by geographic atrophy, a leading cause of blindness in older individuals.</p>

          <p>LeBron James is no longer facing a small claims court lawsuit after a Lakers fan, Andrew Garcia, dropped his claim to recoup money spent on tickets. Garcia had sued after a social media teaser from James about a "Second Decision" turned out not to be a retirement announcement. Garcia accepted an offer from the PrizePicks fantasy sports app, which deposited the full $865.66 cost of his tickets into his account, along with future Lakers tickets and merchandise. Garcia stated he dismissed the case because he felt fully compensated, avoiding any appearance of "double-dipping."</p>

          <p>For over two centuries, the U.S. Constitution has evolved through amendments like the 13th, abolishing slavery, and the 19th, granting women's suffrage, reflecting its design as a living document. Historian Jill Lepore highlights that the founders anticipated constant revisions, with over 200 amendments initially proposed by states, leading to the Bill of Rights. Despite its adaptability, modern challenges include a perceived breakdown in checks-and-balances, with Congress often failing to act and courts becoming overly powerful. Experts emphasize the Constitution's enduring principles of freedom and limited government, crucial for averting tyranny.</p>

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent also indicated plans for price floors in industries like rare earths to combat market manipulation. Companies like NioCorp, Energy Fuels, and USA Rare Earth saw significant gains, with William Blair initiating coverage on USA Rare Earth, anticipating a material stake from the Trump administration.

China's dominance in the global rare earths supply chain and recent export controls have spurred U.S. efforts to establish domestic sources, with the Defense Department already striking a deal with MP Materials.

The new film will showcase American landscapes and cityscapes, reflecting a potential shift towards an "America First" agenda, as seen in President Trump's policies.
