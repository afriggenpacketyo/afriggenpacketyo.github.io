          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is buying 80 shares of Boeing at approximately $217, increasing its total holdings to 240 shares. This move aims to build up their newest position at a price more than 5% below their initial basis, following the strategy of reducing the overall weighted average cost. The purchase comes after Boeing shares fell due to CEO Kelly Ortberg's comments about delays in 777x certification. The Trust views this as a short-term dip, believing the company's long-term cash flow trajectory and improved balance sheet remain intact (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved a France and Saudi-backed resolution supporting a two-state solution for Israel and the Palestinians, explicitly without Hamas involvement. The "New York Declaration" calls for Hamas to free all hostages, end its rule in Gaza, and hand over weapons to the Palestinian Authority. This move precedes a September 22 summit where French President Emmanuel Macron plans to formally recognize Palestine, increasing pressure on Israel. The article highlights this significant diplomatic step, which also condemns Hamas's October 7 attacks and seeks collective action to end the Gaza war.</p>

          <p>Julia Fenner, a UK-Belarus dual citizen and wife of a British diplomat, has been freed from prison in Belarus as part of a broader release deal with the United States.

While opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya welcomed the release, she warned it was a "forced deportation" and expressed concern for other political prisoners, including veteran dissident Mikola Statkevich.</p>
