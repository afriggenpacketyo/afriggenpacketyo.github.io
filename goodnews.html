          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:59:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice, the UN's highest court, has issued a non-binding but influential advisory opinion stating that countries can sue each other over the impacts of climate change. This ruling is a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, particularly Pacific islands, who initiated the case due to frustration with the lack of global action. The court affirmed that countries have legal obligations under international law to protect the environment and the climate system, even beyond existing agreements like the Paris Accord. This decision could pave the way for future compensation claims against historically high-emitting nations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German cabinet has approved a new law designed to accelerate the procurement of weapons and military equipment for the Bundeswehr by reducing bureaucratic hurdles. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called the move a "quantum leap" for national security, citing Russia as the most immediate threat. The legislation will raise value limits for direct contracts, bypassing lengthy tender processes, and facilitate cooperation with defense technology start-ups. The move aims to enhance Germany's defense capabilities and meet NATO spending targets, though it has drawn criticism from opposition parties over potential waste and lack of transparency.</p>

          <h2>Understanding the Minimum Payment on a $2,000 Credit Card Balance</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:54:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With rising inflation and high interest rates, many consumers carry credit card balances, making it crucial to understand how minimum payments are calculated. For a $2,000 balance at a 22% APR, the minimum payment could range from $40 to $60, depending on the issuer's formula, which often involves a percentage of the balance plus interest. Paying only the minimum is a costly long-term strategy, as compounding interest significantly increases the total amount repaid. Experts advise paying more than the minimum whenever possible to reduce debt faster. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of this year's Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish on stage 17. The 160.4km stage concluded in a bunch sprint as anticipated, after the peloton absorbed the last breakaway rider with 4km remaining. A crash in the final kilometer, amidst heavy rain, affected several of Milan's key rivals, including Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay. Milan's powerful finish allowed him to beat Jordi Meeus and further solidify his lead in the points classification, strengthening his hold on the green jersey.</p>

          <p>Uber is introducing a new feature that allows women drivers and riders in the U.S. to state a preference for being paired with each other. The pilot program will launch next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, aiming to enhance safety and comfort on the platform. While not a guarantee, the tool is designed to increase the likelihood of women-to-women matches. This initiative expands on a similar feature Uber rolled out in other countries and comes as ride-hailing companies continue to address long-standing safety concerns, including incidents of sexual assault and harassment.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 11:13:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners facing rejection for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) should first ask the lender for the specific reasons, as this clarifies what needs improvement. Common denial factors include high debt-to-income ratios, insufficient home equity, or a low credit score, with many lenders requiring a score in the mid-600s or higher. To improve approval odds, experts recommend reducing debt, correcting errors on credit reports, and boosting one's credit score. If a HELOC remains out of reach, alternatives like a fixed-rate home equity loan, a cash-out refinance, or a personal loan can be considered. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former City traders Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, who were jailed for manipulating the Libor and Euribor interbank lending rates, have had their convictions quashed by the UK Supreme Court. After a decade-long legal battle, the court ruled their original trials were unfair due to flawed jury directions, rendering the convictions "unsafe." The men argued they were wrongly prosecuted for what were then normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office will not seek a retrial, and the ruling could open the door for other convicted traders to appeal.</p>

          <p>Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, driven by strong performance in its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming division. Revenue from this segment grew 16%, led by the success of Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, which helped offset a 16% decline in the traditional consumer products segment. The company's toy business continues to face headwinds from tariffs and shifting retailer orders. Despite an overall revenue dip of 1%, Hasbro raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in its gaming-centric strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence tool, named Aeneas, that can help fill in missing words from ancient Roman inscriptions. The system analyzes a vast database of 176,000 known inscriptions to find historical parallels, allowing it to suggest missing text and also estimate the date and geographical origin of damaged artifacts. Historians who tested the tool found that it accelerated their work and revealed connections they had not previously considered. While not a replacement for human expertise, Aeneas acts as a powerful assistant that could significantly advance the study of ancient history.</p>

          <p>Ben Schneider, the frontman of the band Lord Huron, discusses the themes of mystery and unanswered questions that permeate their new album, "The Cosmic Selector: Vol. 1." In a recent interview, Schneider reflects on his creative process, which often involves posing existential questions rather than providing answers, a style influenced by his admiration for figures like David Lynch. He also touches on the band's unexpected success, his background in visual arts, and his collaboration with Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausgård, who wrote the album's press bio. The article portrays Schneider as a thoughtful artist who embraces strangeness and nostalgia.</p>
