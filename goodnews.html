          <p>All flights for SkyWest Airlines, the largest regional airline in the United States, were temporarily grounded nationwide on Friday night. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration reported that the ground stop was issued at the airline's request and lasted for 21 minutes before being canceled. SkyWest operates flights for major carriers including United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines. The specific reason for the brief but widespread halt in operations was not immediately disclosed by the airline or the FAA, leaving the cause of the disruption unclear.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has blocked the Trump administration from expanding its fast-track deportation policy, known as expedited removal, across the entire country. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that the expansion, which allowed for deporting migrants anywhere in the U.S. without a court hearing if they couldn't prove two years of residency, likely violates due process rights. Previously, this policy was limited to migrants found within 100 miles of a border who had been in the country for less than two weeks. The ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's aggressive immigration enforcement strategy, though it is expected to be appealed.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic overcame a lower back injury to defeat Britain's Cameron Norrie and advance to the last 16 of the U.S. Open. The 24-time Grand Slam champion won the match in four sets, marking his seventh victory against Norrie in as many meetings. Djokovic, 38, required two medical time-outs during the nearly three-hour contest to address his back issue. The victory keeps his quest for a record 25th major title alive in his first tournament since the Wimbledon semi-finals seven weeks ago. Norrie's exit marks the end of British singles contention at the tournament.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new world record by rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean in 140 days. Their 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia was fraught with challenges, including violent storms that swept one brother overboard and forced significant detours. They beat the previous record of 162 days, completing the feat in a boat named after their unborn sister. The row has also served as a major fundraising effort, raising over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

          <p>A scenic 10-mile stretch of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for several years due to extensive storm and fire damage. The section of Highway 2, which provides access to popular hiking trails in the Angeles National Forest, was severely damaged by rock slides and pavement collapses during the stormy winters of 2022 and 2023, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The $7.9 million repair project included installing new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening is expected to reduce overcrowding at other trailheads, though it coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for the area.</p>

          <p>Global asset managers are growing more optimistic about Chinese stocks after the Shanghai Composite Index reached a 10-year high. Investment directors suggest the rally could be sustained by both domestic and overseas investors seeking better returns, as yields on fixed-income products have fallen to record lows. China's massive US$22 trillion in savings, combined with Beijing's focus on technological innovation in fields like AI and advanced manufacturing, are seen as key catalysts. Despite a recent exodus of foreign capital, analysts believe that undervalued Chinese equities have significant room to grow compared to other major global markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has prevented the Trump administration from ending Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans living in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously affirmed a lower court's ruling, stating that the administration likely acted unlawfully by trying to terminate the protections. The judges found that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem lacked the statutory authority to end a TPS extension that had been granted by the previous administration. This decision ensures that TPS for Venezuelans remains in place while the legal challenge proceeds, protecting them from deportation.</p>

          <p>A charity program in the UK is helping anxious teenagers improve their school attendance by pairing them with toddlers from local nurseries for mentoring sessions.

          <p>Major coffee chains like Costa Coffee are reportedly struggling as consumer tastes, particularly among younger generations, evolve. The rise of trendy alternatives like matcha, offered by newer chains such as Blank Street Coffee, is drawing customers away from traditional coffee-focused brands. Analysts suggest that in a competitive market, legacy brands are caught between cheap, quick options like Greggs and the high-end experience of artisanal shops. With home coffee machines becoming more popular, chains must offer unique, treat-worthy products to entice customers, a challenge for brands that have been slow to adapt to new trends.</p>
