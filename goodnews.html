        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore's core inflation rate eased to 0.3% in August, its lowest since February 2021, falling below economists' expectations of 0.5% due to reduced services costs. Headline inflation also dropped to 0.5%, with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) attributing the decline to cheaper holiday expenses, airfares, and inpatient services. The MAS maintains its full-year inflation forecast for 2025 between 0.5% and 1.5%, anticipating that global trade conflicts' inflationary impact on some economies will be offset by weaker global demand's disinflationary drags. This easing occurs as the city-state prepares for slower growth in the latter half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping is more likely to occur early next year than this fall, according to U.S. Ambassador to China David Perdue. Perdue's comments follow President Trump's social media post about a potential meeting next month and a visit to China early next year, details which were absent from the Chinese readout. The U.S. delegation, including lawmakers, discussed the potential meeting and other issues like TikTok ownership during their rare visit to Beijing. Ambassador Perdue indicated a positive and encouraging relationship currently exists between the two leaders.</p>

          <p>NFL Week Three delivered an extraordinary Sunday dominated by unheralded kickers and backup quarterbacks, with five games settled on the last play, four by field goals. The Philadelphia Eagles staged a massive comeback against the Los Angeles Rams, remaining unbeaten after blocking a last-gasp field goal and returning it for a touchdown. The Cleveland Browns secured an upset win against the Green Bay Packers with a dramatic 55-yard kick, ending an eight-game losing streak. Notable performances included Mac Jones leading the San Francisco 49ers to a 3-0 start and Daniel 'Indiana' Jones's historic form for the Indianapolis Colts.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A paediatrician, Mike Freelander, reassures Australians that paracetamol remains a safe medication for use during pregnancy, directly refuting recent comments by US President Donald Trump linking it to autism. Freelander emphasizes that extensive studies have found no evidence of causation, with the largest and most recent Swedish and Japanese studies disproving a causative effect. He stresses the importance of trusting regulatory frameworks like Australia's TGA, which classify paracetamol as safe, and warns against unscientific health policies that can cause significant anxiety and inappropriate health outcomes. This article advocates for reliance on expert scientific evidence in healthcare decisions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized websites use bots and fake identities to resell tickets at inflated prices, often leaving fans out of pocket. The problem was highlighted during a Brighton vs. Tottenham match, where over a hundred fans, including a supporter who traveled 5,500 miles, were turned away due to illegitimate tickets. Brighton is actively combating this issue with new technology and a dedicated investigation officer, preventing an estimated £100,000 in transactions to touts for one match alone. The Premier League is also introducing encrypted digital ticketing to make touting more difficult.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding that was frozen at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). U.S. District Judge Rita Lin granted a preliminary injunction, stating the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act by cutting funds without specific explanations, citing allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action. This ruling follows an earlier order restoring $81 million to UCLA and comes amidst the Trump administration's broader efforts to pressure elite colleges through federal funding. The restored funds include hundreds of medical research grants crucial for improving American health.</p>

          <p>Sam Allardyce, once criticized for his direct football style, observes a modern resurgence of his playbook in the Premier League, with teams increasingly emphasizing set-pieces and long passes. The article highlights how coaches are now adopting tactics like goalkeepers hitting long balls and utilizing big strikers for flick-ons, mirroring Allardyce's successful methods from over two decades ago. Allardyce notes that modern coaches, including Paris St-Germain's Luis Enrique, are even adopting his preference for watching games from the stands for a better overview. This shift reflects a move away from the 'pandemic' of playing out from the back, as teams prioritize sensible use of skills and set-piece efficiency.</p>

          <p>Laura Weir, the new CEO of the British Fashion Council, emphasizes resilience as a crucial leadership trait for navigating the fashion industry's current challenges, including global tariffs and economic uncertainty. Weir's tenure began as President Donald Trump imposed "reciprocal" tariffs on over 180 countries, significantly impacting key manufacturing bases for fashion brands. She expressed optimism for finding solutions through collaboration with American counterparts to explain the tariffs' severe impact on designers' ability to trade and remain commercially viable. The article notes that a recent survey of business leaders across sectors also identifies resilience as the most important quality for company bosses in the current climate.</p>

          <p>While major European financial hubs face an IPO drought, the Stockholm Stock Exchange is thriving, having raised nearly $2 billion in 2025, significantly outpacing other centers. This article attributes Sweden's success to a deeply ingrained national "equity culture," a diverse pool of domestic capital, and a supportive regulatory framework developed over decades. Government policies, like tax-incentivized savings funds and the Investment Savings Account, have fostered high retail investor participation, with about 70% of Swedish household wealth held in equity. The mature ecosystem, including the use of "cornerstone" investors and efficient listing processes, makes Sweden a model for European IPO markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese buyers have booked at least 10 cargoes of soybeans from Argentina, leveraging low prices due to Argentina's temporary removal of export taxes, amidst ongoing Sino-U.S. trade tensions. This move allows China to build inventories for the fourth quarter, bypassing U.S. supplies, as U.S. farmers miss out on significant sales. The deals followed Argentina's policy to suspend grain export taxes through October, or until declared exports reach $7 billion, which subsequently drove down Chinese soymeal futures. Experts suggest the impact of this policy on prices may be short-lived due to Argentina's limited overall supply. (not investment advice)</p>

He highlighted the courage of these journalists in holding their own industry accountable, contrasting it with the Post Office Horizon IT scandal where public awareness was slower to build despite earlier journalistic efforts.
