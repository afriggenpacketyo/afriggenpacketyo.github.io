          <h2>Flight Path Redesign Aims for Quicker Flights and Reduced Delays</h2>

          <p>The UK government plans to modernize flight paths, potentially leading to shorter journey times, fewer delays, and increased flight capacity. The UK Airspace Design Service (UKADS) will redesign routes, many of which were established 70 years ago, with an initial focus on the complex airspace around London. While changes are not expected for several years, some residents fear new flight paths could increase noise pollution over previously unaffected areas. The government says the plans could allow planes to climb quicker during take off and descend more smoothly.</p>

          <p>Mount Etna, located on the Italian island of Sicily, has erupted, spewing hot ash and lava. The nation's volcano monitoring body reported "explosions of increasing intensity" and a "lava fountain" from the Southeast Crater. There have been no immediate reports of risk to the local population or air travel, as residents are accustomed to Etna's frequent eruptions. Mount Etna is considered the most active volcano in Europe and the most active stratovolcano in the world.</p>

          <p>Maintaining a romantic relationship requires effort and communication, but determining when the work becomes too much can be challenging. Research suggests that couples who invest effort in their relationships experience greater long-term satisfaction. However, relational upkeep should not come at the expense of one's mental or physical health, and it is essential to recognize when a partnership is no longer a good fit. Open communication and a willingness to address issues are crucial for ensuring the relationship can grow.</p>

          <p>Major steel stocks experienced a significant surge after President Donald Trump announced a doubling of tariffs on steel imports. Cleveland-Cliffs shares jumped approximately 25% in premarket trading, while Steel Dynamics and Nucor also saw substantial gains. Trump's decision to increase tariffs to 50% from 25% has reignited trade tensions and faced criticism from global partners. The VanEck Steel ETF (SLX) also reflected the positive market sentiment, adding 1.9%.</p>

          <p>Space agencies and commercial companies are increasingly focused on returning to the moon, driven by the prospect of using it as a base for missions to Mars and for scientific research. NASA's Artemis program aims to establish a permanent base at the moon's South Pole, while a joint China-Russia project plans to build the International Lunar Research Station by 2035. The moon's abundant resources, including iron, silicon, and water, are also attracting interest, with potential for mining operations and the development of self-sufficient lunar bases. These bases could also be used as "transit lounges" for astronauts on their way to Mars.</p>

          <h2>The Limits of Self-Knowledge: Why You Don't Know Yourself As Well As You Think</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While self-knowledge is often encouraged, the pursuit of perfect self-understanding is unattainable and can be detrimental. Humans have limitations in their ability to see themselves clearly due to unconscious behaviors, biases, and a limited awareness of their capacity for change. Introspection can lead to rumination and undermine well-being by overthinking positive aspects of life. Instead of seeking a perfectly accurate story, individuals should construct a narrative that is positive and somewhat reality-based, allowing for flexibility and surprise.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new poll suggests that voters prefer a Democratic candidate focused on combating corporate power over one focused on reducing regulatory "bottlenecks." However, this analysis argues that the political case for "abundance" policies, like zoning liberalization and permitting reform, rests on their material benefits, not their rhetorical appeal. There is no inherent tension between progressive economic policies and "abundance" reforms, and both can contribute to improving working people's living standards. Ultimately, the debate is more about effective governance than political messaging.</p>

          <p>A major international trial has shown that an exercise program for colon cancer patients can reduce the risk of dying by a third. The three-year program, which began soon after chemotherapy, aimed to have people doing at least double the amount of exercise set out in the guidelines for the general population. Researchers suggest that it was "not a large amount" of exercise and any type of workout from swimming to salsa classes counted. The scientists are already investigating whether similar exercise regimes could improve survival for people with other diseases, such as breast cancer.</p>
