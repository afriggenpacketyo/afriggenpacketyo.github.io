          <p>The Oval Invincibles have won their third straight men's Hundred championship, defeating the Trent Rockets by 26 runs in the final at Lord's. Star player Will Jacks was instrumental in the victory, scoring a brilliant 72 from 41 balls, the highest individual score in a men's Hundred final. Despite a late effort from the Rockets' Marcus Stoinis, the Invincibles' total of 168-5 proved insurmountable. The decisive moment came from leg-spinner Nathan Sowter, who took three quick wickets to dismantle the Rockets' chase.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has ordered an emergency stop to the Trump administration's plan to deport almost 700 unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after immigrant advocates filed a late-night request, arguing the plan was illegal and deprived the minors of their due process rights to seek asylum. Judge Sparkle L. Sooknanan issued the 14-day halt after a hearing where she noted conflicting narratives from the government and the children's lawyers. The government had claimed the children were being reunited with family, a point disputed by the advocates.</p>

The company acknowledged a "software issue" was impacting service and stated that its engineers were working to resolve the problem. Reports of the outage, tracked by the website DownDetector, peaked in the afternoon with nearly 23,000 complaints from across the country.

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris described his retirement from the Dutch Grand Prix as a significant blow to his Formula 1 world championship aspirations. An oil leak forced him out of the race with only seven laps remaining, widening the points gap to his teammate and race winner, Oscar Piastri, to 34 points. Despite the setback, Norris stated he would "go for it" in the remaining nine races of the season. The incident highlighted the intense championship battle between the two McLaren drivers, who have been the dominant force on the grid this year.</p>

          <p>Gordon Ramsay revealed on social media that he recently underwent surgery to remove basal cell carcinoma, a form of skin cancer, from the side of his face. The celebrity chef shared photos of the bandage and stitches, reassuring fans it was not a facelift and expressing gratitude to his medical team. Ramsay used the announcement to deliver a public health message, strongly urging his followers to wear sunscreen to protect themselves. This is the second time Ramsay has used a personal health scare to advocate for safety, following a bicycle accident last year where he emphasized the importance of helmets.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, recorded his second career hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The ace occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass, where he used a single shot to cover the 177-yard distance. His first hole-in-one came in December 2024 while playing alongside his father at the PNC Championship. Charlie is gradually adding to the family's tally of aces, with his father having 10 recorded holes-in-one in his own career.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the deal will support thousands of UK jobs, primarily at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership will create a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 similar frigates, significantly strengthening NATO's capabilities in the North Atlantic. The agreement represents a major victory for the British defense industry over international competitors.</p>

          <p>At an informal meeting, European Union foreign ministers discussed a range of new strategies to bolster support for Ukraine amid the ongoing war with Russia. Among the ideas floated were imposing secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and exploring ways to use frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv. Another proposal involved inviting Ukrainian arms companies to begin production on EU soil, creating a "safe haven" for its defense industry. The discussions also touched on potentially shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian territory once a ceasefire is achieved.</p>

          <h2>California Kelp Forest Revived After Divers Smash Millions of Predatory Sea Urchins</h2>

          <p>One of the world's largest and most successful kelp restoration projects has revived a vital underwater ecosystem off the coast of Southern California. Over the past decade, a team of divers led by The Bay Foundation has smashed nearly 6 million purple sea urchins, whose populations had exploded and decimated the kelp forests. This effort has cleared over 80 acres of "urchin barrens," allowing the fast-growing giant kelp to return rapidly. The restored "forgotten forest" now provides critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and helps protect the coastline.</p>
