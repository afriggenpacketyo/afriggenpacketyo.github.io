          <p>Japanese stocks, led by the Nikkei 225 and Topix, surged after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba announced his resignation amid pressure from a national election defeat. Investors are now closely watching potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with Takaichi, known for her stance on deregulation and opposition to interest rate hikes, viewed as a candidate likely to drive economic growth and justify the market's positive response. This significant political transition, alongside a weakening yen and rising bond yields reflecting inflation concerns, sets the stage for extended uncertainty in Japan's financial landscape. The broader Asia-Pacific markets experienced mixed trading, with China's exports missing estimates, while global oil prices saw slight increases.</p>

          <p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson was seen pushing a Buffalo Bills fan after the fan made contact with his helmet following a touchdown pass to DeAndre Hopkins. The incident occurred late in the third quarter, with the Ravens leading 34-19, and no penalty was assessed on the play. Jackson appeared to regain his composure on the bench, while Hopkins did not react to the fan's actions. This event sparked discussion among commentators about the fine line between fan interaction and player safety, highlighting the challenges athletes face with close proximity to the stands during intense game moments.</p>

The company also launched Wall-OSS, an open-source foundation model for embodied AI, and its Quanta X2 robot, anticipating "robotic butlers" within five years. Venture capitalists are heavily investing in humanoid robots, driven by expectations of AI integration transforming human-machine interaction, despite current AI for robots lagging behind generative AI advancements. The startup, already generating revenue from sales to schools, hotels, and retirement homes, plans an initial public offering next year, aiming to reduce robot prices to consumer market levels within three to five years.

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz claimed his second U.S. Open trophy and sixth major title overall, defeating defending champion Jannik Sinner in four sets (6-2, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4). This victory marks Alcaraz's second Grand Slam win of 2025, following his French Open triumph against Sinner. The match, delayed due to security for President Trump's attendance, was a historic third consecutive Grand Slam final between the two rivals, solidifying their "New Two" status. Alcaraz's aggressive play, particularly his forehand, proved decisive against Sinner, who admitted his own play was too predictable.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz described his recent US Open victory as the "best tournament" of his career, citing his exceptional consistency throughout the event, dropping only one set and losing his serve just three times across seven matches. This win, his sixth Grand Slam title, also propelled the 22-year-old back to the world No. 1 ranking after a two-year hiatus, fulfilling a major season goal. His rival, Jannik Sinner, reflected on his own "very predictable" play, vowing to make game changes to counter Alcaraz's dominance, despite having beaten him at Wimbledon earlier this year. The article highlights Alcaraz's remarkable five-month run, reaching eight consecutive finals and winning six titles.</p>

          <h2>China-US Study Reveals Unexpected Solid Inner Core in Mars</h2>

          <p>A joint China-US study, utilizing seismic waves from marsquakes recorded by NASA’s now-retired InSight lander, has unexpectedly discovered a solid inner core within Mars. This core, approximately 600km in radius, constitutes about 18% of Mars's total radius, a proportion similar to Earth's inner core. The finding challenges previous assumptions, as most celestial bodies in the solar system have not cooled fast enough to form a solid inner core. This significant discovery could reignite discussions about whether Earth was the only planet to have once developed plate tectonics, potentially adding Mars to the list of planets with inner cores alongside Earth and the Moon.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz won his second U.S. Open title against Jannik Sinner, but the match was notably delayed by President Trump's attendance in a luxury box, drawing mixed cheers and boos. Enhanced security measures for the President caused long lines and delayed entry for many ticketholders. The U.S. Tennis Association reportedly advised broadcasters to edit out crowd reactions to Trump, who was accompanied by a Rolex CEO despite recent tariffs on Swiss products. This marked the first time a sitting president attended the U.S. Open in over two decades, adding a political dimension to the major sporting event.</p>

The dramatic birth, witnessed by her family, occurred during a match dedicated to a deceased "uncle Huggy," leading the couple to name their son Henry James in his memory.

This arrangement, though not without challenges like loneliness, works for them by fostering individual independence and maintaining communication.

The carousel, one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds and featuring horses carved by Charles Looff, had been closed since 2022 following its previous operator's death and a need for repairs. The acquisition is part of a broader restoration plan for the park, with hopes for the carousel to reopen before its 2026 centennial and the 2028 Olympic Games. Despite needing significant repairs, the city secured the unique amusement at a favorable price.</p>

          <p>Global investors are diversifying away from U.S. equities for the first time in a decade, increasingly allocating capital to Asia, according to Bank of America. This shift is driven by a weakening U.S. dollar, expectations of looser Federal Reserve monetary policy in 2025-2026, and Asia's burgeoning artificial intelligence market, projected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030. While U.S. equities attracted significant inflows previously, investment has slowed this year, with a more even split between U.S. and international markets. Asia offers pockets of opportunity and more favorable valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

This phenomenon occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. Astrophysicists explain that the moon appears red because blue wavelengths of sunlight are dispersed more easily by Earth's atmosphere, allowing only the red wavelengths to reflect onto the lunar surface. The event provided a spectacular visual for observers in regions best placed to view it, offering a moment of shared wonder at natural cosmic occurrences.</p>
