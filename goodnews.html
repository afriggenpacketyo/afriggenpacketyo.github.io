          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka defeated American Amanda Anisimova to win her second straight U.S. Open championship, securing her fourth Grand Slam title overall. Sabalenka won the match 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), demonstrating greater consistency against her opponent's powerful but fluctuating performance. The victory was particularly significant for Sabalenka, who had lost in two other major finals earlier in the year, answering questions about her composure in high-stakes matches. For Anisimova, it was her second consecutive Grand Slam final loss, leaving her emotional despite a stronger performance than her previous final at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>An opinion article from Fox News discusses President Trump's executive order to rename the Department of Defense back to its original name, the Department of War. The author argues this change signifies a major shift away from America's role as a "world's policeman" engaged in endless, unwinnable conflicts. The piece suggests the move, supported by new Secretary of War Pete Hegseth, prioritizes lethality and decisive military victories over peacekeeping and nation-building. This new approach is framed as a return to the original purpose of the military: to destroy enemies rather than contain them.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson led Somerset to a dramatic quarter-final victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast with a remarkable last-over performance. Needing 19 runs to win from the final six balls, Dickson hit two sixes and a four, securing the win with one ball to spare. His unbeaten 71 from just 26 balls was crucial after Somerset's chase seemed unlikely. The victory sends Somerset to their record-equalling 11th T20 Blast finals day, where they will face Lancashire, while continuing the Bears' streak of quarter-final defeats.</p>

          <p>China's recent military parade, marking the 80th anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, revealed significant modernization and restructuring within the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The event featured the public debut of three new military branches: the Information Support Force, the Military Aerospace Force, and the Cyberspace Force. These new formations, along with advanced weaponry for electronic and cyber warfare, signal Beijing's strategic focus on integrating high-tech capabilities into joint military operations. Analysts suggest this demonstrates the PLA's evolution into a force capable of operating across all domains of modern conflict.</p>

          <p>England secured their 30th consecutive victory and a place in the Rugby World Cup quarter-finals by defeating Australia 47-7, but the performance raised some concerns. The Red Roses appeared unsettled in the first half, struggling with their set-piece and allowing Australia to take an early lead. Despite eventually overpowering the Wallaroos, England's initial difficulties with their usually dominant driving maul will be noted by stronger rivals like Canada, New Zealand, and France. The victory sets up a quarter-final match against Scotland, but key players Ellie Kildunne and Hannah Botterman left the match with injuries.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game in São Paulo between the Chargers and the Chiefs is a key part of the league's long-term global expansion strategy. This was the first of a record seven international games this season, with future matchups planned for cities like Madrid, Dublin, and Melbourne. NFL executives emphasize that the goal is not a series of one-off events but sustained, year-round engagement to build a global fanbase. By investing in these markets and securing major media deals, like the one with Brazil's Globo, the NFL aims to become a true global sports property.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, an American social media influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean airbase in Antarctica for landing a plane without permission. The 20-year-old was attempting to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research. Chilean authorities accused him of providing false flight plan data, though his lawyer claimed he diverted due to bad weather with authorization. Guo was released on the condition that he pay $30,000 in penalties, donate his raised funds to a children's cancer foundation, and not enter Chile for three years.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen broke the all-time Formula 1 record for the fastest lap during qualifying for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. His pole-setting lap achieved an average speed of 164.466 mph, surpassing the previous record set by Lewis Hamilton in 2020. The new record is attributed to a combination of factors, including the current cars' lower drag, a recently resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's long straights. Verstappen expressed relative optimism about his chances in the race, despite McLaren's typically strong race pace this season.</p>

This is the second national test of the system, which is designed to warn the public of life-threatening emergencies such as extreme weather or terror attacks. The government is using the test to ensure the system's effectiveness after a previous trial revealed technical issues, such as delayed or missed alerts for some users.</p>

          <p>The Reform UK party conference in Birmingham showcases its significant growth and increasing political ambition, according to a BBC analysis. The event is vastly larger than last year's, with the scale and corporate presence of a major party conference, yet it retains an insurgent energy. The article notes the diverse crowd of new members, many of whom are disaffected former Conservative and Labour voters. Leader Nigel Farage's closing speech emphasized the need for discipline and focus, signaling a serious intent to capitalize on the party's momentum and challenge for power in the next general election.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed an executive order aimed at punishing foreign governments that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order empowers the State Department to create a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, which can trigger consequences such as economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the new measure is designed to ensure any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will "pay the price." The move comes as advocacy groups report at least 54 Americans were wrongfully detained in 17 different countries during 2024.</p>

          <p>J.B. Pritzker, the billionaire governor of Illinois, is increasingly positioning himself as a leading voice in the Democratic Party's opposition to Donald Trump. As a wealthy scion of the Hyatt Hotels family, Pritzker has used his personal fortune to support his political ambitions and bring events like the Democratic National Convention to Chicago. The article notes that while he once joked about being a "real billionaire" compared to Trump, the president's recent financial gains have surpassed Pritzker's wealth. This dynamic underscores the high-stakes political and financial battle between the two figures as Pritzker seeks to lead his party.</p>

Following Yvette Cooper's move to the Foreign Office, Dame Angela Eagle and Dame Diana Johnson have also been moved to different departments. They are being replaced by new ministers, including Mike Tapp, a vocal critic of Reform UK known for his focus on illegal immigration. The shake-up, prompted by the resignation of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, is seen as an attempt by Starmer to reset his government's agenda and regain political momentum.</p>
