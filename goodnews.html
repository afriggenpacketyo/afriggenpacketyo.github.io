          <h2>Ancient Chinese Philosophy Aids in Decoding Yeast Cell Life Cycles</h2>

          <p>Chinese researchers have successfully decoded the metabolic cycle of yeast by employing mathematical analysis, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. Professor Li Lei's team reorganized the understanding of yeast metabolism into four distinct, interconnected phases, moving beyond the traditional three-stage process. These phases, named 1A, 1B, 2A, and 2B, reflect unique metabolic states that mirror the concept of mutual promotion and restraint found in traditional Chinese medicine. This approach highlights the balance between passive and active forces, similar to the "four symbols" theory, to maintain harmony within the cell. The study, published in NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics, provides a new perspective on understanding molecular life mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Voting is underway in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, seen as a precursor to the upcoming House of Councillors race, as Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba navigates a minority government. The Liberal Democratic Party aims to retain its seats despite low approval ratings, with no party holding a majority in the assembly. Major parties are actively using social media and street speeches to appeal to voters, especially unaffiliated ones. Key issues include support for households facing inflation, political funding scandals, child-rearing policies, and measures to prevent heatstroke. A new party launched by Shinji Ishimaru, who gained prominence in the 2024 Tokyo gubernatorial race, is also drawing attention.</p>

          <p>Dozens of people were injured when a yacht struck a dock in the Hudson River near the Henry Hudson Parkway and West 125th Street in New York City. The 200-foot party boat, "Timeless," hit a pylon while attempting to dock near Riverside Park. Marine units escorted the yacht to a dock where passengers were unloaded, and 35 people suffered non-life-threatening injuries, with 22 hospitalized. The Coast Guard is investigating the incident, which occurred during a 69th birthday party with nearly 400 people on board. Guests reported being knocked off their feet during the impact.</p>

          <p>After their son, Blaze Bernstein, was murdered by a neo-Nazi due to his sexual orientation and Jewish identity, Jeanne Pepper and Gideon Bernstein transformed their grief into a kindness movement called "BlazeItForward." Blaze was a 19-year-old Ivy League student targeted for who he was, leading to a hate crime that shocked the community. His killer, Samuel Woodward, a former classmate and member of the violent hate group Atomwaffen, was convicted of first-degree murder with a hate crime enhancement and sentenced to life in prison without parole. The couple has promoted positivity and random acts of kindness in Blaze's name, creating a legacy of tolerance and inspiration. The silent stones at Borrego Park, hand-painted with messages of love and peace, serve as a memorial to Blaze and a symbol of hope.</p>

          <p>Chinese authorities are introducing "property supermarkets," both online and offline, to support the country's struggling housing market. Chengdu is the latest city to launch a homebuying platform, partnering with state-owned and private developers to feature over 50 projects on a mobile app. These platforms aim to make homebuying more transparent and efficient, consolidating information and services such as mortgage applications and property registration. Similar initiatives have been rolled out in other cities, with some focusing on residents holding housing vouchers. The goal is to improve transaction efficiency and minimize false promotions by vetting listings through local governments.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourists are increasingly seeking adventure tourism and off-the-beaten-path experiences, moving away from traditional tourist destinations. Social media is a key driver, inspiring travelers to explore remote locales and disconnect from their daily routines. These thrill-seekers are willing to spend more for unique and immersive experiences in nature. Huang Yihe, a 28-year-old from Shanghai, prioritizes avoiding popular sights and recently embarked on a jungle adventure in Malaysia to find the world's largest rafflesia. This trend highlights a shift towards more personalized and adventurous travel among Chinese tourists.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik, convicted of murdering her husband Bob in 2001, had her conviction overturned after spending two decades in prison. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and raised doubts about the original findings. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, Dorotik's legal team presented evidence that some spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. The prosecution admitted that the new DNA evidence cast doubt on the verdict, leading to the overturning of the conviction. Despite the overturned conviction, the DA's office initially decided to retry her, but eventually dismissed the charges, marking the end of Dorotik's legal ordeal.</p>

          <p>Jessi Toronjo, who lost her mother, stepfather, and two sisters in a 1989 murder, has found healing decades after the tragedy. Her stepbrother, Jeff Pelley, was convicted of the crime, which prosecutors argued was motivated by his anger at not being able to attend his prom. Jessi's life was upended, and she struggled with the loss, eventually being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder. She reconnected with a childhood friend, Stephanie Fagan, and cousin, Jamie Collins, who helped her write a book about her experiences. Despite ongoing legal challenges in her stepbrother's case, Jessi focuses on helping others and cherishes her own family.</p>
