          <p>Vivek Ramaswamy's Republican campaign for Ohio governor is gaining financial support from prominent business leaders who previously donated to Democrat Tim Ryan. The campaign reports that nearly $220,000 in contributions have come from former Ryan backers, signaling a potential political shift in the state. Ramaswamy's chief strategist suggests these donors are moving away from traditional Democratic leadership in favor of a message centered on economic growth and fresh ideas. This development, combined with a record fundraising total of $9.7 million in his first few months, positions Ramaswamy as a formidable contender in the 2026 race, even before Ryan has officially announced his candidacy.</p>

          <p>Investors are closely watching two key inflation reports, the Producer Price Index (PPI) and Consumer Price Index (CPI), which are due this week and could influence the Federal Reserve's decision on interest rates. Following a soft jobs report, markets are increasingly pricing in a rate cut in September, and the new inflation data will be critical in confirming this trajectory. Additionally, Apple is set to unveil its new iPhone 17 lineup on Tuesday, with expectations of a thinner model and potential price increases that could boost the company's revenue. These events are expected to be major drivers of stock market performance in the coming days. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>James Lovell, one of NASA's most traveled early astronauts and the commander of the perilous Apollo 13 mission, has died at 97. Lovell flew in space four times, including the first mission to orbit the Moon on Apollo 8. He became a global hero in 1970 for his calm leadership during the Apollo 13 crisis, when an oxygen tank explosion crippled the spacecraft on its way to the moon. Working with his crew and mission control, Lovell successfully guided the damaged craft back to Earth, a feat of survival that captivated the world and was later immortalized in film. His career underscored the heroism and resilience required in the deadly environment of space exploration.</p>

As part of his release, he must pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from entering Chile for three years.

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by controversy within the McLaren team. Lando Norris finished second after his teammate, Oscar Piastri, was instructed to let him pass, a decision that sparked debate. A slow pit stop for Norris had initially dropped him behind Piastri, but the team intervened, citing tactical reasons and referencing a similar situation in a previous race. Piastri complied with the order despite expressing his disagreement over the radio. The result narrows Piastri's championship lead over Norris to 31 points with eight races remaining in the season.</p>

          <p>New Zealand's Black Ferns delivered a powerful performance, defeating Ireland 40-0 to secure the top spot in Pool C of the Women's Rugby World Cup. Teenage winger Braxton Sorensen-McGee was a standout player, scoring a hat-trick of tries in a dominant display by the reigning champions. Although both teams had already qualified for the quarter-finals, New Zealand's victory establishes them as a formidable force in the tournament and serves as revenge for a previous loss to Ireland. Ireland will now face the winner of the France vs. South Africa match in the next round, facing a more challenging path in the knockout stage.</p>

          <p>Millions of mobile phones across the United Kingdom emitted a siren sound on Sunday afternoon as part of a national test of the government's emergency alert system. The test, which occurred around 3:00 PM, involved phones vibrating and sounding an alarm for approximately ten seconds, accompanied by a message clarifying it was a drill. The system is designed to warn the public about life-threatening events such as severe weather or public health emergencies. While the prime minister deemed the test a success, some users reported receiving garbled messages, though the government stated that mobile operators confirmed the test ran as expected.</p>

          <p>Carlo Acutis, an Italian teenager who died of leukemia in 2006 at age 15, has been declared a saint by the Catholic Church, making him the first millennial to receive the honor. Known as "God's influencer," Acutis used his computer programming skills to create a website documenting religious miracles, spreading his faith online. The canonization ceremony, led by Pope Leo XIV in St. Peter's Square, celebrated Acutis as an example for young people, showing that faith can be integrated with modern life. His preserved body, dressed in jeans and sneakers, has become a major pilgrimage site in Assisi, Italy.</p>

          <p>After multiple sightings since 2019, police in the Czech Republic have arrested a 51-year-old man for driving a Formula 1-style racing car on a public motorway. The vehicle, which resembles a Ferrari F1 car but is believed to be a Dallara GP2 model, was seen driving on the D4 motorway before being traced to a property. The driver, who was wearing a full racing suit and helmet, was taken into custody. Because the helmet previously obscured the driver's identity, authorities were unable to press charges. The owner now faces fines and a possible license suspension for operating a vehicle unfit for public roads.</p>

          <p>Cybersecurity firm SentinelOne is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing need for generative AI security through its recent acquisition of Prompt Security. This move allows the company to monitor and secure employee interactions with AI systems, addressing risks like data leakage and prompt injection attacks. While the cybersecurity market is highly competitive, SentinelOne's focus on this emerging sector could become a significant long-term growth driver. The article suggests that with analysts forecasting substantial revenue and earnings growth by fiscal 2030, the company's currently lower valuation compared to peers like CrowdStrike could present a significant opportunity for patient investors.

          <p>In her first television interview since joining the Supreme Court, Justice Amy Coney Barrett addressed criticisms about the court's ideological shift and its handling of cases related to former President Trump's executive power. Barrett maintained that she does not view the court through a political lens, instead focusing on deciding cases based on legal questions. She discussed her vote to overturn Roe v. Wade, stating the Dobbs decision returned the issue of abortion to the democratic process in the states. When questioned about Trump's expansion of executive authority, she emphasized the judiciary's role is to interpret the law within specific cases, not to form political opinions about officeholders.</p>

          <p>Annalena Baerbock, who served as Germany's foreign minister until May, has officially started her new role as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot, reportedly at Russia's request, in a move seen as a reaction to her strong criticism of the war in Ukraine. In her new year-long position, Baerbock will chair meetings and manage discussions among the 193 member states. Her nomination by the outgoing German government was met with some domestic criticism, particularly from Chancellor Friedrich Merz, but she aims to act as a unifying force and an "honest broker" on the global stage.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a 26.4-mile open-ocean route from Catalina Island to the California mainland in a kayak he grew entirely from mushrooms. The vessel was cultivated from mycelium, the root-like network of fungi, which forms a strong, buoyant, and biodegradable material. This journey marks a significant milestone for a small community of innovators exploring fungal materials, known as AquaFung, as a sustainable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. Shoemaker's successful voyage aims to inspire further research and development in this nascent field, demonstrating the potential of nature-based solutions for manufacturing.</p>
