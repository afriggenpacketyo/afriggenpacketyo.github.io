          <p>Renowned figurative painter Alex Katz, now 98, is focusing on promoting other artists by gifting a collection of over 100 paintings to the Portland Museum of Art in Maine. The exhibition, titled "Painting Energy," features works by emerging and established artists that Katz selected for their dynamic quality. Katz, who faced resistance early in his career for his figurative style in an era of abstraction, aims to support artists who experienced similar struggles, emphasizing his belief in giving back to the art community.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 anti-submarine frigates. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined fleet of 13 advanced frigates, enhancing joint operational capabilities in northern Europe.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The rise of artificial intelligence is creating anxiety in the labor market, with job postings declining and entry-level positions being particularly affected. Economists suggest that while AI can automate certain tasks, especially screen-based jobs like coding and data management, it is less likely to replace roles requiring physicality, empathy, or creative thinking, such as healthcare and teaching. While some job displacement is inevitable, experts believe AI will also create new, unforeseen job categories and could lead to significant advancements in fields like medicine and energy.

          <p>The Irish women's rugby team has advanced to the World Cup quarter-finals for the first time since 2014 after a high-scoring 43-27 victory against Spain. Ireland established an early lead and secured a bonus point by halftime with four tries, with Anna McGann and Grace Moore each scoring twice during the match. Despite a spirited performance from Spain, who scored five tries of their own, Ireland's control in the second half ensured their progression in the tournament ahead of their final pool game against New Zealand.</p>

          <h2>A Liberal Hunter Argues for a More Nuanced View of the Practice</h2>

          <p>In a personal essay, a French-American liberal writer describes her journey to becoming a hunter in Montana, challenging the reflexive disdain for hunting often found on the political left. She argues that hunting is a more honest, sustainable, and ethical way to consume meat compared to factory farming, fostering a deep connection to nature and conservation. The author reflects on the complex emotions of taking an animal's life and the importance of stewardship, suggesting that hunters and vegetarians share more common ground in their concern for food ethics than is commonly acknowledged.</p>

          <p>Psychotherapist and author Amy Morin shares her personal story of rebuilding her life after her husband died suddenly when she was 26. Initially believing she would not remarry, she later reconnected with a high school acquaintance, Steve Hasty, who became her "biggest cheerleader" and encouraged her to pursue new dreams. Their relationship prompted her to leave her traditional therapy job, become a full-time author and speaker, and adopt an unconventional lifestyle living on a sailboat, illustrating how finding love again opened up a life she never imagined.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, "It Doesn't Have to Hurt," neurosurgeon Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores new frontiers in understanding and treating chronic pain. The article highlights the shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience to identify objective biomarkers of pain in the brain. This approach has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of pain, leading to groundbreaking treatments like deep brain stimulation that can predict and interrupt pain signals, offering new hope for millions of sufferers.</p>

          <p>Researchers have resolved a long-standing debate in evolutionary biology by identifying the comb jelly as the first animal to branch off the common ancestor of all animals. For years, scientists were uncertain whether comb jellies or sea sponges held this distinction. By using a new technique to analyze the arrangement of genes on chromosomes, the study found that the comb jelly's genome shows the least amount of rearrangement compared to the earliest non-animal relatives, indicating it was the first to diverge around 600 million years ago.</p>

In 1885, brothers David Kawānanakoa, Jonah Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole, and Edward Keliʻiahonui, who were studying at a nearby military school, fashioned surfboards from local redwood and demonstrated the royal sport. Their "surf diplomacy" made a lasting impression, planting the seeds for a culture that would eventually grow into a major American pastime and global phenomenon.</p>
