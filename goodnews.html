          <p>An 18th-century Italian painting, "Portrait of a Lady" by Giuseppe Ghislandi, has been recovered in Argentina 80 years after it was looted by the Nazis. The artwork was rediscovered when it appeared in an online real estate listing posted by the daughter of the fugitive Nazi officer accused of stealing it. Dutch journalists investigating the officer's past spotted the painting, leading to a police investigation and its eventual surrender to authorities. The recovery is a significant development for the heirs of the original owner, Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, who are seeking to reclaim over a thousand missing works.</p>

Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all traded higher. The upward trend was fueled by optimism in the tech sector after a favorable court decision in an Alphabet antitrust case suggested major tech firms could withstand regulatory pressures. However, underlying economic fears and pressure on global bond markets continue to weigh on overall investor sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling that the current situation does not constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had invoked the obscure wartime law to rapidly remove hundreds of individuals accused of being gang members. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" is equivalent to an armed force, thereby invalidating the legal basis for these specific deportations. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy.</p>

          <p>The city of Shaoxing in China has unveiled a new stimulus measure offering subsidies of up to 5,000 yuan ($700) for large banquets as part of an effort to boost local consumption. The policy is aimed at encouraging spending in the catering sector to support strained economic growth. This initiative highlights the challenge for local officials, who are tasked with stimulating the economy while also adhering to Beijing's broader anti-corruption campaign, which discourages extravagant practices. The new measures are expected to generate significant additional funding by encouraging consumers to spend more.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration acted illegally when it froze over $2.2 billion in federal research funding for Harvard University. The administration had justified the freeze by citing allegations of unaddressed antisemitism on campus, but the judge concluded this was used as a "smokescreen for a targeted, ideologically-motivated assault." The ruling stated the administration failed to follow the proper legal process before cutting off funds for over 900 vital research projects. While the White House plans to appeal, the decision is seen as a major victory for academic freedom.</p>

          <p>In Montana's Blackfoot Valley, a group of ranchers is challenging the conventional food system by creating the Old Salt Co-op. Facing threats from big agriculture and extreme weather, these ranchers are processing a portion of their livestock locally and selling directly to consumers through their own restaurants and butcher shop. The cooperative is committed to regenerative ranching, a practice that involves rotating cattle and allowing land to rest, which improves soil health. This model aims to create a more sustainable and economically viable system that supports local producers.</p>

          <p>A former police detective, drawing from professional experience and a recent personal head-on collision, outlines the crucial actions to take after being in a car crash. The first step is to stop the car, turn off the engine, and check for injuries. If possible, the vehicle should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on; otherwise, occupants should exit and stand well away from traffic. It is essential to call 999 if anyone is injured, if the other driver leaves the scene, or if the road is blocked.</p>

          <p>An agreement has been reached between the Democratic National Committee, voting rights groups, and the Department of Justice to prevent approximately 98,000 North Carolina voters from being removed from the rolls. The DOJ, under the Trump administration, had sued the state to purge voters who had not provided a driver's license or partial Social Security number when they registered. The negotiated settlement allows these voters to provide the required information via a provisional ballot at the polling place. This outcome is seen as a victory for voting rights advocates against a DOJ that has shifted its focus.</p>

          <p>C-SPAN, the nonprofit public affairs network, has secured distribution agreements with YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, significantly expanding its availability on major streaming services. The move comes after C-SPAN faced financial deficits due to the decline of traditional cable television subscriptions, which prompted a U.S. Senate resolution urging streaming providers to carry the network. These new deals will provide millions of subscribers with access to C-SPAN's unfiltered coverage of Congress. The agreements are seen as crucial for the network's future, ensuring it can continue its public service mission.</p>
