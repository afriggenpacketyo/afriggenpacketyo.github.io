          <p>A federal judge ruled President Trump's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) illegal, citing a gross usurpation of power.  The judge deemed the firing of USIP's board and staff unlawful and declared efforts to dismantle the agency null and void.  The USIP, primarily a think tank supporting peacebuilding, will resume its operations following this decision. The Trump administration is expected to appeal.</p>

          <p>The proposed elimination of federal income taxes on tips enjoys broad public support but faces criticism from economists and policy experts. While it would provide significant tax relief for many tipped workers, particularly in the lower 60% of income distribution, concerns exist about its impact on restaurant wages and potential market distortions.  Some argue that it's an inefficient way to provide tax relief to working-class households.</p>
