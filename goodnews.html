          <p>The J.M. Smucker Company is suing grocery chain Trader Joe's for alleged trademark infringement, claiming its new crustless peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are a copycat of the popular Uncrustables brand. The lawsuit accuses Trader Joe's of mimicking the product's distinct round, crimped design and packaging, which Smucker's argues could deceive consumers and cause irreparable harm to its brand. Smucker's is seeking to halt the sale of the Trader Joe's product and is demanding any profits gained from the alleged infringement.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, upholding the nearly $1.5 billion defamation judgment against him for falsely claiming the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued that the massive payout was a "financial death penalty" that violated his free speech rights. Lawyers for the Sandy Hook families stated that the court's decision was a proper rejection of his attempt to evade accountability, and they will proceed with enforcing the jury's verdict.</p>
