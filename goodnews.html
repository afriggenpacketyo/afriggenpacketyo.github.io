          <p>The offshore yuan has surged to a six-month high against the US dollar, breaking past the 7.2 level, driven by growing optimism that the US and China may soon negotiate a rollback of tariffs. Experts suggest that working-level engagements may already be underway, leading to expectations of reduced tariffs. Despite this positive shift, analysts caution that global investors are still hesitant to significantly increase their investments in Chinese assets, awaiting more concrete evidence of China's ability to withstand US challenges.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Astronomer's Star Catalogue Possibly the Oldest</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-05 03:32:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists suggest that the "Shi's Star Catalogue," an astronomical list of celestial bodies, could be the world's oldest star log, dating back approximately 2,400 years. Researchers used image processing technology to convert ancient records into measurable celestial coordinates, confirming observations around 335 BC. If verified, this would predate the Hipparchus star catalogue from Greece, previously recognized as the oldest. Experts believe that astronomers from both China and Greece began studying the night sky in detail around the same time.</p>

          <p>The Australian film industry is expressing concern over Donald Trump's proposal to impose 100% tariffs on film productions made outside the US, with the federal government pledging to defend the local screen industry. Australia, often called ‚ÄúHollywood Down Under,‚Äù attracts foreign productions through a 30% rebate scheme. The potential tariffs could make these incentives less attractive for US-targeted productions. The arts minister has stated that the government will unequivocally stand up for the rights of the Australian screen industry.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis conducted by Chinese and Dutch researchers suggests that the first roses were likely yellow, rather than red. The study examined domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that their common ancestor likely had single-petal flowers with yellow coloring. Roses, known as the 'queen of flowers,' are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers worldwide and are regarded as a symbol of love and beauty.</p>
