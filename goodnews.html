        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents a critical view on the integration of artificial intelligence in universities, arguing that its widespread use for cheating degrades the educational experience and subverts institutional goals. The author contends that current university policies are inadequate and proposes radical solutions to preserve academic integrity, especially for liberal-arts colleges. These measures include eliminating Wi-Fi in favor of Ethernet, banning laptops and smartphones on campus, and requiring in-person, proctored exams. The author suggests such a "de-teching" would create a more focused and intellectually vibrant campus culture.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles III, at Buckingham Palace during a rare visit to the United Kingdom, marking their first private meeting since February 2024. The meeting comes amid ongoing treatment for the King's cancer and a period of strained relations within the royal family since Harry and Meghan's move to California. While details of the private tea meeting were not disclosed, Harry later commented that his father was "doing great." The visit did not include a meeting with his brother, Prince William, with whom relations reportedly remain non-existent.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has struck down a law that prevented husbands from taking their wives' surnames, declaring it a form of gender-based discrimination. The landmark ruling was a victory for two couples who had challenged the law as archaic and patriarchal, arguing it violated the equality rights in the country's post-apartheid constitution. Parliament will now be required to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act to reflect the judgment. The case was supported by legal bodies who argued the old law perpetuated harmful stereotypes by denying men a choice available to women.</p>

          <p>China's top economic planning agency, the NDRC, has announced a major infrastructure project to expand the shipping capacity at the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River. The plan involves building a new double-line, five-stage lock system to ease traffic congestion at the crucial hub of the Yangtze Economic Belt. With an estimated investment of 76.6 billion yuan (US$10.7 billion), the project is described as the largest integrated initiative on the river since the original dam's construction. The construction is expected to take over eight years, spanning the country's next five-year plan.</p>

          <p>This article presents a photographic look back at the world-changing polio vaccination campaign in the United States during the 1950s. At its peak in 1952, polio outbreaks caused tens of thousands of cases of paralysis and thousands of deaths annually. The introduction of the vaccine, which became widely available in 1955, marked a monumental public health achievement. Within a decade, the campaign successfully reduced the number of new polio cases in the U.S. to fewer than 100 per year, demonstrating the profound impact of mass vaccination.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, addressing the country's ambassadors, outlined a significant shift in German foreign policy, emphasizing that it is more crucial than ever in a new and uncertain geopolitical landscape. He described a systemic conflict between liberal democracies and an "axis of autocracies," arguing that Germany can no longer afford an isolationist attitude. Merz's vision is for a more present and assertive Germany on the world stage, with a foreign policy that is explicitly interest-based, particularly in securing economic benefits for the nation. This new focus has reportedly been well-received by his coalition partners.</p>

          <p>In a landmark European ruling, a Spanish court has sided with residents of the Galicia region who sued regional authorities over unchecked pollution from industrial pig farming. The claimants argued that excessive nitrate runoff from pig waste has contaminated drinking water, destroyed the local ecosystem, and violated their human rights. The court ordered authorities to compensate the residents, clean up the polluted Lima River, and prevent further contamination. This case, the first of its kind in Europe, could set a legal precedent for other communities fighting industrial agricultural pollution.</p>

          <h2>Ten Years After First Gravitational Wave Detection, Stephen Hawking's Black Hole Theory is Confirmed</h2>

          <p>A decade after the first detection of gravitational waves, scientists have used the improved sensitivity of LIGO detectors to confirm a key theory proposed by Stephen Hawking in 1971. By analyzing the waves from a collision of two black holes, researchers verified Hawking's area theorem, which states that the surface area of a black hole can never decrease. The analysis showed the final merged black hole had a larger surface area than the sum of the two initial black holes. This observational proof marks a significant milestone in physics, validating a foundational concept of black hole mechanics.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Aims to Protect College Students from Punishment for Seeking Overdose Help</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit public colleges and universities from disciplining students who seek emergency medical help during an overdose. The legislation, AB 602, aims to remove the fear of academic probation or expulsion, which can deter students from calling 911 in a crisis. The bill was inspired by students like TJ McGee of UC Berkeley, who faced disciplinary action after his friends called for help during his overdose. If signed by the governor, the law will require schools to offer rehabilitation options instead of punishment, extending "Good Samaritan" protections to campus environments.</p>
