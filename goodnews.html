          <p>A federal judge has ruled that President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm Jenner & Block is unconstitutional, permanently blocking its enforcement. The judge found that the order infringed on the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, resembling a "screed" motivated by animosity towards the firm due to its legal challenges against Trump's policies. The order had instructed officials to review and revoke security clearances of firm members, terminate government contracts, and halt future federal job hires from the firm. This ruling marks the second setback for the administration in its attempts to punish law firms involved in litigation against it.</p>
