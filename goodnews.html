        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a broader slowdown in luxury spending, the world's wealthiest shoppers continue to purchase high-end jewelry, particularly from sought-after brands like Van Cleef & Arpels, Buccellati, and Cartier, all owned by Swiss luxury group Richemont. According to Luca Solca, sector head for global luxury goods at Bernstein, Richemont's jewelry brands are highly desirable, outperforming competitors like LVMH. This trend contributed to Richemont's better-than-expected fiscal fourth-quarter sales, with its Jewellery Maisons division experiencing 11% growth, and jewelry being the group's strongest segment overall with 8% growth for the full year. This indicates a sustained demand for top-tier luxury jewelry despite economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept across northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, causing near-zero visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings about dangerous road conditions. The storm, unusual for the region, dropped visibility to a quarter-mile at Chicago Midway International Airport, marking the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville issued a dust storm warning for Chicago. Meteorologist Zachary Yack noted the rapid decline in visibility, attributing the storm to exceptionally dry soil conditions in central Illinois. Such storms are more common in the desert Southwest and southern Great Plains, with Chicago last experiencing a similar event during the Dust Bowl era in 1934, according to the article.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, who had been living in eastern Congo since the 1994 genocide, were repatriated on Saturday, according to the U.N. refugee agency. The repatriation, involving mostly women and children, was facilitated after Rwandan-backed rebels seized key parts of the region, and is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR. Returnees expressed happiness at returning to their ancestral land, with authorities emphasizing their value to the country's development. The refugees were among the hundreds of thousands of Hutus who fled Rwanda after the genocide, with many having stayed and joined Congo's army, leading to decades of conflict in the mineral-rich eastern Congo.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a stable fiber-optic gyroscope for enhanced navigation in aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. The gyroscope can sense orientation and turning rates without relying on external signals like satellites, making it immune to interference. Interferometric fiber-optic gyroscopes (IFOGs) are used in both military and civilian applications, from aerospace to autonomous vehicles, due to their simple structure and high resolution. The development offers a more stable way to measure navigation.</p>
