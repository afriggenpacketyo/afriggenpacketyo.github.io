          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington to discuss pressing issues such as the conflict in Ukraine and trade tariffs. Merz's spokesman conveyed the chancellor's anticipation for the meeting, emphasizing Germany's economic significance and its desire for a constructive relationship with the U.S. Both leaders share a passion for golf and possess business backgrounds, which may contribute to a positive atmosphere despite the weighty agenda. Another potential point of contention is the support within Trump's circle for the far-right German party Alternative for Germany (AfD).</p>

          <p>President Trump's new travel ban includes exceptions for World Cup players, dual citizens, and individuals with existing visas. This ensures that athletes participating in major sporting events, such as the 2026 World Cup and the 2028 Olympics, will be able to enter the U.S. despite the ban. The exemptions also extend to those holding "immigrant visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran" and Afghan nationals holding Special Immigrant Visas. The Secretary of State may grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis if it serves a U.S. national interest.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should play a leading role in Pakistan's energy transition by promoting decentralized solar power, creating a model for other countries in the Global South. However, a Chinese energy scholar questions whether this vision is too expensive. The report suggests that China must choose between its coal-fired plants financed in Pakistan and the solar panels it sells, as both cannot succeed in the same market. Indigenous manufacturing is vital due to rising global trade tensions and China's export restrictions on critical minerals.</p>

The agency aims to promote a new style of travel that involves more engagement with local communities to encourage repeat visits. The report also highlights initiatives to remove barriers to travel, including reluctance to take time off work.</p>
