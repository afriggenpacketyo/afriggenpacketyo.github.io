          <h2>Study Indicates Acupuncture as an Effective Alternative for Chronic Back Pain</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 14:15:34 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent NIH-funded study suggests that manual acupuncture can be an effective treatment for chronic low back pain in adults, offering an alternative to opioids. The "BackInAction" trial, involving 800 older adults, found that participants receiving acupuncture reported greater reductions in pain-related disability and intensity compared to those receiving only usual medical care. This traditional Chinese medicine technique, which involves inserting fine needles into the skin, has more than doubled in use among American adults over the past two decades, with many seeking it for pain relief and its favorable safety profile. The findings suggest it works as well as more familiar treatments for pain management.</p>

          <p>Formula 1 drivers are split on the use of a new driver-cooling system ahead of the Singapore Grand Prix, which has been declared a "heat hazard" due to extreme temperature and humidity. Red Bull's Max Verstappen criticized the system, stating he will not use the cooling vest and opposes plans to make it mandatory, citing discomfort and flawed design. In contrast, Mercedes' George Russell plans to use the vest, noting his team has made improvements to mitigate cockpit heat. The debate highlights the physical demands of racing in such conditions and the challenge of implementing effective safety measures without compromising driver preference or performance.</p>

          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA) has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, a significant milestone for the predominantly white denomination. Curry, 53, succeeds the Rev. Elizabeth Eaton and will serve a six-year term leading the nation's largest Lutheran body. His election is seen as a hopeful step toward greater inclusivity in a church that is over 95% white but has been investing in multicultural ministries. As leader, Curry will navigate challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations, including declining membership and ongoing theological debates.</p>

While denying some specific comments attributed to her, she announced a new "state of the game" committee to review officiating and confirmed meetings are scheduled to discuss a new collective bargaining agreement.

          <p>Costco is partnering with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to sell popular GLP-1 weight-loss medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members for approximately half the typical price. Through its prescription program, members can purchase a four-week supply for $499, an offer available to those paying out-of-pocket as many insurers do not cover these drugs. The initiative aims to provide access to authentic versions of the medications amid soaring prices and the rise of cheaper, unregulated compounded alternatives. This move could significantly increase access and demand for semaglutide-based drugs, which have grown rapidly in popularity.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work, the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III has been opened to the public in Luxor, Egypt. The site, which is over 3,000 years old and one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings, had suffered from severe deterioration before the Japanese-led project began. The restoration involved more than 260 specialists and was praised for meeting the highest international conservation standards. The tomb features a long, sloping passageway and multiple chambers decorated with exquisite wall paintings, offering visitors a glimpse into the art and architecture of the Eighteenth Dynasty.</p>

          <p>Hamas has issued a statement agreeing to several key parts of the Gaza peace proposal outlined by former U.S. President Donald Trump, including the release of all hostages. While the response is viewed as positive by U.S. officials, Hamas indicated that other aspects of the deal, such as the decommissioning of weapons, require further negotiation. Following the announcement, Trump urged Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe release of hostages, and the Israeli Prime Minister's office stated it was preparing to implement the first phase of the plan. This development marks a potentially significant step towards ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have added veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw to their roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. This marks Kershaw's return to postseason action after being left off the wild-card series roster for the first time in his healthy career since 2008. The future Hall of Famer is expected to pitch out of the bullpen, providing a steady veteran presence and left-handed depth against the Phillies' lineup. His inclusion is a significant move for the team as he approaches his anticipated retirement at the end of the season.</p>

          <p>U.S. stock markets demonstrated resilience, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reaching new record highs this week despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. The rally was largely driven by strong performances in the healthcare and technology sectors, with life sciences and pharmaceutical stocks surging after a tariff exemption deal. The artificial intelligence trade also continued to boost tech stocks and utilities, which benefit from the increased power demands of data centers. The market's positive performance suggests investors have largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event for the economy's immediate future. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets trading near record highs, some financial experts are advising investors to look abroad for better value and to counteract a strong "home bias." Dave Nadig of ETF.com noted that the average U.S. investor is overly concentrated in domestic markets and could benefit from broader international exposure, including in emerging markets like China. Similarly, Kevin Carter of EMQQ Global highlighted the long-term growth potential in countries like India, which boasts the world's largest population and fastest-growing economy, mirroring the consumption-driven boom previously seen in China.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the prosecution of Kilmar Ábrego García on human-smuggling charges may constitute illegal retaliation by the Department of Justice. The judge granted a hearing to determine if the charges are vindictive, filed only after Ábrego successfully sued the Trump administration for his wrongful deportation to El Salvador. The ruling cited "remarkable statements" by the deputy attorney general that seemed to link the prosecution to Ábrego's legal victory. The case has become a focal point in the partisan conflict over the Trump administration's aggressive immigration and deportation policies.</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching an agreement with Pakistani authorities. The demonstrations, which left at least 10 people dead, were organized to demand lower prices for wheat and electricity and an end to lavish benefits for the political elite. Under the new deal, the regional government has agreed to the protesters' demands and pledged to improve public services. The alliance leader urged the crowds to disperse, expressing gratitude for the government's willingness to resolve the issues that had fueled the widespread unrest.</p>
