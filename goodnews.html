          <h2>Southwest Airlines Flight Executes Rapid Descent to Avoid Mid-Air Collision Over California</h2>

          <p>A Southwest Airlines flight bound for Las Vegas executed a rapid dive of nearly 500 feet to avoid a potential mid-air collision with another aircraft shortly after takeoff from Burbank, California. The pilots responded to an onboard traffic alert system, successfully preventing a disaster. Comedian Jimmy Dore, who was on the flight, described how passengers flew out of their seats during the aggressive maneuver. One flight attendant was treated for minor injuries, but the plane continued to its destination and landed safely. The Federal Aviation Administration is currently investigating the incident.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic ties, as the island nation has recently shown a pro-China alignment. During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line and inaugurated several India-funded projects, including a new defense ministry headquarters. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who previously ran on an anti-India platform, has since softened his rhetoric, calling India the nation's 'closest and most trusted partner.' The move is seen as a strategic effort by India to maintain influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the 2002 hit film 'Bend It Like Beckham' is in the works. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha stated that the success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film make it a good time to revisit the characters. The original movie, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, is credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha is unsure if the sequel will be a film or a TV series but hopes to reunite the original cast and include cameos from current England players.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a 'very temporary' spokesperson for the tech company Astronomer in a public relations move following a recent scandal. The company's CEO and an HR executive resigned after they were caught in an intimate embrace on a KissCam at a Coldplay concert, a band fronted by Paltrow's ex-husband, Chris Martin. In a short video, Paltrow humorously addressed the company's newfound attention, steering the conversation back to its data workflow automation services. The move is an attempt to reframe the narrative after the viral video led to a formal investigation and the executives' departure.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump announced that both Cambodia and Thailand are seeking an immediate ceasefire after three days of deadly border fighting. Trump said he had spoken with the leaders of both nations and that he would not proceed with trade deals if the conflict continues. The fighting, which has killed at least 33 people and displaced over 130,000, is the worst between the neighbors in over a decade. The conflict stems from long-standing border disputes, particularly over the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple, which the International Court of Justice has ruled belongs to Cambodia.</p>

          <p>Taiwanese voters have rejected a large-scale effort to recall two dozen lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the legislative balance of power after losing its majority in the last election. The recall campaigns were launched by critics who accused the China-friendly KMT of obstructing key legislation and passing reforms that favor Beijing. The KMT framed the result as a victory for political stability, while the DPP stated it humbly accepted the outcome.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both closed at record highs this week, driven by positive news on trade deals and a strong start to the second-quarter earnings season. The market was boosted by President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement with Japan and ongoing talks with other nations. So far, a third of S&P 500 companies have reported earnings, with 80% beating expectations. Strong reports from companies like GE Vernova and Danaher contributed to the positive sentiment, though some stocks like Honeywell fell despite good results. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over daily coffee consumption is complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends heavily on the individual. While studies link one to three cups per day to health benefits, high consumption can have negative effects, and the FDA recommends a general limit of 400 milligrams of caffeine. Dietitians stress that caffeine tolerance varies, and people should listen to their bodies, stopping if they feel anxious, jittery, or if their sleep is affected. For most healthy adults, two to three cups before noon is considered a safe range, but it is important to be mindful of personal reactions.</p>
