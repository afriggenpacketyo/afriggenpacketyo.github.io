          <p>A recent Quinnipiac University poll indicates a 16-point drop in Elon Musk's favorability among Republicans since March, falling to 62% despite his contributions to President Donald Trump's re-election. The decline follows a public falling out between Musk and Trump over the president's spending bill, which escalated into a social media war of words. Despite the decrease, Musk remains popular among Republicans for his role in running the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), with 80% rating his work as either excellent or good. The poll highlights the deep division between Republican and Democratic voters regarding Musk, with only 3% of Democrats surveyed holding a favorable view of the Tesla CEO. The article underscores Musk's controversial tenure in the Trump administration and his fluctuating public image.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the United States may extend a 90-day pause on implementing steep tariffs on goods from major trading partners if negotiations continue "in good faith." Bessent's remarks, made during a congressional hearing, marked the first public hint from a high-ranking official about potentially pushing the deadline beyond early July. Japan is one of the key partners actively negotiating with the Trump administration, with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba scheduled to meet with Trump at the upcoming G7 summit. The administration's priority remains clinching trade deals with Japan, South Korea, India, and the European Union, though it's uncertain if these remarks will alter the pace of ongoing talks.

          <p>The government's Spending Review is being presented as a turning point, emphasizing long-term capital spending to transform the public realm and boost economic potential. This strategy reflects a willingness to prioritize patience in an era often characterized by impatience, with limited day-to-day spending and cuts in certain areas. The government hopes that these long-term investments will ultimately lead to national renewal, although immediate impacts may not be apparent. However, many people in England and Wales will likely face higher council taxes to support the police, a detail not explicitly highlighted by the chancellor, Rachel Reeves.

          <p>The United States has initiated a review of the multi-billion dollar Aukus submarine deal with the UK and Australia to ensure it aligns with President Trump's "America First" agenda. This review comes as Australia faces pressure from the White House to increase its military spending from 2% to 3.5% of GDP. Both Australia and the UK have downplayed the significance of the US probe, characterizing it as a routine reassessment by a new administration. The Aukus pact, signed in 2021, aims to provide Australia with its first nuclear-powered submarines from the US, followed by the creation of a new fleet through shared technology. The review raises questions about the future of the trilateral alliance and its strategic goals in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Teoscar Hern√°ndez's three-run home run in the sixth inning propelled the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory over the Padres, securing a crucial series win and a two-game lead in the National League West. Hern√°ndez had been struggling at the plate since returning from injury, but his decisive swing broke open the tie game. Ben Casparius delivered a strong four-inning start, and Andy Pages made a key defensive play, throwing out a runner at home plate. The article highlights the Dodgers' resilience and their ability to overcome challenges in a pivotal series against a division rival. The win sets the stage for a four-game series at Dodger Stadium next week.</p>
