          <h2>British TV Faces Existential Threat From US Streaming Giants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Traditional British television is facing a significant challenge from US streaming giants like Netflix, Disney Plus, and Amazon, leading to discussions about the future survival of British-originated and British-focused TV. With viewing habits shifting and funding becoming increasingly strained, industry insiders are considering options such as mergers or greater cooperation among BBC, ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5. A key concern is the potential dominance of US-based media companies with vastly different business models and the shift towards digital-only video on demand by 2035. Some propose a unified streaming service under BBC iPlayer to compete effectively, while others argue for maintaining distinctiveness among British broadcasters.</p>

          <p>Kansas City, Missouri, is implementing a new approach to address its growing homeless crisis, aiming for "functional zero," which means ensuring anyone who becomes homeless is back on their feet within 30 days. The initiative, led by homelessness prevention coordinator Josh Henges, focuses on coordinating resources from churches, aid organizations, and shelters to provide comprehensive support. The plan includes building trust with the homeless population, providing safe shelter, and addressing core issues like addiction and mental health. The goal is to create a coordinated system that effectively delivers people out of homelessness, rather than simply providing temporary solutions.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the United States would lift sanctions on Syria, providing an economic boost to the war-torn country and signaling a shift in American foreign policy in the Middle East. The decision was revealed during a business forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, where Trump is on a state visit, and comes ahead of a planned meeting with Syria‚Äôs new president, Ahmed al-Shara. The move is intended to support Syria's new government in stabilizing the country and fostering peace, with Trump noting the region's readiness to help Syria recover. The decision has been praised by Syrian officials and citizens, who hope it will lead to reconstruction and reintegration into the global economy.</p>

          <p>GOP lawmakers are targeting online pornography with a proposed interstate ban on obscene content, aiming to clarify the definition of obscenity and make it easier to prosecute offenders. Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Mary Miller introduced the Interstate Obscenity Definition Act (IODA), which seeks to update the legal definition of obscenity for the internet age, replacing subjective standards with practical ones. The bill defines obscenity as material that appeals to prurient interests in nudity, sex, or excretion, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value, and removes the intent requirement, which only prohibits transmission of obscene material for the purpose of abusing, threatening or harassing an individual.</p>

          <p>President Trump arrived in Saudi Arabia for his first international trip of his second term, where he will meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to discuss dismantling Iran's nuclear program, ending the war in Gaza, and maintaining stable oil prices. This visit mirrors his first term, where Saudi Arabia was also his initial foreign destination. The trip is expected to focus on strengthening economic ties, with Trump attending a U.S.-Saudi investment summit and seeking increased Saudi investment in American companies.

          <p>Pete Rose and "Shoeless" Joe Jackson, along with 15 other players, have been reinstated by Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred, making them eligible for the sport's Hall of Fame. This decision reverses the league's policy on permanent ineligibility, which will now expire upon death. Rose was banned for betting on baseball, while Jackson was implicated in the 1919 Black Sox scandal. The Hall of Fame will now consider their candidacies, although both players face scrutiny regarding their integrity and character due to their past controversies.

The documentary surfaces footage from performances in which Selena subverts the idea of the well-manicured image that the Quintanilla family has constantly put out of the singer in the 30 years since her death. It also captures, in real time, the evolution of a bold new identity growing among Latino youth in the 1980s, encapsulated in Los Dinos‚Äô cultural hybridity.</p>
