          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that offers a potential cure for the ultra-rare and life-threatening condition, Activated PI3-kinase Delta Syndrome (APDS). The genetic disorder, which severely weakens the immune system, claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives. Her family played a crucial role in the research that identified the faulty gene just 12 years ago, leading to this breakthrough treatment. The drug, taken as a daily tablet, works by allowing the immune system to function normally, giving the young woman hope for a long and healthy life.</p>

          <p>Manchester City secured a dominant 5-2 victory over Juventus in the Club World Cup, signaling a powerful return to form after finishing the previous season without a major trophy. Manager Pep Guardiola expressed his satisfaction, stating it had been a long time since the team performed so well both on and off the ball. The performance, characterized by 76% possession and 24 shots, served as a strong statement to other teams in the tournament. The return of key midfielder Rodri from a long-term injury further bolstered the team's impressive display, suggesting they are serious contenders for the title.</p>

          <p>McCormick CEO Brendan Foley stated that the spice company is actively focused on mitigating the impact of new tariffs, particularly on its agricultural supply chain. While 90% of McCormick's products sold in the U.S. are manufactured domestically, the majority of its core ingredients, like black pepper, are sourced from various countries abroad. Foley expressed confidence in the company's ability to manage the financial effects of these trade policies throughout the year. The company's recent earnings report exceeded estimates, with shares rising over 5% as consumers continue to prioritize flavor and home cooking despite economic pressures.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer argued that the stock market is experiencing a broad-based rally, countering claims that its success is too narrow. He pointed to a diverse group of top-performing S&P 500 stocks from various sectors to demonstrate his point, including solar company Enphase Energy, crypto platform Coinbase, and utility NRG Energy. The analysis suggests that the market's strength is not confined to a handful of tech giants but is spread across industries like minerals, biotech, and energy. This diversity is presented as a bullish sign for the market's overall health and sustainability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An 18-year-old lifeguard in Asbury Park, New Jersey, is recovering after being impaled through the armpit by a 6-foot beach umbrella pole in a bizarre accident. The lifeguard, identified only as Alex, was attempting to secure the umbrella to her stand when a gust of wind pulled her off, causing her to land on the pole. Remarkably, she remained calm throughout the ordeal as paramedics used a bandsaw to cut the pole for transport. The pole narrowly missed major arteries and nerves, and she is expected to make a full recovery and plans to return to her job after six weeks.</p>

The movie, an English-language remake of a South Korean sci-fi comedy, stars Emma Stone as a powerful CEO who is kidnapped by two conspiracy theorists, played by Jesse Plemons and Aidan Delbis, who believe she is an alien plotting to destroy Earth. This marks the third consecutive year of collaboration between Stone and Lanthimos, following their work on "Poor Things" and "Kinds of Kindness."

          <p>For the first time since its launch, NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured direct images of what is believed to be a previously undiscovered exoplanet. The celestial body, dubbed TWA 7b, is thought to have a mass similar to Saturn and orbits a young, nearby star. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph, which suppresses the star's bright glare to reveal fainter nearby objects. While there is a small possibility the object could be a background galaxy, researchers state that the evidence strongly suggests it is a planet, marking a significant achievement for the telescope.</p>

He sharply contrasted his experience with that of his chief rival, Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani, whom he described as an inexperienced opponent from a privileged background making "empty promises." Adams, who is now running as an independent, framed the election as a choice between his practical progress and what he termed the unrealistic ideals of socialism.</p>

Investor anxiety over tariffs has eased, while strong performance from technology giants like Nvidia has provided a major boost. Furthermore, growing optimism that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts later this year has buoyed investor confidence, pushing major indices toward their previous peaks despite ongoing geopolitical and economic risks.

Teran was charged with improperly downloading confidential police records while at the Sheriff's Department and using them at the D.A.'s office. The court ruled unanimously that her actions were not criminal, as the documents she accessed were public court records that any member of the public could have reviewed. The decision is a significant rebuke of the prosecution brought by the state Attorney General's office, which critics had long argued was politically motivated.</p>
