          <p>England's Lionesses received widespread praise after securing a dramatic Euro 2025 victory against Spain. King Charles celebrated the team for making the "football's coming home" chant a reality through their skill and teamwork. Prince William and Princess Charlotte, who attended the final in Switzerland, expressed their immense pride in the team's historic achievement. The win marks the first time an England team has won a major trophy away from home, and Prime Minister Keir Starmer lauded the players as "history makers."</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade agreement, narrowly avoiding a potential tariff escalation. The deal establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods imported into the U.S., a rate lower than the 30% previously threatened by President Trump. As part of the accord, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments. While some products like aircraft and pharmaceuticals are exempt, the agreement aims to bring stability to the transatlantic trading relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite an early 5-0 deficit, Littler mounted a powerful comeback, showcasing high-quality play with 17 maximums of 180. The win cements his status as a dominant new force in the sport.</p>

          <p>While the absence of a major presentation from Marvel Studios at San Diego Comic-Con was noted, many attendees found the event enjoyable and less crowded. The lack of a blockbuster Marvel panel in the famed Hall H allowed fans easier access to other presentations, such as those for "Alien: Earth" and "The Long Walk." Many attendees emphasized that the convention's appeal extends beyond major movie announcements, focusing instead on exclusive merchandise, artist alleys, and cosplay. The event still featured major draws, including a "Demon Slayer" panel and an appearance by DC Studios' James Gunn.</p>
