          <p>OpenAI is set to acquire io, the AI devices startup founded by former iPhone designer Jony Ive, for $6.4 billion in an all-equity deal. Ive will assume significant creative and design responsibilities across OpenAI and io, with his "creative collective" LoveFrom remaining independent. This acquisition follows OpenAI's recent valuation at $300 billion and its $3 billion purchase of Windsurf, an AI coding tool, as the company intensifies efforts to maintain its lead in the competitive generative AI landscape. This move underscores OpenAI's commitment to hardware operations amidst competition from Google, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI.</p>

Investors anticipate further catalysts, such as regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments, to push Bitcoin prices higher.

          <p>The Senate passed a bipartisan bill that would eliminate federal taxes on tips, a move supported by both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The bill allows workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, provided they are reported. However, some analysts argue that the policy could lead to income misclassification and the introduction of tipping in new occupations. The article notes that the tax break would primarily benefit moderate to middle-income workers, as lower-income tipped workers often do not pay federal income tax due to their earnings falling under the standard deduction.

          <p>Keir Starmer has announced a U-turn on planned cuts to winter fuel payments, following political pressure. The Labour Party will ease cuts to the winter fuel payments, after more than 10 million pensioners lost out on the payments, worth up to ¬£300, when the pension top-up became means-tested last year. Tory leader Kemi Badenoch welcomed the "inevitable" U-turn, but called on the government to set out "early" details of their new approach, adding that autumn's Budget would be too late to deliver changes this winter.</p>
