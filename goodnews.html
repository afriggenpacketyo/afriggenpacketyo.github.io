          <p>Sheila Jordan, a highly respected and unique voice in jazz, has passed away at the age of 96. Known for her innovative style, she recorded the iconic album "Portrait of Sheila" in the 1960s and was honored as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master in 2012. Despite facing challenges including racial prejudice and single motherhood, her dedication to the music of Charlie Parker shaped her life and career. Jordan's career flourished later in life, and she became a distinguished educator, continuing to record and perform well into her nineties, leaving behind a legacy of artistic integrity and resilience.</p>

          <p>The three-year-old case of missing cyclist Tony Parsons was solved thanks to the quick thinking of a woman who secretly marked his burial site with a Red Bull can. The woman's boyfriend, Alexander McKellar, confessed to her that he and his twin brother had fatally struck Parsons in a hit-and-run and buried his body. After McKellar showed her the remote grave, she dropped the can as a marker and later alerted police. Parsons' family expressed immense gratitude, stating his body likely would never have been found otherwise. The McKellar brothers were subsequently brought to justice for the crime.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's Archewell Productions has signed a new multi-year, first-look deal with Netflix, continuing their relationship with the streaming giant. However, this new arrangement is reportedly less exclusive than their original 2020 overall deal, which gave Netflix exclusive rights to all their developed projects. The couple has produced several documentary series, including the popular "Harry & Meghan" and a cooking show. Their upcoming slate includes a second season of Meghan's culinary show and a film adaptation of a romance novel, signaling a continued focus on producing content for the platform.</p>

The project, planned by New York-based Mack Real Estate Development, is set to include 536 rental apartments and ground-floor retail space. However, the developer has not commented on a construction start date, and experts note significant challenges for new construction, including high interest rates and rising material costs. Despite these hurdles, the South Park area is considered a vibrant hub with high demand for housing, and officials hope the project can move forward as market conditions improve.

          <p>Sinclair, one of the largest TV station owners in the U.S., has announced it is conducting a strategic review of its broadcast business that could lead to a merger. The company is also considering spinning off its ventures unit, which includes the Tennis Channel. This move comes as the media industry anticipates potential deregulation under the Trump administration, which could pave the way for more consolidation in the broadcast sector. Sinclair, which owns 178 TV stations, has faced financial headwinds as consumers cut traditional pay-TV subscriptions, impacting its revenue from retransmission fees. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>22-year-old fast bowler Sonny Baker delivered a standout performance to help the Manchester Originals secure a 10-run victory over the London Spirit. Baker's exceptional opening spell, where he conceded only four runs from his first 10 deliveries, was crucial in restricting the Spirit's chase. His bowling troubled international veterans David Warner and Kane Williamson, earning him player of the match honors and high praise from his captain and cricket legend James Anderson. The performance highlighted why the highly-rated Baker, who has an England development contract, is considered a major rising talent in English cricket.</p>

          <p>Comments made by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth during a press conference about the federal takeover of Washington D.C. have been entered as evidence in a separate legal case. California is suing the Trump administration, alleging the unlawful use of military for civilian law enforcement during a deployment in Los Angeles. Hegseth's statement that troops in D.C. would "stand with their law enforcement partners" and that "we did the same thing" in Los Angeles was immediately seized upon by California's attorneys. A judge admitted the remarks into evidence, potentially harming the administration's defense in the ongoing trial over its use of military forces within the U.S.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that gold will not be subject to tariffs, directly countermanding a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling. The customs agency had determined that certain gold bars imported from Switzerland would face a 39% duty, a decision that caused the precious metal to hit a record high. Following Trump's announcement on social media that "Gold will not be Tariffed!", gold futures fell sharply. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had warned that the tariffs would have negatively impacted the international flow of physical gold used to back futures contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After pausing its initial public offering plans in April due to market volatility from new tariffs, ticketing company StubHub is reportedly moving forward with a September IPO. The company, which filed an updated prospectus, aims to begin its roadshow after Labor Day. The filing revealed 10% revenue growth in the first quarter but also a widening net loss. The move comes as the IPO market shows signs of life after a prolonged quiet period, with several other tech and crypto firms recently going public. StubHub faces significant competition in the online ticketing space from rivals like Ticketmaster and Vivid Seats. (not investment advice)</p>
