          <p>The U.S. Department of Education is releasing over $6 billion in grant funding that had been withheld from schools for programs such as adult literacy and English language instruction. The Trump administration had frozen the funds for review, prompting lawsuits and bipartisan pressure from Congress to release the money, which had already been appropriated. School districts and nonprofit organizations had warned of scaling back or closing programs without these funds. A senior administration official confirmed the release, stating that guardrails are in place to ensure the money aligns with administration policy.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The National Football League is penalizing more than 100 players and around two dozen club employees for violating its ticket resale policy. An internal investigation found that these individuals sold their allocated Super Bowl LIX tickets to resellers for a profit, which is against league rules. According to an internal memo, players will be fined 1.5 times the face value of the tickets, while employees will be fined twice the face value and lose future ticket privileges. The league emphasized that no one should personally profit from their NFL affiliation at the expense of fans.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 15:33:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>During a recent "El Tráfico" match, traditionally one of Major League Soccer's most intense rivalries, fans of Los Angeles FC displayed a banner in a show of solidarity with rival LA Galaxy supporters. The gesture was a response to recent federal immigration raids in Southern California, which have instilled fear in many communities. While LAFC officially condemned the raids, the Galaxy organization has remained silent, leading to boycotts from some of its own fans. The LAFC supporters' banner, reading "Los Ángeles Unidos Jamás Será Vencido," momentarily bridged the fierce rivalry to support a community they both share.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece argues that the widespread public amusement over the viral Coldplay kiss-cam video, which exposed an apparent affair, is a healthy societal response. The author pushes back against criticism that the online reaction was a form of cruel public shaming. Instead, the article posits that such laughter reinforces a collective respect for the institution of marriage and spousal loyalty, drawing a parallel to George Orwell's analysis of crude humor. The author contends that the humor stems from a relatable recognition of human fallibility, not from a sense of moral superiority over the shamed individuals.</p>

          <p>The House Ethics Committee has ordered Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to pay thousands of dollars after finding she breached the House "Gift Rule" in relation to her 2021 Met Gala appearance. The violation stems from her failure to pay the full market value for borrowed items, including accessories for her "Tax the Rich" dress, and for accepting free admission for her fiancé. While the committee did not find the underpayments to be intentional, it concluded her staff was "overly reliant" on vendors. AOC must now personally pay over $2,700 to the designer and donate the $250 value of her fiancé's meal.</p>

          <p>The Italian film "Diciannove," produced by Luca Guadagnino, is reviewed as a breathless and exuberant look at a young man's formative 19th year. The story follows Leonardo, an arrogant literature student in Siena, as he navigates intellectual pretension, loneliness, and the chaotic temptations of youth. The review praises the film's energetic and stylish filmmaking, which mirrors the protagonist's internal tornado of emotions, though it can occasionally feel tiring. First-time actor Manfredi Marini is highlighted for his compelling performance as the lost antihero in this messy, funny, and ultimately poignant exploration of being on the cusp of adulthood.</p>

          <p>As President Donald Trump arrived in Scotland for a five-day trip, the Scottish newspaper The National published a provocative front page that has since gone viral. The cover features a picture of Trump with the headline "Welcome to Scotland... just don't get any ideas about staying," reflecting local sentiment and planned protests against his visit. The article highlights strong social media reactions praising the cover for its bluntness and contrasting it with what some perceive as more deferential U.S. media coverage.

          <p>England's Joe Root scored a masterful 150 against India, an innings that moved him past Australian great Ricky Ponting to become the second-highest run-scorer in Test cricket history. His 38th Test century anchored England's dominant performance on day three of the fourth Test at Old Trafford, helping the team build a substantial lead of 186. Root's chanceless innings saw him share significant partnerships with Ollie Pope and Ben Stokes, grinding down the Indian bowling attack. England is now in a commanding position to win the match and secure an unassailable 3-1 series lead.</p>

          <p>Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba have been suspended for their next MLS match after they were absent from the league's All-Star Game. While Messi's absence was attributed to fatigue and Alba's to a minor injury, neither player received prior approval from the league to miss the event, triggering the automatic sanction. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's immense contribution to the league but stated that the long-standing policy had to be enforced without exception. However, he also committed to reviewing the rule with players to see how it should evolve in the future.</p>

          <p>Data analytics and software firm Palantir has seen its stock value more than double this year, pushing its market capitalization to $375 billion and making it one of the 20 most valuable companies in the U.S. The surge is driven by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence business and its strong ties with the U.S. government, with its government-related revenue growing 45% in the last quarter. The company's valuation is now ahead of established giants like Home Depot and Procter & Gamble. Despite its high market cap, the stock trades at a very high multiple of 273 times forward earnings.
