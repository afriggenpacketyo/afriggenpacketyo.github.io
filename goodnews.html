          <p>The Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C., highlighted artisans dedicated to preserving their cultural traditions for future generations. Featured participants included a Guatemalan Maya painter, Bolivian rappers integrating indigenous languages into hip-hop, and refugee weavers from the Karen ethnic group. The event also showcased a family of Mexican-American luthiers who restore guitars for stars like Dolly Parton, continuing a craft passed down through four generations. These artists shared their skills and stories, emphasizing the importance of youth mentorship in keeping their heritage alive.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is exploring additional measures to enhance online safety for children, according to Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander. This comes as new age-verification rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom, are set to take effect, requiring platforms to filter harmful content from children's feeds. Alexander stated these rules are a foundation, not the final step, and that the Technology Secretary is examining further actions to address issues like addictive online habits. While Ofcom has pledged rigorous enforcement, its chief executive acknowledged that new legal powers might be necessary to address challenges posed by advancing AI.</p>

          <p>With the price of package holidays soaring, travelers are employing various money-saving tactics to afford their summer getaways. Some individuals save significantly by booking last-minute trips, while families find value in traveling off-peak and seeking "kids go free" deals. Other creative methods include swapping homes with people in other countries to eliminate accommodation costs, using credit card loyalty points for flights, and house-sitting to enjoy a vacation without paying for lodging. These hacks are helping people combat rising travel expenses and still enjoy holidays in destinations from Mexico to the UK.</p>

          <p>In response to its severe housing crisis, California is creating a new cabinet-level agency dedicated solely to housing and homelessness. The move, initiated by Governor Gavin Newsom, splits the former Business, Consumer Services and Housing Agency to elevate the focus on one of the state's most pressing issues. Supporters believe this reorganization is long overdue and will help streamline the state's complex network of affordable housing funding programs. However, critics question whether a bureaucratic reshuffle will be effective, especially since major funding sources managed by the state treasurer's office remain separate, posing a continued challenge.</p>

          <p>Researchers at Caltech are transforming jellyfish into "biohybrid" cyborgs by embedding them with microelectronic controllers to help explore the ocean's depths. These remotely controlled jellyfish can be directed to swim and collect environmental data on temperature and pressure, offering a low-cost, scalable alternative to traditional underwater robots. Jellyfish are ideal for this purpose as they lack a central nervous system, feel no pain, and have remarkable regenerative abilities. The team aims to make ocean research more accessible and is working on deep-sea versions of the device, potentially revolutionizing how marine data is collected.</p>

Six years ago, the Irishman triumphed by six shots, becoming the first Open champion on the island of Ireland in 68 years, a moment celebrated by thunderous crowds. Lowry recalls the final rounds, particularly the Saturday, as the most incredible experience of his career, where he played some of his best golf under immense pressure. As he returns, he acknowledges that expectations will be higher this time, but he feels well-equipped to perform.</p>

          <p>The final fight in the Katie Taylor and Amanda Serrano trilogy showcased the evolution and enduring contradictions of women's boxing. While the bout was more tactical and less chaotic than their previous encounters, the article argues this represents progress, as female fighters have earned the right to be strategic rather than purely entertaining. The piece reflects on the meaning of choice in a sport where women fight for glory while still facing disparities, from pay to the presence of bikini-clad ring girls. Ultimately, the trilogy is framed as a transcendent moment that solidified the legacies of both fighters and pushed the sport forward.</p>

          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite known as NWA 16788, is being auctioned by Sotheby's in New York with an estimated price of $2 million to $4 million. The rock is believed to have been ejected from the Martian surface by an asteroid impact before crashing into the Sahara desert, where it was found in 2023. Analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe. Representing nearly 7% of all known Martian material on Earth, the rare artifact is a significant find for collectors and scientists.</p>

          <p>After a four-decade conflict, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) has initiated a disarmament process, signaling a potential end to its armed struggle against the Turkish government. The move, which began with a ceremonial destruction of weapons, is seen as an opportunity for reconciliation, though the PKK's full disarmament is contingent on concessions from Ankara, including the release of leader Abdullah Ocalan. While Turkey's government remains cautious, a parliamentary commission is being formed to address the peace process. A successful resolution could significantly boost Turkey's regional influence by improving relations with Kurdish populations in Iraq and Syria.</p>

          <p>Forty years after its broadcast, the 1985 Live Aid concert is remembered as a landmark moment of global unity and fundraising, but its legacy is also viewed with modern criticism. Organized by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to combat famine in Ethiopia, the event raised millions and put humanitarian issues on the global political agenda. However, looking back, the concert is criticized for its lack of diversity, featuring almost no African or female performers, and for promoting a "white savior" narrative of Africa. While Geldof defends the event's impact, others argue it reinforced patronizing stereotypes that persist in the development sector today.</p>

          <p>Campaigners and a UK Member of Parliament are calling for cosmetic ingredient lists to be in English instead of Latin to protect consumers with allergies. The current system uses the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), which relies on Latin-based scientific names that are difficult for the public to understand, such as "Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis" for sweet almond oil. This creates a risk for individuals with severe allergies, who may unknowingly use a harmful product. While the industry association argues the system provides global consistency, advocates maintain that clear, plain-language labeling is essential for safety.</p>

          <p>Ousmane Dembélé has transformed into a pivotal player for Paris Saint-Germain, earning praise as the season's best for his relentless pressing and offensive output. Once known for his unpredictability and discipline issues, the 28-year-old has thrived in a central role under coach Luis Enrique, who has lauded his leadership by example. His aggressive, high-energy press has become the starting point for PSG's suffocating style of play, forcing opponent errors and creating scoring opportunities. This evolution from a talented but inconsistent winger to a disciplined, all-around contributor marks a significant maturation for the French international.</p>
