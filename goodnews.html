This initiative addresses a shortage of drivers and improves safety in dangerous working conditions, as traditional mining operations faced high attrition rates and health issues among drivers. The move is part of China's broader push to digitally transform its coal industry and build "intelligent coal mines," aligning with the government's strategic goals for autonomous driving and technological advancement.

The court ruled that the executive order exceeded the President's supervisory powers under the Constitution. The administration sought to pare the federal workforce through the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk.

          <p>Defence Secretary John Healey stated that UK defence spending is projected to rise to 3% of GDP by 2034. The strategic defence review, to be published on Monday, is based on this assumption, with the possibility of projects being delivered faster if the target is brought forward. The review will recommend deploying new "digital" experts alongside troops to protect them from enemy drones and control future unmanned weapons. New money for defence will be found in part by reducing UK overseas aid.</p>
