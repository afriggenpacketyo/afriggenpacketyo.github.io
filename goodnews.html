          <p>Advisers to President Trump are defending the administration's tariffs amid legal challenges, asserting that they are "not going away." Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick stated that tariffs will remain in place, despite a federal court ruling that Trump overstepped his authority. National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett expressed confidence that the Supreme Court would support the tariffs, but acknowledged that the administration has alternative measures to pursue if the tariffs are blocked. The U.S. Court of International Trade had previously blocked Trump's tariffs, arguing that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorize a president to impose universal duties on imports (not investment advice).

          <p>Investors are increasingly focusing on short-term Treasury bonds, mirroring Warren Buffett's strategy, due to concerns and volatility in the market. Short and middle-term bonds are exhibiting less volatility and stable yields, making them attractive. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 T-Bill ETF (BIL) are attracting significant investor flows, with ultrashort opportunities gaining popularity. Berkshire Hathaway has doubled its ownership of T-bills, now holding 5% of all short-term Treasuries (not investment advice). The optimism score is 65.</p>
