This announcement precedes India's upcoming five-Test tour of England, starting on June 20, and follows Rohit Sharma's recent retirement. Kohli, aged 36, played 123 Test matches for India, amassing 9,230 runs with an average of 46.85. He expressed gratitude for the challenges and lessons learned during his Test career, having previously retired from T20 internationals in 2024 but intending to continue playing one-day internationals.</p>

          <p>The PKK, an outlawed Kurdish group, declared that it is laying down arms and disbanding, marking an end to its 40-year insurgency against Turkey. The group stated that it has "completed its historical mission" and will pursue Kurdish rights through democratic politics, following a call from jailed leader Abdullah Ocalan. This move comes as the PKK faces increased pressure from the Turkish military and shifts in regional dynamics, while President Erdogan seeks support from pro-Kurdish parties for his re-election bid. The decision could lead to new political dialogues and greater Kurdish rights, pending Turkey's democratic transition.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. Both countries will suspend most tariffs for 90 days while continuing negotiations, with the U.S. reducing tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% and China lowering import duties on American goods to 10%. This agreement follows weekend talks in Geneva and aims to address concerns in their economic and trade relationship.

          <p>Republican Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri argues against proposed Medicaid cuts in the upcoming Republican bill, emphasizing that such cuts would harm working-class families and rural hospitals. He points out that Missouri voters mandated Medicaid expansion in 2020 and that many residents rely on the program for healthcare. Hawley insists that cutting Medicaid is morally wrong and politically unwise, as it contradicts President Trump's promises to protect social insurance programs and would negatively impact his constituents. The Senator advocates for policies that support working families, such as capping prescription drug costs and providing tax cuts.</p>

          <p>Contributing Opinion writer Julia Belluz explores the complex issue of chemicals in ultraprocessed foods and their potential health effects. In the United States, thousands of additives are allowed in food, often without rigorous testing for long-term health impacts. The regulatory pathway known as GRAS allows companies to self-certify the safety of many chemicals, leading to concerns about transparency and potential risks. Unlike Europe, the U.S. doesn't routinely re-examine chemicals already on the market, raising questions about the safety of ingredients in common foods and their potential contribution to chronic diseases.</p>

Federal budget proposals that cut funding for education and mental health services are seen as misaligned priorities. The author concludes that America's prosperity is built on investing in people and places, and that reinvestment in public services is essential for working-class life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food scientists have discovered that chilling cooked white rice and pasta can transform digestible starches into resistant starches, a super nutrient with numerous health benefits. Resistant starch improves gut health, lowers inflammation, enhances insulin sensitivity, and aids blood sugar management. The process involves cooking the rice or pasta and then refrigerating it for at least six to eight hours, which alters the sugar chains, making them indigestible. This simple kitchen trick can turn "naughty" carbs into healthier options, offering a way to increase fiber intake and improve overall metabolic health.</p>

While AI tools are already used for routine diplomatic tasks, they are increasingly being considered for high-stakes decision-making. However, concerns remain about biases in AI models and the limitations of replicating human connections in diplomacy.

While the FDA states that current evidence doesn't show a risk, some research suggests possible links between microplastics and health problems.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congressional Republicans are proposing a significant overhaul of the federal student loan program, aiming to simplify repayment options for future borrowers. The plan would sunset most current repayment plans and offer a binary choice: a standard plan with fixed payments or a repayment assistance plan tied to income. The new repayment assistance plan would cap payments at 10% of adjusted gross income and waive remaining interest, but it would also eliminate the $0 payment option and prevent borrowers from switching plans later. This overhaul is part of a broader Republican reconciliation package.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to significantly reduce tariffs in the next 90 days, after President Donald Trump signaled that trade talks with Beijing were going well over the weekend.

          <p>Rory McIlroy is favored to win the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow, a course he loves and where he has had considerable success. McIlroy has won at Quail Hollow in 2021 and 2024. Quail Hollow, boasting 61 bunkers and four water hazards, will feel reassuringly familiar and just how he likes it. It is set up tougher than it usually is for the Wells Fargo Championship. Victory this week would move McIlroy alongside Sir Nick Faldo's six majors and tie the record for any European in the modern era.</p>
