          <p>The Japanese government's initiative to release stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has begun, offering consumers cheaper products. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice, priced at 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The rice has been selling out quickly, reflecting consumer demand for affordable staples. The government hopes that selling directly to retailers will be more effective in curbing soaring rice prices and alleviating financial strain on households. This has the potential to help Japanese consumers save money on food.</p>

Korda, who has never finished higher than a tie for eighth in the US Women‚Äôs Open, shot a 67, her best round in the event. Saigo's strong performance has put her in a favorable position heading into the weekend, with the possibility of matching Brooks Koepka's winning score at Erin Hills in 2017.</p>

          <p>President Trump praised Nippon Steel Corp. for its partnership deal with United States Steel Corp., backing the Japanese company's $14 billion investment. Trump emphasized that U.S. Steel will continue to be controlled by the USA, and said he will raise tariffs on steel imports to 50 percent. Nippon Steel seeks to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, a move that was previously blocked by the Biden administration due to national security concerns. The deal is expected to create at least 70,000 jobs and add $14 billion to the American economy, according to Trump.

Trump said Nippon would invest a total of $14 billion as part of the deal, with some $2.2 billion slotted to increase steel production in Pittsburgh's Mon Valley and another $7 billion to modernize steel mills. Trump emphasized that the U.S. Steel headquarters would stay in Pittsburgh, bringing in more jobs for Americans.
