          <p>The United States government has rescinded its export restrictions on chip design software to China, as confirmed by U.S.-based Synopsys, a key industry player. This policy reversal comes after the U.S. had previously required companies like Synopsys to obtain licenses for exporting semiconductor-related goods to China since May. The lifting of these curbs is seen as a significant development amid a broader trade truce between the two nations, potentially easing tensions and facilitating trade in the critical technology sector. This move could impact global supply chains and foster greater technological collaboration.</p>

          <p>Hong Kong's equity capital markets are experiencing a strong resurgence, with new listing volumes jumping eightfold to $14 billion in the first half of 2025, positioning the city to become the world's largest listing destination this year. This surge is attributed to a confluence of factors, including Beijing's regulatory support for mainland companies to list offshore, a muted pace of A-share listings, ample market liquidity, and delisting fears in U.S. markets. The trend is driven by Chinese firms seeking to fund globalization strategies and capitalize on improved market valuations, particularly in emerging sectors like AI and biotech.

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has blocked the Trump administration's policy that restricts migrants crossing the southern border from seeking asylum. U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss ruled in a 128-page order that President Donald Trump exceeded his legal authority by attempting to "adopt an alternative immigration system," stating neither the Constitution nor the Immigration and Nationality Act grant such unilateral power. The executive order, issued in January, had declared the border situation an "invasion" and suspended asylum access. The judge's decision, which recognized the executive branch's challenges, was stayed for 14 days to allow for an appeal and implementation preparation.</p>

The article delves into the historical context of fan voting, including past controversies and commissioner interventions, and notes that other Dodgers players are strong candidates for reserve or pitching spots.
