          <h2>E-Tattoo Developed to Track Mental Workload in High-Stress Jobs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 17:15:23 EDT</div>

          <p>Researchers have developed a face "e-tattoo" to track brainwaves and mental workload in high-stress professions such as pilots, doctors, and emergency dispatchers. The device, temporarily attached to the forehead, uses EEG and EOG to measure brain waves and eye movements, offering a more cost-effective and compact solution than traditional machines. The study involved participants performing tasks of varying difficulty, with the e-tattoo detecting shifts in brainwave activity corresponding to higher mental workload. While currently a lab prototype costing $200, further development is needed for commercialization, including real-time decoding and validation in realistic environments, as this innovation has the potential to improve training and performance in mentally demanding careers.</p>

Norrie acknowledged the difficulty in managing the noise, while Fearnley downplayed its impact on his performance, as he double faulted on match point.

          <p>The FDA has approved Moderna's new COVID-19 vaccine, mNexspike, for adults 65 and older and those aged 12 to 64 with health conditions increasing their risk, marking a step toward next-generation coronavirus vaccines. The vaccine uses a lower dose by refining its immune target, but its use is limited compared to Moderna's existing vaccine, reflecting skepticism from Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other Trump officials. This decision follows the cancellation of funding for Moderna's flu vaccine development and changes to the CDC's vaccine recommendations for children, adding a layer of complexity to vaccine availability and guidance.
