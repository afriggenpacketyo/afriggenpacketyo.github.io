          <h2>NATO Summit Focuses on Defense Spending and Russia Deterrence Amidst Ukraine Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 00:54:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague is expected to center on increasing defense spending among member nations to deter potential Russian aggression, a key demand of the US administration. Secretary-General Mark Rutte has been instrumental in gaining support for this initiative, particularly from Germany. While the summit aims to give the US a win and rebalance the alliance, some European countries express reservations about shifting priorities from social justice to military strength. Despite Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's invitation, Ukraine's NATO aspirations are unlikely to be a major focus, with the US seemingly downplaying the issue, while discussions about Russia as a threat are expected, but without new aggressive language due to ongoing US efforts to facilitate negotiations. Optimism surrounding the summit hinges on NATO's ability to demonstrate its strength and unity to Russia. </p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency has reported over 180 earthquakes near the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan over the past weekend, urging residents to remain vigilant. Akuseki Island, part of the island chain in Kagoshima Prefecture, experienced two quakes measuring 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale on Sunday, and another early Monday. Seismic activity near the island chain has been frequently observed since Saturday, prompting increased monitoring and warnings to the local population. The agency continues to monitor the situation and advises residents to take necessary precautions in case of a stronger earthquake. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to persuade Iran not to close the Strait of Hormuz, a critical global shipping route for oil. This request follows reports that the Iranian parliament approved a plan to close the Strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. China, being the largest buyer of Iranian oil, has a significant stake in maintaining the Strait's accessibility, as any disruption could cause global oil prices to surge. Rubio emphasized that closing the Strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran and would negatively impact many countries' economies, while energy analysts believe Iran has too much to lose by closing the Strait, including the risk of alienating its key market, China. </p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City is using ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate receives a majority, ensuring that the winner has broad support, though the complexity of the system may lead to slower results and potential questions about transparency. Preliminary results based on first choices are expected shortly after polls close, but the ranked choice tabulations will not begin until July 1, with official certification on July 15. </p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has unveiled its first images, showcasing its ability to explore the universe's depths. The observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, aims to transform our understanding of the cosmos by mapping the Milky Way, detecting killer asteroids, and answering questions about dark matter. The observatory will conduct a continuous 10-year survey of the southern night sky, capturing detailed snapshots and potentially increasing the number of known objects in our solar system tenfold. The telescope's unique design and advanced camera technology will enable scientists to observe faint galaxies and supernova explosions from billions of years ago, providing insights into the universe's history. </p>

The new academies, including the People's Liberation Army Ground Force Service Academy, PLA Information Support Force Engineering University, and PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University, will begin recruiting high school graduates this summer. While the total number of new recruits will remain consistent with previous years, the restructuring aims to create a more efficient and higher-quality system for nurturing military talent. The ministry has also eliminated the requirement for military academy students to have three years of work experience before becoming commanders, streamlining the path to leadership roles. </p>

Professor Houman Sadri from the University of Central Florida believes that Iran will likely respond in a calculated manner, and the impact on gas prices will depend on the stock market's reaction. Despite fears of a global conflict, Professor Sadri believes that a full-scale World War III is unlikely, as he believes that any potential conflict will remain a regional one between Israel and Iran. </p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Abrego Garcia Can Be Released on Bail</h2>

          <p>A federal judge in Nashville ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, can be released on bail while awaiting trial on human smuggling charges. Despite the ruling, Abrego Garcia may remain in custody due to a potential transfer to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Abrego Garcia was previously deported to El Salvador's CECOT prison, despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation due to fear of persecution, and his defense argues that the charges are a distraction from the lack of due process in his case. The prosecution alleges that Abrego Garcia conspired to transport thousands of migrants without legal status from Texas across the US between 2016 and 2025, and another hearing is scheduled to set conditions for his release. </p>

          <h2>Kyoto Tourism Survey Reveals High Satisfaction Despite Overtourism Concerns</h2>

          <p>A Kyoto city government tourism survey reveals that despite a record 10.88 million foreign visitors in 2024, satisfaction with the sightseeing experience remains high among both foreign and Japanese tourists. Temples, shrines, and historic sites continue to be the main attractions, with Kiyomizu temple, Nijo-jo castle, and Fushimi Inari Taisha shrine being the most visited locations. However, Japanese visitors are more likely to be disappointed by crowds compared to foreign visitors, citing issues related to public transportation and manners. A lodging tax increase is planned for March 2026 to address overtourism, with revenue allocated to strengthening related measures. </p>

          <h2>Bitcoin Reclaims $100K as Markets Show Limited Reaction to Iran Strike</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 21:36:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin has rebounded above $100,500 as markets show limited reaction to news of US strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities. While prices briefly dipped below six figures on Sunday, equity futures are flat, and gold is up only marginally, suggesting traders are not yet pricing in a broader escalation. Crude oil is holding gains near $76 per barrel after an initial spike on fears of Iran blocking the Strait of Hormuz, but commentary from US officials and muted trading suggest investors are in a wait-and-see mode. In crypto markets, altcoins like ETH, XRP, and SOL are also recovering losses, as the market appears to be treating the situation as a geopolitical flashpoint rather than a structural break.
