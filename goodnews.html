          <p>A European court ruled that the European Commission should not have denied a New York Times journalist's request for text messages exchanged between Ursula von der Leyen, president of the commission, and Pfizer's CEO, Dr. Albert Bourla, during Covid-19 vaccine negotiations in 2021. The court stated that the commission must provide credible explanations if it claims not to hold requested documents and cannot dismiss messages on major issues as short-lived or unimportant. The New York Times hailed the decision as a victory for transparency and accountability, emphasizing that public scrutiny should extend to communications like text messages. The case highlights broader concerns about transparency in negotiations involving taxpayer money and public policy.</p>

The NIH plans to reduce animal use in research and advance animal-free methods, citing the limited relevance of animal models to human outcomes.

          <p>Despite increasing involvement of fathers in parenting, many people still assume that mothers are the primary caregivers, leading to frustrating experiences for both parents. Schools, doctors' offices, and even strangers often contact mothers first, regardless of parental preferences or availability. Research shows that principals are more likely to call mothers back than fathers, even when fathers indicate greater availability. This default assumption can disrupt mothers' work lives and reinforce outdated gender roles, while also undermining fathers' active involvement in their children's lives, the article suggests.</p>

          <p>China and Russia have signed an agreement to construct a nuclear power plant on the moon to provide energy for the jointly developed International Lunar Research Station (ILRS), planned for completion by 2036. The collaboration between the China National Space Administration and Roscosmos aims to establish a permanent research base on the moon's south pole. The ILRS seeks to conduct space research and test technologies for long-term human presence, with 13 countries reportedly joining the project. The memorandum was one of over two dozen agreements reached during negotiations between Presidents Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Co-op anticipates that its shelves will be more fully stocked this weekend after resolving issues stemming from a cyber-attack that disrupted its online ordering system for suppliers. The attack caused payment problems, widespread shortages, and compromised customer and staff data. The company is gradually bringing its systems back online and working with suppliers to restock stores. Experts caution that the reputational impact of the attack may linger, and the costs of recovery and security upgrades could affect the company's finances.</p>

          <h2>Migrants in UK Face Longer Wait for Permanent Settlement Under New Government Plans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 06:54:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government rules will require migrants to live in the UK for 10 years, double the current five-year period, before qualifying for permanent settlement. The changes will apply to approximately 1.5 million foreign workers who have moved to the UK since 2020, subject to a public consultation. The government believes that settlement should be a privilege earned through contribution to the UK's economy and society. The move is part of a wider effort to cut legal migration and address concerns about a surge in settlement applications.</p>

          <h2>Former Reform MP Will Not Face Charges Over Alleged Threats</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-14 06:49:38 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rupert Lowe, formerly a Reform UK MP, will not face criminal charges regarding allegations of threats, according to the Crown Prosecution Service. Lowe was suspended by the party in March following claims of threats towards the party's chairman. Lowe, now an independent MP, accused Reform of conducting a "brutal smear campaign" and criticized party leader Nigel Farage. The CPS determined there was insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction.</p>
