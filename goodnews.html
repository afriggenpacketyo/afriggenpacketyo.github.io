          <p>Anna Wintour, a dominant figure in the fashion industry for decades, is stepping back from her direct editorial duties at U.S. Vogue. While she will remain Cond√© Nast's chief content officer and Vogue's global editorial director, the U.S. edition will hire a new head of editorial content. This structural change aligns the U.S. publication with other global editions and allows the 75-year-old Wintour to focus on her broader oversight roles. The move marks a significant transition for the magazine she has led since 1988.</p>
