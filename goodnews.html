          <p>President Trump announced via social media that he plans to reveal a major trade agreement with a 'big, and highly respected, country' at a news conference in Washington D.C. The announcement comes after Trump imposed tariffs on numerous trading partners, which initially sent markets into turmoil before he paused the hikes for 90 days, except for China. The New York Times and Politico reported that the U.S. will strike a trade agreement with the UK, citing people familiar with the plans.</p>

          <p>Several public transportation services and police departments in Japan are implementing AI-driven systems to streamline lost-and-found operations. Find Inc.'s platform uses AI to categorize lost items from pictures taken by workers, allowing owners to inquire via messaging apps by providing descriptions or similar images. Keio Corp, a railway operator, saw its return rate increase from less than 10 percent to 30 percent after adopting the system. Yurikamome Inc., another train operator, has significantly reduced inquiry numbers, while police departments report faster item returns due to the elimination of physical warehouse verification.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a stay on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that it could face 'substantial sums' in losses if forced to immediately comply with orders regarding in-app purchase commissions and linking policies. The ruling requires Apple to stop imposing commissions on purchases made through web links inside iPhone apps, and prevents Apple from restricting app developers from choosing the language or placement of those links. Apple claims that non-party developers are already using the order to reduce consumer choice and damage Apple's business.</p>
