          <h2>UK's Eurovision Entry Remember Monday Falls Short Despite Strong Vocals</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-17 21:46:29 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, placed 19th despite delivering a vocally strong performance. The article suggests the song, "What The Hell Just Happened," a mix of musical styles, was too busy and lacked a clear identity for viewers. While the band's friendship and energy were evident, the staging was deemed less impactful than other competitors. Despite the disappointing result, the article notes that Remember Monday achieved the UK's highest score since 2017 (excluding Sam Ryder's 2022 success), laying a foundation for future entries. </p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler surged to the lead at the US PGA Championship after a stellar third round at Quail Hollow, marked by an eagle and multiple birdies. The start of the day was delayed due to thunderstorms, but Scheffler finished with a 65, placing him three strokes ahead of his nearest competitor. He expressed his focus on the opportunity to win a major tournament and acknowledged the need for another strong performance in the final round. Despite a previous hand injury and only one victory this season, Scheffler's recent win at the Byron Nelson Classic by eight shots underscores his current form. </p>

          <p>Public perception of Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents, has shifted over the years due to pop culture and growing understanding of trauma and sexual abuse. Initially portrayed as greedy killers, they now have a new generation of supporters who sympathize with their claims of sexual abuse. A Los Angeles judge reduced their sentence, making parole possible, and their fate now rests with the California Parole Board and Governor Gavin Newsom. New evidence and documentaries have contributed to the changing public opinion, potentially influencing the brothers' chances at freedom. </p>

His work is a "rallying cry" to transform manicured spaces into wildlife-friendly havens, highlighting the importance of these habitats amid climate change. </p>

          <p>Taiwan's last operating nuclear power reactor was shut down on Saturday, marking the end of four decades of nuclear power generation in line with the government's policy to phase out atomic energy. The No. 2 reactor at the Maanshan power plant in Pingtung County ceased operations as the island shifts towards alternative energy sources. The decision follows Japan's 2011 Fukushima disaster and reflects Taiwan's commitment to phasing out nuclear power, although the feasibility of achieving this goal remains uncertain. </p>
