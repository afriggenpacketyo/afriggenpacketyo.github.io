        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brad G. Smith, diagnosed with ALS, can now communicate using a Neuralink brain implant, overcoming limitations of previous eye-tracking technology. The implant, placed in his skull and connected to the motor cortex, picks up neuron signals and transmits them to a computer, allowing him to move a cursor with his thoughts. Smith uses the system to play games, communicate with family, and even utilizes Elon Musk's AI chatbot, Grok, to speed up conversations. Neuralink recently received a "breakthrough" designation from the FDA, offering hope for others with severe speech impairments caused by various neurological conditions, raising questions about privacy and autonomy. The technology provides Smith with freedom, hope, and faster communication, significantly improving his quality of life.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark is increasing its retirement age to 70, prompting discussions about whether the U.S. might follow suit, despite a failed attempt in December by Sen. Rand Paul to raise the U.S. retirement age to 70. While Denmark's move reflects increasing good health and demand for older workers, experts caution that the U.S. has greater disparities in income and life expectancy, making a blanket increase problematic. Raising the retirement age is effectively a benefit cut and could disproportionately harm those with shorter life expectancies, though lawmakers may consider raising taxes, cutting benefits or a combination of both to resolve issues with the Social Security Administration. Denmark's decision sends a message that people should work longer.</p>

          <p>After 23 years of construction, the A465 Heads of the Valleys road in south Wales has fully reopened following a ¬£2bn upgrade project. The 28-mile improvement aims to boost prosperity in one of the UK's most deprived areas and reduce journey times. The project, initially conceived in 1990, involved building almost 70 structures and planting 285,000 trees to mitigate environmental impact. While Welsh ministers tout the upgrade's economic benefits, opponents criticize the project's duration and cost, funded through the Mutual Investment Model, which involves annual payments over 30 years.</p>

          <p>A recent study indicates that the world's population may be significantly higher than the United Nations' estimate of 8.2 billion, potentially by hundreds of millions or even billions. The study, conducted by researchers at Aalto University in Finland, found that UN estimates undercount rural populations by more than 50% due to incomplete census data in the global south. While concerns about overpopulation persist, they often reflect power struggles over which lives matter and who is considered a burden. Despite disparities in consumption, population control efforts still tend to focus on the majority world, although coercive policies are no longer in vogue.</p>

          <p>Dodgers shortstop Mookie Betts will miss the weekend series against the New York Yankees after fracturing his toe at home. Betts sustained the injury when he hit his toe on a wall in the dark, but the team is hopeful he will avoid the injured list. Despite the injury, Betts and manager Dave Roberts are confident he will only be out for a few days. Miguel Rojas will fill in at shortstop in Betts' absence, with Tommy Edman and Hyeseong Kim as other potential options.</p>
