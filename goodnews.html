          <p>The Eastern Kentucky Remembrance Project (EKRP) is working to uncover and memorialize the forgotten history of racial lynchings in the region. The group recently installed a historical marker for Fred Shannon, a Black musician who was lynched by a mob in 1924 after being falsely accused of murder. Founded in 2021, the interracial coalition researches these violent events, places markers at the sites, and collects soil for a national memorial. Despite some local opposition, members say the work is vital for confronting a painful past, especially amid modern efforts to suppress Black history.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio held his first official meeting with the families of the 50 remaining hostages held by the militant group Hamas in Gaza. During the meeting in Washington, D.C., Rubio reaffirmed the administration's commitment to securing the release of all captives. The families urged the U.S. government to push for a single, comprehensive deal to bring everyone home at once, rather than in phases. They expressed their trust in the administration to act with urgency, stating that this is a critical window of opportunity to resolve the crisis and make brave decisions.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major policy shift driven by a new Trump presidency and the war in Europe, Germany plans to significantly increase its military spending to 3.5% of its GDP. Incoming Chancellor Friedrich Merz announced the goal is to build the strongest armed forces in Europe, a move made possible by a constitutional change and a special $117 billion fund. This represents a historic change for a country that has long underspent on defense, reflecting a new sense of urgency among its leaders. While defense companies are seeing a surge in business, the plan also involves the long-term challenge of rebuilding a culture of military service.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues against the "respectability politics" being promoted by some conservative gay figures who seek to distance the LGBTQ+ community from its more flamboyant or radical members. The author references the film "Flawless" and historical events like the Stonewall Riots, emphasizing that drag queens and gender-nonconforming individuals have always been at the forefront of the fight for gay rights. The piece criticizes attempts to create a "normal gay" archetype, asserting that the movement's strength and beauty come from its diversity. It concludes that progress has always been driven by the entire, multifaceted community, not a sanitized, monolithic version of it.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant local political shift, voters in Huntington Beach, California, overwhelmingly passed two ballot measures to protect their public library system from conservative overhaul. The measures effectively dismantled a newly created parent review board for children's books and barred the privatization of the city's libraries. This outcome serves as a strong rebuke to the city's MAGA-aligned council supermajority, which had pushed for these changes, alleging the library contained inappropriate materials. Organizers of the successful "Protect HB" campaign believe the council went "too far, too fast," uniting a diverse coalition of residents who felt the moves were an extremist overreach.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article reflects on President Trump's recent on-camera use of an expletive when discussing the long-running conflict between Israel and Iran. The author argues that while unprecedented for a president in such a public forum, the moment came across as authentic and reflected a frustration shared by many observers. The piece suggests that the public's distrust of polished, scripted political speech is a major problem for the political class. While not endorsing profanity as a standard, the author posits that judicious, genuine moments of unscripted emotion could help politicians seem more human and trustworthy to voters.</p>

          <p>President Trump's administration experienced a momentous week, securing what it touted as major victories while facing looming deadlines on other fronts. The White House celebrated a favorable Supreme Court ruling limiting nationwide injunctions, increased defense spending commitments from NATO allies, and a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. However, significant challenges remain unresolved, including the stalled progress on dozens of international trade deals and the uncertain fate of the president's "big, beautiful bill" in the Senate. The outcomes of these domestic and foreign policy issues over the next several days could be pivotal for the Trump presidency.</p>

          <p>As Russia intensifies its drone attacks on Ukrainian cities, Ukraine is ramping up the development and deployment of interceptor drones as a key defensive strategy. These specialized, high-speed drones are a more cost-effective solution for downing Russian Shahed drones compared to expensive anti-aircraft missiles. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has highlighted the development of these drones as a national priority, with multiple domestic manufacturers already producing and testing them. The goal is to create new mobile air defense units equipped with these interceptors to protect cities and critical infrastructure from the relentless aerial bombardment.</p>

          <p>LGBTQ+ rights supporters are expected to gather for the annual Budapest Pride march, defying a police ban enacted under a controversial "child-protection" law. The event has become a symbol of resistance against the repressive policies of Prime Minister Viktor Orban's nationalist government. More than 30 embassies and numerous members of the European Parliament have voiced their support for the march, with the European Commission President calling on Hungarian authorities to allow it to proceed. The ban is viewed by opponents as part of a wider crackdown on democratic freedoms ahead of next year's elections.</p>

This marks Wilder's first victory since 2022, following a difficult period that included three losses in his previous four bouts. While the performance was dominant, it was a more measured and less explosive display from the fighter once known as the most feared puncher in the division. The 39-year-old stated that this is a "new beginning" for him and that he aims to be a more complete, all-around fighter.</p>
