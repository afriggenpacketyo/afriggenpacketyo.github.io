          <p>Merryl Hoffman experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on a Manhattan street, collapsing near Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Two nurses, Sabrina Castle and Gianna Formisano, who were walking to work, rushed to her aid and performed CPR until the ambulance arrived. Hoffman was taken to NewYork-Presbyterian where she received further treatment, including an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Hoffman later reunited with the nurses, expressing her gratitude for their life-saving actions, stating that she would have certainly died without their help, and now the three women remain in contact with one another.</p>

          <p>The article examines the debate over whether federal rental aid should come with a time limit, focusing on a program in Delaware that imposes a seven-year limit. The Delaware program also includes work requirements and savings incentives, helping recipients save money while receiving assistance. While some argue that time limits encourage self-sufficiency and increase program turnover, others worry about the potential for hardship and homelessness. A similar program in Washington state was discontinued after it proved ineffective due to high rent prices and lack of affordable housing.</p>

While rolling funds into an IRA is an option, it can also come with higher investment fees.
