        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously ruled that President Trump can maintain control of the National Guard troops deployed to Los Angeles, thereby staying a lower court order that would have returned command to California Governor Gavin Newsom. The court stated that the president likely acted lawfully under his statutory authority, even though he failed to notify the governor before deploying the National Guard as required by law, as Newsom had no power to veto the order. The judges cited violence during protests as the basis for federalizing the guard, as protesters had pinned down federal officers and damaged federal buildings. The ruling emphasizes the deference given to the President in national security decisions.</p>

          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, has decided to keep its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures last month, influenced by a recent trade deal with the U.S. The 1-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0%, and the 5-year LPR is at 3.5%, aligning with economists' expectations. This decision follows a rate cut last month, the first since October, intended to mitigate trade tensions with the U.S., coupled with commercial banks reducing deposit rates to protect their net interest margins. The trade truce has provided Beijing with some flexibility to support its currency and has raised hopes that the economic impact will be less severe than initially anticipated (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, following a high-profile Massachusetts trial; however, she was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed as part of a coverup involving law enforcement. The trial included contentious arguments over evidence, witness testimony, and allegations of misconduct by investigators. The timeline of events leading to O'Keefe's death and the subsequent investigation were heavily scrutinized throughout the legal proceedings.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that President Trump can maintain control over the National Guard troops in Los Angeles, pending further litigation on California's objections. The court affirmed the president's broad authority to deploy the military in American cities, while also acknowledging judicial review is not entirely precluded. Legal scholars noted the decision was expected, given the 9th Circuit's shift towards a more balanced composition. The ruling returns the issue to U.S. District Judge Charles R. Breyer, but avoids addressing whether the situation in Los Angeles constitutes a "rebellion."</p>

The ruling challenges the "Duffy Directive," which imposed conditions on grant funding related to immigration enforcement and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies.
