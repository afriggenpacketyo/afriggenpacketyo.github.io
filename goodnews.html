        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Individuals facing terminal illness are increasingly creating personal music playlists to provide comfort and connection during their final days. This practice is gaining recognition in palliative care for its therapeutic benefits, as music can trigger powerful memories and emotions, reducing anxiety and psychological pain. Neurologically, music activates multiple brain regions, allowing it to reach even unconscious patients, as hearing is often the last sense to fade. These playlists also serve as a lasting comfort for grieving loved ones, helping them stay connected to the person who has passed away.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region saw gains on Monday, following a strong performance on Wall Street at the end of the previous week. Investors are closely watching for China's upcoming decision on its loan prime rates, with analysts polled by Reuters widely expecting the rates to remain unchanged. This anticipation follows the central bank's recent move to hold a key interest rate steady. Major indices in Japan, South Korea, and Australia all opened higher, reflecting a generally positive sentiment across the region's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article presents a thought experiment on selecting a single stock for long-term holding, identifying Amazon as a strong candidate due to its diversified business model. The company's operations span e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), advertising, and logistics, effectively functioning like a multi-industry conglomerate within one entity. The high profitability of its AWS division is noted for funding innovation and expansion in its other sectors, creating a synergistic and resilient structure. This diversification makes it a uniquely stable choice in this hypothetical scenario. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a researcher who has studied over 200 parent-child relationships, children with exceptional social skills are often raised by parents who model specific behaviors from an early age. These practices include openly discussing feelings to build emotional vocabulary, demonstrating empathy in daily interactions, and fostering authentic confidence by allowing children to try and fail. Parents are also advised to teach conflict resolution, validate their child's feelings, and help them recognize social cues. By creating an environment of emotional safety, parents can equip their children for healthy real-world relationships.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pat McFadden, the UK's Work and Pensions Secretary, has stated that reforming the welfare system is a necessity to address rising benefit costs and provide better support for individuals. The government plans to press ahead with changes, including offering skills and employment support to tens of thousands on sickness benefits who currently have no work requirements. This commitment comes after the government abandoned a previous plan to cut disability benefits. With the bill for health and disability benefits projected to reach £100 billion by 2030, McFadden emphasized that the current system is unsustainable.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Genetically Engineered Mice to Combat Lyme Disease Transmission</h2>

          <p>Researchers at MIT are pioneering a novel approach to reduce the spread of Lyme disease by genetically engineering wild mice, the primary carriers of the bacteria. The project, named "Mice Against Ticks," aims to create mice that are heritably immune to Lyme, meaning their immunity is passed down to their offspring. By introducing these engineered mice into the ecosystem on islands like Nantucket, scientists hope to break the transmission cycle where ticks become infected by biting mice. The team is engaging in extensive community outreach to ensure public buy-in before any potential field trials.</p>

          <p>The University of Austin (UATX) has opened its doors to an inaugural class of 92 students, positioning itself as an alternative to mainstream higher education by championing ideological openness and the "fearless pursuit of truth." Founded by prominent academics and intellectuals concerned about self-censorship on traditional campuses, UATX emphasizes seminar-style classes, Western civilization, and a culture where all viewpoints can be challenged. To foster open discussion, the university employs the Chatham House Rule, which allows ideas to be shared without attribution. For now, the institution is offering free tuition, funded by private donors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists and conservationists continue to study the remarkable migration of monarch butterflies, focusing on the unique "super generation" that travels up to 3,000 miles from the U.S. and Canada to a specific forest in Mexico. This special generation lives up to nine times longer than typical monarchs, allowing them to complete the arduous journey their ancestors have made for thousands of years. However, the monarch population has declined significantly due to habitat loss, particularly the eradication of milkweed plants essential for their life cycle. Efforts are underway to protect their wintering grounds and restore milkweed habitats.</p>

In an interview, the executive vice-president of a Tsinghua University institute stated that these plans have been foundational to China's development, evolving from building a basic national economy to meeting modern goals. He reflects on how, since the reform and opening-up period began, China has largely succeeded in achieving the targets set out in each successive plan, paving the way for sustainable progress.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary defensive plays that were instrumental in his team's 3-2 victory over the New York Mets. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. Later, in the ninth inning, he made a leaping grab at the fence to rob Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was a significant blow to the Mets' playoff hopes in a tight National League wildcard race.</p>
