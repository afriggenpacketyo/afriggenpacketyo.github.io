          <p>China is expanding duty-free access for taxable products to 53 African countries, a move that contrasts sharply with recent US policies. The United States is reportedly planning to levy higher tariffs on some African nations and has imposed aid cuts and visa restrictions. This policy divergence is strengthening the narrative that Beijing is a more reliable and beneficial partner for African nations. Analysts suggest Washington's long-held belief that humanitarian aid would secure unwavering goodwill is proving to be outdated, as China's economic diplomacy gains significant traction across the continent.

          <p>China has taken a significant step in its advanced nuclear energy program by completing the conceptual design for its first commercial fourth-generation fast neutron reactor, the CFR-1000. This gigawatt-level facility, which is now awaiting final approval, is expected to become operational after 2030. The development places China among other major nuclear powers, like Russia and the United States, that are also pursuing advanced reactor technologies. The goal is to develop a more fuel-efficient and sustainable source of nuclear power, marking a key milestone for the country's long-term energy strategy.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-2 victory against the Boston Red Sox, showcasing a resurgent offense that has struggled for much of July. After a period of low scoring, the team has now scored five or more runs in seven of its last ten games. Key contributions came from Teoscar Hernández, who hit a crucial two-run homer, and Andy Pages, who continued his recent hot streak with multiple key hits. The improved hitting provided solid support for the pitching staff, which delivered a strong performance, culminating in the bullpen's first scoreless outing since early July and a first career save for Ben Casparius.</p>

          <p>China's quantitative hedge funds are successfully recruiting top-tier scientific and engineering talent, partly due to challenges these individuals face in the United States, such as university funding cuts and stricter visa policies. Firms like Shanghai-based Mingshi are offering competitive salaries to attract PhD candidates who might have otherwise stayed in the US. This influx of expertise is crucial for the expansion of China's quant sector, which is the world's second-largest and increasingly leveraging artificial intelligence for its investment strategies.

          <h2>Inter Miami Owner Criticizes MLS for Suspending Lionel Messi</h2>

          <p>Inter Miami's owner, Jorge Mas, has publicly criticized Major League Soccer for its decision to suspend star player Lionel Messi for one game. Messi and teammate Jordi Alba were suspended after they skipped the MLS All-Star game, with the club citing the need for rest. Mas called the punishment "draconian" and stated that the players did not understand why missing an exhibition match would lead to a suspension. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged Messi's immense contribution to the league but stated the league had to enforce its long-standing policy, though he added the rule will be reevaluated.</p>

          <p>A Leicester salon owner is preparing for a pivotal hearing in her long-running trademark battle with the global cosmetics giant L'Oréal. Rebecca Dowdeswell, owner of a salon named 'nkd,' has been fighting L'Oréal's opposition to her trademark renewal since 2022. The French firm, which owns the 'Naked' makeup line by Urban Decay, argues that the 'nkd' trademark would cause consumer confusion. After spending over £30,000 in legal fees and facing significant delays, Dowdeswell says she feels ready to fight again as a hearing date with the UK's Intellectual Property Office has finally been set for later this year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's warmest and sunniest spring on record has led to a thriving population of certain insects, including ladybirds, butterflies, and wasps. The warm conditions caused a boom in aphids, a primary food source for ladybirds, and prompted unusually early sightings of numerous butterfly species. This contrasts sharply with the previous year's 'butterfly emergency' caused by cool, wet weather. However, the relative lack of rain this year is a cause for concern, as it could dry up vital wetland habitats and potentially lead to lower insect and amphibian numbers in the following year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Illinois has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the Trump administration against Chicago and the state over their so-called sanctuary policies. The lawsuit, filed in February, had alleged that local laws limiting cooperation between police and federal immigration agents were unlawfully thwarting federal enforcement efforts. In her ruling, the judge determined that the local policies are protected by the Tenth Amendment and do not illegally interfere with federal operations. Chicago's mayor and Illinois' governor both praised the decision, stating that it affirms the legality of the city's welcoming ordinance and protects public safety.</p>

          <p>A new exhibit at the New York Historical Society explores the infamous Hollywood blacklist era of the 1940s and 50s. The exhibit focuses on the House Un-American Activities Committee's investigation into alleged Communist influence in the film industry, which led to the blacklisting of numerous writers, directors, and actors. It highlights the story of the "Hollywood Ten," who were imprisoned for refusing to testify, and details how many in the industry felt compelled to name names to save their own careers. The exhibit uses personal artifacts, like letters and drawings, to illustrate the profound personal and professional impact of the Red Scare on Hollywood and beyond.</p>

The piece describes his intense focus and competitiveness on the course, as recounted by a former chief of staff. It also touches on the business side of his golf empire and his long-standing desire for his prestigious Turnberry course in Scotland to host a major championship, blending sport with personal and political ambition.</p>

          <p>Wildlife biologists in Texas are undertaking a significant conservation effort to save the state's desert bighorn sheep, whose population has been halved in the last five years due to disease. Last fall, a team captured dozens of healthy sheep from the state's only remaining disease-free herd. These animals, including pregnant ewes, were airlifted over 200 miles to an isolated mountain range to establish a new, protected colony. A recent check on the relocated herd brought promising news, as biologists observed a group that included several newborn lambs, signaling a hopeful start for the species' recovery in the region.</p>
