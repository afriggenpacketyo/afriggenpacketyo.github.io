        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union and Indonesia have concluded a free trade pact after over nine years of negotiations, a process notably expedited by former US President Donald Trump's sweeping tariff policies. The Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and an Investment Protection Agreement were signed in Bali, aiming to eliminate most tariffs on EU exports, including car parts, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals, while opening investment in sectors like electric vehicles. This landmark deal is expected to boost jobs and growth, securing critical raw materials for Europe's clean tech industries, and is considered a significant milestone to mitigate global tariff war risks. It represents the EU's third such agreement with a Southeast Asian nation.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish renewables company Orsted surged after a U.S. judge granted a preliminary injunction, allowing the firm to resume construction of its nearly completed Revolution Wind project off the coasts of Rhode Island and Connecticut. The Trump administration had halted the offshore wind farm, reflecting the President's hardline stance against the wind power industry and his championship of America's oil and gas industries. This court victory provides a significant reprieve for Orsted, whose stock had recently hit a record low, enabling the continuation of a key renewable energy initiative. The company announced it would restart work on the project as soon as possible, marking a positive development for clean energy.</p>

          <p>The NHS in England has launched "Jess's Rule," an initiative urging GPs to "think again" if a sick patient presents with worsening symptoms or no diagnosis after three appointments. Named after Jessica Brady, who died of advanced cancer at 27 after her symptoms were repeatedly dismissed as long Covid due to her age, the rule aims to improve patient safety. Health Secretary Wes Streeting described her death as a "preventable tragedy," emphasizing that this guidance encourages doctors to consider further tests, second opinions, or specialist referrals to catch potentially deadly illnesses earlier. The Royal College of General Practitioners supports this best practice to avoid similar oversights.</p>

          <p>Global investment in renewable energy reached a record $386 billion in the first half of 2025, marking a 10% increase from the previous year and defying efforts by the Trump White House to curtail low-carbon projects. A report from Zero Carbon Analytics highlights the sector's resilience and momentum, with finance for wind power increasing by a quarter, and significant investment in energy grids. Additionally, companies representing 70% of the top 2,000 listed firms are actively pursuing net-zero plans, including 304 US-based companies, despite federal hostility. This indicates a strong underlying commitment to climate goals that extends beyond governmental policy, though faster action is still needed. (not investment advice)</p>

The construction leveraged digital twin, AI, and blockchain technologies to enable a 3D-printing-like process, successfully overcoming significant seismic and geological challenges in the region. This achievement showcases China's advanced capabilities in large-scale infrastructure development and its innovative integration of cutting-edge artificial intelligence into complex engineering projects.</p>

          <p>Forty years ago, Tony Jacklin, the most influential captain in Ryder Cup history, revitalized the competition from near irrelevance due to decades of American dominance. After the inclusion of European players failed to stem heavy defeats, Jacklin took the helm in 1983, implementing significant changes to team treatment and preparation. He famously convinced Severiano Ballesteros to rejoin the team, building a formidable European squad that nearly won in 1983 and secured a historic victory in 1985, ending a 28-year American unbeaten run. His pioneering approach transformed the Ryder Cup into the fiercely contested and popular event it is today.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese developer Seazen Group is re-entering the offshore dollar bond market, seeking to sell two-year dollar notes to repay existing debt and for general corporate purposes. This move highlights a broader trend of mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, and Macau issuers returning to the dollar bond market, driving total issuance to its highest level since 2022. The reopening of these channels, which slammed shut during China's unprecedented property crisis and economic slowdown, suggests companies can now refinance under more favorable terms, potentially rebuilding investor trust in previously challenging sectors. This indicates a cautious but significant shift in the financial landscape, despite ongoing economic uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A highly anticipated meeting between US President Donald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping is more likely to occur in early 2026 than this fall, according to US Ambassador to China David Perdue. This clarification follows Trump's social media post about a potential meeting around a multilateral summit next month and a visit to China early next year, details not included in the Chinese readout of their recent call. Perdue noted the "very good and very encouraging" relationship between the two leaders. A bipartisan US House delegation also discussed the meeting and TikTok ownership during their rare visit to Beijing, emphasizing the need for improved communication between the two countries' militaries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dr. Mike Freelander, a paediatrician with nearly 40 years of experience, strongly refutes claims linking paracetamol (Tylenol) use during pregnancy to autism, calling President Trump's recent comments "very worrying." He emphasizes that while autism is complex and increasing diagnoses reflect better detection, no scientific evidence supports a causal link, with the largest recent studies disproving it. Freelander stresses that paracetamol remains a safe and crucial medication for pregnant women, and alternative medications are less safe for the fetus. He urges trust in regulatory frameworks like Australia's TGA, which base advice on rigorous scientific evidence, warning against unscientific health policy.</p>

          <p>A BBC investigation has exposed an industrial-scale black market for Premier League tickets, where unauthorized resale websites exploit fans with exorbitant prices or non-functional tickets. James, a South Korean fan, traveled 5,500 miles to Brighton only to be turned away after paying £900 for a deactivated ticket. Brighton Football Club is actively combating this illegal practice using new technologies and a dedicated tickets investigation officer, blocking hundreds of touted tickets per match. The Premier League is also introducing encrypted barcodes for digital ticketing to make touting more difficult, aiming to protect genuine supporters from fraud.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore $500 million in federal grant funding to UCLA, ruling that the government likely violated the Administrative Procedure Act. The administration had frozen $584 million in grants over allegations of civil rights violations related to antisemitism and affirmative action, but provided only generalized explanations for the cuts. This ruling follows a previous order that restored $81 million in National Science Foundation grants to UCLA, with the judge finding the funding freeze amounted to illegal retaliation. The decision ensures the continuation of hundreds of critical medical research grants, including studies into Parkinson's disease treatment, cancer recovery, and cell regeneration.</p>

          <p>Modern football is increasingly adopting tactics championed by former manager Sam Allardyce, challenging the recent emphasis on possession-based play. Allardyce, known as "Big Sam," observes a return to direct football, utilizing big strikers for flick-ons and prioritizing forward passes, a style for which his Bolton Wanderers side was heavily criticized years ago. Coaches like PSG's Luis Enrique are even watching from the stands, a practice Allardyce pioneered for a better overview. The article highlights a shift away from playing out from the back due to "damaging stats" and a renewed focus on set-pieces, an area where Allardyce's Sunderland famously excelled.</p>

          <p>British-Egyptian activist Alaa Abdel Fattah has been released from prison and reunited with his family after nearly six years of detention in Egypt. One of the country's most prominent political prisoners, he was pardoned by President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi following a request from the National Council for Human Rights. Abdel Fattah was arrested in 2019 and convicted of "spreading false news," despite acquiring British citizenship in 2021 and facing a UN finding of arbitrary detention. His release, which his family had long campaigned for, including through extensive hunger strikes, marks a significant moment for human rights, though it remains unclear if he will be able to travel to the UK.</p>
