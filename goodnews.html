          <p>Paul McGinley, strategic adviser to European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald, believes a meticulous, data-driven approach can help Europe secure a rare away victory at Bethpage. Following a heavy defeat in 2021, the team has invested millions in preparation, utilizing analytics from vice-captain Edoardo Molinari, sports scientists, and even virtual reality to prepare for the hostile American crowd. The strategy emphasizes retaining experienced players who perform well on the road and maintaining consistent leadership with Donald's reappointment. McGinley asserts this is Europe's best-prepared team ever, focusing on marginal gains and detailed communication to overcome the significant challenge of winning on US soil.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man, has been awarded a $25 million settlement after spending 38 years in prison for a 1983 sexual assault and murder he did not commit. His conviction was overturned in 2022 after DNA evidence, which he had requested testing on as early as 2000, exonerated him and implicated another man, Kenneth Packnett, who died in prison in 2020. The lawsuit accused Inglewood police and a Los Angeles district attorney investigator of framing Hastings. This settlement is reportedly the largest wrongful conviction payout in California's history, highlighting a significant case of justice system failure and subsequent rectification.</p>

          <p>Sales of newly constructed homes in the U.S. saw a significant and unexpected increase of 20.5% in August, reaching their highest level since January 2022. This surge occurred despite mortgage rates being relatively high during the month, surprising many economists who noted the data's large margin of error. Analysts suggest that elevated incentives from homebuilders were a primary catalyst for the strong sales, as 39% of builders reported cutting prices in September. The strong demand reduced the inventory of new homes to a 7.4-month supply, down from a nine-month supply in July. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Multiple rare "pink meanie" jellyfish, known scientifically as Drymonema larsoni, have washed up along the Texas Gulf coast. These massive jellyfish, which can weigh over 50 pounds and have tentacles reaching up to 70 feet, are surprising beachgoers. Identified as a new species only in 2011, pink meanies primarily feed on the smaller, more common moon jellyfish, and their presence is often tied to large populations of their prey. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be mild, and their vibrant pink color, which gives them a "floating cotton candy" appearance in the water, tends to fade once they are on shore.</p>

          <p>In his daily market analysis, Jim Cramer identified Boeing as his "favorite stock" in the Investing Club's portfolio, citing recent positive developments. He noted a push from U.S. lawmakers for China to order Boeing aircraft and a new partnership with Palantir to integrate AI into its defense and space business. Cramer suggested that the stock's recent 10% pullback presents a good opportunity for investors to build a position. He also commented on the broader market, noting that rising bond yields continue to create headwinds for interest-rate-sensitive stocks like Home Depot. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The four astronauts selected for NASA's Artemis II mission, the first crewed flight to the Moon in over 50 years, expressed their excitement and sense of historic purpose. Commander Reid Wiseman stated the crew will "see things that no human has ever seen," and they have named their spacecraft "Integrity" to symbolize peace and hope. The crew, which includes the first woman (Christina Koch), the first Black person (Victor Glover), and the first non-American (Jeremy Hansen) to fly to the Moon, aims to inspire a new generation. NASA hopes to launch the mission, which will orbit the Moon without landing, as early as February 2026.</p>

          <p>Shares of Canadian mining company Lithium Americas surged by 100% following reports that the Trump administration is seeking an equity stake in the firm. The proposal comes as the company renegotiates a $2.2 billion Department of Energy loan for its Thacker Pass mine in Nevada, a major future source of lithium. An administration official stated that if loan repayments are deferred, the government wants a small equity stake to mitigate risk for taxpayers. This move reflects a broader White House strategy to secure direct ownership in supply chains for critical minerals essential for technologies like electric vehicle batteries.

          <p>Oregon police have exhumed the partial remains of a woman known as "Oak Grove Jane Doe," potentially advancing the state's oldest unidentified-person case. The woman's dismembered body was found in burlap sacks in the Willamette River in 1946, but critical evidence, including her remains, later went missing from police custody in the 1950s. Investigators recently learned the remains were likely interred at a local cemetery. Although degraded after nearly 80 years, authorities hope that advanced forensic testing can finally identify the victim, who was determined to be a middle-aged white woman who died from blunt-force trauma to the head.</p>

          <p>Kathleen Corradi, appointed by New York City Mayor Eric Adams in 2023 as the city's first-ever "rat czar," has resigned from her position. Corradi was tasked with tackling the city's infamous rodent problem, which is estimated to include about 3 million rats. During her tenure, she was given a $3.5 million budget for mitigation efforts, which included public awareness campaigns and the introduction of rat birth control. While the mayor's office praised her work and noted a 24% decrease in rat-related calls to the city's 311 service line in January, her resignation marks an end to this chapter in the ongoing war on rats.</p>

          <p>A wildfire near the north shore town of Paia on Maui prompted door-to-door evacuations and the activation of emergency sirens on Tuesday. The fire, which grew to over 100 acres, sparked fears of a repeat of the devastating 2023 Lahaina fire, which killed 102 people. Officials took proactive measures, but the threat from the blaze later receded, and evacuation orders were lifted by the end of the day. The response indicates a heightened level of caution from Maui authorities, who faced criticism for not activating sirens during the much more destructive Lahaina fire last year.</p>

This marks a significant increase for the photo-sharing app, which Meta acquired for $1 billion in 2012. The last publicly disclosed figure was 2 billion monthly users in October 2022, indicating substantial growth over the past few years. This achievement places Instagram in the same league as Meta's other flagship platforms, Facebook and WhatsApp, in terms of global user engagement. Meta now reports a combined daily active user count for its family of apps, which reached 3.48 billion in July.</p>
