          <p>President Trump is actively lobbying Senate Republicans to support the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," a massive tax bill that encompasses a significant portion of their legislative agenda. The White House plans an "all-out advocacy effort," involving top administration officials pressuring senators through direct contact and potential state visits. Key sticking points include concerns over the bill's cost and potential Medicaid cuts, with Trump assuring that only waste, fraud, and abuse would be targeted. With a narrow majority in both the House and Senate, Republicans are using reconciliation to pass the bill with a simple majority, necessitating adherence to the Byrd rule, which requires legislation to be directly related to deficit reduction. </p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is promoting his "Big, Beautiful Bill" as a solution to what he describes as four years of failures under former President Joe Biden. Trump claims the bill will balance the budget through spending cuts, provide tax cuts, unleash American energy, improve air travel, and secure the border. He asserts the bill will end funding for "sick sex changes for minors" and repeal Biden's EV mandate. The bill is currently in the Senate after passing in the House, and Trump is urging Republicans to pass it before July 4, while Democrats are criticizing the bill, arguing that there will be cuts to Social Security, Medicare or Medicaid. </p>

Carney outlined his plan after a meeting with provincial and territorial leaders, aiming to approve "nation-building" projects like pipelines, nuclear reactors, and trade corridors within two years. The goal is to strengthen Canada's economy and autonomy in the face of U.S. trade policies. Carney criticized the latest tariffs as "unjustified and unlawful," and Canada's minister for US-Canada trade will resume trade talks in the U.S. </p>

          <p>South Koreans are participating in a snap election to choose a new president following the ouster of Yoon Suk Yeol, who faced rebellion charges over his imposition of martial law. Pre-election surveys suggest Yoon's liberal rival, Lee Jae-myung, is likely to win due to public frustration with conservatives. The new president will immediately be sworn in for a single five-year term, facing challenges including a slowing economy, U.S. trade policies, and North Korea's nuclear threats. Lee has advocated for patience regarding U.S. tariff policy, while Kim has expressed a desire to meet with President Trump as soon as possible. </p>

The review also suggests a military "gap year" for over-18s, but Starmer has ruled out national service, offering a paid year to teach school-leavers about the military instead. </p>
