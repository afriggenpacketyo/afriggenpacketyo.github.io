          <h2>Book Review Argues 1979 Iranian Revolution Was a Product of Contingency, Not Inevitability</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," posits that the 1979 Iranian Revolution was not a predetermined historical event but rather an accident shaped by specific actions and miscalculations. The article reviews Anderson's work, which focuses on the shah's hubris, the U.S. government's ignorance and inaction, and Ayatollah Khomeini's strategic maneuvering. Anderson argues against grand theories, instead presenting a narrative of contingency where a "freakish convergence of circumstances" allowed a theocratic dictatorship to emerge. The review praises this approach for offering a more instructive understanding of how the Islamic Republic came to power and has endured.</p>

          <p>This market report analyzes recent stock movements, noting that Amazon shares are recovering slightly after a 10% drop post-earnings, which was driven by concerns over its cloud computing competitiveness. The analysis suggests Amazon needs to invest more in Nvidia chips to bolster its cloud division against rivals like Google and OpenAI. The article also looks ahead to Walt Disney's upcoming earnings report, with hopes for continued strength in its theme parks and profitability in its streaming division.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 11:18:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether purchasing an annuity is a sound financial decision for a 70-year-old, weighing the benefits of guaranteed lifetime income against the drawbacks. For healthy individuals with a long life expectancy, buying an annuity later in life can result in higher monthly payments. However, the illiquidity of the principal, high fees, and potential for not recouping the investment if one's health is poor are significant risks. The optimal time to buy depends on individual circumstances, but many advisors suggest the "sweet spot" is between 70 and 75. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh, announced that the country will hold general elections in February 2026. This will be the first election since a widespread popular uprising led to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government in the previous year. In a broadcast marking the one-year anniversary of Hasina's removal, Yunus confirmed his caretaker government would request the Chief Election Commissioner to arrange the vote. He also stated his intention to step down and transfer power to an elected government following the election.</p>

The SQA also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. While most students received their results on time, mail deliveries to some island communities were delayed by Storm Floris. Education Secretary Jenny Gilruth called the results "very positive," noting a return to pre-pandemic performance levels and a record number of university and college placements.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime rates in the United States decreased across every category in 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decline in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a historic 18.6% drop. While experts note this continues a downward trend from post-pandemic highs, they also caution that aggravated assaults remain elevated and that the data only reflects crimes reported to police.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and a strong second-quarter performance that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The company's revenue was boosted by better-than-expected sales of its Covid products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, as well as other key drugs. The positive outlook comes as the company navigates President Trump's calls for lower drug prices and potential tariffs. Pfizer's CEO confirmed the company is in "extremely productive" discussions with the administration to find solutions that balance affordability and industry competitiveness.
