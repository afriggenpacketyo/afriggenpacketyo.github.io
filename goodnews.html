        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the origins of the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which clarifies the procedures for presidential succession and disability. It highlights the efforts of lawyer John Feerick, who recognized a critical gap in the Constitution following President Eisenhower's health scares and before John F. Kennedy's assassination. Feerick championed the cause, leading to the amendment's ratification, which provides a clear framework for what happens if a president is unable to serve. The discussion provides essential context for understanding the continuity of power in the United States government.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom's economy grew by a surprising 0.3% in the second quarter, exceeding economists' expectations of a 0.1% expansion. This growth was primarily driven by a strong performance in the services sector, particularly in computer programming and health, alongside an increase in construction. Despite this positive data, economists express caution, suggesting the momentum is unlikely to continue due to a softening labor market and persistent inflation pressures. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates to 4% in a finely balanced decision reflecting these competing economic signals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's highest court has rejected a copyright infringement claim against The Pinkfong Company, creators of the viral hit song "Baby Shark." U.S. composer Jonathan Wright had alleged that the 2015 song copied his 2011 version, but the court upheld previous rulings stating that Wright's rendition was not original enough to warrant copyright protection. The court found that both versions are based on a traditional American children's camp chant that is in the public domain. Pinkfong's "Baby Shark" has become a global phenomenon, amassing over 16 billion views on YouTube.</p>

          <p>The NBA's Board of Governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record-breaking $6.1 billion. This figure marks the largest price ever paid for an American professional sports team, surpassing the $6.05 billion sale of the NFL's Washington Commanders. The transaction, which is expected to close soon, will see Chisholm's group acquire at least 51% of the team, with a path to full control that could value the franchise at $7.3 billion by 2028.</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of BTecs, which are practical, vocational qualifications in the UK offered as an alternative to traditional academic routes like A-levels and GCSEs. It explains the different levels, with BTec Firsts being equivalent to GCSEs and BTec Nationals equivalent to A-levels, and details the grading system of Pass, Merit, Distinction, and Starred Distinction. The piece also touches on recent government policy changes, where plans to defund many BTecs in favor of new T-levels were paused, securing funding for many key vocational courses until at least 2026.</p>

          <p>Startup Voltify is developing a system to help the $80-billion U.S. freight railroad industry transition from diesel to battery power. The company's solution involves 'VoltCars,' which are essentially large sodium-ion batteries on wheels that can connect to existing locomotives, providing a rechargeable power source. Co-founder Daphna Langer believes this can save rail companies billions in fuel costs and significantly reduce emissions without disrupting current operations. Voltify is in active talks with major railroad companies and is set to run a demonstration project later this year, aiming to decarbonize the industry within a decade.</p>

          <p>A recent survey indicates a growing trend of 'bleisure' travel, with 55% of business travelers admitting to having family, friends, or partners join them on work trips. This practice is even more common among C-suite executives, with 73% participating. Motivations for this trend include combating loneliness, saving money on personal travel by sharing accommodation costs, and creating opportunities for family vacations. While many companies are accepting of this practice as long as work is not compromised and expenses are clearly separated, some employees remain hesitant to broadcast their plans for fear of appearing unprofessional.</p>

          <p>The Nant Conwy rugby club in north Wales is celebrating the selection of two pairs of sisters for Wales' 2025 Rugby World Cup squad. Sisters Nel and Branwen Metcalfe will join sisters Gwenllian and Alaw Pyrs in the national team, a remarkable achievement for a single grassroots club. For the Metcalfe sisters, it will be a new experience playing together at the senior level, as the younger Branwen is captain of the U-20s and has yet to make her senior debut. The players credit the tight-knit community and supportive ethos of their home club for their success.</p>

          <h2>Gallup Poll Shows American Alcohol Consumption at a Record Low</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a new Gallup poll, the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has dropped to 54%, a record low since the firm began tracking the data in 1939. This decline corresponds with a growing public perception that even moderate drinking is unhealthy, a view particularly prevalent among younger adults aged 18 to 34. Experts suggest that increased awareness of health risks, the social acceptability of not drinking, and financial pressures are contributing factors. The poll also noted a significant drop in alcohol use among women and differing preferences for beer and wine between genders.</p>

          <p>China's Xiluodu dam, the country's third-largest hydropower station, has replaced foreign-made programmable logic controllers (PLCs) in its core industrial control systems with domestically produced alternatives. The move to swap out chips from Western companies like Siemens and Schneider Electric reflects growing national security concerns over the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks. This strategic shift is part of a broader effort by Beijing to achieve technological self-sufficiency and secure its industrial systems from potential foreign interference or sabotage, a concern highlighted by past cyberattacks like the Stuxnet virus.</p>
