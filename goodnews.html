          <p>Disney revealed its intention to construct a new theme park and resort in Abu Dhabi, marking its first venture in the Middle East and seventh park globally. The agreement was reached with Abu Dhabi-based Miral, with the park planned for Yas Island, already home to attractions like Ferrari World and Warner Bros. World. The attraction aims to blend Disney's signature entertainment with the cultural essence of Abu Dhabi, targeting visitors from the Middle East, Africa, and Asia.

          <p>A United States Navy fighter jet went overboard while attempting to land on the aircraft carrier Harry S. Truman in the Red Sea, marking the second such incident in two weeks. According to the United States Central Command, the aircraft's arrestment system failed, causing the jet to fall into the water. Both pilots ejected and sustained minor injuries, and were rescued by a helicopter. The accident occurred amid ongoing tensions in the region, including Houthi attacks on commercial and military ships, although officials confirmed the jet was not struck by the Houthis.

          <p>Experts predict a slight decrease in federal student loan interest rates for the 2025-2026 academic year. The interest rate for federal direct undergraduate loans could drop to 6.39%, down from 6.53% in the 2024-2025 year. Graduate students may also see a decrease, with rates potentially falling to 7.94% from the current 8.08%. The government sets these rates annually, basing them partly on the May auction of the 10-year Treasury note.</p>

          <p>The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, a key indicator of used car prices, saw a significant increase in April, reaching its highest level since October 2023. Cox Automotive reports that this 4.9% year-over-year jump is attributed to consumers rushing to purchase vehicles amid concerns over price increases due to auto tariffs. While the tariffs don't directly affect used car sales, they influence new vehicle prices, impacting the used car market. Retail used-vehicle sales decreased slightly from March but remain higher year-over-year, with average listing prices exceeding $25,000.</p>

          <p>During a traffic stop in central Ohio, police encountered a pet raccoon named "Chewy" with a glass methamphetamine pipe in its mouth, sitting in the driver's seat of the pulled-over car. A thorough search of the vehicle led to the discovery of methamphetamine, crack cocaine, and additional used methamphetamine pipes. The vehicle was stopped due to the registered owner having an active warrant and a suspended driver's license, leading to the arrest of 55-year-old Victoria Vidal on drug possession and paraphernalia charges. The raccoon was unharmed, and the owner had the required permits to legally own the animal.</p>
