          <p>Venture capitalist Peter Thiel's firm, Founders Fund, has acquired a 9% stake in Bitmine Immersion Technologies, a company focusing on an ether treasury strategy. This disclosure led to a significant surge in Bitmine's stock, with shares climbing as much as 29%. The investment has also positively impacted other companies in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as SharpLink Gaming and Bit Digital, which saw their own stock prices rise. This trend reflects growing investor interest in Ethereum-related assets, bolstered by recent developments like Robinhood's expansion of tokenized stock trading in Europe and progress on stablecoin legislation in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>United Airlines has issued a revised earnings forecast for 2025, now expecting adjusted earnings between $9 and $11 per share, aligning with analyst expectations. This update comes after the airline's second-quarter earnings surpassed estimates, signaling a recovery in travel demand after a slow start to the year. CEO Scott Kirby expressed confidence in a strong finish to 2025, stating the world feels "less uncertain." The airline's performance was slightly hampered by operational issues at its Newark hub, but the overall outlook suggests a stabilizing environment for the travel industry.</p>

          <h2>Cryptocurrency Market Rallies on Renewed Hope for US Stablecoin Legislation</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cryptocurrency market experienced a significant rally, with Bitcoin and Ether prices climbing, following the advancement of key crypto regulation bills in the U.S. House. Prices had dipped previously when the bills, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, were temporarily stalled. The renewed momentum came after President Trump indicated that several Republican lawmakers had reversed their opposition following a White House meeting. This legislative progress has injected optimism into the market, boosting shares of related companies like Circle and Coinbase, and further fueling the recent surge in ether-related stocks.

          <p>India's women's cricket team defeated England by four wickets in the first one-day international match in Southampton. Chasing a target of 259 runs, India was guided to victory by all-rounder Deepti Sharma's crucial unbeaten score of 62. Despite a late-game effort from England that created some tension, India successfully reached their target with 10 balls remaining. For England, the loss highlighted issues with their fielding and a failure to capitalize on a strong batting performance from Sophia Dunkley, who scored 83 runs. The result is significant as both teams prepare for the upcoming World Cup.</p>

          <p>Veteran NBA guard Bradley Beal is reportedly signing with the Los Angeles Clippers following a contract buyout with the Phoenix Suns. The three-time All-Star is expected to agree to a two-year, $11 million deal, which includes a player option for the second year. This move adds another significant offensive player to the Clippers' roster, which already features stars like Kawhi Leonard and James Harden. Beal's two-season tenure with the Suns was hampered by injuries and team struggles, leading to the mutual agreement to part ways and allowing him to join a Western Conference rival.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is receiving accolades for his strategic handling of US-China relations, which has resulted in the US government granting licenses for the company to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese customers. The White House had previously tightened export rules, but reversed its decision after months of lobbying by Huang, who argued that excluding Nvidia from the Chinese market would harm American tech leadership. This diplomatic success has been hailed by market analysts as a demonstration of Huang's skill as a statesman and CEO. The move allows Nvidia to regain access to a critical market, reinforcing its position as a global tech powerhouse. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ), based in The Hague, serves as the principal judicial body of the United Nations, tasked with settling legal disputes between member states. Comprised of 15 judges from different countries, the court's rulings are legally binding on the parties involved, though it lacks direct enforcement power. Its jurisdiction applies when states agree to submit to it, either through a general declaration or on a case-by-case basis. The ICJ also hears cases based on specific UN treaties, such as the Genocide Convention, which has been invoked in recent cases involving Ukraine, Myanmar, and Israel.</p>

          <p>A sprawling 112-acre equestrian property known as the Robert Taylor Ranch has been listed for sale in Brentwood, Los Angeles, for $70 million. It is the largest residential estate to be publicly marketed in the city in decades. The property features a 12,000-square-foot main house designed in 1950 by architect Robert Byrd, along with several other structures. Originally built for an oil baron and later owned by actors Robert Taylor and Barbara Stanwyck, the ranch has a rich Hollywood history. The current owner undertook a four-year remodel, and the vast property's future is uncertain, with potential for either preservation or subdivision.</p>

          <p>A recent survey by the US-China Business Council reveals that a majority of American companies operating in China still consider the market essential for their global competitiveness. This sentiment persists despite facing challenges from frayed bilateral relations, tariffs, and a weaker Chinese economy. The survey, which included about 130 large US corporations, found that while leaving China is not a viable option for most, fewer than half are optimistic about the future. Persistent concerns over policy uncertainty, trade barriers, and insufficient domestic demand in China are tempering their outlook.</p>
