          <p>Hurricane Humberto, now a Category 2 storm, is weakening over the Atlantic but continues to generate dangerous conditions. The National Hurricane Center warns of life-threatening surf and rip currents affecting the northern Caribbean, Bahamas, Bermuda, and much of the U.S. East Coast for several days. The storm, which briefly reached Category 5 strength, is forecast to pass west of Bermuda before becoming an extratropical system. Forecasters are also monitoring Hurricane Imelda in the same region.</p>

          <p>Imelda has intensified into the ninth named hurricane of the 2025 Atlantic season and is currently moving away from the Bahamas and the southeastern U.S. The storm is on a path toward Bermuda, where a hurricane watch is now in effect. While not expected to make landfall in the U.S., swells generated by Imelda and the weakening Hurricane Humberto are causing life-threatening surf and rip currents along the East Coast. Forecasters noted the two storms are unlikely to merge in a rare Fujiwhara effect.</p>

          <p>Hamas and other Palestinian factions are reportedly leaning toward accepting a U.S.-led proposal to end the war in Gaza, with a formal response expected soon. The 20-point plan, presented by President Trump and Israeli PM Netanyahu, calls for a ceasefire, the release of all hostages and numerous Palestinian prisoners, and the establishment of an interim technocratic administration in Gaza. The plan has garnered support from the Palestinian Authority and several key Muslim-majority nations, who welcomed the effort to end the conflict and rebuild the devastated territory. International bodies like the U.N. and European Council have also expressed encouragement for the peace initiative.</p>

This move is a key part of the company's strategy to make retail its primary channel for selling its used fleet, which could improve resale values and profitability. The initiative, promoted by a new ad campaign with Tom Brady, aims to modernize the customer experience and support Hertz's ongoing business turnaround. The company has been recovering since its 2020 bankruptcy and recently reported its best quarterly earnings in nearly two years.</p>

          <p>Former unified world champion boxer Amir Khan is transitioning into a new role as a promoter, staging a major professional boxing event in Lagos, Nigeria. The event, titled "Chaos in the Ring," is part of Khan's effort to develop boxing in what he calls the "untouched market" of Africa, following a similar event in Ghana. Khan aims to use his extensive experience as a top-tier fighter to build trustworthy shows, with a key theme being to provide fighters of African heritage the opportunity to compete in their ancestral homelands. He acknowledges the challenges of promotion but plans to grow the sport in Africa and the Middle East.</p>

          <p>Health officials in the U.K. report that two new COVID-19 strains, nicknamed Stratus and Nimbus, are now the most common circulating variants, leading to an increase in cases. Experts state that these variants do not appear to cause more severe illness than previous strains, though some reports mention a distinct "razor blade" sore throat as a symptom. The genetic changes may make the virus more transmissible, and hospital admissions are rising, particularly among the very young and elderly. Health agencies are urging eligible individuals, especially those over 75, to get vaccinated to protect against the new variants ahead of the winter season.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase is actively working to integrate artificial intelligence into every aspect of its operations, with the goal of becoming a "fully AI-connected enterprise." The bank has developed a platform called LLM Suite, which harnesses models from OpenAI and Anthropic to automate tasks, assist employees, and curate client experiences. A demonstration showed the AI creating a complex investment banking presentation in seconds, a task that would normally take a team of analysts hours to complete. This strategic rewiring could significantly boost productivity and change the nature of corporate labor, potentially displacing roles focused on rote processes while empowering client-facing employees.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The author describes a personal journey from identifying as a "cultural Jew," with a superficial understanding of the faith, to discovering the depth and intellectual rigor of Jewish tradition. Initially embarrassed by Judaism's laws and what was perceived as an outdated concept of God, the author began studying Jewish texts and found a rich history of debate, analysis, and diverse theological ideas. The essay argues that a shallow, assimilated Jewish identity is often a product of centuries of anti-Semitism and a desire to conform to a Christian-majority culture. Reclaiming a fuller knowledge of Jewish history and tradition is presented as an empowering way to combat modern anti-Semitism.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal has been reached for a group of U.S. investors to take over TikTok's operations in the country, averting a ban. The new entity, valued at $14 billion, will reportedly be controlled by investors including Oracle, Rupert Murdoch, and Michael Dell, with Americans holding a majority of board seats. A key part of the deal is that the new company will control a new algorithm, retrained on U.S. user data, while ByteDance would retain less than 20% ownership. While Trump claims Chinese President Xi Jinping has approved the deal, Beijing has been more reserved, stating it respects commercial negotiations that comply with its laws.</p>

          <p>Qatar's prime minister has confirmed the country will continue its mediation efforts in the Gaza war after receiving a formal expression of regret from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In a call hosted by President Trump, Netanyahu conveyed his regret for an Israeli airstrike in Doha that killed a Qatari security officer and violated the nation's sovereignty, affirming such an attack would not happen again. The strike, which targeted Hamas leaders, had previously been called "fully justified" by Netanyahu but had drawn fury from Qatar and criticism from the U.S. This diplomatic reset is aimed at putting relations back on track to facilitate peace negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent move by Britain, Canada, Australia, and other nations to formally recognize a Palestinian state is more than just symbolic; it represents a direct challenge to the Israeli settler right's agenda. For decades, the settler movement has aimed to create "facts on the ground" by building outposts to make a contiguous Palestinian state impossible. However, this international recognition asserts that the two-state solution cannot be unilaterally erased by settlements, as a border can be drawn by international consensus regardless of who lives there. This sets the stage for a future clash where the world may refuse to accept Israel's de facto annexation of the West Bank.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The president of Princeton University pushes back against the common narrative that current college students are fragile "snowflakes" who are intolerant of opposing views. He argues that genuine disruptions of free speech on campus are rare and often sensationalized, while peaceful protests are themselves a valid form of expression. The author contends that polls measuring students' "comfort" with controversial topics use the wrong metric, as intellectual engagement should be challenging and uncomfortable. The real issue, he suggests, is not a problem unique to campuses but a reflection of America's broader societal problem with polarization and an inability to engage in constructive dialogue.</p>
