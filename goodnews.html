          <p>For the fifth consecutive year, British firms operating in China are reporting a more challenging business environment, citing regulatory opacity, rising compliance costs, and geopolitical uncertainties. The British Chamber of Commerce in China is advocating for clearer and consistently enforced regulations to improve the situation. Despite these difficulties, British companies remain committed to the Chinese market, though confidence in China's long-term outlook is waning due to escalating tensions between China and the US, causing investment delays. The trend reflects structural and geopolitical concerns beyond the pandemic's initial disruptions.</p>

          <p>Japan's Farm Minister Taku Eto resigned after facing criticism for a comment about receiving rice from supporters, which was seen as insensitive given rising rice prices. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba appointed Shinjiro Koizumi as the new agriculture minister. Japan also reported a trade deficit in April due to exports failing to offset imports. Meanwhile, G7 finance leaders aim to maintain stability despite tensions over U.S. tariffs, and Japan plans to offer fast-track entry for South Koreans in June to commemorate the anniversary of diplomatic ties.</p>

          <p>Indian writer Banu Mushtaq has won the International Booker Prize for her short story anthology, 'Heart Lamp,' becoming the first Kannada language writer to receive the award. Translated into English by Deepa Bhasthi, the stories poignantly depict the hardships of Muslim women in southern India. Mushtaq's work reflects challenges faced by women due to religious conservatism and patriarchal societal structures. Her win is expected to encourage more translations from Kannada and other South Asian languages, following Geetanjali Shree's win in 2022.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delaware Governor Matt Meyer signed a bill into law legalizing physician-assisted suicide for terminally ill patients, making it the 11th state with such a statute. The End-of-Life Options Act allows mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and six months or less to live to request a prescription to end their lives. The law requires patients to be presented with other end-of-life care options and mandates two waiting periods and a second medical opinion. Meyer emphasized that the measure is about compassion, dignity, and respect for personal choice.</p>

          <p>During a Senate hearing, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem incorrectly defined habeas corpus as the president's "constitutional right" to deport people, rather than the right of individuals to challenge unlawful detention. Senator Maggie Hassan corrected Noem's definition, emphasizing that habeas corpus is a legal principle requiring the government to provide a reason for detaining individuals. The Trump administration has considered suspending habeas corpus for detained migrants, a move legal experts say can only be done by Congress. Noem stated that Trump has never communicated plans to suspend habeas corpus to her.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has decided to pause its scheme to pay out significant bonuses to senior executives, following public and governmental criticism. The company's "retention scheme" was set to amount to 50% of senior bosses' pay packets, potentially adding ¬£1 million on top of their salaries. This decision comes after Downing Street deemed it unacceptable for bosses at the troubled firm to reward themselves for failure.

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 4-3 walk-off victory against the Arizona Diamondbacks after a rollercoaster game. Yoshinobu Yamamoto pitched seven shutout innings, but the bullpen faltered, allowing Arizona to tie and then take the lead in extra innings. However, the Dodgers rallied in the bottom of the 10th, with Tommy Edman driving in a run, Will Smith tying the game with a bases-loaded hit by pitch, and Max Muncy delivering the game-winning sacrifice fly. The win prevents a season-long losing streak and sets up a series rubber match.</p>

          <p>The first blood test to aid in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease will be available in the U.S. starting in late June, following regulatory clearance. Developed by Fujirebio Holdings, the test detects amyloid, a protein that builds up in the brain and is a hallmark of Alzheimer's, and will initially be available at specialized research institutes and hospitals. The blood test is expected to be a less expensive and invasive alternative to PET scans and cerebrospinal fluid tests, potentially improving access to new Alzheimer's treatments.
