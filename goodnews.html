          <p>Top economic officials from the United States and China met in Geneva for high-stakes negotiations aimed at easing tensions stemming from President Trump‚Äôs trade war, which has involved tariffs disrupting global supply chains. Trump has imposed a minimum tariff of 145 percent on all Chinese imports, while China has hit American products with a 125 percent import tax. Despite Trump hailing the initial conversations as a success, economists remain skeptical about a quick deal, warning that the trade dispute will slow global growth and fuel inflation. The article suggests that while Trump may tout any concessions made by China as a win, significant challenges remain in reaching a comprehensive agreement.</p>

          <p>A discussion about doomsday prepping in America reveals that about half of Americans engage in some kind of preparedness for adverse events, according to a 2023 FEMA survey. The article explores the reasons behind this phenomenon, arguing that prepping is an American institution rooted in self-sufficiency and a lack of reliance on government support. While the ultra-rich often engage in conspicuous consumption through extravagant preparation plans, prepping is also prevalent among the middle class due to ongoing extreme weather events and a perceived inadequate state response. The article considers the political implications of individual versus collective approaches to confronting disasters.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An increasing number of parents are building their family lives around friends, seeking support in a country that lacks structural support for families. One couple moved to be next door to their best friends, creating a village where they could lean on one another for child care and their children could roam among houses. This arrangement provides the support of an extended family but through chosen connections. The article explores the challenges and benefits of such setups, noting that while they require coordination and can lead to conflicts, they also offer much-needed support and deeper friendships.</p>

          <p>British plane parts are expected to be exempted from US import tariffs as part of a trade agreement with the Trump administration. US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick indicated that engines from Rolls-Royce and similar plane parts would be able to enter the US market without tariffs. The UK businesses secretary confirmed that the wider aerospace industry would have ‚Äúa specific guarantee of zero tariffs‚Äù in the agreement, providing certainty to a ¬£40bn sector supporting 450,000 jobs in the UK. The deal also benefits the US, as Boeing imports Rolls-Royce engines for its commercial airliners.</p>

          <p>A New York Times article delves into the impact of sibling relationships on personal development, drawing from research indicating that siblings often mold each other's personalities. The phenomenon known as the ‚Äúsibling spillover effect‚Äù is particularly powerful in disadvantaged families. While birth order psychology may not hold up in studies, younger siblings are sometimes more competitive athletes. The article highlights that parents can be poor judges of their own kids, and genetic inclinations elicit responses from the world that shape personalities.</p>
