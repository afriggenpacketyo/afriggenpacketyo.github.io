          <p>Tadej Pogačar is set to win his fourth Tour de France title after safely navigating the penultimate stage and maintaining his substantial overall lead. While Australian sprinter Kaden Groves celebrated his first-ever stage victory after a solo attack, all eyes were on Pogačar, who finished with the main group of riders. With only the final, traditionally processional stage into Paris remaining, the 26-year-old Slovenian's overall victory is considered secure, barring any unforeseen incidents. His performance solidifies his dominance in the world of professional cycling.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris claimed pole position for the Belgian Grand Prix in a thrilling qualifying session, narrowly beating his teammate Oscar Piastri by just 0.085 seconds. The result pushed championship leader Max Verstappen of Red Bull down to fourth place after he made errors on his final lap. The session saw a major upset as Lewis Hamilton was eliminated in the first round due to a track limits violation, leaving him to start in 16th. Norris's performance sets up an exciting race, with rain predicted, which could add another layer of unpredictability.</p>

She was impressed by the vast selection of traditional Japanese foods, including a wide variety of seaweed, diverse soy-based products like freeze-dried tofu, and seasonal local produce. The article also notes the availability of healthier ready-to-eat meals, traditional rice crackers, and an extensive range of green tea products. The author wishes U.S. stores would carry more of these culturally specific and nutritious items.</p>

          <p>Christopher Kennedy, a 75-year-old man, is recovering after a successful double-lung transplant, a procedure he received after a terminal disease was discovered by chance during a routine X-ray. Diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), a progressive and fatal lung scarring condition, Kennedy was given less than a year to live before the transplant option was offered. Despite his age and initial hesitation, he underwent the surgery at the Cleveland Clinic and is now recovering well, with his lung capacity at 98%. His journey highlights the unpredictable nature of disease and the profound impact of organ donation.</p>

          <p>According to sources, Washington and Beijing are actively working to arrange a visit to China for U.S. President Donald Trump in the autumn, though a previously rumored September trip is off the table. Discussions are reportedly focused on dates in October or November, potentially before or after the APEC summit in South Korea. The potential for a high-level meeting was bolstered by a recent 'better than expected' meeting between the two nations' top diplomats in Kuala Lumpur. Hurdles remain, but the ongoing dialogue signals a mutual interest in stabilizing the complex relationship between the two global powers.</p>

          <p>A provision in the recently passed 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' has made a key student loan repayment benefit permanent, encouraging more employers to help their workers with educational debt. The law solidifies the tax-free status of employer contributions up to $5,250 annually toward an employee's student loans, a measure first introduced temporarily in the CARES Act. Financial wellness professionals believe this certainty will lead to wider adoption of the benefit, which is seen as a critical tool for attracting and retaining talent in a workforce burdened by nearly $2 trillion in student debt.

Krynina visits prison camps, records interviews, and facilitates calls, providing proof of life that is often hard to obtain from Russian authorities.

          <p>In a significant move in the global tech race, China has released its own action plan for artificial intelligence just days after a similar announcement from the U.S. The plan calls for international cooperation on AI development and regulation, with Premier Li Qiang proposing a new global AI organization at a conference in Shanghai. This approach is seen as a counter to the U.S. strategy of building alliances with its allies, effectively creating two distinct camps in the field of AI. China emphasized its willingness to help other nations, particularly in the Global South, integrate AI across various industries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Justin Bieber's surprise new album, 'Swag,' is being hailed as a potential soundtrack for the summer, reflecting a more reserved and melancholic cultural mood. The album's lead single, 'Daisies,' which debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100, departs from his past pop sound for a more aqueous, R&B-influenced style. Critics note the album's production is muffled and gentle, creating a sound that is soothing rather than energetic, aligning with a trend towards more downtempo and introspective music. This shift is seen as a successful artistic evolution for Bieber and a fitting response to the current cultural zeitgeist.</p>

          <p>Brazil is scaling up a novel public health strategy by releasing millions of specially bred mosquitoes to combat the spread of dengue and other viruses. These 'Wolbitos,' engineered by the nonprofit World Mosquito Program, carry a bacterium called Wolbachia which prevents them from transmitting diseases like dengue, Zika, and chikungunya. A pilot program in the city of Niterói saw a roughly 90% drop in dengue cases, prompting the Brazilian government to invest in a massive new factory capable of producing billions of the modified insects. The goal is to protect 140 million Brazilians over the next decade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, taking just 30 seconds to prepare before even casual conversations can significantly improve their quality and make you more influential. This brief moment of forethought allows you to consider topics, questions, and goals before your brain becomes occupied with the cognitive load of real-time interaction, such as listening and formulating responses. By brainstorming beforehand, you can appear more prepared, considerate, and present during the chat. This simple strategy can help build stronger relationships and enhance communication skills in both personal and professional settings.</p>

Ten women, who all achieved high scores on their university entrance exams, were accepted into the prestigious military institution. The academy, founded in 1953, is responsible for training the personnel who operate China's fleet of nuclear and conventional submarines. This historic move marks a significant, albeit small, step towards gender integration within one of the most demanding branches of the Chinese military.</p>

          <p>Tennis superstar Venus Williams recently joked that she returned to competition 'for the insurance,' a comment that resonated widely and shed light on the challenges of the U.S. healthcare system. As an athlete with an on-and-off work schedule and pre-existing health conditions, Williams' situation exemplifies how difficult it can be to secure consistent, affordable coverage when not actively employed. The article explains concepts like COBRA, which allows individuals to keep their employer's plan but at a much higher personal cost. Her experience serves as a relatable, high-profile example of the 'job lock' many Americans face due to health insurance being tied to employment.</p>

From his rough childhood and founding of the pioneering heavy metal band Black Sabbath to being fired for his excesses, he forged a massively successful solo career. He later found a surprising second act as a beloved, bumbling father on the reality show 'The Osbournes,' revealing a softer side to his 'Prince of Darkness' persona.
