          <p>This article explores the growing trend of food products with fewer ingredients, driven by increasing consumer concern about ultra-processed foods (UPF). Retailers and brands are responding to the demand for simpler, more recognizable ingredient lists. However, nutritionists caution against the idea that all UPFs are unhealthy, noting that some processing is necessary for food safety and nutrition. The article examines the debate around UPFs and the potential implications for public health and the food industry.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum communication technology in a space flight, marking a step towards building a secure, encryption-free communication network. A laser module and phase encoding device were tested on a rocket reaching 2.5km to assess their robustness against space travel conditions. This test is part of China's efforts to establish a space-air-ground quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) network. QSDC is considered a highly secure method of communication, sending messages directly through a quantum channel without the need for encryption keys.</p>
