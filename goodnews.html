          <p>This article provides a comprehensive breakdown of President Trump's 20-point plan, initially proposed to end the Israel-Hamas war, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has endorsed. The framework outlines an immediate ceasefire, the release of all Israeli hostages by Hamas within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from parts of the Gaza Strip. It envisions a "technocratic, apolitical Palestinian committee" for governance and an "International Stabilization Force" supported by the U.S. and Arab nations for security. The plan also addresses humanitarian aid, economic redevelopment, and recognizes Palestinian statehood as an "aspiration," while explicitly excluding Hamas from future governance. This article offers crucial context for understanding the recently announced "first phase" of the peace deal.</p>
