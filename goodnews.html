          <p>The British government has confirmed significant changes to its proposed welfare bill after facing a potential defeat from over 100 of its own Labour backbench MPs. Work and Pensions Secretary Liz Kendall announced that planned cuts to the Personal Independence Payment (Pip) and Universal Credit's health element will now only apply to future claimants, protecting current recipients. This major concession aims to secure the bill's passage by appeasing rebels who were concerned about the impact on vulnerable individuals.

          <p>A very bright meteorite, or fireball, was witnessed across the southeastern U.S. in broad daylight before exploding over Georgia, creating a sonic boom heard by many residents. NASA reported that the object, estimated to be three feet in diameter and weigh over a ton, entered the atmosphere at 30,000 miles per hour. The explosion released energy equivalent to about 20 tons of TNT. The American Meteor Society received over 160 reports of the rare daylight event, which may have been part of the Beta Taurid meteor shower, from observers in several states.</p>

          <p>A single block in Chelsea, Massachusetts, is serving as an "urban laboratory" for solutions to the Urban Heat Island effect, where dense development can make neighborhoods dangerously hot. An environmental group, GreenRoots, in partnership with the city, has implemented a "cool block" by planting over 100 trees, resurfacing the street with lighter colors, and painting rooftops white to reflect heat. This initiative provides a potential template for other cities as climate change intensifies heat waves. Research shows such green infrastructure can reduce peak urban temperatures, offering a vital tool for protecting vulnerable communities.</p>
