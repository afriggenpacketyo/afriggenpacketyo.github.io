          <p>This article recounts the harrowing experience of Michelle Renee, a California bank manager, who along with her daughter and roommate, was kidnapped and forced to rob her own bank in 2000. The perpetrators strapped fake dynamite to them, threatening their lives if she failed to comply. Renee's detailed memory helped investigators identify and arrest the culprits, including Christopher Butler, a convicted felon. Despite overwhelming evidence, Renee faced intense scrutiny and was treated like a criminal during the trial of Butler and his accomplice, Lisa Ramirez, who was acquitted, highlighting the challenges victims face in the justice system. Ultimately, Butler was denied parole in 2024 after recanting his lies about Renee's involvement.</p>

          <p>This Fox News article reports on a study that reveals a link between dog owners who ruminate about work stress and increased stress-related behaviors in their dogs. The research found that owners who mentally take work home are more likely to have stressed-out dogs, even when accounting for other stressors in the home. This phenomenon, known as "crossover," suggests that dogs are sensitive to their owners' moods and changes in care routines. The article emphasizes the importance of separating work from home life to protect the well-being of pets.</p>

The case involved a custody battle for Jason's children, Jack and Sarah, who eventually returned to Ireland with Lynch.

          <p>This article discusses Prime Minister Mark Carney's invitation to King Charles III to deliver the Speech from the Throne in Canada. The move is seen as a statement of Canada's sovereignty and independence against perceived threats from US President Donald Trump. The visit is a rare occurrence and marks a shift from previous Liberal governments. The invitation is intended to underscore Canada's distinct identity and traditions, despite a large portion of the population being indifferent to the monarchy.</p>

          <h2>Billy Joel Cancels Tour Dates After Diagnosis of Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-24 19:23:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reports that Billy Joel has canceled his summer tour dates due to a diagnosis of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), a brain condition affecting hearing, vision, and balance. Doctors say the condition is treatable but often underdiagnosed, and Joel's public announcement may help others seek earlier diagnosis. NPH involves a buildup of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain, causing symptoms that can mimic aging or other conditions. The condition can be treated with surgery to relieve pressure, leading to improved symptoms and quality of life.</p>
