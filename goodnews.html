          <p>NASA's Mars Perseverance rover captured a selfie featuring a Martian dust devil, resembling a small pale puff, 3 miles behind the rover during a recent photo shoot. The selfie, a composite of 59 images, marks 1,500 Martian days for Perseverance, which landed on Mars in 2021. The rover is collecting samples for an eventual return to Earth from Jezero Crater, an ancient lakebed and river delta that could hold clues to past microbial life. This image also shows the rover's latest sample borehole on the surface.</p>

          <p>The NFL's spring league meetings in Minnesota saw the failure of a proposal to ban the "tush push," a play popularized by the Philadelphia Eagles. The Green Bay Packers' proposal fell short of the required 75% majority, with the Eagles and several other teams voting against the ban. The Eagles celebrated the decision, posting highlights of the play on social media. The push to ban the "tush push" gained momentum after the Eagles' Super Bowl LIX victory, but the NFL has previously stated that no injuries have been reported on the play.</p>

          <p>Cigna's pharmacy benefits unit Evernorth has reached a deal with Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk to lower prices and cap copays on weight loss drugs Wegovy and Zepbound. The deal aims to make the drugs more accessible to employers and workers, capping monthly out-of-pocket costs at $200. This would benefit clients hesitant to cover the medications due to high costs, while also simplifying the pre-authorization process. The new services and discounts will also be provided for Evernorth clients already offering the weight loss drugs.</p>

          <p>Tash Aw's new novel, "The South," the first in a planned quartet, follows 16-year-old Jay Lim's holiday break on his mother's inherited land in Malaysia. The novel explores the growing attraction between Jay and Chuan, a local boy, while also delving into the lives of other characters and shifting perspectives. Aw beautifully portrays the unspoken class differences between the boys, with Jay's middle-class background contrasting with Chuan's working-class life on a failing farm. The novel quietly yet expansively explores themes of identity, family, and societal change.</p>

Lithium-ion batteries can overheat and catch fire, prompting the FAA to prohibit spare batteries in checked bags. Southwest's policy extends this by requiring visible chargers during use.</p>

          <p>Oklahoma has been exemplary at cleaning up its streams, with more than any other state. A big part of the solution was simple: Give cows clean drinking water and keep them out of the streams.

Today, Horse Creek is no longer on the state‚Äôs list of most contaminated waterways. About 100 Oklahoman streams once polluted by runoff predominantly from farmland have been restored to health.</p>

With the average home equity amount over $300,000 currently, borrowing from it with a HELOC in the same way you'd use a credit card can be advantageous for retirees living on a limited income.
