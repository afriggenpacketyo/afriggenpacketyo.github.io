        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea secured the inaugural Club World Cup trophy with a commanding 3-0 victory over Paris Saint-Germain, driven by a brilliant performance from Cole Palmer. The English attacker scored two nearly identical goals in the first half and assisted a third for João Pedro, effectively deciding the match before halftime. PSG, despite controlling possession, struggled to break down Chelsea's organized defense and create clear chances, with goalkeeper Robert Sánchez making several key saves. The match was sealed for Chelsea when PSG's João Neves received a late red card for unsportsmanlike conduct.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise album titled "Swag," which marks a return to his R&B roots with a raw, improvisatory, and personal feel. The album comes after a period of personal tumult for the artist and features a murky, chillwave-influenced sound, with some tracks resembling unfinished voice memos. The article praises the album for its authenticity and vulnerability, comparing its idiosyncratic vibe to modern pop stars like SZA and Lana Del Rey. Despite some awkward moments, the album is described as a disarming and often beautiful project that showcases Bieber's instinctual vocal talent.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" movie, written and directed by James Gunn, launched with a strong $122 million in ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada. The opening marks a significant and much-needed success for DC Studios and Warner Bros., whose recent superhero films have underperformed. As the first major project under the new leadership of Gunn and Peter Safran, the film's debut is seen as a crucial step in rebooting the DC cinematic universe. While the domestic opening was the third largest of the year, its international performance was more modest, earning $95 million in other markets.</p>

          <p>Senators Lindsey Graham and Richard Blumenthal are leading a bipartisan effort to pass a new sanctions bill aimed at pressuring Russia to end its war in Ukraine. Graham described the bill as a "sledgehammer" that would empower President Trump to impose severe tariffs on countries like China, India, and Brazil that support Russia's economy. The proposed legislation comes as President Trump expresses growing frustration with Vladimir Putin and signals a potential shift in his administration's approach. The bill has gained significant support, with 85 cosponsors, indicating a strong, unified congressional stance against Russia's ongoing aggression.</p>

          <p>A 1940s-era fortune cookie factory in Denver has been transformed into a unique, privately funded art gallery called the Cookie Factory. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and spent eight years renovating it into a space for the community to connect with art, free of charge. The gallery's mission is to provide a place for healing and mental wellness through art, a cause personal to Precourt. Its inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and is part of a long-term vision to foster discussion and togetherness in the city.</p>

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that while the EU prefers a negotiated solution, it will remain prepared to implement countermeasures if a deal cannot be reached, using the extension to seek a resolution.</p>
