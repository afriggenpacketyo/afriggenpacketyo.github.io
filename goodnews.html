          <p>Kavan Markwood, the Pirates fan who fell from the stands at PNC Park, is recovering faster than anticipated, according to doctors at Allegheny General Hospital. Markwood sustained injuries to his skull, brain, spine, ribs, and lungs but has made remarkable progress, is off the breathing machine, out of intensive care, and preparing for physical therapy. His sister emphasized that he is a good person and shouldn't be judged based on the accident, while the family expressed gratitude for the support received. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is still investigating the fall, with initial reports suggesting possible intoxication, though a Pirates spokesperson stated Markwood showed no signs of intoxication upon entering the park and had consumed only two beers throughout the game.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 18:10:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This New York Times opinion piece argues that the charitable tax deduction in the U.S. disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and skews the behavior of nonprofits. The article highlights that the current system allows higher-income individuals to receive larger income tax deductions for every dollar they donate, while the majority of Americans receive no federal tax benefit for their charitable contributions. The author proposes replacing the current charitable deduction with a tax incentive that is determined by the amount of the donation, not the income of the donor. This could involve the government matching private donations or emulating Canada's tax credit system, aiming to level the playing field and incentivize charities to appeal to a broader range of donors.</p>
