        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced on social media that Israel and Iran have agreed to a complete ceasefire, which is scheduled to commence in approximately six hours. The agreement entails two 12-hour ceasefire periods, with Iran initiating the first period, followed by Israel with a second 12-hour ceasefire. Trump congratulated both countries for their stamina, courage, and intelligence in ending what he termed 'THE 12 DAY WAR,' following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear targets two days prior. This announcement signals a potential de-escalation of tensions in the region, although the long-term implications remain to be seen. The situation remains fluid, and further developments are anticipated as the ceasefire takes effect. Optimism surrounding the agreement will depend on its successful implementation and adherence by both sides. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Pixar's latest film, 'Elio,' experienced the studio's worst opening weekend ever, grossing $21 million in the U.S. and Canada, falling behind 'Elemental's' debut. Despite positive reviews, the film struggled to attract audiences, highlighting the challenges original animated movies face in the post-pandemic era. Analysts suggest that timing and marketing may have contributed to the disappointing performance, as the film competed with other family-friendly releases. Disney remains optimistic, drawing parallels to 'Elemental's' eventual success, and plans to continue investing in original animated content alongside sequels and franchises. </p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 17:45:20 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top U.S. analyst suggests that China is unlikely to deploy its navy to secure the Strait of Hormuz if Iran threatens to close it, despite China's heavy reliance on Middle Eastern oil. Instead, China's approach would likely involve quiet negotiations and prioritizing its self-interests, rather than direct military intervention. This assessment is based on China's past behavior, such as its agreement with Houthi rebels in the Red Sea to spare Chinese-flagged vessels. China's focus remains on protecting its own economic interests rather than policing global waterways. </p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target of spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, with 3.5% allocated to core defense and 1.5% to defense-related areas like resilience and security. This commitment is intended to appease US President Donald Trump, who has urged NATO allies to increase their defense spending, while also providing flexibility for EU countries facing financial constraints. The government expects to reach 4.1% of GDP on national security by 2027, with core defense spending reaching 2.6% by then, and it published its National Security Strategy emphasizing the need for the UK to be more competitive in science, education, trade, and technology. The government believes this investment in defense will create jobs and growth for working people. </p>
