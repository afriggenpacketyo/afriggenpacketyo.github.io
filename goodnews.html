          <p>Dr. Allen Frances has spoken out about the dramatic increase in autism diagnoses over the past several decades, stating that he played a part in this trend. In a recent piece and an interview, he discusses how changes in diagnostic criteria, which he helped shape, have contributed to a 60-fold rise in autism rates. His perspective sheds light on the evolving understanding and classification of developmental disorders within the medical community. The conversation explores the complex reasons behind the soaring numbers, moving beyond simple awareness to include diagnostic shifts.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old from Norfolk has become the first patient in Europe to receive leniolisib, a newly licensed drug that could cure her life-threatening inherited immune disorder, APDS. The condition, which claimed the lives of her mother and other relatives, was only identified in 2013 by Cambridge researchers with help from her family's participation in studies. The treatment works by blocking an overactive enzyme, allowing the immune system to function correctly. This breakthrough represents a remarkable journey from disease discovery to an available NHS treatment in just 12 years, offering new hope to patients.</p>

          <p>Brendan Foley, the CEO of spice manufacturer McCormick, has stated that the company is primarily focused on how new tariffs will affect its agricultural supply chain. While 90% of its products sold in the U.S. are made domestically, the company sources a majority of its raw ingredients, like black pepper, from various international markets. Foley expressed confidence that the company has effectively managed the tariff impact for the remainder of the year. He also noted that consumer demand for at-home cooking and flavor remains strong, which has bolstered the company's recent positive earnings report.</p>

          <p>The first trailer has been released for "Bugonia," the latest film from director Yorgos Lanthimos, reuniting him with actors Emma Stone and Jesse Plemons. The movie is an English-language remake of the South Korean film "Save the Green Planet!" and centers on two conspiracy theorists who kidnap a powerful CEO, believing she is an alien bent on destroying Earth. The trailer hints at Lanthimos's signature bizarre and darkly comedic style, set to an energetic punk rock soundtrack.

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has successfully captured its first direct images of a planet outside our solar system, a significant milestone for the observatory. The exoplanet candidate, named TWA 7b, is believed to be a gas giant with a mass similar to Saturn, orbiting a young star. Scientists used a high-contrast imaging technique with a coronagraph to block the star's bright light, revealing the faint planet nearby. While a small possibility remains that the object is a background galaxy, researchers state the evidence strongly suggests it is a newly discovered world.</p>

          <p>Mayor Eric Adams officially began his reelection campaign, positioning himself as a "blue collar" candidate who has delivered results on crime and jobs for New York City. From the steps of City Hall, Adams drew a sharp contrast with his main rival, Democratic primary winner Zohran Mamdani, whom he characterized as an inexperienced politician with a privileged background making "empty promises." Adams, who is now running as an independent, touted his administration's achievements in reducing crime and building housing. He dismissed Mamdani's democratic socialist platform, arguing New York is a city of opportunity, not socialism.</p>

          <p>Residents across the metro Atlanta area reported seeing a bright "fireball" in the sky, followed by a loud boom and shaking on Thursday afternoon. NASA confirmed the event was caused by a meteor, likely an asteroidal fragment about three feet in diameter, traveling at 30,000 miles per hour. The space agency stated that the object disintegrated approximately 27 miles above the ground, releasing energy equivalent to 20 tons of TNT, which produced the sonic boom. Emergency officials also investigated a report from a homeowner who believed a piece of the meteorite may have crashed through their roof.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 is nearing an all-time high, completing a remarkable recovery from a significant dip in April that was triggered by new tariff announcements. Analysts attribute the rebound to several factors, including easing concerns over a full-blown trade war and strong performance from the technology sector, led by AI-related companies like Nvidia. Investor optimism has also been bolstered by signals from the Federal Reserve, which has indicated it may cut interest rates later this year. Despite the market's resilience, some economists warn that the full economic impact of the tariffs has yet to be felt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A coalition of environmental organizations, cities, and tribes has filed a first-of-its-kind class-action lawsuit against the EPA and its administrator, Lee Zeldin. The suit seeks to restore some $3 billion in environmental and climate justice grants that were awarded by the previous administration but abruptly terminated by the Trump administration. Plaintiffs, like Air Alliance Houston, argue their funding was illegally canceled not for noncompliance, but because the new administration politically opposes their work. This legal strategy allows smaller, less-resourced groups to pool their efforts and challenge the administration's sweeping deregulation and funding cuts on a broader scale.</p>
