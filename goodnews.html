        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NFL has issued significant fines to star players Saquon Barkley of the Philadelphia Eagles and Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs following their Week 2 game. Barkley was fined $46,371 for a dangerous helmet-lowering violation, a repeat offense, despite no flag being thrown during the play. Kelce received a $14,491 fine for an obscene gesture after a big catch, which also went unflagged during the game. These penalties underscore the league's ongoing efforts to enhance player safety and maintain decorum, even when officials miss calls on the field, with tighter officiating expected in future games.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron outlined France's decision to recognize a Palestinian state at the UN, viewing it as crucial for a political solution and regional security. He proposed a three-phase plan: an immediate ceasefire, hostage release, and humanitarian aid, followed by Gaza's reconstruction and governance, then a two-state solution. Macron also criticized the U.S. Ambassador's public remarks on French antisemitism as unacceptable and rejected claims that his stance on Israeli government policies is inherently antisemitic. He stressed the need to isolate Hamas through political means, not just military action, arguing that military force alone has not diminished Hamas's recruitment capabilities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Liberal Democrats are reevaluating their historical opposition to ID cards, prompted by reports of a potential digital scheme by the Labour government. Leader Sir Ed Davey expressed an openness to digital ID if it empowers individuals to access public services, potentially increasing freedoms, but cautioned against systems prone to authoritarian abuse. While a party debate is pending, many members at a fringe meeting voiced strong civil liberties and data security concerns, reminiscent of past campaigns. This shift reflects evolving technological landscapes and differing political philosophies on balancing security, convenience, and individual rights in modern governance.</p>

Johnson underwent extensive transformation for the part, revealing a desire for dramatic roles that allow him to "rip myself open" for artistic fulfillment beyond box office success. He admitted feeling nervous about the raw role, drawing on childhood trauma like eviction for emotional depth. This marks a new chapter in his career, signaling a shift towards more challenging and personally resonant projects and a new "book" in his professional life.</p>

          <p>On the eve of Rosh Hashanah, Rabbi Angela Buchdahl reflects on the Jewish New Year as a time for communal atonement and a return to "our better selves." She emphasizes the concept of Teshuvah, or repentance, as a fundamentally hopeful message that individuals and societies can change through collective responsibility. Buchdahl suggests that the nation could benefit from a shared self-examination, moving beyond blame to acknowledge collective failings like ignoring the vulnerable and normalizing violence. Her commentary advocates for a return to goodness, compassion, and generosity as foundational values for societal well-being and unity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A child development expert, having studied over 200 parent-child relationships, identifies nine key practices parents employ to cultivate exceptional social skills in their children. These include openly discussing emotions, modeling empathy, fostering authentic confidence, teaching conflict resolution, and validating children's feelings. The article emphasizes that children learn communication and connection through observation and emotional safety at home, rather than just memorizing polite phrases. By prioritizing listening over lecturing and treating mistakes as learning opportunities, parents can raise adaptable, compassionate, and socially aware adults, ready for healthy real-world relationships and positive societal contributions.</p>

          <p>The United States asserted its dominance at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, topping the medal table with 26 total medals, including 16 golds. In contrast, Great Britain and Northern Ireland experienced their worst performance since 2003, failing to secure a gold medal and finishing 21st overall. Their five-medal tally, matching 2019, was their lowest since 2005, and they secured no relay medals for the first time in two decades. Head coach Paula Dunn acknowledged a "mixed bag" and missed opportunities, citing challenging conditions like high humidity as factors. This outcome underscores a significant shift in athletic fortunes for some nations, while Samoa celebrated its first-ever medal with a discus bronze, highlighting diverse national achievements across the competition.</p>

          <p>A credit expert advises consumers to avoid three common mistakes to fully maximize the value of their rewards credit cards, especially as annual fees for premium cards rise. Brian Kelly, founder of The Points Guy, cautions against opting for no-fee cards, which often lack substantial rewards, and hoarding points, as their value can change unpredictably. He also recommends negotiating with credit card companies before canceling, as retention departments may offer incentives or discounts.

          <p>The latest UN Global Innovation Index reveals China has entered the top 10 most innovative nations, displacing Germany, a significant achievement fueled by massive R&D investments. This success highlights the perceived failure of U.S. technological containment efforts, which, instead of stifling, have catalyzed China's domestic innovation and self-sufficiency. Washington's strategy of tech decoupling, aimed at crippling China's capabilities in advanced fields like AI and 5G, has inadvertently spurred a doubling down on domestic development. This development signals a profound paradox where U.S. policies may be undermining global innovation and its own long-term interests in a competitive technological landscape.</p>

          <p>A recent article highlights a pervasive lack of fertility knowledge among U.S. women, with many expressing regret over not receiving comprehensive sex education earlier. Studies indicate that a significant percentage of reproductive-age women, including medical trainees, misunderstand basic reproductive biology, such as ovulation and the finite nature of egg supply. Fertility doctors advocate for more robust, school-based sex education that covers both pregnancy prevention and fertility enhancement, starting in middle and high school. This educational gap has tangible consequences, leading to missed opportunities for family planning and increased reliance on costly treatments like IVF, underscoring the need for informed reproductive choices.</p>
