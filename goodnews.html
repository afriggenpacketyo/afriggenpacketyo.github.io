          <p>Palantir's stock increased by nearly 8% after the software analytics firm reported its first-ever quarter with over $1 billion in revenue, surpassing analyst forecasts. The company attributed its strong performance to high demand for its artificial intelligence platforms and raised its full-year revenue guidance. U.S. commercial revenue nearly doubled, and government revenue also saw significant growth, leading to a net income jump of 144% compared to the previous year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article advises homeowners considering a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) to ask critical questions before borrowing, especially with amounts as large as $100,000. While HELOCs offer lower interest rates compared to credit cards, their variable rates mean payments could change with market conditions. Homeowners should assess the likelihood and impact of potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, which may not translate to immediate, substantial savings. The article also suggests comparing the flexibility of a HELOC against the stability of a fixed-rate home equity loan to determine the best fit for their financial situation.

          <p>A report highlights that Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut, has become a notable incubator for chief executives across the restaurant industry. Many prominent leaders, including the CEOs of Starbucks and Brinker International, previously held senior roles within Yum, benefiting from its focus on leadership development and global operations. The company's vast scale and competitive internal environment often lead talented executives to seek top roles at rival chains.

          <p>South Korean national team captain Son Heung-min is set to join Los Angeles FC (LAFC) in a landmark deal for Major League Soccer (MLS). The transfer fee reportedly surpasses the previous MLS record, with some estimates placing it at $26 million. The signing is seen as a monumental event for the league, LAFC, and the large Korean American community in Southern California, drawing comparisons to major signings in other sports. The move is expected to boost LAFC's on-field performance, increase the MLS's global profile, and help Son acclimate to North America ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial equipment supplier Eaton fell despite the company reporting a solid second quarter and increasing its full-year financial outlook. The stock dropped over 6% as the results, while positive, did not meet the exceptionally high expectations set by Wall Street analysts. Eaton, a key supplier for AI data centers, saw strong growth driven by demand in electrification and aerospace. The article suggests that with the stock's pullback, it may present a buying opportunity given the company's strong long-term growth prospects tied to major economic trends.

          <p>This op-ed argues that artificial intelligence is set to cause a paradigm shift in the financial advisory industry, leading to the emergence of the "RIA of 1" — a single advisor augmented by AI agents. The author predicts AI will streamline nearly all operational tasks, from client onboarding to portfolio management, allowing human advisors to focus on high-value strategic planning. This leap in productivity will not only make quality financial advice more personalized and responsive but also democratize access for middle-income families.

          <p>President Trump's recent comments on potential candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair have influenced prediction markets, with Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh emerging as frontrunners. In a CNBC interview, Trump spoke favorably of "both Kevins," leading to their chances on the Kalshi prediction market rising to 35% each. The speculation comes as Trump continues to criticize current Chair Jerome Powell for keeping interest rates high. The recent resignation of Fed Governor Adriana Kugler also gives Trump an opportunity to appoint a new board member who could later be elevated to the top position. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has officially ended the requirement for federal employees to submit a weekly list of five accomplishments. The practice was initiated by Elon Musk's short-lived Department of Government Efficiency, with Musk threatening that failure to respond would be treated as a resignation. The OPM director stated that managers have other tools to stay informed of their team's work and that the agency would no longer manage the process. Many agencies had already stopped enforcing the controversial directive prior to the official announcement.</p>

The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows notable drops in violent crimes like murder (down 14.9%) and property crimes, including a significant 18.6% decrease in motor vehicle thefts. While experts point to the positive trend, they also note that aggravated assault rates remain elevated compared to pre-COVID levels and that hate crime incidents saw only a slight decrease.</p>
