          <p>A federal judge has temporarily paused the Trump administration's plans to restructure government agencies and implement mass layoffs, citing the need for Congressional approval for such large-scale reorganizations. Judge Susan Illston sided with unions and local governments, arguing that the administration's actions were unlawful and disruptive to critical services. The ruling halts the administration's efforts, led by Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to eliminate duplicate roles and automate tasks. A hearing is scheduled for May 22 to consider a longer preliminary injunction.</p>
