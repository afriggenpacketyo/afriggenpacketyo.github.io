        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists in Australia have identified a new species of stick insect, Acrophylla alta, which is now believed to be the country's heaviest insect. Discovered in a remote, high-altitude rainforest in Far North Queensland, the insect measures 40 centimeters long and weighs 44 grams, similar to a golf ball. Researchers theorize that its substantial body mass is an evolutionary adaptation that helps it survive the colder conditions of its canopy habitat. Specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum to support future research.</p>

          <p>In the current uncertain economic climate, many individuals approaching retirement are considering rolling over their 401(k) savings into an annuity to secure a guaranteed lifelong income. While high interest rates have made annuity payouts more appealing, this financial move involves significant trade-offs, including reduced liquidity, potential fees, and surrender charges if funds are withdrawn early. The article advises that such a decision should be part of a comprehensive retirement strategy, carefully weighing personal risk tolerance, income needs, and long-term goals.

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense has reversed its plan to discontinue sharing crucial satellite weather data relied upon by hurricane forecasters and climate scientists. The Navy had intended to phase out the data as part of a modernization effort but reconsidered after feedback from government partners highlighted its importance. This information is vital for tracking storms in real-time, issuing timely evacuation warnings, and monitoring long-term changes in sea ice. The data flow is now secured until at least September 2026.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the withdrawal of approximately 1,350 National Guard members from Los Angeles, significantly scaling back the force deployed in June amid unrest over federal immigration raids. The initial deployment by President Trump was met with fierce opposition from California's Democratic leaders, who filed a lawsuit calling it an illegal usurpation of state power. Local officials, including Mayor Karen Bass, celebrated the withdrawal, viewing the military presence as an unnecessary escalation that inflamed tensions in the city.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its blockbuster diabetes drug, Mounjaro, demonstrated significant cardiovascular benefits in a late-stage trial directly comparing it to Trulicity, the company's older treatment. The study revealed that Mounjaro not only matched Trulicity in reducing major cardiovascular events but also showed a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and offered greater kidney protection. These compelling results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes and associated cardiovascular risks.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court is hearing a major legal challenge to President Trump's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose broad tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. During arguments, judges sharply questioned the administration's claim that the law grants such expansive authority, noting it has never before been used for this purpose and that the power to levy tariffs is constitutionally given to Congress. The case, brought by a coalition of states and businesses, tests a cornerstone of Trump's economic policy and is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court. (not investment advice)</p>
