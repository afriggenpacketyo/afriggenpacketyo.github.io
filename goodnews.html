          <p>Tesla has officially opened its flagship 24/7 diner in Hollywood, California, combining a classic American drive-in experience with advanced technology. The location features 80 charging stations, two massive 66-foot movie screens, and an Optimus robot that serves popcorn to patrons. CEO Elon Musk has indicated that if this retro-futuristic concept proves successful, the company plans to expand the diners to major cities and Supercharger sites worldwide. The venue allows customers to watch films on the large screens or within their vehicles via a dedicated app.</p>

          <p>Licensed psychotherapist Britt Frank challenges the common advice to "just be yourself," arguing it is incomplete and can be detrimental. She explains that individuals have multiple "selves" and that our behavior is heavily influenced by our nervous system's state, meaning our "authentic" self is not fixed. Frank warns that using authenticity as an excuse for poor behavior damages relationships. Instead, she proposes the concept of "self-leadership," which involves consciously choosing which internal part of you to present in a given situation, leading to more aligned and responsible actions.</p>

          <p>Corporate travel spending is continuing, though businesses are being more strategic and cautious due to ongoing trade tensions and economic uncertainty, according to new reports. A Navan index showed a 15% year-over-year increase in corporate travel spending in the second quarter, suggesting companies still see travel as a key business component. However, the Global Business Travel Association noted that overall growth forecasts have been moderated. Companies are reportedly prioritizing individual, relationship-building trips over large group events and seeking more efficient ways to travel, ensuring each trip has a clear purpose and return on investment.

          <p>Financial experts suggest that now is a competitive time to consider purchasing an annuity, with some current rates significantly higher than in recent years due to the elevated interest rate environment. Factors like rising Treasury yields and increased competition among providers are driving attractive payouts. However, uncertainty about future Federal Reserve policy means these high rates may not last. Advisors note that while locking in high yields can be beneficial for securing retirement income, annuities are not suitable for everyone, particularly those who may need liquidity or whose financial goals don't align with a long-term commitment.

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent clarified that while he believes the Federal Reserve's operations need a thorough internal review, he does not think Fed Chair Jerome Powell should resign. Bessent argued that the Fed has experienced "mission creep" over the years, expanding into areas beyond its core monetary policy mandate. He suggested that Powell could secure his legacy by leading a review to "right-size" the Fed's non-monetary functions. This position contrasts with President Trump's calls for Powell's resignation and demands for the central bank to lower interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's export growth accelerated in June, rising 5.8% from the previous year, as companies rushed to place orders before a U.S. tariff truce expires in August. While exports to the United States fell by 16%, this was a significant improvement from the 34.5% drop in May, indicating a temporary resumption of trade. However, the long-term outlook remains uncertain, with analysts expecting export growth to slow as high tariffs are likely to remain. The data also showed China's global trade diversifying, with significant export growth to Southeast Asia and Europe in the first half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This literary essay recounts a writer's journey to the Greek island of Corfu, a setting in John le Carré's novel "A Perfect Spy," to explore the author's elusive nature. The article delves into how le Carré's own life, particularly his relationship with his con-man father, Ronnie Cornwell, deeply informed his fiction about espionage, betrayal, and fractured identity. It reflects on how le Carré used travel, secrecy, and writing as forms of escape and reinvention. The piece intertwines the author's travels on the island with the complex, layered narratives of le Carré's life and work, exploring themes of influence, memory, and authenticity.</p>
