          <p>Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reportedly instructed the military to cease all offensive operations in the Gaza Strip, permitting only defensive actions. This significant development follows Hamas's conditional acceptance of a U.S.-led peace proposal from President Donald Trump, which includes the release of all hostages. The Israel Defense Forces continue to warn Gaza residents that the northern part of the strip remains a dangerous combat zone. In a show of unity, other Palestinian militant groups like Islamic Jihad have expressed their support for Hamas's position on the proposed ceasefire agreement.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion May Have Originated in Tang Dynasty China</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian statue from China's Tang dynasty (618–907). The theory is based on stylistic similarities to mythical Chinese beasts and lead isotope analysis indicating the copper came from China's Lower Yangtze River basin. Researchers speculate the 2.8-tonne statue was transported to Venice and later altered, possibly by the family of explorer Marco Polo. While this theory offers a fascinating connection between medieval Europe and China, some Chinese scholars have expressed skepticism about the findings.</p>

          <p>The new film "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, chronicles the turbulent life of pioneering MMA fighter Mark Kerr. The movie, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores Kerr's rise to become the world's top heavyweight fighter as well as his subsequent fall due to addiction to opioids and alcohol. Johnson, who first met Kerr in 1997, had long hoped to portray the fighter's story of vulnerability and toughness. Now sober, Kerr sees the film as a second chance and has been actively involved in its promotion, marking a remarkable second act for the retired athlete.</p>

          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with the feasibility of achieving its net-zero emissions targets, which heavily rely on the use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the EU and UK have mandated that 2% of jet fuel be sustainable this year, rising to 10% in Britain by 2030, some industry leaders are skeptical that production can meet these goals. Experts acknowledge that while SAF is technically possible, making it commercially viable and available at scale remains a significant hurdle, especially for next-generation fuels. Despite challenges, investment continues, as SAF is seen as the primary pathway to decarbonizing air travel.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed "States of Elevation," an endurance project where he summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous U.S. under his own power. Over 31 days, he cycled more than 3,000 miles between the peaks in six states and ran up each one, an effort equivalent to a daily marathon and a Tour de France stage. Jornet undertook the challenge not for records but to explore new landscapes and test his body's limits. His approach emphasized finding "the most aesthetic line," choosing more challenging and beautiful routes over more efficient ones.</p>

          <p>This article reveals several interesting and controversial facts about the history of the Nobel Prize. It highlights the Curie family's five-prize dynasty and notes that Albert Einstein was awarded the prize for the photoelectric effect, not his more famous theory of relativity. The list also addresses the myth behind the absence of a mathematics prize and discusses notable female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin who were overlooked for their crucial contributions. The piece concludes by noting that prizes have been awarded for science later proven wrong, and have never been revoked.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, will be visible on the night of October 7th, appearing larger and brighter than any other full moon so far this year. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, known as the perigee. This event kicks off a series of three consecutive supermoons for the final months of the year. This year's Harvest Moon is the one closest to the autumn equinox, a name traditionally linked to farmers gathering crops by the extra moonlight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores President Donald Trump's decision to interpret Hamas's conditional response to his 20-point peace plan as a full acceptance, a move that has cornered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Despite Hamas not committing to key demands like disarmament, Trump's focus on securing the immediate release of all hostages prompted him to publicly call for Israel to halt its bombing of Gaza. This unorthodox, deal-making approach is seen as quintessentially Trumpian, driven by a pragmatic desire to achieve a breakthrough and secure a significant foreign policy win. The move reflects a shift in Trump's stance.</p>
