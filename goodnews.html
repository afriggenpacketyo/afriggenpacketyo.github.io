          <p>The U.S. housing market is showing signs of cooling, with a new report indicating modest home price declines in some metro areas compared to the 2022 peak. The South and West, including cities like Austin and Miami, are experiencing the most significant price drops due to higher housing inventory and new construction. In contrast, markets in the Northeast and Midwest continue to face limited inventory and rising prices, creating a distinctly divided national real estate landscape. The article attributes these regional disparities primarily to fundamental supply and demand dynamics across the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Residents of Yreka, a small city in Northern California, were temporarily ordered to shelter in place Tuesday morning after an industrial accident at a cement plant released a large dust cloud. The Siskiyou County Sheriff’s Office issued the alert out of an abundance of caution due to the potential hazard of airborne cement particles. The order, which advised residents to turn off air conditioning and stay indoors, was lifted in less than an hour as the cloud dissipated. Officials stated that any settled particles were safe to wash away and that more information would be released.</p>

          <p>Following comments from President Trump, prediction markets have identified Kevin Hassett and Kevin Warsh as the leading candidates to become the next Federal Reserve chair. In a CNBC interview, Trump praised both men, causing their odds on the Kalshi prediction market to rise to 35% each. The speculation comes as Fed Governor Adriana Kugler's resignation opens a seat on the board, potentially for the next chair to fill before Jerome Powell's term ends in 2026. Both Hassett and Warsh are seen as likely to favor lower interest rates, aligning with Trump's criticism. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Lady Gaga, Sabrina Carpenter, Bruno Mars, and Kendrick Lamar have received the most nominations for the 2025 MTV Video Music Awards. Lady Gaga leads with twelve nominations, including artist of the year, while Carpenter earned eight. The awards show, which will take place in New York in September, also includes two new categories for best country and best pop artist. Previous top winners Beyoncé and Taylor Swift each received a single nomination for artist of the year, reflecting a year focused on touring rather than new album releases for both.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes the potential interest earnings of depositing $10,000 into either a 3-month Certificate of Deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. While a high-yield savings account might currently offer a slightly higher rate and thus marginally more interest over three months, its rate is variable and could decrease. In contrast, a CD locks in a guaranteed rate, providing certainty in a climate of potential interest rate cuts. The article concludes that the choice depends on an individual's need for liquidity versus the security of a fixed return. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With home equity levels high, homeowners may consider a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) for financing, but the article advises asking critical questions first. Borrowers should assess the likelihood and impact of imminent Federal Reserve rate cuts on their variable-rate HELOC payments, as the effect may be gradual. The article also suggests comparing a HELOC with a fixed-rate home equity loan, which offers rate stability and a lump-sum payment. Making an informed decision is crucial, as borrowing against home equity carries the risk of foreclosure if payments are not met. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new spending bill signed by President Trump will introduce changes to the tax deduction for charitable giving, primarily affecting high-income filers starting in 2026. The legislation establishes a "floor," allowing deductions only on donations exceeding 0.5% of adjusted gross income, and it also caps the benefit for those in the top 37% tax bracket. Financial planners suggest these changes may encourage taxpayers to "bunch" several years of donations into 2025 to take advantage of the current, more generous rules, possibly through donor-advised funds.
