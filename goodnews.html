        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The BBC has publicly rejected claims made by the White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt regarding its coverage of events in Gaza. Leavitt accused the BBC of taking down a story and altering casualty figures based on information from Hamas, but the BBC stated that it stands by its journalism and that its coverage was updated with new figures throughout the day, which is standard practice for fast-moving news stories. The BBC clarified that a separate report from BBC Verify, which debunked a viral video, was distinct from its news coverage. The BBC reiterated the importance of accurate reporting from Gaza and called for White House support in gaining access to the region, which is currently restricted for international journalists. The optimism score for this article is relatively high due to the BBC's commitment to journalistic integrity and transparency in its reporting, even in the face of criticism.</p>

          <p>French cognac businesses are hopeful that recent talks between China and France could lead to a rollback of tariffs imposed by Beijing. The tariffs were introduced in retaliation for the EU's tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, impacting the French cognac industry significantly. Guilhem Grosperrin, director of the Grosperrin family brand, expressed optimism that the Chinese government is willing to listen to their concerns. Some Chinese clients have even put orders on hold, awaiting the outcome of the negotiations, signaling a potential breakthrough for the industry. The article's optimism stems from the possibility of improved trade relations and the alleviation of economic pressures on French cognac businesses.</p>

          <p>Thomas Mann, a Nobel laureate, literary exile, and conscience of a nation in the wake of Nazi rule, remains a cultural icon 150 years after his birth. His literary genius reflected a life spent wandering between diverse worlds, especially after escaping Germany in the early 1930s. Mann's works often reflected his strident views against the Nazi regime and his advocacy for social democracy. He emigrated to the US in 1939 and continued to call on Germans to resist, solidifying his legacy as a courageous voice against fascism.</p>
