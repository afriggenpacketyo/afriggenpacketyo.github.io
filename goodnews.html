        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article discusses the remarkable decrease in violent crime rates across the United States, following a sharp increase during the pandemic. FBI data indicates that murder rates have fallen to pre-pandemic levels, with some cities like Baltimore experiencing their lowest homicide rates in over a decade. The article attributes the decline to the easing of pandemic-related stressors, the return of social services, and government initiatives such as community violence interruption programs. Despite these positive trends, the article notes that many Americans still believe crime is rising, highlighting a disconnect between perception and reality, and emphasizes that bad news tends to dominate media coverage.</p>

          <p>Former President Trump is considering taking Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac public, potentially ending 17 years of federal control over the mortgage giants.

          <p>Conductor John Mauceri experienced a rapid 40-pound weight gain and severe swelling after contracting COVID-19, leading to a months-long search for a diagnosis.
