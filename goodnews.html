          <p>More than a third of the United Kingdom's Members of Parliament, totaling 220 from nine different parties, have signed a letter urging Prime Minister Keir Starmer to formally recognize a Palestinian state. The letter argues that recognition would be a vital step toward a two-state solution and send a powerful message of support for Palestinian rights. The move increases pressure on the UK government, especially after France recently announced its own plans for recognition. Prime Minister Starmer has stated that recognition must be part of a broader, practical plan for peace in the region.</p>

          <p>Veteran quarterback Aaron Rodgers began his first training camp with the Pittsburgh Steelers by throwing an interception on his first pass in team drills. The 41-year-old quarterback, who recently joined the team after a brief and injury-plagued tenure with the New York Jets, downplayed the incident with a smile. He told reporters that he's known for trying out difficult throws in practice and remains stellar at protecting the football during games. Rodgers expressed confidence in the team's potential, suggesting they are one of about 10 to 12 teams with a legitimate chance at a Super Bowl.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he is considering a plan to issue rebate checks to Americans, particularly those at certain income levels, using revenue generated from his administration's tariffs. The federal government has collected approximately $100 billion from these tariffs, which Mr. Trump suggested could be used for rebates or to pay down the national debt. This proposal echoes previous direct payment programs, such as those during the pandemic, and would likely require new legislation from Congress to authorize the Treasury Department to issue the checks.

          <p>Inter Miami stars Lionel Messi and Jordi Alba have been suspended for their next league match after they did not participate in the MLS All-Star Game. According to the club, Messi missed the event due to fatigue, while Alba was dealing with an injury. However, under league rules, players who miss the All-Star Game without prior league approval are ineligible for their club's subsequent match. MLS Commissioner Don Garber acknowledged the difficulty of the decision but stated the long-standing policy had to be enforced, though he is open to reviewing the rule in the future.</p>

          <p>Data analytics firm Palantir has seen its market capitalization rise to $375 billion, making it one of the 20 most valuable companies in the United States. The company's stock has more than doubled in 2025, driven by investor enthusiasm for its artificial intelligence capabilities and strong ties to the U.S. government. In its most recent quarter, Palantir reported a 45% increase in revenue from its U.S. government business. Despite its high valuation, the company's sales are smaller than other firms in the top 20, and its stock trades at a very high forward earnings multiple. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Director Kiyoshi Kurosawa's new action-thriller "Cloud" is described in this review as a chilling and nail-biting examination of the consequences of online capitalism and anonymity. The film follows a young, callous online reseller who becomes the target of a coordinated and violent revenge campaign by people he has scammed. The article praises Kurosawa's masterful direction and the film's ability to create a palpable sense of paranoid dread. Rather than speculative horror, the review suggests "Cloud" is a bleakly resonant depiction of how online interactions can collapse into real-world, pitiless violence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While homeowners currently have record amounts of tappable home equity, accessing it through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) is not always a fast process. This article explains that closing on a HELOC typically takes two to six weeks due to necessary steps like income verification, credit checks, and property appraisals. However, closing in under two weeks may be possible with certain online lenders, by having all financial documents prepared in advance, or if the lender waives a full appraisal. A federally mandated three-day "right of rescission" period also adds to the timeline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new BritBox drama series titled "Outrageous" is bringing the story of the six famous and politically divergent Mitford sisters to the screen. The article highlights an archival 1989 NPR interview with one of the sisters, the late author and activist Jessica Mitford. In the interview, she reflected on her journey from an aristocratic English upbringing to becoming a committed leftist, a path that starkly contrasted with two of her sisters who became fascists. Jessica discussed her motivations, her estrangement from family, and her work as a muckraking journalist.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores why airplane Wi-Fi service is often inconsistent, caught between being a promised amenity and a frustrating failure. The problem typically isn't the Wi-Fi router on the plane but the connection to the internet, which comes from either ground-based towers or satellites. While newer satellite technology offers a much better experience, many aircraft, particularly smaller regional jets, still use the older, less reliable air-to-ground systems. Airlines are in the process of upgrading their entire fleets, but the transition is slow, meaning consistent, reliable internet for all passengers is likely still a few years away.</p>

          <p>The journal Science has officially retracted a controversial 2010 study that claimed to have discovered bacteria capable of using the toxic element arsenic to build its DNA. The finding, which suggested new possibilities for life on Earth and other planets, was met with skepticism after other research groups failed to replicate the results. The journal stated the retraction was due to the reported experiments not supporting the key conclusions, not because of scientific misconduct. The study's authors disagree with the decision, arguing that controversial interpretations are part of the scientific process.</p>

The second question concerns a brother-in-law who makes cruel jokes about eating disorders. The experts advise confronting the bully directly and making it clear the behavior is unacceptable, while also supporting the children who are understandably upset by the comments.</p>

          <p>England forward Lauren James is recovering from an ankle injury and her availability for the Euro 2025 final against Spain on Sunday is uncertain. James, who has scored two goals in the tournament, was substituted at halftime during England's semi-final win over Italy. Manager Sarina Wiegman stated that they are giving James time to recover but does not yet know if she will be ready for the championship match. The potential absence of the 23-year-old star presents a significant selection dilemma for Wiegman ahead of the final.</p>
