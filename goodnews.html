          <p>China Evergrande Group was delisted from the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, marking a significant downfall for the once-prominent developer. Evergrande's market capitalization peaked at $51.7 billion in 2017 but plummeted to $275 million before trading was suspended. The company's default on over $300 billion in debt triggered a broader crisis in China's property sector, which accounted for a quarter of China's GDP before 2020. The Chinese government is implementing measures to stabilize the housing market, including easing purchase restrictions and lowering mortgage rates, while analysts predict a gradual easing of the property market's drag on GDP.

Ortega emphasizes that yacht work requires willingness to learn and customer service skills, not necessarily maritime expertise. He now runs "Superyacht Sunday School" to mentor aspiring yachties, with a high job placement rate, and cautions against entering the industry solely for the money, but encourages those feeling stuck to pursue it.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has rescheduled the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket for Tuesday night after two previous attempts were scrubbed due to technical issues. The flight aims to test the Super Heavy first stage under stressful conditions and send the Starship upper stage on a suborbital trajectory to the Indian Ocean. A successful flight would pave the way for testing autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, essential for NASA's planned moon landing and eventual Mars missions. Some experts doubt SpaceX will perfect the system in time for a 2027 moon landing.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Food price inflation has reached an 18-month high, driven by rising costs of chocolate, butter, and eggs, according to a recent survey. The British Retail Consortium's shop price monitor revealed a 4.2% food inflation rate, with staples like butter and eggs seeing significant price increases. Poor cocoa harvests due to climate change and crop disease have contributed to more expensive chocolate. Some relief is noted for parents with cheaper clothing, books, and stationery ahead of the new academic year, but shoppers may need to reassess household budgets.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump stated that the U.S. would allow 600,000 Chinese students to study in the country, more than doubling the current number. This message came hours after the Chinese embassy in the U.S. advised students to "be cautious when choosing" Houston as their destination, citing unreasonable customs checks. Trump stated his administration aims to "get along good" with China, reiterating Xi Jinping's invitation to visit the country. The announcement signifies a shift in tone from the U.S. government regarding Chinese students.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have reportedly achieved a technological breakthrough that could make airborne early warning and control (AEW&C) aircraft less detectable. The new method involves assigning each antenna a minutely varied frequency, rendering the signal chaotic and difficult to intercept or geolocate. This innovation utilizes a new class of radar system known as frequency diverse array (FDA) technology, described as a "paradigm shift" from traditional phased array radars. This development could enhance the survivability of these critical command nodes in modern warfare.</p>
