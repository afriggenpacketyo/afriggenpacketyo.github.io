          <p>Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has announced significant actions to reform the U.S. organ transplant system, including the decertification of a Miami-based organ procurement organization. The move follows reports of patient safety failures, including instances where organ procurement was initiated on patients who may not have been deceased. Kennedy stated the Trump administration is taking bold steps to restore public trust in the donation process, which has been shaken by these incidents. The reforms aim to increase oversight and accountability for the 55 organizations that coordinate transplants nationwide.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has halted the U.S. government's plan to deport a group of unaccompanied Guatemalan children, stating the administration's justification for the action "crumbled like a house of cards." Judge Timothy Kelly, a Trump appointee, ruled that there was no evidence to support the government's claim that it was reuniting the children with their families at the families' request. The ruling highlights that many parents were unaware of the deportation plan and believed their children were on a path to legal status in the U.S. This decision reaffirms legal protections for unaccompanied minors entering the country.</p>

          <p>In a significant industry development, Nvidia has announced a $5 billion investment in its rival, Intel, to co-develop chips for data centers and personal computers. The news caused Intel's stock to surge by over 28%, providing a major boost to the struggling chipmaker. This collaboration follows recent investments in Intel from the U.S. government and SoftBank, signaling a concerted effort to revitalize the American semiconductor giant. The partnership aims to combine Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing expertise with Intel's CPU architecture, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape of the chip industry.

          <p>The White House has indicated its acceptance of the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, with National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett describing it as a "prudent call." Although some within the administration, including new Fed Governor Stephen Miran, had advocated for a larger half-point reduction, Hassett suggested the gradual approach was sensible. This reaction contrasts with President Trump's previous aggressive criticism of the central bank's policies. The commentary suggests an alignment between the administration and the Fed on the direction of monetary policy for now. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite lowering its 2025 operating profit margin forecast due to U.S. tariffs, the company raised its revenue growth expectations for the current year. CEO José Muñoz emphasized the U.S. as the "engine of growth," with a $26 billion investment planned to expand American operations and increase local production. The event was shadowed by a recent immigration raid at a Hyundai-affiliated plant in Georgia. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Darden Restaurants, the parent company of Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse, reported disappointing earnings for its fiscal first quarter but raised its full-year revenue forecast. Strong performance from its casual-dining brands, which saw increased traffic from higher-income groups, helped to offset continued weakness in its fine-dining segment. Olive Garden's same-store sales grew by 5.9%, driven by popular promotions and a new delivery partnership with Uber. The company's strategy of keeping menu price hikes below the rate of inflation appears to be successfully attracting value-conscious customers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage has fallen to a three-year low of 6.13%. This reduction provides tangible savings for homebuyers and those looking to refinance. For a $500,000 mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment at today's rate is approximately $3,040. This is about $300 less per month compared to the start of the year when rates were above 7%, translating to over $3,600 in annual savings and more than $100,000 over the life of the loan.

          <p>Researchers at the University of St. Andrews have located a "mileage clock" within the brain that helps both animals and humans estimate the distance they have traveled. By monitoring the brain activity of rats running in an arena, they discovered specific cells that "fired" in a regular pattern corresponding to the distance covered. When the environment was altered, this pattern became erratic, and the rats' distance estimation became inaccurate. A similar experiment with human volunteers confirmed the same behavioral pattern, providing new insights into the brain's internal navigation system and how it can be disrupted.</p>

          <p>A quarter-century after his brief, 11-game managerial debut, Jose Mourinho has returned to manage the Portuguese football club Benfica. While his appointment has generated significant excitement due to his legendary career, it is also seen as a gamble. For Mourinho, it is a chance to revitalize his career after a decade without a league title. For Benfica's president, Rui Costa, hiring the high-profile manager is a bold move ahead of club elections. The article explores whether this reunion can recapture past glory or if "peak Mourinho" is gone, leaving both the club and the manager in a precarious position.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut is providing relief to homeowners with variable-rate products like Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs). With average HELOC rates dropping, the monthly cost of borrowing has decreased. For a $100,000 HELOC, the monthly payment on a 15-year term at the current average rate of 8.05% is approximately $959. This is a noticeable reduction from rates seen in the previous year, which were closer to 9%. The article notes that while costs are currently lower, the variable nature of HELOCs means payments could change in the future. (not investment advice)</p>
