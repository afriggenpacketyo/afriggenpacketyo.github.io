          <p>An opinion article suggests that China's global initiatives could provide the necessary reform for the United Nations, which its General Assembly President describes as being at a “make-it-or-break-it moment.” The author critiques Western powers, particularly Germany and the United States, for their roles as arms suppliers to Israel amidst the conflict in Gaza, highlighting a perceived contradiction in their calls for peace. This perspective argues that the UN's current structure and the actions of some powerful members undermine its effectiveness, implying China offers a fresh approach to global governance. The article advocates for a shift in international dynamics to address pressing global challenges more effectively.</p>

          <p>Fading West, a modular homebuilder in Colorado, is offering a solution to America's housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in a factory setting, reducing costs by up to 20% and halving build times. The company, which builds single-family homes, townhouses, and apartment complexes, utilizes lean manufacturing principles and state-of-the-art facilities to complete a 10-ton house in about seven days. This approach was successfully demonstrated in Lahaina, Maui, where 82 modular homes were built for wildfire victims. The article highlights modular construction's benefits, including affordability, speed, waste reduction, and a stable workforce, suggesting it could be key to addressing the nationwide housing shortage.

This settlement follows similar agreements Dominion made with Fox News and Newsmax.

          <p>President Trump has ordered the declassification of all federal records pertaining to Amelia Earhart's 1937 disappearance, a mystery that has fascinated the public for decades. While the widely accepted theory is that Earhart ran out of fuel and crashed into the Pacific, other unproven theories persist, including one suggesting she was captured by the Japanese on a spy mission. A lawmaker from the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged the declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart on Saipan.

          <p>Pakistan's nationwide HPV vaccination campaign, aimed at eliminating cervical cancer, is facing a surge of misinformation, including AI-generated videos and claims from local politicians that the vaccine causes infertility. This article fact-checks these widely shared myths, confirming through extensive scientific research that the HPV vaccine is safe, effective, and not linked to infertility. It highlights Pakistan's historical struggle with vaccine skepticism, exacerbated by past events like a covert CIA operation.

          <p>A new study published in Science reveals that chimpanzees in the wild regularly consume fermented fruit, ingesting alcohol equivalent to more than half a liter of beer for humans daily. Researchers observed chimps in Uganda and Ivory Coast consuming fruit with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, totaling about 14 grams of alcohol per day. This finding, supported by a separate study on chimps in Guinea-Bissau, suggests that regular alcohol consumption may have deep evolutionary roots in non-human great apes, challenging the idea that it's solely a human cultural phenomenon. The article highlights that alcohol consumption is more common in the natural world than previously thought.</p>
