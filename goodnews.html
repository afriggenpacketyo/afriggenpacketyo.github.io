          <p>Australia's immigration minister has confirmed that the entry visa for the American rapper Ye, formerly Kanye West, was revoked due to his pro-Nazi song. The government decided to cancel the visa after he released a track containing the phrase "Heil Hitler" and a sample from a Hitler speech. The minister stated that while every application is reassessed, the country does not need to import such bigotry. This action follows a history of antisemitic remarks from Ye, who is married to an Australian citizen.</p>

          <p>The Welsh women's national football team is preparing for its first-ever appearance at the European Championship, Euro 2025. As the lowest-ranked debutants facing a tough group, the team is relying on strong unity and a deep connection to their Welsh heritage. Coach Rhian Wilkinson emphasizes this "Welsh red vein" and sisterhood as key strengths for a squad with less depth than larger nations. The tournament is seen as a major opportunity to increase visibility and inspire a new generation of female players in Wales.</p>

He was able to contact his sister, who raised the alarm in Thailand, leading to his rescue. The Chinese embassy issued a warning to its citizens about overseas high-paying job scams.</p>

          <p>A new short film titled 'Final Finishers' shifts the focus of sports documentaries away from elite athletes to the everyday runners at the back of the New York City Marathon. The film celebrates the inspiring stories of amateur participants who often cross the finish line long after sunset. It features individuals who have overcome significant personal challenges, such as paralysis, to complete the 26.2-mile race. The creators hope to show that extraordinary stories of perseverance are found throughout the pack, not just at the front.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is inviting the public to help shape the design of the next generation of banknotes for the first time. Citizens have a month to suggest themes, which could move away from the tradition of featuring historical figures that began in 1970. Early suggestions from the public have included diverse themes such as the UK's maritime heritage, famous landmarks like the Angel of the North, and nostalgic classic television characters. The redesign discussion comes as the use of physical cash continues to decline.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Space Force is set to be a major beneficiary of President Trump's recently passed tax and spending bill, with a potential 30% year-on-year funding increase to nearly $40 billion. A substantial portion of this allocation, around $25 billion, is earmarked for the "Golden Dome" missile defense system, a key part of the administration's space superiority strategy. This funding boost provides a significant investment pipeline for defense and space contractors, contrasting with recent budget cuts at NASA and reflecting a strategic pivot toward space-based defense.

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network believe that pieces of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor lit up the night sky over the Scottish Highlands and was captured on numerous doorbell cameras, with local residents reporting an orange glow and a loud bang. The network, which has calculated the object's trajectory from the asteroid belt, is appealing to hillwalkers in the area to keep an eye out for the rare space rocks. Finding the fragments will be challenging in the vast, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>The Australian medical device company Cochlear has launched its new smart hearing implant system in China, making it one of the first global markets for the technology. The device is designed for people with severe to profound hearing loss and functions differently from a hearing aid. Instead of amplifying sound, the implant bypasses damaged inner ear cells and directly stimulates the auditory nerve. The early launch in the significant Chinese market represents a key strategic move for the company in the medical technology space.</p>
