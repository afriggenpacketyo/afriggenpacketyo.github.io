          <h2>Chinese Scholar Advocates for Indigenous AI Knowledge System Beyond Western Influence</h2>

          <p>Prominent Chinese scholar Zheng Yongnian contends that China must cultivate its own artificial intelligence knowledge system, asserting the need to transcend Western-centric frameworks. He voiced significant concerns about "intellectual colonialism" within the AI era, especially regarding social sciences that are rooted in Western practices and experiences, which he believes inadequately explain diverse civilizations such as Confucian, Islamic, and Indian societies. This article emphasizes Zheng's conviction that the humanities and social sciences fundamentally determine the meaning of society and technology, urging China to fully embrace its secular civilization. By forging an indigenous knowledge system, China can assume a more fitting and influential role in the evolving international order, free from Western theoretical hegemony.</p>

          <p>Chloé Zhao's film "Hamnet," which delves into William Shakespeare's family life and the profound influence of his 11-year-old son Hamnet's death on the play "Hamlet," clinched the prestigious People's Choice Award at the Toronto International Film Festival. This article highlights the significance of this win, as the award often serves as a strong predictor for future Oscar success, a feat Zhao previously achieved with "Nomadland." Guillermo del Toro’s “Frankenstein” and Rian Johnson’s “Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery” were recognized as runners-up. The festival also honored "The Road Between Us: The Ultimate Rescue" for best documentary and Park Chan-wook's "No Other Choice" with the International People's Choice Award, celebrating a diverse array of cinematic achievements.</p>

          <p>Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, a highly respected foreign policy leader, has announced his decision not to seek reelection in 2026 after serving 11 terms, stating he is looking for a "new challenge" within the national security and foreign policy realm.

          <p>Barron Trump, the son of US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, has reportedly chosen to attend NYU's D.C. program, opting to remain close to his parents rather than enrolling at the main Manhattan campus. This article highlights that the NYU D.C. program, which integrates coursework with internships and professional opportunities tied to the government, is primarily designed for students pursuing studies in politics, public policy, or journalism. Although Barron was previously enrolled at the NYU Stern School of Business, his decision to relocate to Washington has fueled speculation about a potential change in his academic and career trajectory towards a more political path, particularly given his prior involvement in his father's campaign.</p>
