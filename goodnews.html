          <p>Jerry Ye, CEO of Whale, an AI startup backed by Temasek, discusses the impact of U.S.-China tensions on global AI opportunities, emphasizing that business remains business and their customer base is global. He notes that while the U.S. and China are the largest markets, AI applications will differ, with China focusing on marketing and sales and the U.S. on niche sectors. Ye highlights that China does not face a shortage in AI computing power, as on-device chips become increasingly capable, and that AI's immediate financial impact for businesses will be in marketing and sales due to easily calculable ROI. He also addresses challenges such as complying with local data privacy needs and the importance of real-life videos over generative AI for conveying emotions. </p>

          <p>China has introduced an ambitious plan to upgrade its information technology (IT) manufacturing sector, aiming for self-sufficiency in critical technologies like semiconductors and AI, while circumventing U.S. tech restrictions. The 18-point plan emphasizes AI integration and the cultivation of industry service providers by 2027, targeting over 85% computer numerical control usage in key manufacturing processes. By 2030, China intends to establish a core industrial database to facilitate breakthroughs and advance to the high end of the global value chain. This initiative, led by multiple ministries, arrives as the "Made in China 2025" initiative nears completion, underscoring IT manufacturing's role as the backbone of China's industrial system.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has enacted a law mandating 300 to 400 major companies to participate in a carbon emissions trading system, set to begin in fiscal year 2026. The revised law targets firms producing 100,000 tons of CO2 or more annually, encompassing industries like steel and car manufacturing, which collectively account for approximately 60% of Japan's domestic greenhouse gas emissions. Under the system, companies receive a maximum emissions allowance and must purchase carbon credits for emissions exceeding this limit from companies with a surplus, creating an incentive for emissions reduction. While designed to lower emissions, the system may lead to increased consumer prices as companies pass on decarbonization costs.</p>

          <p>India's heightened concerns over Chinese spying capabilities have led to stringent new security rules for surveillance equipment, impacting global manufacturers. The new regulations require manufacturers to submit hardware, software, and source code for testing in government labs, causing delays and potential supply disruptions. India's policy, prompted by alarm over China's surveillance technology, has sparked warnings from the industry and added to existing trade disputes. While the policy doesn't explicitly target any country, concerns about China's state security laws and potential misuse of tech devices have fueled the stringent testing requirements.</p>

          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's IPO is notable not only for being one of the first significant cryptocurrency companies to go public in the U.S., but also for its share distribution. Existing shareholders are selling a larger portion of shares (60%) than the company itself, a rare occurrence in tech IPOs, with Facebook being a notable exception. While Circle has not provided a specific reason for this decision, it may be due to venture capital firms seeking liquidity after a period of meager returns.

However, the researchers, working at a full-scale test line in China, claim to have found a way to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, mitigating the severe bumps.

          <p>The Trump administration‚Äôs actions against Harvard University have inadvertently fostered a sense of unity on campus, amidst prior divisions over issues like the war in Gaza and free speech. The Department of Homeland Security barred Harvard from enrolling international students, and the government froze billions in grants and contracts, prompting widespread condemnation. Students and faculty, including those with differing views on the Middle East conflict, have rallied in support of the university, viewing the administration's actions as an existential threat to academic freedom and higher education.</p>

          <h2>CDC Revises Covid Shot Recommendations for Healthy Children</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 21:48:57 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children, citing a lack of supporting data. This decision marks a significant shift from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone over 6 months. While most agree that the initial vaccine course provided protection against severe illness in children, the necessity of annual boosters against new variants remains debated. The new guidance takes into account the low risk of severe COVID in most children, while still acknowledging the importance of vaccination for children with underlying conditions or those living with high-risk individuals.</p>
