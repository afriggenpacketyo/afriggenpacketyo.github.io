          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand has developed in the Atlantic Ocean, positioned southeast of Bermuda, marking the sixth named storm of the 2025 hurricane season. Forecasters from the National Hurricane Center predict it will remain over open waters, strengthening to a hurricane by Monday before weakening. This storm follows Hurricane Erin, which reached Category 5 strength earlier in the season, causing coastal impacts despite not making landfall. NOAA had forecast an above-normal hurricane season with 13 to 18 named storms. The storm's trajectory is expected to take it well east of Bermuda, posing no immediate threat to land.</p>

          <p>The UK is set to experience temperatures reaching 30C on bank holiday Monday, marking what is expected to be one of the hottest summers on record. This warm spell is attributed to the remnants of Hurricane Erin pushing tropical air towards the British Isles. However, the pleasant weather will be short-lived, with cooler, unsettled conditions, including wind and rain, expected from Tuesday as the storm fully arrives. Travel disruptions are anticipated over the weekend due to rail strikes and engineering works. The prolonged dry periods this summer have also led to widespread hosepipe bans and concerns about a catastrophic harvest. This article details the weather forecast and its broader implications.</p>
