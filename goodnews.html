          <h2>NHS Urgently Seeks 200,000 New Blood Donors Amid Supply Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 03:57:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The NHS is appealing for 200,000 new blood donors to address a "challenging" shortage and maintain a safe blood supply. The number of regular donors needs to increase to over one million to avoid a "red alert" situation where demand exceeds capacity, potentially delaying treatment for patients. There is a particular need for more black donors, who are more likely to have blood types that can treat sickle cell disease. The appeal comes after an "amber alert" was issued last year due to low stocks, highlighting the importance of regular donations to support patients needing transfusions for conditions like cancer. Increased donor registration is needed to bolster blood supplies. </p>
