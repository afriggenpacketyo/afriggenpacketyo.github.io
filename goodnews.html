          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:30:24 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese sportswear company Xtep International announced a record net profit of 913.6 million yuan for the first half of the year, a 6.4% increase. This growth was largely driven by a surge in marathon participation across China, which significantly boosted sales for its professional running shoe brands, Saucony and Merrell. While the company's main mass-market brand still accounts for the majority of revenue, the professional segment saw the most substantial sales growth, validating Xtep's strategy of taking full control of these brands' distribution in China. The company plans to continue leveraging the influence of its high-end brands to attract mass-market consumers.</p>

          <p>A 47-year-old man has been banned from all football stadiums in the United Kingdom after being arrested for racially abusing Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo during a Premier League match against Liverpool at Anfield. The game was briefly stopped after Semenyo reported the incident to the referee. Merseyside Police have conditionally bailed the man, with conditions including the stadium ban. Semenyo later posted on social media, expressing gratitude for the supportive response from teammates, Liverpool players, fans, and officials, highlighting how the "entire football family stood together" in response to the abuse.</p>

          <p>The Cambridge Dictionary has officially added over 6,000 new words this year, including slang terms popularized on social media like "skibidi" and "tradwife." "Skibidi" is a versatile, often nonsensical term from a YouTube series, while "tradwife" refers to a "traditional wife." The update also includes terms reflecting modern work culture, such as "mouse jiggler," a device used to feign activity while working remotely. Lexical program manager Colin McIntosh noted that internet culture is significantly influencing the English language, and the dictionary only adds words that demonstrate potential staying power.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 06:00:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An American-Israeli epigraphist, Michael S. Bar-Ron, is reanalyzing 3,800-year-old Proto-Sinaitic inscriptions found in Egypt's Sinai desert that may contain the oldest known written references to Moses. The etchings, discovered at an ancient turquoise mining site, potentially read "This is from Moses" and "Declaration of Moses," predating the earliest parts of the Bible by centuries. The inscriptions also appear to express resistance by Semitic laborers against the worship of the pagan goddess Ba`alat, who had a temple at the site. If verified through peer review, this discovery would provide significant new context for historical and biblical studies.</p>

          <p>The Marshall Islands, previously considered the last country in the world without a national soccer team, has made its official international debut in a match held in Springdale, Arkansas. The location was chosen due to its large Marshallese population, which provided enthusiastic support despite a 4-0 loss to the US Virgin Islands. For the community, many of whom have complex immigration histories linked to U.S. nuclear testing, the event was a powerful moment of representation and pride. The team, still new and developing its style, aims to build on this historic first step and compete in future matches.</p>

          <p>A fisherman in Minnesota using a sonar device on the Mississippi River has likely solved a cold case dating back nearly 60 years. Brody Loch discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick and reported it to authorities, who recovered the vehicle and found human remains inside. The car's VIN matched that of a vehicle belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing in September 1967. While the remains await formal identification, authorities believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family. The discovery is expected to finally bring closure to a case that has been unsolved for decades.</p>

          <p>Current Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remain high, offering investors an opportunity to lock in favorable returns before potential further rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. As of August 18, 2025, top CD rates reach as high as 5.5% APY for a 5-year term, significantly above the national average, which is 1.77% for a 1-year term. Online banks and credit unions typically offer the most competitive rates due to lower overhead costs. When choosing a CD, it's crucial to compare rates from various institutions, consider minimum deposit requirements, and review terms such as early withdrawal penalties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted accelerated approval for Novo Nordisk's popular obesity drug, Wegovy, to be used as a treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a serious liver disease. This approval makes Wegovy the first GLP-1 class drug authorized for MASH, a condition affecting about 5% of U.S. adults. The decision was based on a trial showing Wegovy significantly improved liver fibrosis compared to a placebo. Following the announcement, shares of Novo Nordisk climbed nearly 5%, as the new application expands the drug's market beyond weight loss and diabetes treatment.</p>

This will be the first government-coordinated operation of its kind during the current conflict, following a letter from 96 MPs urging action. The children will be selected based on medical need by doctors in Gaza, with the World Health Organization coordinating their travel. They will travel with family members and receive treatment from the NHS. Given the difficulty of returning to Gaza, it is understood some may enter the UK's asylum system after their treatment is complete.</p>

          <p>Canadian Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre is facing a critical by-election in the rural Alberta riding of Battle River-Crowfoot. After losing his own Ottawa-area seat in the last general election, Poilievre needs a decisive victory in this conservative stronghold to re-enter the House of Commons and solidify his leadership. The race is unusual, featuring 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform. While Poilievre is expected to win, the margin of his victory will be closely watched as an indicator of his standing ahead of a mandatory party leadership review in January.</p>

          <p>Cambricon Technologies, a prominent Chinese semiconductor firm viewed as a potential competitor to Nvidia, is planning to raise nearly 4 billion yuan (US$560 million) to fund further AI chip development. The fundraising plan has received approval from the Shanghai Stock Exchange and is seen as a significant step in China's push for technological self-sufficiency. The company's stock has surged over the past year amid strong investor interest in its AI prospects. This move is supported by a government directive for publicly owned computing hubs to source over half of their chips from domestic producers, creating guaranteed demand for companies like Cambricon.</p>
