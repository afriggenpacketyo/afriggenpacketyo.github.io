          <p>A previously lost handwritten letter from Thomas Jefferson, discussing the right of citizens to bear arms in a revolutionary context, has been discovered and is up for sale. Penned in 1783, the letter reflects on revolutionary movements in Europe, specifically mentioning Dutch citizens demanding the right to arm themselves against their rulers, similar to the American colonists' actions. The document, valued at around $90,000, was considered missing by Jeffersonian scholars for over half a century. Its resurfacing offers a significant glimpse into Jefferson's views on democracy and armed citizenry just after the American Revolutionary War.</p>

          <p>A North Korean civilian has been taken into custody after successfully crossing the heavily militarized land border into South Korea. The man traversed the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) within the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), one of the most mined areas in the world. South Korea's military detected the individual and conducted a 20-hour tracking and surveillance operation to guide him safely to the South, navigating dense vegetation and landmine risks. This type of defection is rare, as most North Koreans escape through China, and the incident is currently under investigation by South Korean authorities.</p>

          <p>On the 249th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence, NPR reflects on the evolving concept of freedom in the United States. The article highlights the contrast between the document's ideals and the historical reality for many, including enslaved Black people, women, and Native Americans. It shares perspectives from readers who define freedom as having a voice, feeling safe, and recognizing a collective responsibility to advocate for the liberty of others. The piece also touches on preparations for the nation's 250th anniversary and cultural traditions associated with the July 4th holiday, from barbecue to fireworks displays.</p>

          <h2>300,000-Year-Old Wooden Tools Discovered in China Provide Evidence of an East Asian 'Wood Age'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 06:30:08 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have unearthed dozens of wooden artifacts in southwest China's Yunnan province, providing the first substantial evidence of a 'Wood Age' in East Asia dating back 300,000 years. The discovery at the Gantangqing site fills a significant gap in the understanding of Palaeolithic tool use, as wood typically decomposes and leaves little trace. Published in the journal Science, the finding is considered a world-class archaeological discovery. The tools suggest that early humans in the region had a sophisticated and widespread culture of using wood for various purposes, challenging previous assumptions about technological development in the area.</p>

          <p>A small meteor that created a bright orange glow and a loud bang over the Scottish Highlands is believed to have scattered fragments on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The UK Meteor Network (UKMON) tracked the object, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, as it descended through the atmosphere. Dozens of residents reported the event, with some feeling their houses shake. UKMON is now appealing to hillwalkers to look for the meteorites, though they acknowledge the search will be difficult in the vast, mountainous terrain.</p>

          <p>As temperatures rise, many people are turning to powdered hydration multipliers to stay hydrated, but experts advise caution. While these products can be useful for replenishing electrolytes lost during intense exercise or prolonged time outdoors, plain water remains the gold standard for hydration. Doctors recommend checking product labels for high levels of sugar, caffeine, and sodium, which can be problematic for individuals with certain health conditions like diabetes or kidney disease. These products should be seen as supplements, not replacements for water, and consulting a doctor before use is recommended for those with chronic illnesses.</p>

The project, initiated by law professors, brought together individuals like Stacey Abrams, Christine Todd Whitman, and Gen. Wesley Clark to articulate shared values. Focusing on five key areas—the rule of law, democracy, separation of powers, personal freedom, and equality—the group reached a unanimous agreement on core tenets. The principles aim to remind Americans that despite deep political divisions, a common ground of underlying values still unites the nation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article argues that the best defense of liberal democracy lies in the philosophical concept of 'value pluralism,' as articulated by thinker Isaiah Berlin. Value pluralism posits that humans hold many legitimate but often incompatible values (like liberty and equality, or justice and mercy), meaning no single, perfect utopian society is possible. Because there is no one 'right' way to live, governments cannot justifiably impose a single vision on their citizens. This inherent diversity of values necessitates a political system like liberal democracy, which protects individual freedom of choice and allows for collective decision-making through fair elections.</p>

          <p>India's securities regulator, SEBI, has barred U.S. quantitative trading firm Jane Street Group from its markets and frozen over $566 million in alleged illegal gains. The firm is accused of manipulating India's benchmark Nifty 50 index by making large, strategic stock purchases to influence its value, and then profiting from options bets on its decline. SEBI's order stated the firm's actions were a "deliberate strategy" that disregarded a previous warning from the National Stock Exchange.

Felize notes that Berghain is surprisingly accessible compared to other venues, but she still faces challenges, from practical issues like finding working elevators to social ones like being treated as an obstacle.
