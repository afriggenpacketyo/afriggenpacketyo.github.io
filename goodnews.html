          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter, narrowly avoiding a technical recession thanks to a strong performance in its manufacturing sector. Despite this growth, which surpassed economists' expectations, the Ministry of Trade and Industry remains cautious. Officials warned of significant downside risks and uncertainty for the second half of 2025, primarily stemming from global trade tensions and unclear U.S. tariff policies. The country had previously downgraded its full-year GDP growth forecast, reflecting the precarious international economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will send Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian attacks. Trump stated that the European Union and NATO would fully reimburse the U.S. for the sophisticated military equipment, framing the deal as a business transaction for the United States. This move signals a shift in approach, coming shortly after the Pentagon had paused some arms shipments and as Trump has expressed frustration with the lack of progress toward peace in the region.</p>

This shift from checklist tourism to experiential travel, along with the rise of a more diverse, global tourist base, represents the biggest change he has seen in the industry.</p>

A 5-2 extra-innings win against the Giants provided a positive end to the first half.
