          <h2>Newcastle United Initiates Negotiations to Sign Goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Premier League club Newcastle United has started discussions with Southampton to acquire England goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale. The negotiations are in the early stages, with Newcastle exploring either a loan or a permanent transfer for the player. Southampton, which was recently relegated from the Premier League, reportedly prefers a permanent sale for the goalkeeper they signed from Arsenal in 2024. The potential move would reunite Ramsdale with his former manager Eddie Howe and provide competition for Newcastle's current first-choice keeper, Nick Pope.</p>

          <h2>4,000-Year-Old Handprint of Ancient Egyptian Maker Found on Tomb Artifact</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-28 10:03:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Cambridge University have discovered a remarkably complete 4,000-year-old handprint on an ancient Egyptian artifact. The print was found pressed into the clay of a "soul house," a model building placed in tombs, before it had dried. Curators describe the discovery as rare and exciting, offering a direct and personal connection to the craftsperson who created the object during Egypt's Middle Kingdom period. The artifact, along with its unique maker's mark, will be a highlight of an upcoming exhibition at the Fitzwilliam Museum focusing on the lives and techniques of ancient Egyptian artisans.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has confirmed that Tesla is the counterparty in a $16.5 billion semiconductor supply contract with Samsung Electronics, set to run until 2033. According to Musk, Samsung's new factory in Texas will be dedicated to producing Tesla's next-generation "AI6" chip, a move he described as strategically critical. The deal solidifies a key partnership for Tesla's advanced AI and self-driving ambitions, while providing a major boost to Samsung's foundry business.

          <p>The WNBA is experiencing unprecedented growth in popularity and value, leading to a contentious labor negotiation as players demand higher pay. With stars like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese driving record viewership and merchandise sales, the league recently secured a media rights deal worth an estimated $2.2 billion. Despite this boom, players currently receive only about 9.3% of the league's revenue, a stark contrast to the roughly 50% share seen in men's leagues like the NBA and NFL. Players are arguing not for equal pay to male athletes, but for a fair proportion of the rapidly expanding revenue they help generate.</p>

          <p>A real estate agent with over a decade of experience advises that homebuyers can negotiate on many aspects of a purchase beyond the final price. Strategic negotiations can include asking for seller concessions to cover closing costs, or using those funds to buy down the mortgage interest rate. Other negotiable items include personal property like furniture, additional due diligence inspections, and pre-closing repairs for issues like a faulty septic system, which can save buyers tens of thousands of dollars.

The business failed within a month because, as he discovered, nobody wanted his product. This early experience taught him a crucial lesson: "it doesn't matter how many times you fail, you only have to be right one time." For aspiring entrepreneurs with no money, Cuban advises focusing on "sweat equity" by turning a personal skill into a service, such as tutoring, design, or consulting on new technologies like AI.</p>

          <p>For Americans looking to buy a home or refinance, understanding current interest rates is crucial in a challenging market. As of late July 2025, national average rates for a 30-year fixed mortgage are approximately 6.79%, while a 15-year mortgage averages around 6.01%. Experts suggest that while rates are higher than in recent years, borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable terms. To get the best possible rate, consumers are advised to strengthen their credit score, pay bills on time, and shop around to compare offers from multiple lenders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to Harvard associate professor Alison Wood Brooks, active listening is a powerful but underutilized tool for becoming more influential and likable at work. This involves more than just hearing someone; it requires demonstrating engagement by asking follow-up questions or paraphrasing what was said. This "superhero move" shows you are competent and empathetic, which builds trust and makes you more likable to colleagues and managers. Research co-authored by Brooks shows that simply asking follow-up questions correlates with higher likability, which in turn can lead to more positive performance reviews and career success.</p>

The conflict, rooted in a long-standing border dispute, had escalated with both sides using heavy artillery and rockets, displacing tens of thousands of civilians. The ceasefire is seen as a vital first step toward de-escalation, though maintaining it will be challenging given the deep mistrust between the two armies.</p>
