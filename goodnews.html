          <p>The British and Irish Lions secured a commanding 48-0 victory against the Australia and New Zealand Invitational XV in their final match before the first Test against the Wallabies. Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick of tries in the eight-try rout in Adelaide. While the on-field performance was strong, the Lions faced setbacks with a suspected head injury to Garry Ringrose and a knee injury to Luke Cowan Dickie, which saw him stretchered off the field. The dominant win provides momentum but also raises injury concerns for the team ahead of their crucial upcoming game.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography, "Desi Arnaz: The Man Who Invented Television," reveals that the 'I Love Lucy' star sought help for his alcoholism late in life after a plea to his son, Desi Jr. Feeling isolated and fearing for his life, Arnaz entered a rehabilitation program in 1985, a decision his daughter Lucie Arnaz called the proudest moment of her life. The book by Todd S. Purdum explores how Arnaz's struggles with alcohol and womanizing, stemming partly from the trauma of fleeing Cuba, contributed to the end of his marriage to Lucille Ball. Despite their divorce, the two remained deeply connected until his death from lung cancer in 1986.</p>

          <p>After experiencing chest pains, 13-year-old Micah was diagnosed with Danon disease, a rare genetic condition causing severe heart failure that affects only about 300 families globally. His heart was functioning at just 7%, and he required a heart transplant, a journey his mother, Dr. Brittany Clayborne, had also experienced. Following his successful transplant, Micah and his mother discovered a lack of support systems for teenagers facing similar health crises. In response, they launched Transplant Teenz, a non-profit virtual community to connect and support young people awaiting or recovering from organ transplants across the nation.</p>

          <p>This article argues that modern society increasingly restricts children's natural inclination for free, unstructured movement, to their detriment. With rising sedentary behavior and limited access to safe, open spaces, children are missing out on crucial physical and cognitive development. Experts suggest that activities like climbing trees and wrestling help build a robust "movement vocabulary," which improves coordination and reduces injury risk later in life. The author encourages parents to overcome fears of minor injuries and provide opportunities for such play, emphasizing that it fosters healthier bones, better grades, and improved mental well-being.</p>

          <p>In her new book "Rich Girl Nation," author Katie Gatti Tassin argues that the pressure to maintain an "acceptable feminine appearance" acts as an insidious financial drain on women. She describes the recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare as a "hot girl hamster wheel," where spending on these depreciating assets requires continuous investment just to maintain results. Tassin suggests women conduct a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to see their financial impact and then experiment with cutting back. The goal is to redirect this money toward building wealth through paying off debt, saving, or investing for the future.</p>

          <p>While many students believe finance offers the best career path, recent data suggests job prospects may be stronger for graduates in other fields. A CFA Institute survey found high student confidence in finance careers, but New York Fed data shows lower unemployment rates for majors like art history and philosophy compared to finance and economics. This trend is partly driven by the rise of artificial intelligence, which has increased demand for creative thinking and soft skills often cultivated in the humanities. Consequently, major firms like BlackRock are now actively recruiting more graduates with degrees in subjects like history and English.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently sold approximately $36.4 million worth of the company's stock, totaling 225,000 shares, according to an SEC filing. This transaction is part of a pre-established trading plan announced in March, which allows for the sale of up to six million shares by the end of the year. Huang's net worth has surged to $143 billion, placing him nearly on par with Warren Buffett, as Nvidia's market capitalization surpassed $4 trillion this year amid the AI boom. The sale is part of his scheduled financial planning and not indicative of a lack of confidence in the company. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite the backlash, supporters and politicians have pointed out that Superman, an alien refugee from Krypton, has always been an immigrant.

The new government plan aims to reduce the projected death toll from a major Nankai Trough quake by 80% over the next decade.
