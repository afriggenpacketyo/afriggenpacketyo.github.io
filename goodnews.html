          <p>Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) trade ministers convened in South Korea to address the implications of U.S. tariffs, with many countries seeking engagement with U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. The meeting occurred shortly before a 90-day pause on tariffs was set to expire in July, adding urgency to the discussions. President Trump had imposed tariffs on numerous countries, claiming they exploited the United States through trade surpluses, but later suspended them for negotiations. South Korea's trade minister noted the challenges of trade talks amid upcoming elections, while Mr. Greer also met with the vice chairman of HD Hyundai to discuss potential shipbuilding cooperation as part of a trade deal. The article highlights the economic uncertainty and trade frictions impacting the region, with APEC reducing its economic outlook due to the tariffs.</p>

          <p>President Trump's repeated denunciations of 'activist' judges align with a historical pattern of presidents criticizing the judiciary when disagreeing with court decisions. The term 'judicial activism,' coined in 1947, describes judges who rule based on personal policy views rather than legal interpretation. Criticism of judicial activism has come from across the political spectrum, with presidents like Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard Nixon also accusing courts of overreach. The article examines historical examples of presidential clashes with the judiciary and how the definition of judicial activism has evolved over time.</p>

          <p>Japan experienced record foreign inflows into its equities and long-term bonds in April, as investors shifted away from U.S. markets amid trade tensions. Overseas investors purchased 8.21 trillion yen worth of equities and long-term bonds, the largest monthly net inflows since 1996. Analysts attribute this trend to Trump's tariff policies, which prompted investors to diversify into safe-haven assets like those in Japan. The article discusses the factors driving these inflows and the potential implications for Japanese assets as confidence in U.S. assets is restored. (not investment advice)</p>
