          <h2>Nvidia CEO Warns Huawei Could Dominate China's AI Chip Market if U.S. Restrictions Continue</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that Huawei could dominate the Chinese market if the U.S. continues to restrict AI semiconductor exports to China. Huang acknowledged Nvidia's technological lead but cautioned that Huawei could fill the void if the U.S. doesn't participate in the Chinese market. This comes as China focuses on developing domestic firms like Huawei to build its own AI chip ecosystem in response to U.S. export curbs. Despite this, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei admitted their single chip is still behind the U.S. by a generation, downplaying Huawei's achievements and emphasizing the need for continued hard work. The situation highlights the ongoing tech competition between the U.S. and China in the AI sector. </p>

          <p>Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) is reportedly considering acquiring some of BP's liquefied natural gas (LNG) assets, adding to speculation about a potential takeover of the energy major. ADNOC's interest comes as BP faces underperformance relative to industry peers, making it a takeover target for companies like Shell, Exxon Mobil, and Chevron. Analysts note the long-standing relationship between ADNOC and BP across hydrocarbons and renewables, particularly in Abu Dhabi and Egypt. BP is seeking to restore investor confidence through a strategic reset, including increasing oil and gas spending while reducing renewables investment, and targeting $20 billion in divestments. </p>

          <p>Top European CEOs believe Europe has an opportunity to capitalize on recent volatility amid hopes that U.S. exceptionalism is waning. European leaders from Unicredit to Goldman Sachs have stated that Europe has a significant advantage, citing data showing the Stoxx 600 outperforming the S&P 500 since November 2024. Bank of America reported outflows from U.S. equities and inflows into European stocks, while Morningstar data showed investors withdrawing from U.S. equity ETFs and shifting funds into European ETFs. This shift is attributed to the convergence in U.S. and European growth rates, cheaper capital and valuations in Europe, and a growing innovation cycle. </p>

The proposed changes reflect India's cautious stance on a rise in outward remittances and full convertibility of the rupee. Overseas investments by individuals fall under the central bank's Liberalised Remittance Scheme (LRS), which allows resident Indians to remit up to $250,000 in a single year.
