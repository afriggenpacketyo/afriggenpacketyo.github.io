          <p>Li Licheng, an 84-year-old power grid engineering expert and academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, has signed a contract with Beijing Interstellor Human Spaceflight Technology to book a seat on a space tourism voyage scheduled for 2028. Li, a leading figure in China's electricity industry, plans to make three space trips, one per year, stating that he will only be 89 years old after the third trip. This event challenges the conventional perception of age limitations for space travel and highlights China's growing ambitions in commercial spaceflight. </p>

          <p>Government data reveals that Japan's child population has decreased for the 44th consecutive year, reaching a new record low of 13.66 million as of April 1. The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications released the data ahead of the national Children's Day holiday, indicating a continuing struggle to reverse the declining trend of births. Other news from Kyodo includes Japan and Sri Lanka agreeing to enhance defense cooperation, China rebutting Japan's airspace intrusion claim near the Senkaku Islands, and President Xi Jinping's upcoming visit to Russia for WWII Victory Day celebrations. Also, a survey shows over half of major Japanese firms are not using AI in hiring processes.</p>

          <p>China has refuted Japan's assertion that a Chinese coast guard helicopter violated its airspace near the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Instead, China alleges that a Japanese civilian aircraft intruded into the airspace, prompting a protest from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. Japan, however, maintains its claim that the Chinese helicopter entered its airspace, leading to a strong demand for preventive measures. This incident underscores the ongoing territorial dispute between China and Japan over the Senkaku Islands, which are administered by Japan but claimed by China, further straining relations between the two countries. </p>

          <p>China is expediting the construction of its Burning Plasma Experimental Superconducting Tokamak (Best) in Hefei, aiming to be the first globally to achieve net energy generation through nuclear fusion, with completion expected in 2027. The project involves assembling tens of thousands of components and mastering core technologies, scientifically and technically. This initiative is part of China's broader strategy to secure a clean, safe, and virtually limitless energy source, although SPARC, a similar project in Massachusetts, is pursuing the same goal on a comparable timeline. </p>

          <p>The area surrounding Elon Musk's SpaceX facility in South Texas has been officially incorporated as the city of Starbase, following a successful vote by residents, most of whom are SpaceX employees. The new municipality, covering 1.6 square miles, will be governed by a mayor and two commissioners with authority over local planning and taxation. While supporters envision Starbase as a hub for space exploration, some local residents and environmental groups have raised concerns about the company's impact on the environment and public access to nearby Boca Chica Beach.</p>

          <p>Clinicians at the Department of Veterans Affairs are reporting that the president's mandate to return to in-person work is forcing them to conduct sensitive conversations in inadequate, makeshift spaces. This situation raises serious concerns about the privacy of veterans seeking mental health services, as confidential discussions can be easily overheard. The lack of suitable facilities for private consultations is undermining the quality of care and potentially discouraging veterans from seeking necessary treatment. </p>

          <p>Sarah Snook stars in a new one-actor adaptation of Oscar Wilde‚Äôs The Picture of Dorian Gray, which uses modern technology to critique our image-obsessed culture, while Andrew Scott stars in Vanya, a more analog and introspective adaptation of Chekhov‚Äôs Uncle Vanya. Dorian Gray uses elaborate camerawork and a smartphone to highlight the dangers of prioritizing appearance over substance, while Vanya suggests that embracing multiple voices within oneself can be liberating. These productions raise questions about the role of performance in modern life and whether it corrupts or enriches our sense of self.</p>

          <p>This poem, titled "Good Lord, These Muscadines," reflects on the complexities of intimacy and connection, using the image of muscadine grapes as a central metaphor. The speaker expresses a sense of inadequacy in conveying their feelings, preferring subtext over direct expression. The poem touches on themes of shared experiences, unspoken confessions, and the tension between longing and contentment. Ultimately, it suggests a shift from the belief that longing is the only song to an appreciation of the present moment, with all its imperfections and glut.</p>
