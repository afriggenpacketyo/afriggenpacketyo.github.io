          <p>President Trump hinted at the possibility of lowering tariffs on goods imported from China as trade officials from both nations prepared for discussions in Switzerland. Trump mentioned that the existing tariffs had reached a high point, implying an expected decrease. He expressed optimism about the upcoming meeting, describing it as a friendly endeavor. China's Vice Foreign Minister also conveyed confidence in managing trade issues with the U.S. This article underscores the growing economic pressures on both Washington and Beijing, suggesting a transactional de-escalation might be on the horizon, but analysts caution that systemic frictions will require prolonged negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newspaper headlines are dominated by the U.S. and UK's new trade agreement and the selection of a new Pope. The trade deal, hailed as 'historic' by both leaders, aims to save the British car industry but still leaves some tariffs in place. Meanwhile, the selection of Leo XIV, the first American Pope, was swift and marked by a message of building bridges. The newspapers also reflect on the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day and BlackRock's decision to end flexible working for senior staff.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United States, particularly under President Trump, has shown a renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, driven by strategic considerations related to its geographic location. Greenland's proximity to both Russia and Europe makes it crucial in the nuclear age, especially with the Arctic warming and opening new sea routes. Russia's increasing assertiveness in the Arctic and its economic cooperation with China have further intensified U.S. interest. The article proposes a model similar to the Compact of Free Association agreements in the Pacific to balance U.S. interests with international concerns.</p>

          <h2>Trump Hails Framework of U.K. Trade Deal, Tariffs to Remain on Some Items</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-08 23:27:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with Britain, which could potentially ease the burden of his tariffs and provide a political win for Prime Minister Starmer. The deal aims to increase U.S. access to the U.K. market, including for agricultural products, and reduce non-tariff barriers. However, the 10% tariff imposed on U.K. imports will remain in place. The agreement is seen as a symbolic victory and a relief for British exporters, though it may not significantly address Trump's concerns about trade deficits.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Developed nations that produce tungsten products are starting to diversify their supply sources after China added five critical industrial metals, including tungsten, to its export restriction list. This has caused panic in the industry, which has relied on readily available exports from China for three decades. The element is used to make cutting tools, drill bits and heavy machinery parts. US defence contractors must stop using Chinese tungsten by January 1, 2027.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are advocating for a revision of World War II history, pushing back the start date to 1931 and emphasizing China's role in fighting fascism. They argue that the current 'Western-centric' version, which marks 1939 as the beginning, diminishes China's contribution. This year marks the 80th anniversary of the end of WWII, and China is commemorating the event with its own perspectives.</p>
