        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge to increase their defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as the U.S. pushes for greater contributions amid ongoing conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. The proposed 5% target includes 3.5% for defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure, such as cyber warfare capabilities. While some member states are supportive, others are hesitant to meet the 2% threshold agreed upon years ago. This year's NATO summit is considered crucial, with the U.S. seeking concrete action and commitments from its allies to bolster defense capabilities. Whether these pledges materialize remains uncertain, but the U.S. is keen to see concerted efforts to address global security challenges.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy aimed at boosting economic growth by supporting key industries and lowering energy costs for businesses. The plan includes exempting over 7,000 UK businesses from some green energy levies, potentially slashing energy bills by up to 25%. The British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027, while energy-intensive firms will receive increased discounts on network charges. The strategy also aims to upskill Britons, attract global talent, streamline planning processes, and boost research and development spending. The government's focus is on sectors such as advanced manufacturing, clean energy, creative industries, and digital technologies, with the goal of creating more than one million new "well-paid jobs" over the next decade.

          <p>An NHS psychiatrist in Scotland hopes to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression. Ketamine, known recreationally but also as a medical anaesthetic, could be offered as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). A private clinic in Lanarkshire already offers ketamine-assisted therapy for treatment-resistant depression, combining infusions with psychotherapy. While Esketamine, a nasal spray form of ketamine, is approved for moderate to severe depression, intravenous ketamine is not routinely licensed but can be prescribed off-label. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release updated information on ketamine and other psychedelics later this year.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to focus on a massive increase in defense spending, potentially pleasing U.S. President Donald Trump. The goal of spending 5% of GDP on defense has gained acceptance among NATO countries, largely due to Secretary-General Mark Rutte's efforts. The summit aims to give Trump a win and rebalance the alliance, with officials stressing the importance of Trump's presence to learn about NATO's contributions to U.S. security. While Spain initially opposed the measure, it ultimately agreed after securing an exemption. The summit is also expected to address the situation in Ukraine, although Ukrainian aspirations to join NATO are unlikely to take center stage.</p>
