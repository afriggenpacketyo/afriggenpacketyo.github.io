          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 05:34:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK wage growth decelerated slightly over the summer, reaching 4.7% in the three months to August, while unemployment marginally increased to 4.8%. This data, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), suggests a stabilizing labor market, though younger workers face greater challenges. Employers cite rising national insurance as a factor in reduced hiring, but the overall employment rate has seen a slight increase over the past year. The ONS has noted data quality concerns for the unemployment rate, and this figure will likely influence next year's state pension increase under the triple lock policy. The report indicates a softening labor demand that could ease broader cost pressures.</p>

          <p>India secured a decisive seven-wicket victory over West Indies, completing a clean sweep in the Test series, marking Shubman Gill's first series win as captain. Opener KL Rahul's unbeaten half-century on the final morning sealed the win, following impressive first-innings centuries from Yashasvi Jaiswal and Gill. West Indies initially struggled but showed resilience in their second innings with centuries from John Campbell and Shai Hope before a late collapse. This comprehensive victory places India third in the early World Test Championship standings, setting the stage for their upcoming white-ball tour of Australia and a subsequent two-Test series against South Africa.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is launching the multi-million dollar Janus Project to deploy next-generation commercial microreactors at military bases globally, aiming to reduce reliance on fossil fuels and enhance energy security in contested areas. Led by Dr. Jeff Waksman, this initiative addresses the immense challenge of providing 24/7 power for modern warfare's increasing energy demands, especially in regions like the Indo-Pacific. The program, inspired by NASA's COTS model, will partner with industry to develop and operate these reactors, with initial hardware construction expected by 2027. This strategy seeks to strengthen the industrial base for small reactors and offer long-term power solutions without constant resupply.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump declared the Israel-Hamas war over following the release of Israeli hostages and Palestinian prisoners, presenting a 20-point peace plan. While Trump hailed this as the end of an "age of terror," Middle East experts caution that the most challenging work is just beginning. The Sharm el-Sheikh summit, co-chaired with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, marked the official signing of a ceasefire proposal. However, critical issues like the total withdrawal of Israeli forces, Hamas's demilitarization, and Gaza's future governance under international trusteeship remain unresolved, with some concerns arising about Hamas's potential role as a temporary police force.</p>

          <p>This article debunks three claims made by the White House, including President Donald Trump, linking Tylenol use in pregnancy to autism and advising against giving it to young children. Medical experts, including pediatricians and researchers, refute the assertions, stating there's no scientific evidence to support a Tylenol-autism link or that Amish communities have no autism due to lack of medication/vaccines. Doctors emphasize that acetaminophen is safe and often the safest option for pain and fever during pregnancy and for children when used correctly. Misinformation can be dangerous, and healthcare professionals advise consulting doctors for medical guidance.</p>

          <p>Robertson County, Kentucky, has appointed Randy Insko as its new sheriff, following the resignation of Terry Gray, who faced his third DUI arrest in under two years. Gray stepped down after Governor Andy Beshear demanded his resignation or removal for neglect of duty. Insko, who previously served as sheriff for 21 years, has agreed to come out of retirement to complete Gray's term but has no plans to run in the next election. This decision aims to create an "even playing field" for future candidates, allowing citizens to choose their next sheriff without an incumbent's advantage.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Candid New York: The Pioneering Photography of George Bradford Brainerd," compiles the early work of the civil engineer often called the "father of instantaneous photography." In the 1870s, Brainerd developed handheld cameras capable of capturing street scenes with unprecedented detail, documenting diverse people on New York streets, from musicians to beggars to paperboys. This innovative use of technology provided a unique historical glimpse into urban life, showcasing his pioneering efforts in candid photography. The publication celebrates his significant contribution to the art form and its historical record.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A DHL-NYU study indicates that while President Trump's high tariffs will slow global trade growth, they won't halt it entirely. The report forecasts an average annual trade growth of 2.5% between 2025 and 2029, a slight reduction from earlier predictions but consistent with the past decade. Despite initial surges in shipments anticipating tariff hikes, growth is expected to decelerate from 3.2% this year to 1.6% next, before stabilizing. The study, based on extensive data, suggests that a reversal of globalization is a risk but not yet a reality, emphasizing the resilience of international commerce despite ongoing trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak advocates for a targeted prostate cancer screening program in the UK, arguing it could "save countless lives." Prostate Cancer Research, of which Sunak is a patron, proposes an annual screening for high-risk men (black men and/or those with a family history, aged 45-69) involving MRI, PSA tests, and biopsies, estimated at £25m annually. While Sunak emphasizes the affordability and deliverability, some medical experts express skepticism due to the risk of unnecessary treatments from false positives. The UK National Screening Committee is currently reviewing its stance on routine screening, amidst calls for earlier checks and addressing health inequalities.</p>
