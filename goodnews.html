          <p>Wall Street concluded a strong week with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite both setting multiple record highs, driven by investor optimism over potential interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Positive inflation data from the July consumer price index initially fueled the rally, and despite a subsequent report showing higher wholesale inflation, market expectations for a September rate cut remained high. The article notes strong performance in several portfolio names, though Cisco Systems saw its stock slip despite a positive earnings report. (not investment advice)</p>

The race serves as a measure of revenge for Thompson, who lost the Olympic gold to Lyles by a mere five-thousandths of a second, and sets the stage for their rivalry at the upcoming world championships.</p>

          <p>An academic from the Chinese Academy of Sciences has urged China to implement a top-down strategy to speed up the development of space-based solar power. This technology involves building orbital stations that convert solar energy into electricity and transmit it to Earth using microwaves or lasers, providing a continuous power source unaffected by weather. The call emphasizes the need for China to gain a stronger footing in the new energy sector and close the technological gap with the United States.</p>

          <p>The concept of a "Lighthouse Parent" is presented as a healthier alternative to the trend of intensive parenting, which can be exhausting for adults and damaging for children. Coined by pediatrician Kenneth Ginsburg, this approach encourages parents to act as a steady, reliable guide, providing safety and clarity without controlling every aspect of a child's journey. By allowing children to struggle and find their own solutions, this method aims to foster greater confidence and resilience.</p>
