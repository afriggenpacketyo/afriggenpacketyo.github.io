          <p>In a much-hyped NBA Summer League game, the Lakers' Bronny James and the Mavericks' top draft pick Cooper Flagg competed in a closely watched matchup. While neither player had a standout shooting performance, the game was an intense duel that ended with an 87-85 victory for the Mavericks after James missed a potential game-winning shot. James finished with eight points, while Flagg recorded ten points, with both players showcasing their defensive efforts. The game served as an early showcase for two of the league's most prominent young talents and their potential future rivalry.</p>

          <p>Caesar Sengupta, CEO and co-founder of the fintech startup Arta Finance, advises that the most crucial "superpower" for an entrepreneur is the ability to ground oneself and filter out noise. The former Google executive, whose startup is backed by investors like Sundar Pichai and has raised over $92 million, emphasizes that the entrepreneurial journey is highly volatile. He recommends meditation as a key strategy to maintain focus and manage the immense pressures of building a company from the ground up. Sengupta notes that this practice helps in confronting the constant ups and downs, which is essential for maintaining health.</p>

          <h2>China Removes Hundreds of Dams and Hydropower Stations to Restore Yangtze River Ecology</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 00:00:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a major environmental restoration effort, China has dismantled approximately 300 dams and hydropower stations in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. The project targets the Red River, a critical tributary flowing through southwestern provinces, which is considered a last refuge for many rare and endemic fish species. Over the years, the dense network of dams had severely restricted water flow, fragmented habitats, and blocked crucial fish migration routes, leading to ecological degradation. This large-scale removal aims to revive the natural riverine ecosystem and protect the biodiversity of this vital waterway.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Victoria, Australia, have arrested and charged a 37-year-old man for allegedly sending racist messages to a professional basketball player on social media. The player is widely reported to be Montrezl Harrell, an American athlete playing for the Adelaide 36ers who previously played in the NBA. The arrest, a collaboration between Victoria Police and Basketball Australia, is being hailed as a landmark moment in the fight against online abuse in Australian sports. Basketball Australia emphasized its zero-tolerance policy, stating that the action sends a clear message that hateful behavior will not be tolerated.</p>

          <p>China's Ministry of Natural Resources has announced the discovery of 38 new mineral reserve sites in the first half of the year, a 31% increase from the previous year. These discoveries, which include significant reserves of rubidium and gold, are part of a strategic push to enhance the country's resource security. Investment in mineral exploration, particularly for critical elements like tin, bauxite, and copper, has risen sharply. These materials are vital for high-tech industries, and the new findings are expected to bolster China's domestic supply chains amid a global race for critical resources.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling signaling she will order the Trump administration to halt immigration enforcement tactics that plaintiffs argue involve unlawful stops and arrests. The lawsuit, filed by civil rights groups, seeks to block federal agents from detaining people without probable cause, alleging they have been targeting individuals based on their appearance. During the hearing, the judge pressed the government for specific evidence justifying the arrests and questioned the lack of documentation. A final ruling could place significant restrictions on mass deportation operations in the region.</p>

          <p>Firefighters successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped after a tunnel collapsed in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred in a new seven-mile-long wastewater tunnel being built deep underground, with the collapse happening far from the single access point. A massive response from the Los Angeles Fire Department, including Urban Search and Rescue teams, was deployed to the scene. Fortunately, none of the workers sustained visible injuries, and they were able to climb over a large pile of debris to escape. The project is now on hold pending a safety investigation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New Hampshire has once again blocked President Trump's executive order that seeks to end birthright citizenship for children of some non-citizens. The judge granted a temporary halt by approving a class-action lawsuit filed by the ACLU, a legal strategy designed to comply with recent Supreme Court limits on universal injunctions. The lawsuit argues that the president's order is unconstitutional, violating the 14th Amendment's guarantee of citizenship to all persons born in the United States. The White House condemned the ruling, vowing to fight the decision.</p>

          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate student and pro-Palestinian activist, has filed a $20 million administrative complaint against the Trump administration for what he alleges was a retaliatory arrest and false imprisonment.

His legal team argues the detention was an unconstitutional response to his protected speech. Khalil has stated he would accept an official apology and a policy reversal in lieu of monetary damages, while the government maintains its actions were lawful.</p>

          <p>Kenneth Bianchi, one of the two convicted "Hillside Strangler" serial killers, has been denied parole by a California board. Now 74, Bianchi has been imprisoned since 1979 for his role in a series of murders that terrorized Los Angeles in the late 1970s. He and his cousin, Angelo Buono Jr., impersonated police officers to lure, torture, and murder at least 12 women. After hearing testimony from victims' families and prosecutors, the parole board determined Bianchi remains a threat and will not be eligible for another hearing for 10 years. Buono died in prison in 2002.</p>

          <p>Sotheby's is auctioning the largest known piece of Mars on Earth, a meteorite weighing over 54 pounds that is expected to sell for as much as $4 million. The meteorite, named NWA 16788, represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet and was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023. Scientists believe an asteroid strike dislodged the rock from Mars, sending it on a 140-million-mile journey to Earth. Martian meteorites are exceptionally rare, making this a significant event for collectors and providing a valuable dataset for scientists studying the red planet.</p>

          <p>The Denver Museum of Nature and Science made an exceptionally rare fossil discovery on its own property, finding a dinosaur bone in a core sample drilled from over 750 feet below its parking lot. The bore hole, only a few inches wide, was part of a study on geothermal heating potential, making the find incredibly unlikely. The fossil is believed to be a vertebra from a plant-eating dinosaur that lived around 67.5 million years ago. While not scientifically groundbreaking, the discovery has generated excitement for its sheer improbability and is now on display at the museum.</p>

          <p>Jensen Huang, the CEO of Nvidia, met with President Donald Trump at the White House on the same day his company became the first to close with a market capitalization over $4 trillion. While the meeting's agenda was not disclosed, it occurs as Nvidia grapples with U.S. export controls on its advanced AI chips, particularly to China. The Trump administration implemented restrictions that effectively cut off Nvidia's sales to the Chinese market, a move the company said would cost it billions in planned orders. The meeting highlights the intersection of technology, national security, and economic policy. (not investment advice)</p>

The iconic landmark's restoration was celebrated with a street performance by 60 can-can dancers and a fireworks display. The original collapse in April 2024 was caused by a mechanical failure, and while new blades were installed, motor delays kept them stationary. The return to motion restores a beloved symbol of Parisian nightlife, a major tourist attraction immortalized in art and film since its opening in 1889.</p>

          <p>A political strategist has analyzed 20,000 campaign messages to identify a formula for successful political slogans, pinpointing eight words that consistently resonate with voters worldwide. The words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—act as "emotional shortcuts" that can be adapted across different cultures and political ideologies. While not a guarantee of victory, these words serve as powerful building blocks for creating memorable messaging. The analysis also explores famous exceptions like "Make America Great Again" and considers how AI-driven micro-targeting may be changing political communication.</p>
