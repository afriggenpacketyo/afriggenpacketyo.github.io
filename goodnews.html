          <p>The Senate passed the GENIUS Act, a bill establishing federal regulations for U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoins and creating a pathway for private companies to issue digital dollars. The bill includes requirements for full reserve backing, monthly audits, and anti-money laundering compliance. While the bill faces hurdles in the House, its passage in the Senate signifies a turning point for the crypto industry's political influence. The legislation grants considerable authority to the Treasury Secretary and has drawn criticism regarding potential conflicts of interest related to President Trump's crypto ventures.
