          <p>With college costs continuing to rise, an increasing number of high school seniors are basing their college choices on affordability. According to The Princeton Review, a larger percentage of students are opting for public schools over private institutions due to financial uncertainties and changing student loan policies. The article emphasizes that price is now a significant factor for both students and parents, with financial concerns outweighing academics for many families. Students like Carlos Marin are choosing to attend local universities and live at home to minimize expenses, reflecting a growing trend among graduates. This shift highlights the impact of soaring college costs and mounting student debt on higher education decisions.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia has won a second term, a turnaround for his Labor Party amid a cost-of-living crisis. The conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, also lost his parliamentary seat, echoing the defeat of Canada‚Äôs conservative leader. Voters expressed concerns about struggling to make ends meet, with both parties offering short-term relief proposals. The candidates steered clear of Australia's reliance on the United States for defense and trade with China. Ultimately, Albanese's victory was a recovery from the failure of a 2023 referendum, and Dutton's association with Trump policies hurt his campaign.</p>
