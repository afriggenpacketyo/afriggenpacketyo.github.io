        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>David's Bridal, traditionally known for budget-friendly wedding attire, is expanding into the luxury market with its new Diamonds & Pearls store in Delray Beach, Florida, offering dresses ranging from $700 to over $5,000. This move comes after the company's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in 2023, driven by inflation and economic pressures. CEO Kelly Cook explained that the expansion aims to serve brides seeking premium offerings, as the company previously lacked products for the couture segment. David's Bridal is also innovating with AI-powered wedding planning tools and partnerships with DoorDash for quick dress deliveries, while shifting production out of China due to tariff concerns.</p>

          <p>NJ Transit rail engineers went on strike due to a dispute over pay raises, leading to a complete shutdown of rail service and affecting over 300,000 daily commuters. The union claims that engineers haven't received a pay raise in five years and that they are paid less than their counterparts. NJ Transit suggests commuters work from home and has implemented a contingency plan with additional bus service on select routes, though it can only accommodate a fraction of the daily train riders. New York City is coordinating with NJ Transit to mitigate impacts, and NJ Transit is cross-honoring rail tickets on bus and light rail lines.</p>
