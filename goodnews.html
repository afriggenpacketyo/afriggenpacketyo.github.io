          <p>The NBA has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group led by private equity mogul Bill Chisholm for a record-breaking $6.1 billion, making it the largest sale price ever for an American professional sports team. Chisholm will initially acquire at least 51% ownership, with full control expected by 2028, potentially raising the total value to $7.3 billion. This transaction surpasses previous records set by the NFL's Washington Commanders and the NBA's Phoenix Suns. The previous ownership group, led by Wyc Grousbeck, purchased the team in 2002 for $360 million and oversaw two NBA championships.</p>

          <p>South Korea's Supreme Court has concluded a six-year legal dispute, ruling that Pinkfong's global hit "Baby Shark" did not plagiarize a version by US composer Jonathan Wright. The court upheld lower court decisions, stating Wright's 2011 rendition of the children's folk song, which is in the public domain, lacked sufficient originality to be protected by copyright. Pinkfong's 2016 adaptation became a viral sensation, achieving billions of YouTube views and inspiring various adaptations. This verdict confirms that the popular tune is an arrangement of a public domain folk song, not an infringement on Wright's interpretation.</p>

          <p>This article highlights the diverse career paths of four individuals in the UK who achieved their dream jobs without attending university. Their stories, including a zookeeper, a celebrity photographer, a filmmaker, and a nail technician, demonstrate that success is attainable through alternative routes like apprenticeships and self-taught skills. The featured individuals emphasize the importance of taking time, pursuing passions, and not rushing into decisions about higher education. Their experiences challenge traditional notions of career progression, advocating for hands-on learning and practical experience as valid pathways to professional fulfillment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>BTecs are practical UK qualifications assessed through exams, coursework, and projects, serving as alternatives or complements to GCSEs (Level 2) and A-levels (Level 3). Many students use BTec Nationals as a route to university or direct employment, with popular subjects including health and social care. Recent government plans to streamline post-16 education initially threatened BTec funding in favor of T-levels, but the Labour government has paused and reviewed these plans, saving 157 "key courses" from defunding. This ensures that a broader range of vocational pathways remains available for students, addressing concerns about educational diversity.</p>

          <p>Voltify, a startup founded by Daphna Langer and Alon Kessel, is aiming to decarbonize the $80-billion U.S. rail industry by transitioning freight locomotives from diesel to rechargeable sodium-ion batteries. The company projects potential annual earnings of up to $10 billion by convincing Class 1 railroads to adopt its "VoltCars" system. Despite initial industry skepticism regarding charging time and power supply, Voltify developed an algorithm to forecast energy demands and is building solar-powered microgrids. This initiative, which could save the industry $94 billion over 20 years, represents a significant step towards sustainable transportation, with pilot projects expected soon.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing trend, dubbed "bleisure" travel, shows that over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are bringing family members, friends, or even pets on their work trips. Motivations include reclaiming family time, combating loneliness on the road, and significant cost savings by sharing expenses. While generally accepted, many employees do not openly broadcast these arrangements to their companies due to concerns about professionalism or "policy grey zones" regarding expenses and insurance. Companies are increasingly encouraged to support this trend, provided business objectives are met and costs are clearly separated, boosting morale and loyalty.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has reported a significant increase in Chikungunya virus cases, with over 70 infections in the first half of this year—more than double the previous year. All reported cases are travel-related, primarily linked to an ongoing outbreak in the Indian Ocean region, including India, Sri Lanka, and Mauritius. While rarely fatal, the mosquito-borne virus can cause severe fever and joint pain that may persist for years. The UKHSA is urging travelers to high-risk areas to take precautions against mosquito bites, such as using repellent and bed nets, and to consider vaccination.</p>

While visa-free travel was discussed, it will be addressed in a separate, unconfirmed subsidiary agreement. This pact underscores Australia's commitment to its Pacific neighbors, following similar recent agreements with the Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, and Papua New Guinea, emphasizing a "shared destiny" and long-term regional stability.</p>
