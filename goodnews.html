          <p>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) featured a significant software update, introducing a new design language called Liquid Glass across its devices, marking the first major iPhone operating system redesign since 2013. The update includes a revamped lock screen and new animations. However, the unveiling failed to impress Wall Street, with Apple's stock dropping 1.2% as investors anticipated more substantial AI advancements to compete with rivals like Google and OpenAI. Apple delayed its Apple Intelligence feature, including a "more personal" Siri, citing the need for more development time to meet quality standards, with a restated timeline of "the coming year." The unveiling of the software update was underwhelming to some. Optimism for the future of Apple's AI is still up in the air.</p>

Winfrey was surprised by the story's focus on a male character, given Lamb's extensive work with women in prison. Lamb hopes readers will recognize that addiction is a black hole you can get out of, and that 12-step programs really work.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament are scheduled to vote on decriminalizing abortion in England and Wales, a move that would end the threat of investigation or imprisonment for women terminating their own pregnancies. The current law, dating back to 1861, requires two doctors to sign off on an abortion, even before 24 weeks, necessitating a woman to testify that her mental or physical health is at risk. A proposed amendment aims to decriminalize abortion at any stage by a woman acting in relation to her own pregnancy. However, some abortion care providers have expressed concerns about rushing through changes without proper scrutiny.</p>
