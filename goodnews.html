          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 20:39:07 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A partnership between Los Angeles schools and the nonprofit Trust for Public Land is converting hot asphalt playgrounds into vibrant green spaces. This initiative addresses the lack of safe outdoor areas for children in urban "concrete jungles" and significantly reduces surface temperatures, which can reach up to 145 degrees on blacktops. The new parks not only provide a cooler, safer environment for play but also help mitigate air pollution and support children's emotional and developmental well-being. The project highlights a critical need, as an estimated 28 million children in the U.S. lack easy access to parks.</p>

          <p>The NFL has secured a 10% ownership stake in Disney's ESPN in a landmark deal that will see ESPN take operational control of the NFL Network and the Red Zone channel. This strategic partnership, valued at over $2 billion, solidifies the relationship between the sports media giant and the league for years to come. The agreement is also a key component of ESPN's strategy to launch a direct-to-consumer streaming service this fall, which will include the newly acquired NFL properties. The move aims to recapture "cord-cutting" sports fans and strengthens ESPN's position ahead of future media rights negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Charity Commission has concluded its investigation into Sentebale, the charity co-founded by Prince Harry, finding no evidence of widespread bullying, harassment, or misogyny. The probe was initiated after whistleblower allegations emerged from a bitter boardroom dispute that led to Prince Harry's resignation. While the commission imposed no sanctions and the current leadership will remain, it criticized all parties for allowing the internal conflict to damage the charity's reputation publicly. The regulator has issued an action plan to address governance weaknesses and improve internal dispute resolution mechanisms within the organization.</p>

          <p>A growing number of older Americans are using AI-powered chatbots, like ElliQ, to combat loneliness and social isolation. For retirees who live alone and have limited mobility, these devices offer a form of connection, providing conversation, games, and virtual experiences. One 75-year-old user described her AI companion as the best thing that has happened to her, highlighting the deep need for interaction. While ethicists express concern that over-reliance on AI could potentially deepen isolation, for many users, these chatbots are filling a critical void left by the absence of regular human contact.</p>

          <p>Star wide receiver Keenan Allen is returning to the Los Angeles Chargers, agreeing to a one-year deal worth a reported $8.52 million. Allen, the franchise's second all-time leading receiver, was traded to the Chicago Bears last season in a salary-cap-related move. After the recent retirement of Mike Williams, the Chargers were in need of an experienced pass-catcher to support their offense. The 33-year-old, six-time Pro Bowl selection demonstrated his continued productivity last season and will now rejoin a receiving corps led by Ladd McConkey and Quentin Johnston.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders is scheduled to start the team's first preseason game against the Carolina Panthers. This decision comes as a surprise, as Sanders was listed fourth on the depth chart just a day earlier. The opportunity arises due to hamstring injuries sidelining fellow quarterbacks Kenny Pickett and Dillon Gabriel, while the team's veteran, Joe Flacco, is not expected to see significant preseason action. Sanders, a fifth-round draft pick, now has a prime chance to compete for a roster spot after a decorated college career under his father, Deion Sanders.</p>

          <p>New Jersey has reached a landmark $2 billion settlement with DuPont and its affiliates, Chemours and Corteva, to resolve claims related to "forever chemical" (PFAS) and other pollution. State officials called it the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund the cleanup of four industrial sites across the state that have been contaminated for decades. The settlement addresses the long-term environmental and health risks posed by PFAS, which are persistent chemicals linked to various health problems, including cancer.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% drop in property crime. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a historic 18.6% decrease. While experts find the trend promising, they also note that aggravated assault rates remain high and that many crimes go unreported to police.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has launched a new program called "Families on the Fly" to ease the stress of airport security for parents traveling with children. The initiative creates dedicated security lanes at select airports, including John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, which do not require TSA PreCheck. These lanes often have shorter lines and allow families to proceed without feeling rushed by other passengers. The program aims to enhance the overall airport experience for families, particularly at popular tourist destinations, by expediting the screening process during busy travel seasons.</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, OpenAI has released two open-weight language models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, marking a significant strategic shift. These models are designed as lower-cost, customizable alternatives for developers and researchers, competing directly with offerings from Meta and Mistral. By making the models' parameters publicly available, OpenAI is contributing to the open-source ecosystem, allowing for greater transparency and control. The company emphasized that it conducted extensive safety testing to mitigate risks of misuse before the highly anticipated release, which was previously delayed for safety reviews.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements that have made weather forecasting more accurate than ever, public perception of errors persists. Meteorologists explain this is due to several factors, including the "chaotic" nature of the atmosphere, where tiny initial inaccuracies can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of complex data in a simple format for TV or apps also presents a challenge, as does managing public expectations for 100% accuracy. The article explores how forecasters are using new methods, including AI and "ensemble forecasts," to improve both predictions and how they communicate uncertainty to the public.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from fashion retailer Zara, ruling them "irresponsible" for featuring models who appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog cited the use of shadows, posing, and hairstyles that made one model look "gaunt" and another's collarbones appear overly "protruding." Zara, which has since removed the ads, stated that the models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers like Marks & Spencer and Next, reflecting growing regulatory scrutiny over body image in fashion advertising.</p>

          <p>Following a market pullback, CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors to resist the pervasive pessimistic sentiment on Wall Street, which he termed "knee-jerk negativity." He argued that the investing class is overly scared, causing them to miss opportunities with profitable companies that are performing well. Cramer suggested that many companies are successfully managing the impact of tariffs and that concerns over major tech firms like Apple and Amazon are overstated and easily solvable. He asserted that despite perceived negatives, the underlying performance of many companies remains strong and should be the primary focus for investors. (not investment advice)</p>
