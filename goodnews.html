        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan has requested that eight countries and regions block its residents from accessing licensed online casino websites, as gambling with overseas-based betting sites is illegal in Japan. The government is addressing the issue after revelations of professional athletes and celebrities using these sites, with a police survey estimating over 3 million people in the country have gambled online. Japan has engaged with countries including Canada, Costa Rica, and Malta, and plans to tighten regulations on illegal online gambling by prohibiting websites from directing traffic to casino sites. An analysis of online casino sites available in Japanese found that most operators were licensed in Curacao.</p>

          <p>Residents in the Tokyo metropolitan area are increasingly opposing the construction of large data centers in residential neighborhoods, raising concerns about electricity shortages, heat islands, and obstruction of natural light. Some projects have been scrapped due to local opposition, prompting industry groups to work on improving relations between residents and tech companies. Municipalities are beginning to implement regulations, such as requiring early construction announcements and indicating the location of heat-emitting units. The Japan Data Center Council emphasizes the importance of businesses disclosing information and building trust with affected communities.</p>

          <p>An internet outage affecting parts of Los Angeles and Ventura counties was caused by individuals who cut through fiber-optic cables in an attempted copper theft, though the cables contained no copper. Spectrum reported that multiple fiber lines were cut, requiring thousands of fiber splices to repair the lines and restore service. The company is working with the Los Angeles Police Department and offering a reward for information leading to an arrest, noting that the severing of wires has become an issue affecting the entire telecommunications industry due to the increase in the price of precious metals.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, with a 6.4% jump in May, exceeding analysts' estimates and accelerating from the previous month. The growth was partly attributed to the extended Labor Day and Dragon Boat holidays, as well as the effects of the consumer goods trade-in program. However, industrial output growth slowed to 5.8% year on year, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, undershooting forecasts, while the contraction in property investment deepened. The urban survey-based unemployment rate eased to 5.0%, the lowest level since November last year. (not investment advice)</p>

The Conference Board's China Center noted that the retail data appeared strong, particularly in dining and home-appliances segments, likely driven by holiday effects and consumption-promoting policies.</p>

By using an alternative method to prepare perovskite, the team's PeLEDs reached a brightness far exceeding commercial display screens. When operating at standard brightness, the new PeLEDs had a theoretical lifespan of over 185,000 hours, or around 21 years.
