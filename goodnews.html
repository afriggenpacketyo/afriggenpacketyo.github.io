        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese and U.S. negotiators have agreed to continue discussions on a new tariff deal, though significant differences persist, particularly regarding Washington's duties on Japan's automotive industry. The talks in Washington were described as "fruitful," but no immediate breakthrough was announced as a July deadline for President Trump's proposed reciprocal tariffs looms. The Trump administration has hinted that the 90-day pause on these tariffs could be extended, providing more time for negotiations with key trading partners like Japan. However, the administration's separate, higher tariffs on imported vehicles remain a major point of concern for the Japanese government.</p>

          <p>All four giant pandas from the Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have departed for China, leaving only two of the iconic animals in the entire country. The departure of the 24-year-old female Rauhin and her three offspring marks a significant moment for the zoo's successful joint breeding program with China, which began in 1994. The event, which drew thousands of visitors for a farewell ceremony, underscores the role of "panda diplomacy" in the relationship between the two nations, even as it brings a local chapter of conservation to a close.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-27 20:55:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study in Japan has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people. The research, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, identified diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, seaweed, and green tea as beneficial. Researchers theorize that nutrients like the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables could play a role in releasing mood-regulating neurotransmitters, though they emphasize that more research is needed to confirm the link.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the writer and star of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," reflect on the dark humor that defines their show. The series follows a financially and romantically desperate family of women, with Sadler drawing inspiration from the "bleak" modern dating scene and a desire to explore taboo subjects from a female perspective. The creators feel the success of the first series has allowed them to push the characters into even more twisted and depressing, yet humorous, scenarios for the second season.</p>

As the world faces a growing crisis of antibiotic resistance, researchers and doctors are increasingly looking to phages as a promising, though still developing, alternative to treat incurable superbugs.</p>
