          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto has formed in the central tropical Atlantic and is expected to move northwest, potentially impacting the Southeast U.S. coast. The National Hurricane Center forecasts significant strengthening, with Humberto expected to become a hurricane and possibly a major hurricane this weekend. Another storm system is being monitored over the northeast Caribbean, likely bringing heavy rains to Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic before potentially strengthening near the Bahamas. There are currently no coastal watches or warnings in effect, but residents are advised to stay informed as the storms develop. </p>

          <p>Keir Starmer has publicly stated that the Labour Party needs to address "every aspect of the problem" of illegal immigration, acknowledging past failures to recognize public concerns. He highlighted the need to counter the "rise of the populist Right," citing the increasing popularity of Reform UK as a challenge. Starmer is expected to announce plans for a compulsory UK-wide digital ID scheme as part of Labour's strategy to tackle illegal immigration. He also warned of a "coming struggle, a defining struggle, a violent struggle" for the nation, addressing the wave of protests outside UK asylum hotels. </p>

          <p>According to a top investor, artificial intelligence is in the early stages of a "super cycle" that could last 20 years and have a significant global impact. Raj Ganguly, co-founder of B Capital, suggests this cycle will reshape industries and the job market, with India emerging as a key market for AI native apps. While acknowledging the excitement over AI, Ganguly believes parts of the market are becoming overvalued, as the transformative impact of AI may take longer than expected. B Capital focuses on deep tech, including AI, healthcare, and climate sectors. </p>

          <p>Reform UK is facing scrutiny over the involvement of a tech investor, Harriet Green, in its cost-cutting efforts at West Northamptonshire Council. Green, the founder of Basis Capital, is assisting Reform UK's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) in identifying savings. Concerns have been raised about potential conflicts of interest due to Basis's investments in companies that compete with local government services. The council is vetting Green's access to sensitive data, while Reform UK views this as a potential model for accessing information at other councils. </p>

The settlement will pay authors and publishers approximately $3,000 per book.

          <p>President Donald Trump has stated that he will not allow Benjamin Netanyahu to annex the Israeli-occupied West Bank, amidst increasing global pressure to end the war in Gaza and occupation of Palestinian territories. Trump also mentioned that a Gaza deal was "pretty close." Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed readiness to work with world leaders to implement a peace plan for Israel and the Palestinians. Several countries have recently recognized a Palestinian state, but the U.S. opposes such a move, viewing it as a reward for Hamas. </p>

          <p>A California bill, SB 576, aims to regulate the volume of commercials on streaming services, preventing them from being significantly louder than the content being watched. Introduced after an incident where a loud commercial woke an 8-month-old baby, the bill seeks to close a loophole in the federal CALM Act, which doesn't apply to streaming services. The Motion Picture Association argues the bill could hurt small independent streaming services, but supporters believe it's feasible to regulate ad volume. The bill is now awaiting Governor Newsom's signature. </p>

The Anthony Nolan Cell Collection Centre, in partnership with the National Institute for Health and Care Research, will create 1,300 new donation slots annually. This addresses a global shortage of cell collection facilities, with the goal of ensuring patients receive transplants in a timely manner. The center was part-funded by Omaze, which raised £3.7m through a house prize draw. </p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Humberto, currently in the Atlantic, could potentially interact with another developing system, leading to the Fujiwhara effect, a rare phenomenon where two storms merge or become entangled. Although unlikely, such a collision could alter the paths of both storms, but only slightly. Forecasters expect Humberto to strengthen into a hurricane, while the second system is likely to become a tropical storm named Imelda. Residents in the southeastern U.S. are advised to monitor the storms' progress, as they could bring storm surge, wind, and rainfall. </p>
