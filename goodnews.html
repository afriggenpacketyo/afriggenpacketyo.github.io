          <p>Democrat Xp Lee has won a special election in Minnesota for the House seat previously held by the late Rep. Melissa Hortman, who was assassinated in June. The victory over Republican Ruth Bittner restores a 67-67 tie in the state's House, preserving a crucial power-sharing agreement. The election took place amid heightened concerns over political violence, following Hortman's murder and the recent killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Lee's win prevents Republicans from gaining control of the House and strengthens the position of Democrats in the state legislature.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's exports experienced a smaller-than-expected decline in August, contracting by only 0.1% year-on-year, a significant improvement from the 2.6% fall in July. This was largely due to a rebound in shipments to Asia and a sharp increase in exports to Western Europe, which helped offset a steep 13.8% drop in exports to the United States. Despite the softer contraction, this marks the fourth consecutive month of negative export growth for the world's fourth-largest economy. The data comes as Japan faces political uncertainty with the impending resignation of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that Hong Kong presents a unique and strategic option to co-host China's proposed World Artificial Intelligence Cooperation Organisation, challenging the front-runner, Shanghai. While Shanghai offers robust AI infrastructure and political backing, Hong Kong's "one country, two systems" framework could provide a crucial bridge between Chinese interests and Western partners. The city's independent legal system and international credibility might help ease skepticism and encourage broader global participation in shaping AI governance standards. This move could be a nuanced strategy for Beijing to navigate the ongoing tech tensions with the United States.</p>

          <p>A man from Norfolk has successfully brought his attacker to justice 20 years after the crime occurred. Dan Cooper, who waived his anonymity, was inspired to re-report the 2004 sexual assault after serving on a jury in 2018 and witnessing others give evidence. His renewed effort led to the conviction of Shaun Gilder, who was sentenced to eight years in prison for two counts of sexual assault and one count of assault by penetration. Cooper's story highlights the lasting trauma of the attack and his long, difficult journey to see justice finally served.</p>

          <p>A 19-year-old woman in Chino Hills, California, thwarted a robbery attempt by throwing her tea at an assailant who had brandished a knife. The suspect, 29-year-old Rashawn Lee, allegedly demanded she hand over her beverage in a shopping center breezeway. The teenager's quick thinking of flinging the drink at him created an opportunity for her to escape and call 911. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrested Lee shortly after the incident on one count of robbery; he has since posted bail and been released. No injuries were reported during the unusual confrontation.</p>

          <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella stated that artificial intelligence could boost the UK's economy by as much as 10% within the next five years. His comments followed the announcement of a new $30 billion investment by Microsoft in the UK's AI sector, its largest outside the US. This is part of a broader £31 billion deal between the UK government and several US tech giants, including Nvidia and Google, to build AI infrastructure. The investment aims to stimulate economic growth, create skilled jobs, and position Britain as a key player in the global AI landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This appreciation reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, who consistently chose complex and challenging roles over simpler, heroic ones that his classic Hollywood looks could have easily afforded him. From his early days, he rejected lucrative but conventional parts, instead opting for characters that questioned the American ideal, such as selfish victors and flawed idealists. In iconic films like "The Candidate" and "All the President's Men," he used his all-American appeal as a vehicle to explore the nation's underbelly and challenge audiences. His career is celebrated not just for the roles he played, but for the easy ones he turned down.</p>

          <p>Five partially built homes in Los Angeles' Laurel Canyon neighborhood are set to be demolished after a legal battle spanning over two decades. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office announced a plea agreement with the current developers, who pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders. The structures, part of a development halted in 2002, were ordered to be torn down in 2003 but were instead passed between a series of buyers who attempted to restart construction. The current owners must now demolish the dilapidated and dangerous homes by August 2026 or face significant penalties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New data reveals a significant shift in driving habits in Great Britain, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a substantial increase from just over 6% a decade ago. The trend is largely driven by the growing popularity of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics can be easier for learners, and the AA insurer suggests the need to drive a manual car is becoming irrelevant for many.</p>

          <p>Tottenham Hotspur opened their Champions League campaign with a 1-0 victory over Villarreal, showcasing a new pragmatic, defense-first approach under manager Thomas Frank. The team has now kept four clean sheets in five games this season, a stark contrast to their more attack-oriented style last year. Despite being gifted an early goal, Spurs maintained a cautious structure and limited Villarreal to zero shots on target. While effective, this defensive solidity came at the cost of offensive excitement, with Tottenham themselves only managing one shot on target throughout the match.</p>
