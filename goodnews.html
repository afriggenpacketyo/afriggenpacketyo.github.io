          <p>The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda are scheduled to sign a US-brokered peace agreement on June 27, aiming to end fighting in eastern Congo, where Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have made advances. The agreement includes provisions for respecting territorial integrity, prohibiting hostilities, disengaging, disarming, and integrating non-state armed groups. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio will witness the signing, signaling the Trump administration's effort to halt the conflict and attract Western investment to the mineral-rich region. Previous ceasefires have failed, and it remains unclear if the Congo River Alliance will adhere to the deal. The agreement builds on principles signed in April, but the success hinges on the commitment of all parties to uphold the terms.</p>

The company reported that the Starship "experienced a major anomaly" while on the test stand, preparing for its tenth flight test at Starbase. SpaceX confirmed that a safety area was maintained, and all personnel were safe and accounted for. CEO Elon Musk's SpaceX assured that there were no hazards to nearby communities and requested that people avoid the site, with the company working with local officials to address the incident. The explosion's cause is under investigation, but the event underscores the risks inherent in space exploration and development.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba faces a dilemma in negotiating with the U.S. over tariffs, particularly on autos, as he aims to protect Japan's national interests ahead of an upcoming election. Despite multiple rounds of negotiations, a deal remains elusive, with Japan resisting pressure to concede on auto tariffs, which are crucial to its export-driven economy. Ishiba emphasizes the need for an agreement that benefits both sides, while also upholding Japan's commitment to free trade under multilateral arrangements. Failure to reach a deal could have economic repercussions, especially for smaller suppliers, and could also impact Japan's diplomatic standing in Asia. The Prime Minister is trying to set a precedent for other countries that negotiations on U.S. tariffs can produce results that can benefit both sides, not one side.</p>

          <p>Kate Middleton unexpectedly canceled her appearance at the Royal Ascot, signaling a shift in how she approaches royal duties while recovering from cancer treatment. Royal experts suggest this move indicates a new approach where Kate prioritizes her health and well-being as she eases back into public life. The Princess of Wales, who is now cancer-free, is adopting a case-by-case approach to engagements, with her decisions being responsible and dignified. The cancellation was attributed to the ongoing heatwave in the U.K. and the need for Kate to listen to her body, as she continues to navigate the challenges of recovery.</p>

          <p>Researchers in China have developed a compact, portable neutron gun powered by a controlled nuclear reaction between hydrogen and lithium. This breakthrough in neutron generation technology has potential applications in scientific, industrial, and defense sectors. The device uses an electromagnetic technique to achieve nuclear fusion, producing a beam with 10 billion fast neutrons per second, each packing 3 million electron volts of energy. Unlike previous designs requiring massive accelerators, this portable gun could offer new possibilities for material analysis and other applications.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists have pieced together thousands of fragments of 2,000-year-old wall plaster, revealing frescoes from a luxurious Roman villa in central London. The frescoes, discovered in 2021, depict musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, offering insights into the affluence of the area, described as the "Beverly Hills of Roman London". The art also provides clues about the artists, with one fragment bearing the Latin word "Fecit," meaning "has made this."

          <p>New Zealand has suspended NZ$18.2 million in funding to the Cook Islands due to concerns over deals made with China covering infrastructure, tourism, technology, and deep-sea mineral exploration. Wellington, the Cook Islands' biggest funder, claims it was not informed about the agreements, leading to a breakdown in trust. Fresh funding will be reconsidered once the Cook Islands takes steps to repair the relationship and restore trust.

Chinese Ambassador Xie Feng argued that the trade relationship is generally balanced and that high tariffs on Chinese imports are unreasonable. Xie suggested that the U.S. goods deficit would not shrink as long as export controls, visa denials, and barriers to Chinese firms remain in place. He stated that China is willing to increase purchases from the U.S., but the U.S. needs to ease restrictions on competitive products and allow greater access for Chinese businesses and students.</p>
