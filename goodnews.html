          <p>Negotiations for President Donald Trump's tax agenda are underway, with the House Ways and Means Committee releasing a preliminary bill. However, the process faces challenges due to the narrow Republican majority in the House and disagreements among lawmakers over fiscal responsibility. Some lawmakers are seeking a more fiscally conservative approach, which could affect individual provisions within the package. The article notes that these internal divisions could make it difficult to pass the tax cuts without significant compromise.</p>
