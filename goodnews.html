          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 10:00:01 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Southwest Airlines is set to officially end its long-standing open seating policy, with assigned seats becoming available for flights starting January 27. This major shift is part of a broader business model overhaul aimed at generating new revenue and aligning the carrier with its more profitable competitors. The new system will feature eight boarding groups determined by factors like elite status, fare type, and seat location, replacing the familiar A-B-C boarding process. This change, along with new baggage fees, marks a significant transformation for the airline's iconic customer experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The All England Club's ambitious plans to nearly triple the size of the Wimbledon tennis site can move forward after a High Court judge dismissed a legal challenge from a local campaign group. The group, Save Wimbledon Park, had argued that the expansion, which includes 38 new courts and an 8,000-seat stadium, was unlawful as the land was protected. However, the judge ruled that the Greater London Authority's decision to grant planning permission was a rational and properly exercised judgment. This expansion will allow the prestigious tournament to host its qualifying events on-site for the first time.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 09:45:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As many high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs) opened in recent years begin to mature, financial experts are cautioning savers against common pitfalls. One major error is allowing a CD to automatically renew at the bank's current, often lower, interest rate without shopping around for better offers. Experts also advise against chasing the absolute highest rate without considering the time commitment and one's own financial goals, as liquidity needs can change. Instead of moving funds to a low-interest regular savings account, savers should reevaluate their financial situation and consider alternatives like high-yield savings accounts.

          <p>The state-owned China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) has set a new national record by discovering a significant uranium deposit at a depth of over 3,000 meters. The discovery was made in a sandstone-type deposit, which is typically larger and more cost-effective to mine than other uranium sources. This breakthrough in deep-earth exploration technology is crucial for China, a country that heavily relies on uranium imports to fuel its nuclear power plants and weapons programs. Last year, China produced 1,700 tonnes of uranium but needed to import 13,000 tonnes to meet its demand.</p>

          <h2>Leadership Expert Warns Against Using Flattery, Citing It as a Sign of Insecurity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 09:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to leadership expert Jennifer Schielke, bosses who frequently use flattery to win over their employees are employing a flawed and ineffective tactic. She argues that excessive or insincere praise often comes across as manipulative and points to a leader's own insecurity rather than genuine appreciation. Instead of trying to be popular, effective leaders should focus on authentic interactions, empathy, and addressing difficult issues directly. Schielke suggests that making employees feel valued through meaningful actions, like listening to their needs and fostering a positive culture, is far more beneficial than offering empty compliments.</p>

          <p>A new crypto treasury company, The Ether Machine, is set to begin trading on the Nasdaq with the goal of becoming the largest public vehicle for institutional exposure to ether. The company, backed by a $645 million anchor investment, distinguishes itself from other crypto accumulators by focusing on generating yield through staking, a process that contributes to the Ethereum network's security. Co-founder Andrew Keys highlighted that this strategy makes ether a more "productive" asset than bitcoin, as it can generate a dividend-like return for investors. This launch comes as institutional interest in ether and tokenization grows. (not investment advice)</p>

Though devastated at the time, Mallick used the blunt feedback as motivation to overcome her reticence and develop her communication skills, which she practiced diligently.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new analysis by the JPMorganChase Institute reveals a significant trend of Americans shifting money from standard checking and savings accounts to vehicles like brokerage accounts and money market funds. This shift helps explain the surprising resilience of U.S. consumer spending, as households' total cash reserves are growing when these investment-based accounts are included. The study found that even lower-income households are participating in this trend, seeking better returns in a higher-interest-rate environment. This behavior suggests people are using these accounts for cash management rather than solely for long-term investing, adapting their financial strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the common parental mistake of sidelining young children from household chores, which can inadvertently diminish their natural desire to help and contribute. While it's often faster for adults to do the work, involving children in tasks like cleaning or cooking helps develop crucial motor skills, responsibility, and confidence. Researchers suggest that instead of micromanaging or shooing them away, parents should find a middle ground, allowing kids to participate at their own level. Turning chores into a shared social activity, rather than using bribes or charts, can foster a sense of belonging and familial contribution.</p>

          <p>For savers looking to protect their money from inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) remain a strong option, with top rates currently outpacing inflation. While the national average for a one-year CD is just over 2% APY, online banks are offering significantly higher yields, with some reaching up to 4.45% APY for various terms. The article notes an inverted yield curve phenomenon, where short-term CDs often provide better rates than long-term ones.

          <p>EMJ Capital founder Eric Jackson has made a highly ambitious long-term price prediction for Ethereum, suggesting its value could eventually reach $1.5 million per coin. Jackson's reasoning is tied to his belief that global commerce will increasingly move onto blockchain rails, with Ethereum's dominance in the stablecoin and tokenization sectors driving its value. He argues that as trillions of dollars in assets become tokenized, the demand for ETH as the network's transactional and security layer will skyrocket. While most analysts are bullish on Ethereum's potential, Jackson's specific, multi-million dollar projection stands out as exceptionally optimistic. (not investment advice)</p>
