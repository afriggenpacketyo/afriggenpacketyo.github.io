          <p>Nvidia announced stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue, reinforcing the critical role of its data center business in the burgeoning artificial intelligence infrastructure. The company reported an adjusted earnings per share of $1.05, surpassing the $1.01 estimate, and revenue reached $46.74 billion, exceeding the $46.06 billion projection. Nvidia also forecast impressive sales of $54 billion for the current quarter, outperforming LSEG estimates of $53.14 billion. This robust financial performance underscores the company's dominant position and the sustained, high demand for its AI-related technologies in the global market.</p>

          <p>Kohl's shares experienced a significant 24% surge after the retailer reported fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that substantially exceeded Wall Street expectations, despite a general sales decline. The company refined its full-year sales guidance to the higher end of its previous range and increased its adjusted earnings per share outlook. Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed sales challenges to economic pressures on consumers but highlighted strategic efforts like reintroducing popular product categories and overhauling discount policies. This market response indicates investor optimism regarding Kohl's ongoing turnaround initiatives to reclaim customer loyalty and improve financial performance.</p>

          <p>A certificate of deposit (CD) account can be a valuable option for savers seeking to protect their principal and avoid stock market volatility, despite generally lower returns than market investments. A $40,000 CD can earn between $423.24 for a 3-month term at 4.30% and $9,018.09 for a 5-year term at 4.15%, depending on the term and interest rate. While locking money away incurs early withdrawal penalties, the fixed interest rate offers predictability. Savers are encouraged to consider their budget, goals, and ability to commit funds for the full term, especially with potential rate cuts on the horizon, to determine if a CD is the right move.

          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has formally apologized to Greenland's Inuit women and their families for a forced contraception campaign conducted during the 1960s and 70s. Thousands of women and girls, some as young as 12, were fitted with intrauterine devices (IUDs) without their consent as part of a Danish-administered birth control program. This systematic discrimination caused profound physical and psychological harm, significantly impacting Greenland's population growth and leading to sterility for some victims. The apology, which follows a two-year inquiry, acknowledges a serious human rights violation and seeks to address historical injustices.</p>

          <p>The NFL has relaxed certain restrictions on Tom Brady as he transitions into his second year as a Fox analyst, following the league's approval of his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders. A key change allows Brady to attend production meetings with coaches and players remotely, a previous prohibition. While he is still barred from team facilities for these meetings, he can conduct interviews off-site. The league continues to enforce a rule against "egregiously criticizing officials," which Brady successfully navigated in his initial year, reflecting his evolving dual roles in sports media and team management.</p>

          <p>This article outlines the maximum Social Security payments available to seniors in 2025, emphasizing that the benefit amount is highly dependent on the age of retirement. A person retiring at full retirement age could receive up to $4,018 monthly, while delaying until age 70 could increase the maximum to $5,108 per month, totaling over $61,000 annually. Attaining this peak benefit demands a consistent history of high earnings, meeting or exceeding the taxable maximum for at least 35 years, and strategically delaying benefit claims. The article suggests that most retirees will need supplementary income streams, such as reverse mortgages or annuities, for a secure retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
