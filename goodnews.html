          <p>Shingo Natsume, known for directing popular anime series such as "One Punch Man" and "Sonny Boy," has announced his first original feature-length anime film, titled "ghost (working title)," slated for release in 2027. The film's production will be handled by Madhouse, a renowned animation studio, with original character designs by Natsume Ono and character design adaptation by Norifumi Kugai, reuniting the team from "ACCA: 13-Territory Inspection Dept." The story centers on a young girl named Nike who rebels against the world's absurdities to protect the "starry sky," exploring themes of loneliness, bravery, and subtle emotional changes as she interacts with others. Natsume aims to capture the essence of our times while pursuing a sense of reality through animation.</p>

          <p>US singer Chris Brown pleaded not guilty to an assault charge related to an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub two years ago. Brown faces charges of attempting to cause grievous bodily harm, assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and possession of an offensive weapon, all stemming from the same incident. The judge adjourned arraignment on the latter two counts until July 11, with a trial scheduled for October 2026. Brown was arrested in Manchester last month and later released on bail after paying a substantial security fee, with conditions including residing in the UK and surrendering his passport, though a plan allows him to travel for his tour dates.</p>

          <p>Shares of Eutelsat, a European satellite operator, experienced a 22% increase after the company announced a 1.35 billion euro capital raise, primarily supported by the French state. This capital infusion, along with a debt refinancing plan, will facilitate Eutelsat's investment in its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) capabilities, focusing on business-to-business and business-to-government operations. Following this move, the French state will become Eutelsat's largest shareholder, holding 29.99% of capital and voting rights, followed by India's Bharti Space Limited at 18.7%. Eutelsat recently secured a 10-year agreement with the French armed forces to provide priority-access space resources on its OneWeb LEO satellite constellation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>One of the most extensive collections of painted Roman wall plaster has been discovered during an archaeological excavation in London, offering insights into ancient Londinium. Thousands of vibrant fragments, originally adorning a high-status Roman building, were found in a demolition pit and have been meticulously reassembled. The recovered artworks feature bright yellow panel designs with motifs of birds, fruit, flowers, and lyres, and include what may be the first known example of a painter's signature in Roman Britain. The findings provide valuable information about Roman artistry, literacy, and the lives of inhabitants in the ancient city.</p>

Gates highlights breakthroughs in blood-based diagnostic tests that can detect amyloid plaques in the brain, potentially enabling earlier diagnosis. He notes FDA approval of the first blood-based test for patients 55 and older and emphasizes the importance of early detection, as the disease can begin 15 to 20 years before symptoms emerge. Gates also points to the FDA approval of drugs like Lecanemab and Donanemab, which can modestly slow the disease's progression, and calls for increased research funding to further advance treatments.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers are set to be sold for a record $10 billion to an investment group led by Mark Walter, owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers, marking a significant shift in sports ownership. This sale underscores the increasing value of sports teams, making them too expensive for individual billionaires to own outright, and leading to the rise of consortiums and institutional investors. The Lakers' new owners are expected to benefit from the team's strong fanbase and market presence, despite challenges facing the cable industry. While the sale is likely to benefit the Lakers and their fans, it raises questions about accountability in sports ownership as teams become controlled by less visible groups of investors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study challenges the long-held theory that birds sing at dawn due to better acoustic transmission conditions, such as higher humidity and less wind. Researchers analyzed audio recordings of birds in the rainforest and found little evidence to support this environmental explanation. The study suggests that early morning bird vocal activity is more related to marking territory after inactivity at night and communicating about food sources. While the researchers did not definitively identify a single reason for the dawn chorus, they found support for the idea that it relates to birds establishing territory and communicating about food.</p>

          <p>Japan has been proactive in ensuring supply chain resilience, particularly in rare earth elements, long before China's recent export restrictions. Following China's 2010 export ban on rare earths targeting Tokyo, Japan has reduced its reliance on Chinese rare earths to below 60% through stockpiling, recycling, and investing in non-China projects like Australia's Lynas. Japan's approach serves as a template for Western nations, though escaping China's critical mineral dominance remains challenging. While Japan has made progress, it still relies on China for heavy rare earth elements, underscoring the complexities of diversifying supply chains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese matcha industry, which has recently benefited from a surge in global popularity, faces potential challenges due to the possibility of tariffs imposed by the US President Donald Trump. Concerns have arisen that these tariffs could raise prices and reduce sales, impacting both experts and tea farmers. This uncertainty has caused anxiety within the industry, as a shrinking global market could lead to the loss of a promising and lucrative opportunity. The Kokaen tea farm in Aichi Prefecture is among many in the matcha industry that has benefited from the recent boom in popularity of the Japanese powdered tea. (not investment advice)</p>
