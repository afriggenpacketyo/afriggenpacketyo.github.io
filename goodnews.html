          <p>A cluster of small earthquakes, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.5, occurred near Big Bear Lake in San Bernardino County, California, over a weekend. The seismic activity began late Saturday night and continued into Sunday morning, with the epicenters located in the San Bernardino Mountains. The shaking was described by the U.S. Geological Survey as "weak," generally not strong enough to cause damage but noticeable to people indoors. The area's last major seismic events were the magnitude 6.3 Big Bear and magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquakes, which occurred on the same day in June 1992 and caused significant damage.</p>

          <p>Minnesota Vikings quarterback Carson Wentz briefly left a game against the Cleveland Browns in London with a left shoulder injury late in the second quarter. Wentz sustained the injury while scrambling for a first down and was taken to the locker room for evaluation. Former NFL linebacker and commentator Jonathan Vilma criticized Wentz for taking a physical risk, given that the team's other quarterback, J.J. McCarthy, was also injured. Despite being initially listed as questionable, Wentz was able to return to the game in the third quarter, playing with extra padding on his shoulder.</p>

          <p>George Russell secured his second victory of the season at the Singapore Grand Prix, holding off Red Bull's Max Verstappen. The race also saw McLaren clinch the constructors' championship, though the celebration was overshadowed by on-track tension between their drivers, Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri. A first-corner collision led Piastri to protest that Norris's move was "not fair," reviving scrutiny over the team's management of its title-contending drivers. The event, designated as Formula 1's first 'heat hazard' grand prix, tested drivers with extreme heat and humidity, with Piastri finishing fourth after being delayed by a slow pit stop.</p>

          <h2>Researcher Brené Brown Links Effective Communication to a Tolerance for Discomfort</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-05 11:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Author and researcher Brené Brown suggests that people struggle with communication because it requires vulnerability and a "tolerance for discomfort." In a recent podcast interview, she explained that good communication involves being clear, using precise language, and taking accountability when conflicts arise, skills that are rarely taught. Brown emphasized that tone is often lost in text messages and that honest, direct conversations are crucial in both personal and professional settings. To navigate difficult conversations, experts recommend phrases that show you are listening, validate the other person's feelings, and express a desire to understand their perspective.</p>

          <p>Major real estate and tech companies, including Prologis, Amazon, and Meta, have founded the Sustainable Concrete Buyers Alliance (SCoBA) to accelerate the adoption of low-carbon concrete. Since concrete manufacturing accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the alliance aims to use its collective purchasing power to create demand for more sustainable alternatives. This initiative is designed to provide financial incentives for producers to invest in expensive decarbonization projects. The group will utilize a "book-and-claim" system, similar to the renewable energy market, allowing members to purchase environmental attribute certificates to support clean production without being limited by geography.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, singer-songwriter Yusuf Islam, also known as Cat Stevens, discussed his life and career as detailed in his new memoir, "Cat on the Road to Findout." He reflected on his search for meaning, which led him to convert to Islam and step away from music for nearly 30 years after being told it was forbidden, a view he later realized was incorrect. Yusuf explained that re-embracing music and performing under the name Yusuf/Cat Stevens represents the complete picture of his identity. He also briefly addressed the past controversy surrounding his comments on Salman Rushdie, stating he made a mistake with his "British sense of humor" on a serious issue.</p>

The new film, about a man in self-exile, was a collaborative process that drew the elder Day-Lewis back to acting.

At Eglin Air Force Base, AI systems are learning basic flight and combat maneuvers, with the goal of handling large amounts of data and making real-time decisions faster than a human can. This shift is seen as a necessary response to the growing capabilities of China's air force, with plans to have up to 1,000 AI-piloted aircraft eventually. While a human will remain in control of lethal decisions for now, officials acknowledge pressure may grow to give the machines more autonomy.</p>

          <p>The massive electricity requirements of AI and data centers are driving a revival of nuclear energy, including the development of small modular reactors (SMRs). In Michigan, the decommissioned Palisades Nuclear Plant is being brought back online with federal support and will also host the nation's first SMRs. Tech giants like Microsoft, Google, and Bill Gates' TerraPower are investing heavily in nuclear energy to power their operations. While public perception of nuclear power is improving, experts note that challenges remain, including high costs, regulatory hurdles, and the unproven nature of SMRs at a commercial scale.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to psychologist Mark Travers, the most common source of conflict for couples is not money or sex, but rather their tone of voice. He explains that nonverbal cues carry more emotional weight than the actual words used, and a sharp, flat, or sarcastic tone can turn a simple question into an accusation. To prevent escalation, he advises individuals to catch and correct their own harsh tone by pausing and rephrasing. If on the receiving end, he suggests calmly asking your partner to say it differently, thereby interrupting the cycle of defensiveness without escalating the argument.</p>
