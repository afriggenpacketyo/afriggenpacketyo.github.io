          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-26 11:22:15 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This week, the stock market will be focused on inflation data, Nvidia's earnings, Salesforce's earnings, and Costco's earnings. President Trump's trade policy and its potential impact on inflation will be closely monitored, particularly with the release of the personal consumption expenditures price (PCE) index. Nvidia's earnings and guidance will be crucial, with investors closely watching the impact of the China AI chip ban and new deals in the Middle East. Investors will be looking for updates on AI adoption and economic conditions from Salesforce, while Costco's performance and commentary on tariffs will be in focus (not investment advice).</p>
