          <p>A significant ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas has led to the release of 20 living Israeli hostages from Gaza, marking a pivotal moment in the two-year conflict. In exchange, Israel is freeing approximately 1,900 Palestinians held in its jails, with emotional reunions occurring on both sides. The deal, mediated by the Trump administration, brings a period of relief, though uncertainty remains regarding the return of deceased hostages. The successful exchange has been met with celebrations in both Israel and the Palestinian territories, though officials caution that the truce remains fragile.</p>

Despite being a fugitive, Sullivan continued to post videos from Qatar. He has since appeared in court and was remanded in custody ahead of his next court appearance, facing charges that also include driving without insurance.</p>

Bright stated the decision was personal, citing a desire to focus on her club career and personal life after reflecting during her recovery from knee surgery.

Speaking at the SNP conference, Swinney stated the new sites would operate seven days a week from noon to 8 p.m., with the first one operational within a year. He also criticized the Westminster government's policies on overseas workers, which he claimed have harmed NHS recruitment, and announced a sponsorship scheme to help foreign social care staff remain in Scotland.

          <p>Following the release of all living Israeli hostages from Gaza, former President Donald Trump addressed the Israeli Knesset, declaring the event marked the "historic dawn of a new Middle East." In his speech, which received multiple standing ovations, he celebrated the ceasefire and asserted that the region was finally on a path to lasting peace after two years of conflict. Trump also made an impromptu suggestion that Israeli President Isaac Herzog should pardon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of his corruption charges. The address was part of a broader diplomatic effort, with Trump later traveling to Egypt for a peace summit.</p>

          <h2>Stock Market Recovers as Trump Softens Rhetoric on China Tariffs</h2>

          <p>U.S. stocks experienced a significant rebound after former President Trump adopted a more conciliatory tone regarding trade tensions with China, easing investor fears of an escalating tariff war. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average both rose over 1%, recovering a portion of the steep losses from Friday when Trump announced a potential 100% tariff on Chinese imports. Over the weekend, Trump stated that "all will be fine" with China, which markets interpreted as a sign of de-escalation. Analysts noted that while the immediate risk seems to have subsided, the potential for future trade-related volatility remains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AstraZeneca successfully negotiated a deal with the Trump administration to lower some drug prices for Americans, thereby avoiding the threat of steep import tariffs. The agreement was the result of a prolonged strategic effort by CEO Pascal Soriot, which included meetings with administration officials, a close relationship with Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin, and timely announcements of major U.S. investments. This proactive engagement allowed the non-U.S. drugmaker to secure its position in the world's largest pharmaceutical market. The deal gives the company more regulatory clarity without significantly impacting its revenue forecasts, marking a strategic victory for AstraZeneca.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey from the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) indicates that economists now expect the U.S. economy to grow by 1.8% in 2025, an increase from the previous 1.3% forecast. However, this improved outlook is coupled with predictions of a weaker labor market, with projected monthly job gains slowing to 60,000 for the remainder of the year. The report suggests that while the economy has proven resilient, challenges like stubborn inflation and rising tariffs continue to pose risks. Most economists surveyed believe a recession in the next 12 months is unlikely. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve's recent rate cut, the average interest rate for a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.84%, making it a more attractive borrowing option for homeowners. For a $300,000 HELOC, this translates to monthly payments of approximately $3,615 for a 10-year term or $2,839 for a 15-year term. These costs are significantly lower than they were a year ago when rates were higher. Because HELOCs have variable rates, borrowers may benefit from further anticipated rate cuts without needing to refinance, though they should also budget for potential rate increases in the future.

The retirement of veteran defender Millie Bright and injuries to captain Leah Williamson and forward Lauren James will necessitate adjustments to the defensive lineup. This situation could create opportunities for younger players like Arsenal's Katie Reid and Manchester United's Maya le Tissier to secure more prominent roles. The upcoming friendly matches against Brazil and Australia will serve as an important test for the team's depth and adaptability ahead of future competitions.</p>

          <p>Chipmaker Power Integrations announced it is collaborating with Nvidia to support the development of more energy-efficient AI data centers. The partnership focuses on Nvidia's initiative to operate data centers at a higher voltage (800 volts DC), which reduces internal power loss. Power Integrations will supply specialized gallium nitride (GaN) chips, which are capable of handling high power requirements in a smaller space compared to traditional materials. The company's experience in providing reliable, automotive-qualified chips was a key factor in securing its position as an approved supplier for Nvidia's ambitious project.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a recent escalation in trade tensions, including new export controls from Beijing and harsh rhetoric from Washington, analysts suggest the situation is likely a short-term scare. Both the U.S. and China appear focused on managing immediate conflicts rather than addressing underlying structural issues. Former President Donald Trump recently softened his tone, stating he thinks relations "will be fine with China," which has calmed immediate market fears. However, experts note that this pattern of crisis management avoids the deeper, substantive discussions needed to establish a stable, long-term economic relationship between the two global powers.</p>
