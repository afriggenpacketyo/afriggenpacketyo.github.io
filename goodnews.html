          <p>Denver Nuggets point guard Russell Westbrook has launched Eazewell, an AI-powered startup aimed at simplifying funeral planning. Co-founded with former Charlotte Hornets star Kemba Walker and Donnell Beverly Jr., the Los Angeles-based company uses AI to curate funeral options based on user budgets and preferences. The platform also assists with paperwork, budget planning, invitations, and tasks like canceling utility bills and social media accounts, having already tested its beta platform with over 1,000 families. Eazewell aims to alleviate the burden on grieving families during a difficult time. Optimism regarding the prospect of Eazewell is modest, as it is simply a company announcement.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere around May 10.

While the risk of the spacecraft hitting someone or something is small, it cannot be completely excluded, although the risk is similar to that of a random meteorite fall.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an economy challenged by persistent inflation, certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a way to save money and earn returns that outpace inflation. To secure a good CD rate, consider online banks, which often offer higher interest rates due to lower overhead costs. Also, explore short-term CDs, as they currently offer better rates than longer-term CDs due to the inverted yield curve. Laddering CDs, by buying some for one year, some for two years, and so on, is a practical approach to take advantage of high rates while also saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs during exclusive rituals, potentially shaping social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including "snuff tubes," at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Chemical tests revealed traces of hallucinogenic substance dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and tobacco plants on these tubes. Researchers contend that these rituals, reserved for a select few, played a vital role in the transition from egalitarian societies to stratified ones.</p>
