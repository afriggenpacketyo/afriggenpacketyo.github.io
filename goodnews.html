          <h2>Japan's Cruise Industry Sees Post-Pandemic Tourism Boom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's cruise industry is experiencing a resurgence after the COVID-19 pandemic halted operations in 2020, with demand for luxury maritime journeys surging due to pent-up wanderlust and new investments. Japanese ports are seeing record domestic passenger numbers, boosting local economies that rely on tourism. Shipping giants like NYK Line and Mitsui O.S.K Lines (MOL) are expanding their cruise ship fleets, with NYK Cruises launching the Asuka III and Mitsui Ocean Cruises adding a third ship. The Asuka III, Yokohama-based, will be the largest passenger ship in the Japanese fleet, featuring frescoes and private seaside balconies. These developments indicate a shift towards cruise ships as stable income streams for Japanese shipping companies amidst challenges in their core cargo business.</p>

          <p>Peter Diamandis, founder of the XPrize Foundation, emphasizes the potential of AI and biotech to benefit humanity despite geopolitical tensions and the threat of technological decoupling. He highlights that human biology, math, physics, and chemistry are universal, allowing breakthroughs in one country to be accessible globally. Diamandis expresses concern over cuts to scientific funding in the US, particularly at the National Institutes of Health, warning of long-term implications for scientific discoveries. He advocates for a shift in perspective from fear and scarcity to one of optimism and possibility regarding technological progress.</p>

          <h2>Universities Face Course Cuts Amid Financial Challenges</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-01 20:58:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Universities UK report warns that students could face subject "cold spots" if universities are not allowed to collaborate more to deliver courses, as institutions struggle with cost cuts and efficiency. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) acknowledges the financial challenges and aims to support collaboration where possible, but universities are hesitant due to competition laws. Sir Nigel Carrington suggests neighboring universities should agree on which courses to offer to maximize cost-effectiveness. University budgets are strained by a drop in international students and fees failing to keep up with inflation, leading to course cutbacks and job losses. The government is reviewing higher education funding in England, with Skills Minister Jacqui Smith expressing support for universities contributing more to economic growth.</p>

          <p>Scottie Scheffler secured a four-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament, joining Tiger Woods as the only repeat winners of the event. Scheffler's consistent performance, marked by only one bogey over the final 40 holes, allowed him to maintain his lead throughout the weekend. Ben Griffin finished second after a late surge, while Sepp Straka came in third. With this win, Scheffler has expanded his lead as the world's number one golfer, and Jack Nicklaus praised his playing style, comparing it to his own. The victory earned Scheffler $4 million from the $20 million purse.</p>

          <p>AB Hernandez, a transgender student athlete from Southern California, competed in the CIF track-and-field finals, winning first-place medals in high jump and triple jump and placing second in the long jump, amid national scrutiny and protests. The California Interscholastic Federation implemented a policy change allowing an additional athlete to compete and earn a medal in events where a transgender athlete also qualified. The U.S. Department of Justice launched a Title IX investigation into transgender athlete participation in California high school sports, and President Trump threatened to pull federal funding from the state if Hernandez competed. Protests and counterprotests occurred at the event, with one arrest made following an altercation.</p>

          <p>Pamela Hemphill, a former Trump supporter pardoned for her role in the January 6th Capitol riot, is refusing the pardon, stating that it contributes to a false narrative. Hemphill, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge, believes the pardons are inappropriate and damage Americans' views of the federal government. She has sought assistance from Senator James Risch to formally refuse the pardon, and the Department of Justice has acknowledged her non-acceptance. Hemphill's stance contrasts with other Jan. 6 defendants who sought pardons and used them in court. She expects her protest to garner attention from President Trump, and she has sparred with other Jan. 6 defendants over the riot's whitewashing.</p>
