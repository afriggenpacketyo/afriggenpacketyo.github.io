        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have reconstructed remarkable frescoes from 2,000-year-old wall plaster discovered in Central London in 2021, revealing details of a luxurious Roman villa. The frescoes, originating from at least 20 walls, showcase beautifully painted musical instruments, birds, flowers, and fruit, providing insights into the affluence of the area, dubbed the "Beverly Hills of Roman London." One fragment is scored with the Latin word Fecit, meaning "has made this," hinting at the artists' identity, while comparisons to other frescoes across Britain and Europe suggest the work of skilled painters who traveled the Roman empire. The discovery of the plaster, along with a mosaic and Roman cemetery, highlights the city's early expansion and the Romans' commitment to London as a place to settle and invest.</p>

          <p>Emmet Sheehan made a strong return to the Dodgers after Tommy John surgery, pitching four sharp innings in their 4-3 win against the San Diego Padres. Sheehan's fastball reached 95 mph, and his slider and changeup kept Padres hitters off balance, while Justin Wrobleski provided five innings of relief. Will Smith sealed the victory with a walk-off home run in the ninth inning. Sheehan's successful return adds a promising option to the Dodgers' pitching rotation for the second half of the season.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty in the 2022 death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a trial that garnered significant public attention. Read thanked her legal team and supporters following the verdict, which spared her a life sentence. The case drew widespread interest, fueled by social media and documentaries, with some viewing it as a result of a flawed criminal justice system and others relating to Read's circumstances as a woman. The defense argued that Read was framed by the police for murder, while the prosecution claimed she ran over O'Keefe and left him to die in a snowbank.</p>

Headed by Park Sae-hwan, the circus has adapted by dropping animal acts and focusing on acrobatic performances.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to reclassify products and lower duty rates. This legal practice involves altering materials, dimensions, or compositions to fit a different "harmonized system code." While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions exist, creating opportunities for companies to benefit through strategic design choices. Examples include manufacturers bundling steel and aluminum, or hoodie makers switching to cotton to save on duty costs. Columbia Sportswear and Converse are also cited for using tariff engineering to reduce costs.</p>
