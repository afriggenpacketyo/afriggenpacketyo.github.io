          <p>During a commencement address at West Point, President Donald Trump highlighted his administration's efforts to strengthen the U.S. military, emphasizing an "America First" worldview. He told the graduating class they are becoming officers in the greatest and most powerful army the world has ever known, claiming he rebuilt the military like nobody has ever rebuilt it before in his first term. His remarks mixed elements of a traditional graduation speech with aspects reminiscent of his 2024 campaign speeches, including criticisms of his predecessors. Trump also used the remarks to highlight his administration's achievements, asserting the military's job is to dominate any foe and annihilate any threat to America, anywhere, anytime and any place.</p>

          <p>Iranian dissident filmmaker Jafar Panahi's revenge thriller "It Was Just an Accident" was awarded the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, marking a significant win for a director previously banned from leaving Iran for over 15 years. The award was presented by Cate Blanchett, and Panahi received a standing ovation, celebrating his continued filmmaking despite restrictions. The win extends Neon's unprecedented streak of backing the last six Palme d'Or winners. The Cannes closing ceremony proceeded despite a major power outage in southeastern France, suspected as arson, which was resolved just hours before the event.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman of Pennsylvania has addressed his recent absences from the Senate, attributing them to the weaponization of his openness about mental health issues. Fetterman stated that he felt unfairly shamed into fulfilling senatorial duties like attending committee work and casting procedural votes, which he dismisses as a “performative” waste of time. He claims that media scrutiny has portrayed him as mentally unfit, which he believes is a product of his decision to spend more time at home. Despite his frustration, Fetterman is now attending hearings and votes to demonstrate his capability to perform his job, though he admits to having little interest in the day-to-day work of serving in the Senate.</p>

          <p>French authorities have confirmed that a power outage in the Cannes area, which briefly disrupted the film festival, was caused by sabotage, including arson at a substation and damage to a transmission tower. The outage left about 160,000 homes without power for hours, but service was fully restored by late afternoon. Despite the disruption, organizers affirmed that the closing ceremony would proceed as planned, utilizing an independent power supply. Local prosecutors have opened investigations into the sabotage, though it is unclear if the Cannes Film Festival was deliberately targeted.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The loss of contact lasted about 20 seconds, leading to confusion among air traffic controllers regarding the helicopter's location. The Army attributed the incident to a temporary antenna that was not maintaining contact with the helicopter as it approached the Pentagon. The FAA declined to comment on whether its controllers were unable to get a good fix on the Black Hawk's location because of their own equipment issues, citing the ongoing crash investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board.</p>

          <p>California has initiated a project to create new wetlands on the shore of the shrinking Salton Sea, aiming to provide habitat for fish and birds and control lung-damaging dust. The state began filling a complex of shallow ponds with water, marking its largest effort to address the environmental problems plaguing the Salton Sea. The habitat area in Imperial County is being filled with water after an adjacent area called East Pond received its first water in April, leading to the first 2,000 acres of the Species Conservation Habitat Project. The project intends to create lower-salinity habitats where fish and birds can thrive, helping birds migrating along the Pacific Flyway.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured pole position at the Monaco Grand Prix, marking his first pole since the opening race of the season. He expressed his satisfaction with the achievement, especially doing it against the hometown hero, Leclerc. Leclerc, who qualified second, rued traffic on his first lap of final qualifying. Hamilton's fourth place, was his best qualifying result of the season apart from taking pole for the sprint in China, but the penalty undoes the good work.</p>

          <p>Shoaib Bashir's six-wicket haul broke Zimbabwe's feisty resistance and led England to victory by an innings and 45 runs inside three days of the one-off Test. Bashir claimed 6-81 at Trent Bridge, his best figures in Test cricket, to dismiss the tourists for 255 in their second innings. He removed both either side of lunch. Although Sikandar Raza made 60, England chipped away at the other end. Already in this match, the 21-year-old had become the youngest England bowler to 50 Test wickets and this performance made him only the fourth to have three five-wicket hauls before the age of 22.</p>
