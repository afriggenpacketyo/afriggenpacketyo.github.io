          <p>A viral satellite image shared on social media, claiming to show an Iranian missile strike's aftermath on Israel's Weizmann Institute, has been debunked. A DW Fact Check revealed the image actually depicts an Iranian missile facility in Tabriz that was damaged by an Israeli attack, not the other way around. The investigation highlights the ongoing information war between the two nations, where manipulated or mislabeled visuals are used to spread disinformation online. The actual Weizmann Institute is located elsewhere and has a distinctly different appearance.</p>

          <p>The China National Space Administration (CNSA) has released new images of the Earth and the Moon captured by its Tianwen-2 spacecraft. The probe, which launched in late May, took the photos from a distance of over 12 million kilometers and is reported to be in good working condition. This mission update coincides with reports of Chinese researchers testing autonomous robots in terrestrial lava caves. The tests are designed to simulate future lunar missions where such robots could be used to explore similar underground structures on the Moon.</p>

          <h2>Essay Argues Political Protests Play a Crucial Role in Countering the "Spiral of Silence"</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the often-overlooked value of political protest as a tool to combat the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals wrongly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. Public demonstrations serve as a powerful signal, correcting misperceptions about collective public opinion on sensitive issues like climate change or abortion rights. By making dissent visible, protests can build "common knowledge" and show that a viewpoint is more widely shared than assumed. This can empower individuals, break the cycle of silence, and prevent unpopular policies from persisting due to a falsely perceived consensus.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has officially implemented a new law requiring women to be included in the military conscription lottery system alongside men when they turn 18. This change makes Denmark one of the few European countries, along with Norway and Sweden, to draft women into its armed forces. The period of service is also being extended from four to eleven months for all conscripts. The move is part of a broader effort by the Danish government to bolster its defense capabilities and increase military spending to meet NATO targets, reflecting growing security concerns across Europe.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure giant Cloudflare has announced it will begin blocking artificial intelligence crawlers by default, a move that could significantly affect how AI models are trained. This new policy requires website owners to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to scrape their data, aiming to give creators more control over their content and compensation. Cloudflare, which handles a substantial portion of global internet traffic, argues that AI scraping deprives publishers of traffic and revenue. The change puts pressure on AI companies like OpenAI and Google that rely on vast amounts of web data for their models.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece analyzes the successful New York City mayoral primary campaign of democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani, arguing it offers key lessons for the Democratic party. The author highlights Mamdani's focus on practical, popular policies like affordable housing and free childcare, his moral consistency on difficult issues like the Israel-Palestine conflict, and his ability to build a powerful grassroots volunteer movement that overcame massive spending by his opponent. The victory is presented as proof that a progressive, unapologetic platform can mobilize voters and that people can overpower money in politics.</p>

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, are pushing back against a proposal by private prison company CoreCivic to reopen a local facility to house immigration detainees.

Despite the economic incentives offered by CoreCivic, the community is engaged in a legal and public battle to prevent the facility's reopening, challenging the private prison industry's expansion under the Trump administration's immigration policies.</p>

          <p>Amid ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. and E.U., China has unveiled new tax breaks designed to encourage foreign companies to reinvest their profits within the country. The policy allows foreign firms to deduct 10% of their reinvested profits from their onshore taxes, a move aimed at restoring investor confidence and signaling continued openness to foreign capital. This incentive can be applied retroactively to the beginning of 2025 and is part of a broader strategy to bolster China's economy by making it more attractive for international businesses to expand their local operations.

          <p>The University of California is exploring a systemwide shift from its current quarter-based academic calendar to a semester system, a move that would align all its undergraduate campuses. Proponents argue that a common calendar would simplify cross-campus collaborations, transfers, and access to internships, which often align with semester schedules. However, the proposal faces opposition due to the massive estimated cost of the transition, ranging from $288 million to $371 million, and concerns from faculty about increased workloads. The debate weighs the potential benefits for students against significant financial and logistical challenges, especially during a time of budget cuts.</p>
