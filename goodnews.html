          <p>The UK government has announced a new partnership with major supermarkets and food manufacturers in England to encourage healthier food choices among consumers. The voluntary plan aims to tackle rising obesity rates by having retailers promote nutritious options through methods like special offers, loyalty point incentives, or in-store layout changes. While the initiative is designed to increase accountability by requiring businesses to report on healthy food sales, it does not impose specific targets. The goal is to make healthy eating more accessible and affordable, thereby reducing long-term pressure on the National Health Service.</p>

          <p>Primary schools in Kent, UK, are trialing a new educational program to teach children as young as five about sun safety to help prevent future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which is planned for a nationwide rollout, instructs students on applying sunscreen, reading UV indexes, and understanding the risks of sun exposure. Health experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases the risk of developing melanoma later in life. With melanoma diagnoses projected to rise, the program aims to instill lifelong healthy habits and empower the next generation to protect their skin.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in the Budapest Pride march, turning the event into a major demonstration for human rights and solidarity against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The large turnout was partly a reaction to the government's attempt to ban the march, citing a controversial 2021 law that conflates homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, defied the ban, framing the event as a peaceful show of freedom against a "hateful power." The march celebrated LGBTQ+ rights while also serving as a broader protest against the ruling Fidesz party's policies.</p>
