          <p>Researchers worldwide are exploring solutions to address critical blood shortages, as many countries struggle to meet the demand for healthy blood. Approaches include genetically modifying red blood cells to carry more oxygen, using enzymes to neutralize blood types for universal compatibility, and developing microscopic artificial red blood cells. Though promising, these substitutes carry risks such as anaphylactic reactions and must replicate all functions of biological blood. Research teams in the US, Denmark, Sweden, and Japan are making progress, with some methods nearing human testing, although safe, large-scale production is still years away.</p>

          <p>The WNBA and E.W. Scripps have announced a new multi-year media rights agreement to broadcast Friday night WNBA matchups on Ion, including the first weekly broadcast show dedicated exclusively to WNBA coverage. While the deal's financial details were not disclosed, reports estimate the original deal, expiring at the end of the 2025 season, was worth an average of $13 million annually. Ion has aired WNBA games since 2023, and this season will broadcast 50 regular season games, reaching over 128 million homes. The partnership has seen significant viewership growth, attributed to popular players like Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese, with viewership increasing 133% year-over-year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from implementing parts of an executive order imposing new proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration. Judge Denise Casper granted a preliminary injunction sought by 19 state attorneys general, finding they were likely to succeed in their challenge. This is the second judge to block the order, which aimed to overhaul U.S. elections, but Casper's decision covers more of the directive. The ruling prevents the administration from requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and from directing the Secretary of Defense to update absentee voting applications for military members to include similar requirements.</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its approval of Moderna's RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk of the disease. The vaccine was previously approved for those aged 60 and older, and the expansion follows a clinical trial showing boosted immune responses in younger adults. While the FDA approves vaccines, the CDC sets recommendations for who should receive them, and currently recommends RSV vaccination only for those aged 75 and older or those 60 and over at increased risk. The CDC's advisory committee will need to vote to recommend the vaccine for the new age group, followed by a final recommendation from the CDC director.</p>

          <p>Marine experts believe they have located the remains of the Recovery, an 18th-century British treasure ship that sank off the coast of Wexford, Ireland, in 1787. The ship carried valuable cargo, including marble, bronze, rare art, and natural curiosities collected by James Caulfeild and John La Touche. Researchers identified the shipwreck after discovering a copper sheath, a rudder, and other artifacts. The true value of the cargo is unknown, but La Touche's possessions have previously fetched high prices at auction, and the team hopes to find well-preserved treasures.</p>

          <h2>Consumer Sentiment Rebounds as Tariff Concerns Ease</h2>

          <p>Consumer sentiment has rebounded more than expected in June, as concerns over tariffs and inflation have softened. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index rose to 60.5, surpassing expectations, with both current conditions and future expectations showing significant gains. This improvement coincides with a softening in the heated rhetoric surrounding President Trump's tariffs, and consumers appear to have settled somewhat from the shock of the announcements in April. The one-year inflation outlook also tumbled, reflecting reduced fears about the impact of tariffs on future prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment improved more than expected in June, signaling a surge of optimism as President Trump rolled back some tariffs. The University of Michigan survey data showed a resurgence of shopper attitudes, ending six months of worsening sentiment. Year-ahead inflation expectations dropped sharply, although they remain above current levels. The improvement in sentiment was reflected across all demographics, and the recent trade agreement between the U.S. and China has slashed tariffs, contributing to the market surge.

          <p>Shares of RH (formerly Restoration Hardware) surged after the company maintained its sales forecast and outlined measures to offset higher costs from tariffs. The luxury furniture retailer expects full-year revenue to grow by 10% to 13%. To mitigate the impact of tariffs, RH is shifting more production out of China, with receipts from the country expected to drop significantly by the fourth quarter. The company is also delaying the launch of a new concept until 2026 to gain more tariff certainty and is proceeding with plans to open stores internationally. (not investment advice)</p>
