          <p>Warren Buffett informed CNBC that Berkshire Hathaway is not looking to acquire another railroad, despite a meeting between himself, Greg Abel, and CSX CEO Joseph Hinrichs. The discussion focused on increasing cooperation between Berkshire's BNSF Railway and CSX to achieve similar benefits to a merger, following a new coast-to-coast rail service partnership. This clarification caused CSX shares to fall, along with other railroad stocks, as earlier speculation had suggested Berkshire might join the takeover fray in the sector. The move aims for efficiency without a costly acquisition.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is preparing for its 10th Super Heavy-Starship test flight, aiming to validate upgrades after three prior failures. The mission will stress-test the Super Heavy first stage for a Gulf splashdown and send the Starship upper stage on a sub-orbital trajectory, deploying Starlink simulator satellites. A successful flight is crucial for restoring confidence, especially amid concerns that a moon lander variant for NASA's 2027 mission might not be ready, potentially affecting U.S. lunar exploration timelines.</p>

          <p>The U.S. confirmed its first human case of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite, in a traveler from El Salvador, though public health risk is low. This parasite's larvae infest warm-blooded animals, posing a significant threat to livestock and causing painful, potentially fatal human cases if untreated. Its northward spread has prompted federal authorities to intensify eradication efforts, including a new sterile fly production facility in Texas and increased border surveillance. These measures aim to prevent a potential $10.6 billion economic loss to the U.S. cattle industry.</p>

Calculated by dividing current stock price by estimated next 12-month earnings per share, it helps determine if a stock is overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued. Factors like earnings growth rate, industry comparisons, historical valuation, and interest rates influence the appropriate P/E multiple.
