          <p>Lifestyle icon Martha Stewart, at 84, revealed on the "Today" show that her viral "thirst trap" photos have led to a significant influx of flirtatious direct messages from hopeful suitors. Despite receiving numerous propositions, Stewart confirmed she remains single, finding happiness and fulfillment through her wide circle of friends. She embraced her sensual image after a spontaneous poolside selfie went viral in 2020 when she was 78, later making history as the oldest Sports Illustrated Swimsuit cover model at 81. Stewart prefers focusing on "good living" and enjoying life's experiences rather than dwelling on her age.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese research team has made a significant discovery, identifying 41 new landslides on the moon that have formed since 2009, directly attributing their occurrence to moonquakes. Published in the peer-reviewed National Science Review, these findings challenge the long-held conventional geological wisdom that the moon's internal activity had essentially ceased. The analysis, based on comparing 562 pairs of before-and-after images of 74 unstable lunar sites, is critically important for future human endeavors. As civilization approaches establishing permanent lunar infrastructures and deep-space outposts, understanding these active geological hazards becomes paramount for safety and mission planning.</p>

          <p>The White House clarified that a new $100,000 H-1B visa application fee will exclusively apply to new applicants, not existing visa holders or those seeking renewals. This measure is intended to level the playing field for American workers, who the administration claims are being replaced by lower-paid foreign labor. Separately, an agreement concerning TikTok's U.S. operations is anticipated in the coming days, with the White House confirming the app will be majority-owned by Americans. Six of the seven board seats will be held by U.S. citizens, and Oracle will manage data privacy and control the algorithm. (not investment advice)</p>

Transport Minister Patrick Schneider is expected to formally announce her appointment and outline his broader plans for the company on Monday. Palla, 52, brings extensive experience, having joined Deutsche Bahn in 2019 after roles at Infineon, E.ON, and ÖBB. Her leadership comes at a critical time, following the dismissal of former CEO Richard Lutz amidst widespread delays and cancellations, with Chancellor Friedrich Merz promising a major restructuring and modernization of Germany's transport infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Giulia Baccosi, a ship's cook, unexpectedly found herself stranded at sea for 188 days after embarking on what was supposed to be a three-month cargo voyage from Germany to Central America in January 2020. The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic led to widespread port closures and travel restrictions, preventing her and her 15-person crew from disembarking or resupplying. Facing dwindling food, rationing, and rising tensions in their confined space, the crew demonstrated remarkable resilience and ingenuity. Despite the immense challenges, Baccosi eventually returned to Hamburg, profoundly changed by her extraordinary, unplanned odyssey.</p>

          <p>Chinese tourism to Japan is experiencing a significant boom, largely propelled by a weaker yen which makes high-end goods and cultural experiences more attractive and affordable. Over 6.7 million Chinese travelers visited Japan during the first eight months of 2025, marking a substantial increase compared to the previous year. Wealthier families are notably prominent among these visitors, freely spending on luxury items, diverse culinary experiences, and unique cultural offerings such as stays in traditional ryokan guest houses. This trend underscores Japan's growing appeal as a premier destination for affluent Chinese tourists seeking quality and distinctive insights.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 7-5 victory over the San Francisco Giants, further reducing their magic number to clinch the National League West title. However, the team's positive momentum is tempered by the concerning news that catcher Will Smith has a hairline fracture in his right hand, making his playoff availability uncertain. The "small" fracture was only detected in a subsequent MRI after initially being missed. While the team has managed well in his absence, relying on journeyman Ben Rortvedt, Smith's presence in the middle of the batting order is considered crucial for their optimal postseason performance.</p>

          <p>Anuparna Roy has made history as the first Indian director to win the prestigious Orizzonti Award at the Venice Film Festival for her debut feature film, "Songs of Forgotten Trees." Her triumph is particularly meaningful given her humble origins in a tribal village in West Bengal, far removed from the elite cultural centers. The film, set in the bustling heart of Mumbai, sensitively explores the intimate relationship between two migrant women as they navigate shared experiences of marginality, survival, and same-sex desire in an urban sprawl. Critics lauded the article for its "anguished portrait" and "remarkable subtlety."</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine, a widely popular muscle-boosting supplement, is now being increasingly investigated for its potential cognitive benefits, particularly in alleviating "brain fog." While extensively researched for enhancing athletic performance, new studies are exploring its impact on short-term memory, mood, and focus, especially in women experiencing perimenopausal symptoms. Experts suggest that creatine may increase energy stores in the brain, potentially mitigating cognitive effects similar to sleep deprivation or dietary deficiencies. However, research in this area is still evolving, and dieticians caution about potential side effects and emphasize that it is not a "wonder drug" for all users.</p>
