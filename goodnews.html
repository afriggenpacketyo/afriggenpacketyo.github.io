          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison briefly surpassed Elon Musk as the world's wealthiest individual after a significant surge in Oracle's stock price. Ellison's net worth climbed to $393 billion on Wednesday morning following a 40% jump in the company's shares, driven by a strong outlook for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business. Although the stock's gains later moderated, placing Musk back on top, the event highlights Oracle's growing market power amid high demand for data centers. The article also notes Ellison's close ties to President Trump and his ambitions in the media sector.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour has finally shared her thoughts on the 2006 film "The Devil Wears Prada." Wintour, who inspired the demanding character Miranda Priestly, called the movie a "fair shot" that had significant humor and wit. She praised Meryl Streep's fantastic performance and recalled attending the premiere wearing Prada, unaware of the film's plot but hearing concerns from the fashion industry. Her overdue review comes as a sequel to the hit film is in production, with a planned release in May 2026.</p>

          <h2>Financial Experts Suggest Renewing CDs Despite Anticipated Federal Reserve Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 16:39:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, savers holding maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) may be hesitant to renew them. However, this article argues that renewing could be a wise financial move to lock in currently competitive rates before they fall further. Interest rates on CDs are still high, and renewing protects savings from the declining returns that will affect variable-rate accounts like high-yield savings. Since banks may have already priced in the anticipated cut, acting promptly to secure a new CD term can safeguard earnings against future rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle experienced a historic surge in its stock value, climbing nearly 36% in a single day after announcing a massive backlog of contracted revenue. The company's remaining performance obligations reached an astounding $455 billion, far exceeding analyst expectations and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. This dramatic growth is attributed to soaring demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure, which is crucial for running artificial intelligence workloads for major tech companies. The rally overshadowed a slight miss on quarterly earnings and revenue, signaling strong investor confidence in Oracle's central role in the AI boom.</p>

          <p>Former football star and presenter Gary Lineker has won the Best TV Presenter award at the UK's National Television Awards, ending the 23-year consecutive winning streak of duo Ant and Dec. Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's "Match of the Day" after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award by thanking his colleagues. He also commented that the win demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for those without a voice. The result was a major upset at the popular awards ceremony, where winners are determined entirely by public vote.</p>

          <p>NASA scientists have announced that a rock sample collected by the Perseverance rover on Mars contains potential "biosignatures," marking a significant step toward determining if life ever existed on the planet. The sample, named Sapphire Canyon, was gathered from an ancient river valley in the Jezero Crater and exhibits textures and mineral compositions often associated with microbial life on Earth. While researchers cannot yet rule out non-biological origins, the finding has generated considerable excitement. The next crucial step is the Mars Sample Return mission, which aims to bring the rock to Earth for in-depth analysis.</p>

          <p>Swedish fintech firm Klarna made a strong debut on the New York Stock Exchange, with its shares closing up 15% at $45.82. The company, known for its "buy now, pay later" services, priced its initial public offering above the expected range at $40 per share, raising $1.37 billion. This successful IPO signals robust investor appetite for new tech listings and will test Wall Street's confidence in Klarna's expansion into banking services, including a new debit card. The public offering also generated substantial returns for early investors like Sequoia Capital, which first backed the company in 2010.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has initiated a public petition against FIFA's use of "dynamic pricing" for the 2026 World Cup, calling the practice an "affront to the game." Mamdani argues that the pricing model, which allows ticket costs to fluctuate with demand, will make attending matches unaffordable for many genuine fans and prioritize profit over the sport's accessibility. His petition demands an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and an allocation of 15% of tickets for local residents. The move aligns with Mamdani's broader political focus on affordability in his surprising rise in city politics.</p>

          <p>A weekend-long bus strike that threatened to disrupt dozens of routes in London has been mostly called off after a pay offer was accepted. The Unite union announced that employees of London United, who operate the majority of the affected routes, voted to accept a new deal, canceling their planned walkout. However, negotiations are still ongoing with another operator, London Transit, meaning a small number of routes in north-west and south-west London could still face disruptions. The resolution averts wider travel chaos in the capital, which has already been impacted by a separate strike on the London Underground.</p>

          <p>Boeing has reached a tentative five-year labor agreement with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, potentially ending a strike by over 3,000 defense workers. The new deal, which is subject to a ratification vote on Friday, reportedly includes improved wages and the restoration of a signing bonus. The employees, primarily based in St. Louis, Missouri, assemble F-15 fighter jets and have been on strike since early August after rejecting a previous contract offer. This walkout was the first of its kind for this union at Boeing in nearly three decades.</p>

          <p>A new study by the China-Brazil Business Council found that imports from China supported 5.2 million jobs in Brazil in 2024, more than double the number linked to Brazilian exports to China. The report underscores the deep economic interdependence between the two nations, whose bilateral commerce has grown nearly fivefold over the past two decades. While export-related jobs offered higher salaries, the impact of imports was found to be more widespread across Brazilian industries and communities. However, the study also highlights the risk of this reliance, as 80% of Brazil's exports to China are concentrated in just three commodities.</p>

The report, based on provisional data, shows that heart disease, cancer, and unintentional injuries were the top three causes of death last year. Despite the overall drop in the death rate, fatalities from both heart disease and cancer saw an increase compared to the previous year.</p>
