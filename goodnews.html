          <h2>England Planning Reform Aims to Facilitate Heat Pump Installation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-28 19:11:12 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The British government is easing planning restrictions to promote the installation of heat pumps, a key part of its Warm Homes Plan. A previous rule requiring heat pumps to be one meter from a neighbor's property has been lifted, potentially benefiting millions of homes in England. While the industry welcomes the change, consumer groups note that the high upfront costs and potential need for insulation upgrades remain significant barriers, particularly for renters and those in older properties. The government hopes the changes will help lower household bills and reduce planet-warming emissions, but challenges persist in making heat pumps accessible to all.</p>
