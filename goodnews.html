          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that Russian truck drivers unknowingly transported platforms used in Ukraine's drone attack on Russian warplanes. The drones were hidden in "mobile houses" with retractable roofs, which were remotely opened to conduct the operation. Zelenskyy emphasized that the drivers were simply doing their job and were unaware of the contents they were transporting. He also noted that Ukraine's secret services used only domestically produced weapons in the attack, which damaged over 40 Russian bombers, representing a significant portion of Russia's strategic bomber fleet.</p>

The infection spreads through direct contact with animals or contaminated surfaces. Organizers of Open Farm Sunday emphasized that participating farms adhere to high health and safety standards, but visitors are urged to take precautions to minimize the risk of infection.

Some believe it was a substitute for meat for poor farmers, while others suggest English pubs mocked the Welsh for not affording real rabbit. Welsh food historian Carwyn Graves associates it with Welsh culture, as cheese was vital in European diets, especially in Wales. The dish's name appeared later, with early English cookbooks using terms like Welsh rabbit. The theory that the name is linked to actual rabbits is not historically proven.</p>

Walmart CEO Doug McMillon stood by the decision to announce the price increases. About two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the U.S. is made, grown or assembled in the country.
