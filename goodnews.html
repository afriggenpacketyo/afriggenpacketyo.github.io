        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Patti Davis, daughter of Ronald Reagan, reflects on President Joe Biden's recent prostate cancer diagnosis, drawing parallels to her father's announcement of his Alzheimer's diagnosis in 1994. Davis argues that Biden's openness about his health can provide leadership on a human level, transcending political divides. She notes that while cancer is openly discussed, the emotional impact often isn't, and Biden has an opportunity to connect with voters by sharing his personal experience. Davis contrasts this with speculation about Biden's fitness for office and suggests candor could restore trust, while also noting that her father also faced accusations of hiding his illness.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece on Fox News draws parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump, arguing that both men are conservative/populist outsiders who challenged the political establishment. The article highlights Reagan's opposition to the Soviet Union and his desire to eliminate certain government departments, mirroring Trump's policies. It also notes that both presidents were popular with blue-collar voters and possessed a strong sense of humor. The author contends that the Republican Party has embraced tax cuts, a strong national defense, and a pro-life stance due to Reagan's influence, which Trump continues to pursue. The only potential difference between them, according to the article, is on trade, but the author notes that Reagan also used tariffs to save Harley-Davidson.</p>

          <p>China's central bank reduced the five-year loan prime rate (LPR), a key reference for mortgage loans, by 10 basis points in an effort to stabilize the struggling property market. The one-year loan prime rate was also cut by 0.1 percentage points. This action follows a previous cut to the seven-day reverse repo rate, and comes as Beijing attempts to revive the property sector, which has been a drag on the economy. The article notes that these efforts are aimed at boosting domestic demand and ensuring economic stability amidst external risks under Donald Trump‚Äôs second presidency.</p>

          <p>NASA engineers successfully revived a dormant primary roll thruster on Voyager 1 after it had been inactive for two decades. The decision to reactivate the thruster was prompted by concerns about the spacecraft's backup thrusters, which were showing signs of potential failure. This was a critical maneuver as the thrusters are essential for maintaining the spacecraft's antenna alignment with Earth. The successful revival ensures Voyager 1 can continue its mission of exploring interstellar space, with the team optimistic about keeping it operational through its 50th anniversary in 2027.</p>

Investors are optimistic about the company's prospects in the electric vehicle (EV) market. CATL raised HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion) in its IPO, which will be used to build a factory in Hungary to supply batteries to European automotive clients. The company's expansion into Europe coincides with global expansions from Chinese EV makers, amidst increased scrutiny from the U.S. and EU. The article also notes that CATL found itself in the crosshairs of U.S.-China trade earlier this year, with the Pentagon putting it on a watchlist over suspected links to China's military, allegations the company has rejected.</p>

          <p>Japan's animation industry is increasingly embracing AI, despite concerns from artists about copyright infringement and job losses. Japan's copyright laws are permissive, allowing the use of copyrighted materials to train AI models without the consent of the copyright holder. This is due to a labor crunch in the anime industry and the country's embrace of technology. While many artists are worried about AI, some studios are using AI to assist with coloring, background generation, and turning photos and videos into anime, which saves time and effort. However, some experts don't see this as threatening creativity in the East Asian country.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to initiate offshore "blue carbon" research to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea, aiming to accelerate decarbonization. The project seeks to leverage the ability of marine vegetation, such as mangroves and kelp, to absorb and store more carbon than terrestrial vegetation. The Environment Ministry will commission studies on seaweed behavior at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact of such projects. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon.</p>
