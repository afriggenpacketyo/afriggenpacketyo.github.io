          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB, Pure Storage, and Snowflake, saw their stock prices surge significantly this week, signaling that the financial benefits of the AI boom are extending beyond chipmakers like Nvidia. MongoDB's stock had its best week on record, jumping 44% after reporting strong revenue growth and customer acquisition, with many new clients being AI-native companies. Similarly, Pure Storage and Snowflake exceeded earnings expectations and raised their forecasts, citing strong demand for data management and analytics solutions that support AI applications. This trend suggests growing investor confidence in the broader software sector's ability to capitalize on artificial intelligence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's attempt to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals panel unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration's action was unlawful. The judges argued that Congress designed the TPS program to be insulated from electoral politics, providing stability for individuals from countries in crisis. This ruling temporarily safeguards the ability of these Venezuelan nationals to live and work legally in the United States.</p>

Despite playing an early morning match, which he admitted is not his preference, Alcaraz displayed dominant form from the start. The Spanish player, who won the tournament in 2022, briefly received treatment on his right knee during the second set but stated afterward that it was not a cause for concern. He is aiming for his second Grand Slam title of the year and could reclaim the world number one ranking depending on his performance in New York.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 concluded a successful August with a slight decline, ending a four-week winning streak, though it still gained over 2% for the month. The week's dip was partly driven by profit-taking ahead of the Labor Day weekend and a modest drop in Nvidia's stock despite a strong earnings report. Inflation remains a key concern for investors, as the Federal Reserve's preferred gauge, the PCE price index, showed core inflation ticking up to 2.9% annually. Despite this, the market still largely anticipates an interest rate cut at the Fed's September meeting, following recent comments from Chairman Jerome Powell. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Meta to Modify AI Chatbot Responses for Teens Amid Senate Investigation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 16:34:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Meta has announced it will temporarily change its AI chatbot policies for teenage users in response to concerns from lawmakers about inappropriate conversations. The company is retraining its AI to avoid generating responses on sensitive topics like self-harm and to prevent potentially inappropriate romantic discussions, instead directing teens to expert resources. This move follows the launch of an investigation by Senator Josh Hawley after reports revealed the AI was permitted to have "romantic" and "sensual" conversations with minors. An advocacy group recently assessed Meta AI as unsafe for anyone under 18, urging a complete rebuild with safety as the top priority.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the next round of COVID-19 vaccines but has changed its guidance on who should receive them. Previously, the vaccines were available to nearly everyone aged 6 months and older. Under the new guidelines, the updated shots are now limited to individuals at higher risk for serious complications from the virus. This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems. This shift marks a significant change in the nation's vaccination strategy, moving from broad availability to a more targeted approach focused on vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>Shares of the "buy now, pay later" company Affirm surged 10% after it reported fiscal fourth-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street expectations. The company posted earnings of 20 cents per share on revenue of $876 million, a 33% increase from the previous year, and offered an optimistic forecast for the upcoming fiscal year. CEO Max Levchin cited strong consumer transaction frequency and growth in both consumer and merchant numbers as key drivers. The positive performance was bolstered by key partnerships with Shopify and Amazon, helping to offset the recent loss of Walmart as a client to a competitor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese technology giant Alibaba saw its stock rise by nearly 13% after reporting better-than-expected net income for its fiscal first quarter. A key driver of the positive result was the accelerated growth of its cloud computing division, where revenue increased by 26% year-over-year, fueled by strong demand for AI-related products. The company stated that revenue from AI products has maintained triple-digit growth for eight consecutive quarters. While overall company revenue slightly missed forecasts, investors were encouraged by the cloud unit's performance and a revival in the e-commerce business, signaling strength in key growth areas.

          <p>An administrative law judge has ruled that a homeowner whose house was destroyed in a fire can probe State Farm's claims handling practices as part of the insurer's hearing for a proposed 11% rate increase. The ruling is a victory for policyholders who have criticized the company's response to recent firestorms, alleging payment delays and underpayments. The judge denied a motion by the Department of Insurance to handle the inquiry in a separate hearing. This decision links the insurer's request for higher rates directly to the quality of service it provides to customers when they file claims.</p>

          <p>Manchester United has reportedly accepted a bid from Spanish club Real Betis for Brazilian winger Antony. The 25-year-old is expected to travel to Spain to complete a medical and finalize the permanent move. Antony spent the latter half of last season on loan at Betis, where he helped the team secure a European qualification spot. The transfer marks the end of a disappointing tenure at United for the player, who was the club's second-most expensive signing but struggled to perform consistently. Antony was one of several players excluded from first-team training this summer as the club looked to offload them.</p>

          <p>A legislative effort that would have provided special legal protections for Frank McCourt's proposed Dodger Stadium gondola project has been defeated in the California state assembly. Language in a broader transit bill would have limited the timeframe for legal challenges against the project, but it was stripped out after public opposition from Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass and the City Council. The city leaders argued the provision was a "carve out" to benefit a "billionaire's private project." The gondola, first proposed in 2018, still requires approval from several public agencies, including the City Council, which is awaiting a new traffic study.</p>

If it strengthens into a named storm, it would be called Gabrielle, becoming the seventh of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season. So far this season, only one storm, Hurricane Erin, has reached hurricane status, though it did not make landfall.</p>

The suspect was arrested for a separate robbery, but an investigation linked him to the Macklemore case and other high-profile burglaries. During the June incident, two men entered the home, used bear spray on the nanny, and stole thousands of dollars worth of personal items, including a distinctive Seattle Sounders championship ring. Police located some of the stolen items at a jewelry store in south Seattle, which helped lead them to the suspect.</p>

Her campaign launched with a strong list of endorsements from prominent Democrats, including Mayor Karen Bass and five sitting members of Congress.
