          <p>Lindsay Lohan is celebrating her return to Hollywood with the premiere of "Freakier Friday," a sequel to the beloved 2003 film. She expressed that her motivation for the project was to bring joy to audiences, especially given the current state of world events. Lohan also reflected on how becoming a mother has given her a new perspective on the film's mother-daughter themes and helped her balance her career and personal life. Co-star Jamie Lee Curtis noted that their bond has remained strong over the years and that the sequel's themes of understanding and empathy are particularly relevant today.</p>

          <p>The White House is set to begin construction on a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, with President Trump stating it is his "gift to the country." The project aims to address the current lack of a large-scale event space, as the White House East Room has a limited capacity. According to the press secretary, funding for the new building will come from President Trump himself and other "patriot donors." This marks the first major structural addition to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948 and will replace the current East Wing.</p>

          <p>Design software company Figma made a stunning stock market debut, with its shares soaring 250% on the first day of trading, resulting in a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. The successful IPO is a massive windfall for its early venture capital investors, including Index Ventures, Greylock, Kleiner Perkins, and Sequoia, who collectively hold a stake worth around $24 billion. The outcome is particularly notable as Figma was previously set to be acquired by Adobe for $20 billion, but the deal collapsed due to regulatory opposition. The IPO's success signals a potentially renewed appetite for tech offerings on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the planned terminations until at least November, when a hearing on the merits of the case will be held. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson sharply criticized the administration's actions, stating the plaintiffs were being told to "leave because of their names, and purify their blood." Many of the affected individuals have lived in the U.S. for over two decades under the program.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have published a study in the journal Cell suggesting an unexpected evolutionary link between two common foods: the potato and the tomato. According to the scientists, the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event with another wild species. The study proposes that a gene from the ancient tomato, which does not produce tubers, combined with a gene from the other species to enable the formation of the starchy tubers we know today. This finding helps solve a long-standing puzzle about the potato's genetic origins.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC is set for a decisive Leagues Cup match against Pachuca, where a victory is essential to keep their tournament aspirations alive. The team is coming off a disappointing penalty-shootout loss to Mazatlán in their opening game, a result that has put them in a precarious position. With only four teams from MLS and four from Liga MX advancing to the quarterfinals, the pressure is on. Coach Steve Cherundolo is expected to field his strongest lineup after resting several key players in the previous match, hoping to secure a much-needed win at home.</p>

          <p>Apple announced strong financial results for its third quarter, with revenue rising 10% year-over-year to $94.04 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The company saw record sales for its iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch upgrades, and its services division also set a new all-time sales record. Despite the robust performance, investor enthusiasm was somewhat muted due to a continued lack of clarity and detailed updates regarding the company's long-term strategy for artificial intelligence. CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed that AI is a profound technology and that Apple is significantly increasing its investments in the area. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A statue of Robert Smalls, an American hero who escaped slavery by commandeering a Confederate ship and later became a U.S. congressman, will be erected on the grounds of the South Carolina State House. This will be the first monument honoring an individual African American at the state's capitol, which is currently surrounded by statues of White men, many with Confederate ties. The project, made possible by a bipartisan push from state lawmakers, is seen by historians as a crucial step in completing the state's historical narrative. The sculpture is being created by Jamaican-born artist Basil Watson.</p>

          <p>Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and earnings for its second quarter, with sales increasing 13% to $167.7 billion. Despite the strong top-and-bottom-line beats, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading. Investors were reportedly underwhelmed by a relatively small revenue beat from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division and mixed guidance for the third quarter. The company's forecast for operating income fell short of Wall Street expectations, raising some concerns even as Amazon projects another quarter of healthy overall revenue growth.

          <h2>UK Government to Restrict Civil Service Internships to Working-Class Students</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 19:38:21 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is reforming its civil service internship program to exclusively recruit students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more representative of the country it serves by harnessing a broader range of talent. Under the new rules, eligibility will be determined by parental occupation when the student was 14. Successful interns will then be prioritized for the Fast Stream, the main graduate entry program, creating a new pipeline for working-class students into senior government roles.</p>
