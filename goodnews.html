          <p>Football in Germany is facing a concerning trend as fewer teenagers are sticking with the sport during crucial developmental years, with nearly 6,000 men's U19 and U17 teams lost since 2006. The German FA is implementing reforms to modernize football and make it more appealing to young people, focusing on fun over results and involving youth in decision-making. Factors contributing to the decline include the rise of digital platforms, the cost of playing organized football, high expectations, intense scheduling, and social issues. Reform efforts aim to instill trust and confidence in young players, ensuring they have opportunities for real participation and development, emphasizing that humanity is the basis of performance.</p>

          <p>Novo Nordisk's shares jumped nearly 7% after the company announced that sales of its Wegovy weight loss drug are expected to improve in the second half of the year, as copycat compounded drugs are phased out. The Danish pharmaceutical giant reported first-quarter net profit of 29.03 billion Danish kroner ($4.4 billion), surpassing analysts' forecasts, while Wegovy sales rose 83% annually to 17.36 billion Danish kroner. The company had lowered its full-year sales growth forecast due to competition from compounded weight loss drugs in the U.S. during the first part of the year, but expects sales to pick up again as the FDA's drug shortage ruling ends.</p>

          <p>A new study from UCSF indicates that psilocybin, a psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms, can improve mood, cognition, and motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients. The small study, involving 12 participants with mild to moderate Parkinson's disease and depression or anxiety, showed clinically significant improvements in mood, cognition, and motor function one week and one month after treatment. While the study had limitations, including a small sample size and lack of a control group, researchers are conducting a larger trial to rigorously test psilocybin's effectiveness in Parkinson's and to understand its mechanisms of action.</p>

          <p>Before becoming known for its notorious prison, Alcatraz Island in San Francisco Bay was originally named "Isla de Alcatrazes" by Spanish explorers due to its large population of pelicans.

Alcatraz served as a military fort before becoming a federal penitentiary in 1934, housing infamous criminals like Al Capone, and closing in 1963 due to high costs. The island, now a national park and museum, has been proposed by President Trump to be rebuilt and reopened as a prison for the country's most ruthless and violent offenders, a suggestion that has drawn criticism due to the island's impracticality and structural issues.</p>

          <h2>American Investment in Soccer Faces Challenges in the United States</h2>

          <p>American investment in European soccer may soon face a challenge from the domestic game, as European clubs seek to tap into the lucrative U.S. market. This sets up a kind of reckoning between the two occasionally-overlapping sects of the American investor class: Those that bought into European soccer, and those that did so with the interests of the domestic game. The article suggests that this has been done to optimize monetization, and the Americans came for the European soccer clubs, and now those teams, and all the others around them, are stealing covetous glances back at America.</p>

          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is traveling to France and Poland to discuss European leadership and migration policy, with a Polish government source expressing hope for common leadership in Europe. A key question was how Merz's government planned to increase defence spending, the source said. He added that a reasonable approach would involve European countries collectively purchasing equipment. Merz intends to speak with French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk about adopting a tougher European migration policy, and his government plans to further tighten migration by rejecting asylum seekers at land borders.</p>

          <h2>UK to Introduce Longer Jail Terms for Criminals Who Skip Sentencing</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 04:24:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill to be introduced to Parliament in England and Wales proposes an additional two years in prison for criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings. This measure aims to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice, a move welcomed by victims' families who have experienced the pain of their loved ones' killers not attending sentencing. The bill could apply to any case in the Crown Court, including those who attend proceedings but are removed for disruptive behavior, and is seen as a step in the right direction to provide some peace and justice to victims' families.</p>
