          <p>Pride Month concluded with large-scale marches in cities like New York and San Francisco, where celebration was intertwined with protest against increasing political attacks on LGBTQ+ rights. In New York, the theme was "Rise Up: Pride in Protest," with many demonstrators targeting recent policies from the Trump administration. Meanwhile, in Budapest, Hungary, tens of thousands defied a government ban on LGBTQ+ public events to hold their own march. These events underscored a global mood of both joy and resistance, commemorating the 1969 Stonewall Uprising while fighting for current and future rights and inclusion.</p>

          <p>Industrial output in Japan rose by 0.5 percent in May compared to the previous month, according to preliminary government data. The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry reported that the seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8, using 2020 as a base of 100. This slight increase indicates some activity in the nation's industrial sector. However, the modest nature of the growth reflects the broader economic challenges and uncertainties facing Japan's economy as it navigates both domestic and global market conditions.

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023 in response to Japan's release of treated radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant. The decision reflects an apparent move by Beijing to improve diplomatic ties with Tokyo amid its ongoing trade disputes with the United States. Chinese customs authorities stated that long-term monitoring showed no abnormalities in the water. While the blanket ban is lifted, restrictions will remain on food imports from 10 Japanese prefectures, including Fukushima, and shipments will require registration and radiation checks before trade fully resumes.</p>

Drawing parallels to the post-1989 era, he notes that American students and scholars are once again pioneers in returning to China after a period of reduced exchange, this time due to the pandemic. Mahboubi, who recently led a student trip to China, observed a warm and welcoming reception, which he interprets as a sign of underlying desire for connection despite high-level political tensions. He believes that people-to-people exchanges remain a vital component of the bilateral relationship.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Justin Wrobleski provided a significant boost with a standout performance, pitching six scoreless innings in a 5-1 victory against the Kansas City Royals. Entering the game in the second inning, the 24-year-old left-hander allowed just three hits and struck out six, continuing his impressive midseason resurgence. Wrobleski's recent success is attributed to increased fastball velocity and improved mechanics, which have helped him solidify his role as a valuable depth option for the team.
