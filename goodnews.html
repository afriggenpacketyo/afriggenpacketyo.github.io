          <p>Trump's Truth Social platform is taking steps towards launching a bitcoin ETF with a filing by NYSE Arca to list the Truth Social Bitcoin ETF. The ETF is designed to track the price of bitcoin, providing investors with a simplified method for gaining exposure to the cryptocurrency market without direct asset holding. This move follows a partnership between Trump Media and Crypto.com aimed at introducing digital asset products to the market, pending regulatory approval. The filing represents a significant entry into the expanding market for bitcoin funds, particularly given Trump's increasing involvement in the crypto space (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Trump administration reversed its decision to revoke the humanitarian parole of a four-year-old girl, identified as Sofia, and her family, who came to the U.S. from Mexico in 2023 to seek medical care for her rare condition. Sofia's doctors warned that she would likely die if forced to return to Mexico, prompting a national outcry and intervention from Democratic lawmakers. The Department of Homeland Security granted the family humanitarian parole for one year, allowing Sofia to continue receiving specialized treatment in the U.S. This decision follows criticism of the administration's deportation policies and their potential impact on vulnerable individuals. </p>
