          <p>Uber's first-quarter earnings surpassed expectations, but revenue fell short, causing a 5% stock drop. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year to $11.53 billion, while net income rose to $1.78 billion from a previous loss. CEO Dara Khosrowshahi anticipates gross bookings between $45.75 billion and $47.25 billion for the next quarter. The company is also dealing with an FTC lawsuit over Uber One subscription billing, which Khosrowshahi dismisses as easily cancellable. Uber is pushing into autonomous vehicles, reporting an annual run-rate of 1.5 million autonomous vehicle trips.</p>
