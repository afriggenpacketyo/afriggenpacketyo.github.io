          <p>President Trump announced a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Iran, stating that both nations agreed to halt strikes. The Israeli government confirmed its coordination with Trump and adherence to the ceasefire, warning of forceful responses to any violations. Iranian state television also reported the ceasefire's commencement, though an Iranian Foreign Minister suggested there was no formal agreement but that Iran would cease strikes if Israel did the same. The conflict, initiated by Israeli airstrikes on Iranian nuclear and military targets, led to casualties on both sides and U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites. Qatar helped broker the deal after direct talks with Iran occurred after Iran's strike on Al Udeid Air Base.</p>

          <p>Boy and girl scouts in Kyoto participated in harvesting "Ofuku Ume" plums at the Kitano Tenmangu shrine, known for producing these Japanese plums believed to bring good luck in the New Year. Around 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, plucked the ripe plums from the shrine's 1,500 plum trees. The harvested plums are pickled and dried to become Ofuku Ume, and drinking tea made from them on New Year's Day is believed to promote good health and ward off illness. The scouts expressed their enjoyment of the activity and hoped that everyone would enjoy the plums.</p>

          <p>The UK government has committed to spending 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035, aligning with a new NATO target that includes core defense spending and defense-related areas. Prime Minister Starmer emphasized the need for agility and a clear national interest in navigating an era of radical uncertainty. The plan allocates 3.5% to core defense and 1.5% to resilience measures like border security and cyber attack protection. The government expects to reach 4.1% by 2027, with core defense spending at 2.6% by then, but has not detailed how the 3.5% target will be funded by 2035.</p>

Originally formed by 12 founding members, NATO has expanded to 32 countries, including former Warsaw Pact members and Nordic nations like Finland and Sweden.

          <p>Global equities experienced slight gains as investors reacted to President Trump's announcement of a ceasefire timeline between Iran and Israel, coupled with growing weariness towards Trump's policymaking. The article suggests that the markets are becoming desensitized to policy changes, with the Iranian response to U.S. strikes being relatively subdued. It notes that the markets are muted because there are elements of the market getting jaded at Trump policy changes and how the Iranian response to U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities was largely subdued. After the wild swings from changes to tariff policy in April, each successive change has seen less of a move.</p>

          <p>Germany's cabinet is set to approve a draft budget for 2025 that includes record figures for defense spending and government borrowing. The defense budget is projected to more than double by 2029, reaching ‚Ç¨152.8 billion, in response to growing security concerns and pressure from the U.S. Net borrowing will also increase significantly, jumping to ‚Ç¨81.8 billion in 2025. These increases are made possible by the easing of Germany's debt brake.</p>
