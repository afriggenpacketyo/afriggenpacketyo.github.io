          <p>This article discusses the late George Wendt's accidental impact on Ohio politics during John Boehner's 1990 congressional race. Wendt, known for his role as Norm on "Cheers," mistakenly conflated Boehner with another politician involved in a scandal during an appearance on "The Arsenio Hall Show," while campaigning for his brother-in-law, Greg Jolivette, who was running against Boehner. Despite the gaffe, Boehner won the election and later became Speaker of the House. Boehner acknowledged the incident after Wendt's death, recalling Wendt's apology and their conversation.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a truck carrying them overturned in Whatcom County, Washington.

The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow for the rescue operation, and the public was advised to avoid the area.</p>

          <p>This opinion piece suggests that Donald Trump's political resilience is tied to his willingness to adapt and contradict himself. The author argues that Trump's flexibility reassures swing voters that anything extreme is provisional. The willingness to swerve and backpedal and contradict himself is a big part of what keeps the president viable, and the promise of chickening out is part of Trump‚Äôs implicit pitch to swing voters. The author suggests that seeing Trump check himself and be checked by others is what an important group of voters expect from his presidency.</p>
