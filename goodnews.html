        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card interest rates have decreased slightly from their peak in late 2024, but still remain high, averaging around 21.37%. Experts suggest that further rate declines are possible later in the year, but are likely to be gradual and minimal. Given the current high rates and the potential for only slight decreases, borrowers are encouraged to explore debt relief options such as credit card debt forgiveness or debt management programs. Waiting for significant rate relief may not be the most effective strategy for those with substantial debt. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The film *Ballerina*, a spin-off of the *John Wick* franchise, initially struggles to capture the stylistic flair of its predecessors, focusing on a generic revenge plot. However, it eventually succeeds by expanding the world of *John Wick* rather than simply deepening the protagonist's story. The film's strengths lie in its inventive stunts and incorporation of the bizarre, darkly cartoonish universe that defines the franchise. The film expands on the Wick canon, and showcases an askew storytelling, finally reminding viewers of why they stayed interested in the Wick chronicles for all these years.</p>
