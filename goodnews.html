          <p>Gregory May, the U.S. consul general for Hong Kong and Macau, is reportedly a leading candidate for a senior ministerial role in the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Sources suggest that his experience covering mainland China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan makes him well-suited to assist the new American ambassador, David Perdue, particularly as Beijing and Washington engage in high-stakes trade talks. May's efforts in maintaining business, academic, and people exchanges in Hong Kong, despite sanctions, are also considered valuable for the new role. His pragmatism and resourcefulness are assets during this critical time in U.S.-China relations.</p>

He argues that the death penalty goes against the spirit of democracy and respects human rights, while noting a decrease in violent crimes in Mongolia after its abolition.</p>

The service will initially involve a small rollout of Model Y vehicles with a new, "unsupervised" version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving technology, geofenced to limit their operational area and remotely monitored by employees.
