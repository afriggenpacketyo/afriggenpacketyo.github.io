        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new peer-to-peer messaging application that functions without an internet connection. The app operates on a decentralized Bluetooth mesh network, allowing users to communicate directly between nearby devices. Messages are encrypted, ephemeral, and are not stored on any central servers, reflecting Dorsey's continued push for privacy-focused and censorship-resistant technology. Bitchat is designed to work even during internet outages or government-imposed shutdowns, offering a resilient communication tool for users in such environments.</p>

          <p>A recent analysis examines the interest-earning potential of placing $20,000 into either short-term or long-term certificates of deposit (CDs) in the current economic climate. While short-term CDs currently offer higher interest rates, the compounding effect over a longer duration means long-term CDs ultimately yield a greater return. For example, a five-year CD at 4.20% would earn significantly more than a one-year CD at 4.40%. The article advises savers to consider their ability to lock away funds for an extended period, as early withdrawal penalties could negate the interest gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. State Department is set to formally remove the Syrian Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) from its list of foreign terrorist organizations. The group, formerly an al-Qaeda affiliate, played a key role in the offensive that overthrew the Assad regime, and its leader is now Syria's interim president. This move aligns with broader efforts by Western nations, including the U.S. and U.K., to reset relations with Syria and support its recovery after years of civil war. Despite these diplomatic shifts, concerns remain about the new government's operations and recent violent attacks against minority groups within the country.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's sporting director, Andrea Berta, has reportedly traveled to Portugal for direct negotiations with Sporting CP regarding a potential transfer for striker Viktor Gyokeres. The Premier League club has intensified its pursuit of the Swedish international as it seeks to secure a new center-forward. Sources indicate that the discussions, which took place late last week, concern a deal potentially valued at around £70 million. Berta's personal involvement in the talks signals Arsenal's strong commitment to finalizing the acquisition of Gyokeres quickly, marking a significant step in their summer transfer plans.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic advanced to the Wimbledon quarter-finals after a challenging four-set victory over Australian Alex de Minaur. Playing in front of eight-time champion Roger Federer, Djokovic dropped the first set and had to rally from a 4-1 deficit in the fourth before securing the win. The seven-time champion expressed relief at winning in Federer's presence, joking that he had broken a "curse" of losing when his former rival was watching. Djokovic is now three wins away from a record-tying eighth Wimbledon title and a standalone record 25th Grand Slam championship, with a quarter-final match against Flavio Cobolli next.</p>

          <p>On CNBC, Jim Cramer suggested that chipmaker Nvidia might soon be able to resume selling certain AI chips to China, following the U.S. government's easing of export restrictions on chip design firms. He also addressed a recent downgrade of cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike by Piper Sandler, which moved the stock to a neutral rating after it hit the analyst's price target. Cramer noted that his investment club has been periodically taking profits from the high-valued stock. The discussion occurred as the broader market saw a slight downturn amid anticipation of new trade policy announcements from the Trump administration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier won a chaotic third stage of the Tour de France, narrowly beating Italy's Jonathan Milan in a photo finish. The stage was marked by several crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race. Another crash in the final kilometers appeared to involve general classification contenders Remco Evenepoel and Geraint Thomas, though they finished safely. Mathieu van der Poel retained the overall leader's yellow jersey, with top favorites Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard also avoiding trouble to remain second and third in the standings.</p>

          <p>The Formula 1-themed movie starring Brad Pitt has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, surpassing $293 million at the global box office. The film, distributed by Warner Bros. Discovery, has out-grossed previous Apple-produced films like "Napoleon" and "Killers of the Flower Moon." Its success is partly attributed to a strong partnership with IMAX, which secured a three-week exclusive run and contributed over 20% of the film's total gross. While the movie had a high production and marketing budget, its box office performance marks a significant milestone for Apple's growing ambitions in the film industry.</p>

          <p>Keith Siegel, an American-Israeli man held captive by Hamas for 484 days, has called on U.S. President Donald Trump to secure the release of the remaining hostages in Gaza. Siegel, who was freed in a deal brokered by Trump, believes the president has the power to pressure both sides to reach an agreement that would free the approximately 50 remaining captives and end the war. His plea comes as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to meet with Trump at the White House. Siegel described being beaten and taunted during his captivity and emphasized the urgency of bringing all hostages home.</p>
