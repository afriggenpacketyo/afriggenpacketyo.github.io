          <p>President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke by phone to discuss trade tensions, with Trump claiming they reached a "very positive conclusion" for both countries. Trump stated that U.S. and Chinese negotiating teams will meet soon to finalize the agreement, and that Xi invited him to visit China. The call follows recent accusations from Trump that China violated a previous agreement to roll back tariff rates, which China denies. Trump believes they "straightened out any complexity" regarding the agreement, particularly concerning rare earths and magnets, and he expressed openness to Chinese students coming to the U.S., despite earlier administration announcements about visa revocations. This conversation signals a potential thaw in trade relations between the two nations. (not investment advice)</p>

Heger recently won his category at the Dakar Rally, a nearly 5,000-mile race through the Saudi Arabian desert, attributing his endurance to his upbringing on the farm. He started racing at age six and has since won six consecutive major events, including the Dakar Rally, which he entered as a last-minute participant. Heger's father, Joe Heger, emphasized the importance of respecting equipment and enjoying the work, which has contributed to his son's success.

          <p>The government has announced that free school meals will be extended to an additional 500,000 children in England from September 2026. Any child whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible, regardless of their income, saving parents ¬£500 a year and potentially lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the changes up to 2029 and will also review standards to ensure school meals are healthy. While some critics argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective, the government maintains that this initiative will improve educational attainment by ensuring children are not hungry in the classroom. The move has been welcomed by advocates and celebrities who received free school meals themselves growing up.</p>

          <p>Stellantis is bringing back its V-8 Hemi engine for Ram 1500 pickup trucks, reversing a previous decision to discontinue it due to fuel economy regulations. Ram CEO Tim Kuniskis admitted the decision to cancel the Hemi engine was a mistake and emphasized the company's commitment to providing powertrain choices for customers. The announcement is part of a new product turnaround plan that includes 25 product announcements over 18 months, with the Hemi expected to represent 25% to 40% of Ram 1500 sales. While the Hurricane engine will still be offered, the Hemi will be available as an option on most models. The move comes as EV adoption has been slower than expected, leading automakers to reevaluate their plans. </p>

          <p>NATO defense ministers have generally endorsed a plan to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, in response to US President Trump's demands for greater investment from alliance members. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte expressed confidence that allies are ready to increase the target, with a formal agreement expected by the next NATO summit in The Hague. While most members currently commit to spending at least 2% of GDP on military expenditure, some countries, including Spain, are hesitant to significantly increase their contributions. The increased urgency among NATO members to bolster defense capacity in Europe is driven by Russia's war in Ukraine. This move reflects a growing commitment to collective security in the face of geopolitical challenges.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed over 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders previously barred from collecting full benefits due to the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO).

The SSA has completed 90% of its caseload, with beneficiaries receiving one-time payments deposited into their bank accounts. While most eligible parties should have seen monthly benefit increases starting in April, some cases require manual processing and may take longer, with all beneficiary records expected to be updated by November 2025.

          <p>The Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision in Catholic Charities v. Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission, focusing on a narrow distinction in Wisconsin law regarding unemployment taxes. The case involved a law that exempts some nonprofits from paying unemployment taxes, but only those operating "primarily for religious purposes." The Court reversed the state supreme court's decision, granting Catholic Charities an exemption, as the state cannot prefer one religious denomination over another. The decision avoids a broader fight over religious organizations ignoring the law, but leaves some ambiguity regarding the definition of "theological" choices. This ruling highlights the Court's cautious approach to religious exemptions in the workplace. </p>

          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a record-breaking decrease in April as demand for imports declined, influenced by President Trump's tariffs. The deficit decreased to $61.6 billion, a significant drop from the previous month, reversing a surge in imports ahead of Trump's tariff announcements. Imports slowed sharply, while exports accelerated, indicating a shift in trade dynamics. Despite the positive news, economists caution against interpreting the shrinking deficit as entirely positive, noting that international trade has generally benefited the U.S. economy.
