          <p>Microsoft's digital crimes unit, in collaboration with global law enforcement, dismantled the Lumma Stealer malware project, which had infected over 394,000 Windows computers worldwide. The malware, popular among cybercriminals, was used to steal passwords, credit card information, bank account details, and cryptocurrency wallets. The operation involved seizing over 1,300 domains and working with tech companies like Cloudflare and Lumen to sever communications between the malware and its victims. The Lumma malware had been actively sold in underground forums since 2022, and was used in phishing campaigns targeting online gaming communities, education systems, and critical infrastructure. One notable example involved a March 2025 phishing campaign impersonating Booking.com.</p>

          <p>The United States has accepted a Boeing 747 from Qatar as a gift to be used as part of the Air Force One fleet, a decision that has sparked criticism and debate. The plane, valued at an estimated $400 million, will require extensive modifications to meet security and functional requirements for presidential transport. The acceptance raises legal and ethical questions under the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits gifts to public officials from foreign governments without congressional approval. While the White House insists the gift is legal as it is given to the Defense Department, critics express concerns about potential influence and security risks, with the new plane slated for use until Boeing delivers updated aircraft.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin's price briefly hit a new all-time high of $109,500 before slipping back due to rising Treasury yields and stock market declines. The cryptocurrency's rise was attributed to factors like softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, which increased interest in bitcoin as an alternative store of value. Cumulative inflows into ETFs tracking bitcoin's price surpassed $40 billion, supported by liquidity in the stock market and risk-off scenarios related to tariffs and deficits. Investors anticipate further regulatory updates and corporate treasury investments to drive prices higher, with public companies now holding about 15% of the total bitcoin supply (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat that sank in Lake Michigan over a century ago. Christopher Thuss found the wreckage in shallow water near Manitowoc, Wisconsin, revealing a piece of lost maritime history. The J.C. Ames, built in 1881, was once one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the Great Lakes, used for moving lumber and transporting railway cars before being scuttled in 1923. Historians are working to locate shipwrecks in the Great Lakes before invasive quagga mussels cause further damage. This discovery highlights the ongoing efforts to preserve the region's rich maritime heritage.</p>

          <p>The Senate passed a surprise "no tax on tips" bill, generating discussion about its potential impact on workers. Both President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris supported the idea during campaign appearances. The bill, if enacted, would allow workers to deduct all "qualified tips" from 2025 through 2028, but tips must be reported to qualify. While proponents claim it will provide relief to hardworking Americans, analysts note that the benefits may be limited to moderate- to middle-income workers and could incentivize income misclassification (not investment advice).</p>
