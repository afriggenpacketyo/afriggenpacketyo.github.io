          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to continue cutting interest rates, financial experts are advising savers on the current landscape for certificates of deposit (CDs). Although the peak rates seen in recent years are no longer available, short-term CDs still offer significantly higher returns than traditional savings accounts, with some rates currently above 4%. The article suggests that savers interested in locking in these elevated rates should act proactively, as further Fed actions will likely cause returns on savings vehicles to decline.

          <p>Spot gold has reached a record high of over $4,000 per ounce, driven by economic uncertainty and expectations of interest rate cuts. Despite this surge, some top financial advisors caution against over-allocating to the precious metal, arguing that stocks historically provide better long-term returns through compounding earnings. While gold can serve as a safe-haven asset during turmoil, experts recommend that most investors limit their exposure to a small percentage within a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>
