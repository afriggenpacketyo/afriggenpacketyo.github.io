          <p>Oracle's shares experienced a notable increase of approximately 8% after the company released its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings report, surpassing Wall Street's projections for both earnings per share and revenue. The company's cloud infrastructure revenue is anticipated to increase by more than 70% in fiscal year 2026, a substantial increase from the 52% growth observed in the current quarter. Oracle also announced strategic partnerships with Cleveland Clinic and G42 for an AI platform in healthcare, along with cloud and consulting commitments with IBM, and SoftBank's acquisition of Ampere, an Oracle-backed chip design startup. This performance reflects the company's strong position in the cloud computing market and its strategic investments in artificial intelligence and partnerships. The company's financial outlook appears optimistic, with expectations of continued growth in the cloud sector.</p>

          <p>Researchers have analyzed gold coins found near the San Jose galleon, which sank off the coast of Colombia in 1708, confirming they are from the iconic shipwreck. The coins feature depictions of castles, lions, and crosses, as well as the "Crowned Pillars of Hercules," and researchers were able to discern the letters "PVA" and the date of minting (1707) on some coins. The Colombian government announced it would begin extractions from the ship, which was discovered in 2015, and declared the site a "protected archeological area" in May 2024. Multiple parties have laid claim to the shipwreck, including Colombia, Spain, and Indigenous Qhara Qhara Bolivians, while the cause of the sinking remains debated. The shipwreck is believed to hold gold, silver, gemstones, and other treasure worth billions of dollars.</p>

The teams had to pass seven checkpoints in China, Nepal, and India, and were banned from using air travel, relying instead on a limited budget for transport, food, and accommodation. During the show, Caroline shared her feelings of losing her identity outside of being a mother and wife, while her son Tom gained new confidence by discussing his cerebral palsy with strangers. The winning duo will share a cash prize of ¬£20,000.</p>

          <p>Debbie Lin and Na-Moya Lawrence, a Los Angeles-based duo, are creating unisex perfumes that challenge industry norms by focusing on personal memories and emotions rather than aspirational messaging. Their artisan perfume company, Samar, operates out of their Hollywood apartment, where they create small-batch fragrances inspired by specific experiences. Samar's inclusiveness extends to its pricing, offering smaller sizes at more approachable price points, and its commitment to gender neutrality, encouraging customers to suspend their beliefs about masculinity and femininity. The brand reflects a dedication to making fragrance available and emotionally resonant for everyone.</p>

The move marks a shift towards recognizing nuclear power as a potential solution for climate change and energy access. This will allow for investments in nuclear infrastructure.</p>
