          <h2>Premier League Discusses Introducing Ref Cams for Enhanced Broadcasts Next Season</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 10:11:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League is in discussions with the International Football Association Board (Ifab) regarding the potential introduction of "Ref Cams" for the upcoming season. These small cameras, worn on a referee's ear, aim to provide broadcasters with unique, immersive in-game footage, bringing viewers closer to the action. The technology has already been successfully trialed by FIFA during the Club World Cup, where it also proved beneficial for officials in reviewing incidents. If approved by Ifab and the Premier League clubs, initial trials could occur in the Summer Series tournament, paving the way for broader implementation. This initiative seeks to enhance the viewing experience and potentially aid officiating.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has surged to unprecedented all-time highs, briefly surpassing $118,000, fueled by a remarkable influx of institutional investment into bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Thursday alone witnessed the largest single-day inflows into bitcoin ETFs for 2025, reaching $1.18 billion, with Ether ETFs also experiencing their second-biggest day ever. This rally was initially spurred by the Federal Reserve meeting minutes and market expectations of a more dovish stance from future Fed leadership. The cryptocurrency's ascent was further amplified by a significant wave of short liquidations, underscoring strong market momentum. Investors anticipate continued growth in the latter half of the year as corporate treasuries increase bitcoin acquisitions.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss has significantly raised its full-year sales guidance, driven by robust consumer demand and strong performance across its product lines. The denim manufacturer also announced its intention to absorb some of the initial costs stemming from President Donald Trump's new tariffs, which disproportionately impact its supply chain in Southeast Asia. CEO Michelle Gass explained that strategic initiatives, including a reduction in promotions and premium pricing for innovative new fits, are helping the company mitigate these tariff-related headwinds. This optimistic financial outlook underscores the effectiveness of Levi's direct-to-consumer strategy and its focus on enhancing profitability, even amidst an uncertain global economic landscape.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>FDA Commissioner Marty Makary has announced a significant policy shift, stating that the agency will now explicitly consider drug affordability as a "national priority" when granting new vouchers designed to expedite treatment approvals. This program aims to dramatically reduce drug review times to as little as one to two months for companies whose products align with U.S. national interests, which also include bolstering domestic drug manufacturing. The initiative directly supports the Trump administration's broader objective of lowering drug prices for Americans, even as it navigates the complex landscape of potential tariffs on imported pharmaceuticals. While the precise mechanism for evaluating affordability post-approval is still developing, the FDA's goal is to incentivize the creation of more innovative and accessible cures.</p>

          <p>As U.S. President Donald Trump escalates tariffs, China is intensifying its efforts to rally trade partners and collectively push back against Washington's protectionist policies. Analysts suggest Beijing is adopting a pragmatic, long-term strategy to fortify its global economic standing, particularly ahead of anticipated talks with Washington. China aims to offer substantial development opportunities, including expanded market access and deeper regional integration, to its neighboring trade partners. This approach is designed to counter the expected impact of U.S. tariffs on transshipped goods and gradually cultivate a more unified regional market, effectively portraying the United States as a "big bully" in international trade relations.</p>

          <p>China's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) in Shanghai has issued a remarkable directive, urging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to actively research the potential role of stablecoins and other digital assets within the realm of trade. This announcement is particularly significant given the central government's extensive ban on most crypto-related activities across the mainland for several years. The regulator specifically called for SOEs to explore the application of blockchain technology in cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This move reflects recent calls from state media for Beijing to adopt a more proactive stance on stablecoin legislation, ultimately aiming to study how yuan-backed stablecoins could potentially enhance the yuan's global currency standing.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will supply Patriot air defense systems to Ukraine, with distribution facilitated through NATO, which will reportedly reimburse the full cost. This commitment follows an urgent appeal from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who requested ten Patriot systems amid a significant surge in Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. The announcement is particularly notable as the U.S. defense department had recently paused some critical weapons shipments, causing concern in Kyiv. Patriot batteries are recognized as highly effective against incoming missiles and are vital for Ukraine's layered defense, despite their substantial cost, signaling a crucial resumption of military aid to the embattled nation.</p>

          <p>IMAX is confidently projecting its best year on record, anticipating a global box office haul of $1.2 billion, representing a substantial 33% increase from 2024. This success stems from the company's effective capitalization on Hollywood's box office resurgence and a growing consumer demand for premium, immersive entertainment experiences. Key to this performance are strategic partnerships with major studios for "filmed for IMAX" titles, which consistently lead to superior box office results due to enhanced viewing quality and filmmaker endorsement. With plans to build approximately 500 more screens worldwide, IMAX demonstrates significant growth potential, benefiting from both a robust domestic film slate and the success of local language films across its expanding global footprint.</p>

Devin is expected to augment the bank's 12,000 human developers, initially handling hundreds and potentially thousands of tasks, particularly routine coding updates and language migrations. This move signifies a profound shift towards "agentic AI," which is capable of executing complex, multi-step jobs like building entire applications with minimal human intervention, potentially boosting productivity three to four times. While this development raises concerns about future job cuts, Goldman Sachs envisions a "hybrid workforce" where human engineers supervise AI agents, fundamentally redefining roles and workflows within the financial sector.</p>
