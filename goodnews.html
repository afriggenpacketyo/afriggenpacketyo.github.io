          <p>President Trump has canceled a planned large-scale immigration enforcement operation in San Francisco that was expected to involve federal agents. The decision came after a conversation between the president and San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie, who argued the deployment would hinder the city's economic recovery. The plan had drawn strong condemnation from state and local leaders, including California's governor, who had vowed to challenge any such federal action in court. Protests had already begun in anticipation of the agents' arrival.</p>

          <p>Shares of industrial conglomerate Honeywell surged after the company reported third-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations. The positive results were driven by a strong rebound in its aerospace division and a record backlog of orders, indicating robust demand. In response to its strong performance, Honeywell raised its full-year guidance for sales and earnings per share. The company is also proceeding with its plan to spin off its Solstice Advanced Materials business into a separate publicly traded entity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. Commerce Department official has refuted a report claiming the Trump administration was negotiating to take equity stakes in quantum computing companies in exchange for federal funding. The denial follows recent instances where the government has taken ownership stakes in industries deemed vital to national security, such as semiconductors and rare earth minerals. Quantum computing is considered a critical technology with significant military implications, including the potential to break modern encryption, making government involvement a sensitive topic.</p>

Officials emphasized that the ID will not be required to access essential services like healthcare, aiming to address public concerns about government overreach. Despite these assurances, the controversial proposal faces significant opposition, including a petition to scrap the plan that has garnered nearly three million signatures amid privacy and surveillance fears.</p>

          <p>A bill designed to make IRS notices for simple tax return mistakes clearer and more understandable for taxpayers has passed Congress and is now awaiting the president's signature. The legislation addresses complaints that current "math error" notices are often confusing and do not adequately explain how to correct the mistake or the consequences of not responding within the 60-day deadline. Advocates say the change will help ordinary citizens resolve minor issues with the IRS without needing to hire expensive professional help.</p>

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, this article outlines strategies for consumers seeking relief from high-interest balances.

          <p>President Trump has granted a full pardon to Changpeng Zhao, the billionaire founder of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance. Zhao had pleaded guilty to enabling money laundering and served four months in prison as part of a multi-billion dollar settlement with the U.S. government. The White House framed the pardon as a response to the Biden administration's "war on cryptocurrency," asserting that Zhao was prosecuted despite a lack of identifiable fraud victims. This action is seen by supporters as a move to protect the digital asset industry in the United States.</p>

However, pursuing wealth for social comparison, power, or to overcome self-doubt is negatively correlated with life satisfaction and can lead to anxiety and depression.</p>
