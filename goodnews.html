          <p>Asia-Pacific markets demonstrated resilience, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index rising over 2% and Japan's Nikkei 225 hitting a record high, even as China reported a 4.8% GDP growth for the third quarter, which aligned with expectations. Despite this growth, the article notes an unexpected contraction in fixed-asset investment, indicating underlying economic challenges. The broader market strength was also influenced by a more conciliatory tone in U.S.-China trade discussions and a recovery from recent U.S. regional bank sell-offs. This suggests investors are weighing diverse factors, including regional political stability and specific national economic indicators, to shape overall market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British Defence Secretary John Healey is set to announce new powers allowing UK troops to shoot down drones threatening military bases, a significant shift from previous protocols that only permitted diversion or GPS disruption. This move comes after several incidents, including mystery drone sightings at four British airbases used by US forces last year, and broader airspace disruptions across Europe. The article notes these powers, initially for military sites, might extend to civilian airports, reflecting a growing urgency to counter drone threats. This initiative is part of a wider European response, with some EU states planning a "drone wall" to detect and destroy Russian drones.</p>

          <p>Centrist Senator Rodrigo Paz has won Bolivia's presidential run-off election with over 54% of the vote, marking an end to two decades of leftist Movement Toward Socialism (MAS) party rule.

          <p>Steven Qiu, founder of RoboSense, a leading LiDAR maker, argues that Elon Musk's vision-only approach to self-driving vehicles is insufficient and unsafe, advocating for a multi-sensor system. Qiu asserts that vision-only systems cannot account for "corner cases," like distinguishing a white car from a cloud or detecting unlit trucks at night, making Level 3 or 4 automation unattainable without additional sensors like LiDAR. The article highlights Musk's long-standing criticism of LiDAR as "expensive and unnecessary," despite its falling costs and increasing performance. Other auto executives, like Ford CEO Jim Farley, support LiDAR as "mission critical."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles is confronting narratives of American history by transforming 18 decommissioned Confederate monuments into a thought-provoking art exhibit titled "Monuments." The centerpiece includes a melted-down statue of General Robert E. Lee and a reconstructed "zombie-like" sculpture of Stonewall Jackson by artist Kara Walker. Curator Hamza Walker argues the exhibit challenges the "Lost Cause ideology" that romanticizes Confederate figures and denies the Civil War's connection to slavery. The article contrasts this initiative with President Trump's calls to reinstall such monuments, highlighting the ongoing national debate over historical symbols and their interpretation.</p>
