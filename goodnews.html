          <p>Jeff Hiller, a character actor, expressed genuine surprise and emotion upon winning his first Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for HBO's "Somebody Somewhere."

Raleigh, who remains focused on the team's goal of ending their division title drought, expressed humility despite making baseball history.

          <p>New York Governor Kathy Hochul has formally endorsed Zohran Mamdani for New York City mayor, expressing confidence in his leadership to address city challenges like affordability and public safety. Despite past disagreements, Hochul believes Mamdani shares her commitment to a safer and more opportunity-rich New York, and a firm stance against Donald Trump's agenda. This endorsement from a moderate governor is significant for Mamdani, a democratic socialist who has recently softened some previous positions. The move aims to unify the Democratic party ahead of the mayoral race.</p>

Despite a rise in farm bankruptcies and increased costs, many farmers, like Tim Maxwell, express patience and continued belief in Trump's policies, expecting long-term benefits. Experts note that rural America's support for Republicans predates Trump, rooted in a shared identity and perceived alienation from urban liberals. While some analysts warn of potential long-term damage to supply chains, farmers remain hopeful for future results.</p>

          <p>Football analyst Danny Murphy argues that Manchester United's recurring problems stem from player selection and positioning rather than their 3-4-2-1 system. Despite tactical improvements in team compactness, individual mistakes continue to cost them points. Murphy highlights Bruno Fernandes playing out of his natural attacking role in central midfield, leading to defensive lapses. Similarly, Luke Shaw's placement in a back three, rather than his usual left-back position, contributes to defensive vulnerabilities. Murphy suggests that until personnel are better utilized within the system, United's struggles are likely to persist.</p>
