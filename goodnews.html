          <p>President Trump has begun a four-day tour of the Middle East, starting in Saudi Arabia, with subsequent stops planned in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. The New York Times article notes that Trump aims to secure deals worth over $1 trillion, focusing on investments in artificial intelligence, energy production, and arms purchases from U.S. manufacturers. He was greeted warmly in Saudi Arabia, in contrast to President Biden's visit in 2022. The visit closely aligns with the Trump family's financial interests, given their pending deals with Saudi-owned firms and projects backed by the governments of Qatar and the UAE.</p>

          <p>The UK jobs market continues to weaken, with the unemployment rate increasing to 4.5% and the number of workers on payrolls falling in recent months. Wage growth has slowed, but pay is still rising faster than inflation. The number of job vacancies has also declined, indicating a cooling labor market. Increases in employer National Insurance contributions and the National Living Wage, which came into effect in April, may have contributed to businesses reducing headcount.</p>

          <p>This article explores the potential of public transport to replace cars, highlighting initiatives in cities like Jakarta and Tallinn. Jakarta uses a Bus Rapid Transit system and minibuses to encourage public transport use, while Tallinn offers free public transport to residents.

          <p>The recent agreement between the U.S. and China to pause high tariffs is creating pressure on manufacturing hubs like Vietnam and Mexico. These countries had previously benefited from a "China-plus-one" strategy, attracting companies seeking alternatives to China due to high tariffs. With the U.S. and China agreeing to reduce tariffs, these manufacturing hubs are now pressured to secure better deals with the U.S. to maintain their competitive advantage. Experts suggest that companies may delay investment decisions due to the uncertainty surrounding trade policies.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to lower tariff rates, but the triple-digit duties imposed since April have only been significantly reduced. The baseline rate is about 50 per cent, which is derived by adding the around 20 per cent in tariffs imposed during Trump‚Äôs first term plus the 30 per cent in new duties still in force after last weekend‚Äôs agreement. These rates do not include previous tariffs, held over from the first iteration of the trade war during Trump‚Äôs initial White House term, nor do they factor in other duties on specific goods and categories of products.</p>
