          <p>The Kremlin has announced that Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to a meeting that will take place in the coming days. According to a Putin adviser, work on organizing the summit has already begun, though a specific date and location have not yet been made public. The meeting follows a visit from a U.S. special envoy and comes ahead of a deadline set by Trump for Moscow to make peace with Ukraine or face severe new sanctions. Trump described the preceding talks as "highly productive."</p>

          <p>Danish shipping giant Maersk has raised its full-year financial guidance after reporting stronger-than-expected second-quarter profits. The company, a key indicator of global trade, cited a manufacturing boom in China and robust export growth worldwide as drivers of demand. However, CEO Vincent Clerc specifically noted that the United States is an exception to this trend, attributing a dampening effect on demand to the "tariff-on, tariff-off" environment. The company now expects global container market volume to grow between 2% and 4%, an upward revision from its previous forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese robotics company Unitree has introduced its new humanoid robot, the R1, at a price of $5,900, making it one of the most affordable bipedal robots available. Promotional videos showcase the four-foot-tall robot performing agile movements like running, spinning, and even doing cartwheels. While the standard model cannot grip objects, an upgraded version offers movable fingers. The low price is seen as a significant step toward making advanced robotics more accessible for researchers, developers, and educational institutions, intensifying competition in the global robotics market.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a plan to construct a $200 million ballroom on the White House grounds, a project he says will be funded by himself and other private donors. The new structure is intended to host large official events like state dinners, which are currently often held in tents. Spanning over 8,000 square meters, it will be one of the most significant architectural additions to the executive mansion in over a century. While Trump has touted his building expertise for the project, the plan has drawn skepticism from Democrats.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that the Democratic party is losing support among working-class voters and must embrace economic populism to win them back. The authors cite a report showing that progressive economic policies, such as taxing the rich and funding public goods, are popular across the political spectrum. They highlight several Democratic candidates who are finding success by focusing on issues like corporate greed and workers' rights rather than culture wars. The piece concludes that for Democrats to build a durable majority, they must elevate candidates who speak directly to the economic realities of working Americans.</p>

          <h2>Bipartisan Push in Congress Aims to Simplify Veterans' Access to Private Healthcare</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-07 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Congress is considering legislation to make it easier for military veterans to use their VA benefits for healthcare at private, non-VA facilities. The proposals, led by Republicans, would build on existing community care programs, particularly for rural veterans who live far from VA hospitals. Supporters argue it provides necessary convenience and choice, while critics and some veterans' groups worry that shifting funds to private care could weaken the VA's specialized system. The debate centers on balancing accessibility for veterans with the need to maintain the integrity and funding of VA-run hospitals and clinics.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: The Democratic Lessons from Los Angeles's Azusa Street Revival</h2>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the 1906 Azusa Street revival in Los Angeles as a historical model for a more inclusive American democracy. Led by Black preacher William J. Seymour, the movement gave birth to modern Pentecostalism and created a radically integrated community that defied the era's segregation. The author argues that these early 20th-century Black migrants built communities based on shared dignity and faith, offering a vision of democracy from the ground up. The piece suggests that in today's politically fragile climate, these lessons in resilience and community-building remain profoundly relevant.</p>

          <h2>California Bill Seeks to Protect Access to HIV Prevention Drugs Amid Federal Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California lawmakers are advancing a bill designed to safeguard insured access to HIV prevention medications like PrEP and PEP. The legislation, AB 554, would mandate that health plans cover these FDA-approved drugs without cost-sharing or prior authorization. This state-level effort comes in response to concerns that the Trump administration may undermine national preventive care mandates, particularly following the HHS Secretary's plan to review the makeup of the influential U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. Advocates see the bill as a crucial shield to protect the health of LGBTQ+ Californians.</p>

          <p>India has shown a calm response to the U.S. imposing a 50% tariff on its goods and threatening secondary sanctions over its oil trade with Russia. There is a consensus in India that the move is a pressure tactic, and the government has signaled it will not compromise on key issues, particularly those affecting its farmers. While the tariffs could significantly impact sectors like gems, jewelry, and textiles, over 60% of India's GDP comes from domestic consumption, providing a buffer. India is pursuing diplomatic channels and appears to be in a "watch and wait" mode. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Saudi Pro League club Al-Hilal has reportedly reached an agreement to sign striker Darwin Nunez from Liverpool for a fee of £46.3 million (€53m). The 26-year-old Uruguayan international is now expected to travel for a medical to finalize the move. Nunez joined Liverpool in 2022 for an initial £64m but had a limited role last season, starting only eight Premier League games. The sale could provide Liverpool with the financial flexibility to pursue other transfer targets, such as Newcastle's Alexander Isak, during the current window.</p>

          <p>In response to a query from NPR, readers shared their personal strategies for curbing the impulse to buy things they don't need. Common tactics include delaying purchases by leaving items in an online cart or adding them to a browser's "wish list" to see if the desire fades over time. Other suggestions involved turning shopping into a game by picking out items without buying them or visiting a library or thrift store to satisfy the "thrill of the hunt" without significant spending. The advice focuses on creating intentionality and finding deeper, non-material sources of fulfillment.</p>
