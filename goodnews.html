        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A top state regulator warns that the US gambling industry is becoming a "highway without speed limits," urging federal lawmakers to consider nationwide rules on advertising by betting firms. Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, also advocates for nationwide exclusion lists to block problem gamblers. He compares regulators to those who install "seatbelt dingers" to ensure responsible behavior within the industry. The industry has rapidly expanded since 2018, often resisting restrictions proposed by states. The regulator also notes the potential of AI to promote healthy betting behaviors.</p>
