          <p>The UK government plans to invest ¬£1.5 billion in at least six new munitions and explosives factories to enhance its defense capabilities and deter adversaries. This initiative, part of the upcoming strategic defense review, aims to create approximately 1,800 new jobs and support the production of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons. Defence Secretary John Healey emphasized the need to strengthen the UK's industrial base in light of the war in Ukraine, which has highlighted deficiencies in Western weapons production. The government aims for an "always on" munitions production capacity that can be rapidly scaled up, increasing the UK's munitions spending to ¬£6 billion during this parliament.</p>

          <p>The UK has officially implemented a ban on the sale of single-use disposable vapes, with the primary goal of safeguarding children's health and protecting the environment. This measure prohibits shops and supermarkets from stocking disposable vapes, while still allowing the sale of rechargeable and refillable devices. Disposable vapes have been identified as a significant factor in the rise of youth vaping, and millions of these devices are discarded annually. While vaping is considered less harmful than smoking, health experts advocate for further regulation to address youth vaping effectively.</p>
