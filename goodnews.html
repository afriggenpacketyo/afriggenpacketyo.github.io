The former world No 1 showcased improved movement, strategic play, and a positive attitude, overcoming Muchova's offensive pressure and an injury timeout. Osaka, a two-time US Open champion, expressed that reaching this stage feels like a dream come true, reinforcing her status as a leading figure on the women's tour.

          <p>The winning numbers for Wednesday's Powerball drawing, an estimated $1.4 billion jackpot, have been announced as 3, 16, 29, 61, 69, with a Powerball of 22. This substantial prize, the game's fourth-largest ever, holds an estimated cash value of $634.3 million before taxes, though it was not immediately confirmed if any winning tickets were sold. The jackpot's rapid growth is attributed to increased ticket sales as drawings approach, making it the sixth-largest lottery prize in history. Despite the slim odds of 1 in 292.2 million, the prospect of such a life-changing win generates immense public excitement.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets saw gains on Thursday, mirroring an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.57%, Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed 0.67% driven by increased household spending, and South Korea's Kospi was up 0.45%. Despite these gains, global bond markets remain a focus, with the U.S. 30-year Treasury yield surpassing 5% and Japan's 30-year bond yield reaching a record high. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite closed higher, fueled by optimism from an Alphabet antitrust case ruling. (not investment advice)</p>

Twenty participants from eight countries are currently engaged in the 14-day training program in Beijing, which covers crucial areas such as safety management, airworthiness certification, green development, and new aviation technologies. This initiative is a clear effort by China to expand its influence within the region's aviation sector and to challenge the long-standing dominance of Western manufacturers like Airbus and Boeing. China's smaller C909 regional jets have already established a decade-long operational presence in Southeast Asia.</p>

          <p>Xiaohongshu, the popular Chinese social media platform often compared to Instagram, has seen its valuation soar by 19% in just three months, reaching an impressive $31 billion in recent transactions by GSR Ventures Management. This significant increase highlights intense investor demand for a robust Chinese equivalent to Western platforms, especially as TikTok faces potential regulatory threats in the US. The platform, also known as RedNote, has gained considerable traction following the Chinese government's renewed commitment to supporting private firms, thereby revitalizing confidence in the country's vibrant start-up ecosystem. Xiaohongshu constitutes a dominant portion of the GSR fund's total assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Former Republican Senator John E. Sununu is seriously considering a bid to return to the Senate in New Hampshire, where a seat is open following Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's decision not to seek re-election. Sununu, a member of a prominent political family, is viewed as a prime recruit for Republicans, with reports indicating support from senior White House officials for his potential campaign. New Hampshire has historically posed a challenge for GOP Senate candidates, but Sununu aims to garner broad support and expects to finalize his decision by the end of next month. If he runs, he will face a primary challenge.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century Italian painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was infamously looted by the Nazis during World War Two. The artwork, estimated to be worth around $50,000, was originally part of the extensive collection of Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his tragic death in 1940. Its reappearance in an online real estate listing in Argentina led investigators to the daughters of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien. This recovery represents a significant step in the ongoing global effort to repatriate stolen art and address historical injustices, bringing a measure of closure.</p>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle, the US fashion retailer, experienced a significant 25% surge after the company reported stronger-than-expected sales, largely attributing the boost to its highly successful viral advertising campaigns featuring celebrities Sydney Sweeney and Travis Kelce. Despite a modest 1% sales dip in the May-July quarter, executives now project low single-digit sales growth for the upcoming months. The "Great Jeans" ad, starring Sweeney, generated immense public debate but also garnered billions of impressions, leading to a rapid sell-out of her signature jeans. The company is also proactively managing tariff costs through supplier negotiations and price adjustments. (not investment advice)</p>

Anisimova, who deliberately rewatched highlights of her previous defeat for motivation, showcased a remarkably fearless and aggressive game, accumulating 23 winners. Her significantly improved mental resilience, developed since taking a break from the sport, was evident as she maintained composure despite early challenges in the match. This victory, which she profoundly described as "the most meaningful of my life," propels her into a highly anticipated semi-final clash against Naomi Osaka.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled against the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, calling it an "ideologically-motivated assault." The judge found the freeze illegal, stating it violated Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, as well as academic freedom. While acknowledging Harvard's shortcomings in addressing antisemitism, the court concluded the administration used this issue as a pretext for broader ideological control over universities. The White House plans to appeal the decision, maintaining Harvard failed to protect students from harassment.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing in the development of AI "agentic frameworks," which are essential tools for creating autonomous AI agents, with major tech giants like Tencent and ByteDance actively joining the global competition against US players. Tencent recently open-sourced its innovative Youtu-Agent framework, demonstrating impressive performance on a web traversal benchmark. This follows similar open-sourcing efforts by ByteDance with its Coze Studio and Alibaba Group Holding with its Qwen-Agent earlier this year. These sophisticated frameworks provide the necessary components to build, deploy, and manage AI agents capable of independently performing complex tasks, signaling China's growing prowess and ambition in artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's use of the 18th-century Alien Enemies Act to rapidly deport Venezuelan migrants, ruling there was "no invasion or predatory incursion." The administration had used this obscure wartime law to remove hundreds of alleged Tren de Aragua gang members, some sent to a supermax prison or exchanged in a prisoner swap. The court rejected the argument that "mass illegal migration" constituted an invasion, upholding the need for due process. This ruling marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration strategy.</p>

This initiative reflects local officials' urgent need to stimulate consumption and bolster economic growth, balancing it with Beijing's ongoing anti-corruption campaign against extravagance. The municipal government anticipates these measures, which strategically focus on sectors like catering, cars, housing, and retail, will inject an additional 178 million yuan in funding this year.
