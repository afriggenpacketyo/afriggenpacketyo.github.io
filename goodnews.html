          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash tariffs for 90 days, signaling a de-escalation in their trade war. The U.S. will lower tariffs on Chinese goods from 145% to 30%, while China will reduce tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%. This agreement, which follows talks in Switzerland, led to a surge in global stock markets, with the S&P 500 jumping 3.2%. While some tariffs remain, this move is seen as a positive step towards resolving trade differences and fostering cooperation between the two countries.</p>

          <p>With gold prices near record highs, investors are considering whether to sell their gold investments. While profits could be substantial, especially for those who bought gold before 2025, selling means losing a portfolio diversifier that tends to hold its value during market instability.
