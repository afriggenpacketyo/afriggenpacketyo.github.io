          <p>JPMorgan Chase has opened its 1,000th new branch since initiating a major expansion plan in 2018, marking the milestone in Charlotte, North Carolina. This growth brings its total to approximately 5,000 branches, the most of any U.S. bank, running counter to the industry trend of branch closures. The bank's strategy involves entering new markets and renovating existing locations to capture more deposits and serve a larger portion of the U.S. population. The expansion aims to add over $160 billion in incremental deposits, with each new branch expected to break even within four years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 15:05:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered that the modern potato evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through a hybridization event. A study published in the journal Cell explains that the potato's ability to form starch-rich tubers is the result of genetic contributions from two different parent species. An ancient tomato provided a key gene that signals the plant to create tubers, while a non-tuber-producing wild potato species from Chile contributed a gene that helps control their growth. This finding resolves a long-standing puzzle about the potato's origins and demonstrates how interbreeding can spark the evolution of new traits.</p>

The incident occurred in the second half following a foul call against Griner during a rebound attempt. After a brief verbal exchange resulted in the first technical foul, Griner appeared to bump the referee, leading to an immediate second technical and her automatic removal from the game.

          <p>Justin Timberlake has revealed he is battling Lyme disease, a bacterial infection spread by ticks that can cause debilitating symptoms. The 44-year-old singer shared the diagnosis on Instagram, explaining that it was the cause of the nerve pain, fatigue, and sickness he experienced while on his recent world tour. He stated that despite the health challenges, he chose to complete the tour, which concluded this week, to avoid disappointing his fans. Timberlake joins other musicians like Justin Bieber and Shania Twain who have also publicly discussed their struggles with the disease.</p>

          <p>American buyers of European-made yachts are expected to use legal strategies to circumvent new 15% U.S. tariffs on EU goods. The most common method will likely be registering the vessel in a foreign country, such as the Cayman Islands or Malta, which allows the yacht to enter U.S. waters as a visiting vessel without being technically imported. While this strategy involves fees, it offers substantial savings on multimillion-dollar yachts, though it is less practical for smaller boats. The tariffs could also potentially boost demand for U.S.-built yachts and pre-owned vessels already registered in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The opening day of the decisive fifth Test cricket match between England and India was overshadowed by a significant shoulder injury to English pace bowler Chris Woakes. He was injured late in the day while fielding and had to leave the pitch, potentially leaving England's already depleted bowling attack with only three seamers for the remainder of the crucial match. Before the injury and two rain delays, England managed to take six Indian wickets, with the tourists ending the day at 204-6. The outcome of the match, and the series, could be heavily influenced by Woakes' absence.</p>

Key initiatives include adding a "smart queue" to reduce wait times and introducing new menu items. Niccol, who has a history of successful corporate turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, expressed confidence that focusing on operational fundamentals will put the company ahead of schedule for a comeback.</p>

          <p>A key consumer protection for federally-backed reverse mortgages, known as the "95% rule," offers a significant benefit to heirs who wish to keep a family home. This rule stipulates that if the loan balance exceeds the home's market value, heirs can satisfy the debt by paying 95% of the property's current appraised value, rather than the full amount owed. This prevents them from having to pay more than the home is worth, with the FHA's mortgage insurance covering the remaining loss. The provision provides peace of mind for senior homeowners and a predictable, more manageable path for heirs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An independent regulatory commission has cleared West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta of spot-fixing charges, nearly two years after the Football Association began its investigation. The Brazil international was accused of deliberately getting yellow cards in four separate matches to improperly influence the betting market and faced a potential lifetime ban if found guilty. While the four main charges were found to be "not proven," the commission did find him guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. Paqueta, who has maintained his innocence, expressed his relief and gratitude following the verdict.</p>

Under the existing terms, Mexico pays a 25% tariff on fentanyl and cars, and a 50% tariff on steel, aluminum, and copper. President Trump announced the extension after a successful phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, citing the complexities of the cross-border relationship.

          <p>A federal appeals court appeared highly skeptical of the Trump administration's legal authority to impose broad tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). During arguments, judges questioned the Justice Department's claim that the law, which does not mention tariffs, grants the president such sweeping power, noting it could disrupt the entire U.S. trade framework established by Congress. The case, brought by several states and businesses, is a major legal test of the president's economic agenda. The court's decision could have significant implications for the administration's use of tariffs as a tool in foreign and trade policy.</p>

The new species, Acrophylla alta, can be up to 40 centimeters long and weigh 44 grams, comparable to a golf ball. It was discovered living high in the canopies of the mountainous Wet Tropics region, a habitat that likely contributed to its large size and why it remained undiscovered for so long. The insect was identified as a new species based on its distinctive eggs, and two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum collection.</p>
