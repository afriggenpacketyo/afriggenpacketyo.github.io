          <p>China's largest trade fair, the Canton Fair, experienced unexpected growth in deals signed during its spring edition, driven by a record high in overseas attendance. Despite the absence of most American buyers, the fair's overall transaction volume rose by 3% year-on-year, with a significant portion of visitors from countries involved in China's Belt and Road Initiative. This performance has boosted confidence in China's export sector and its ability to cope with a prolonged trade war with the US. The Canton Fair is seen as a barometer for China's foreign trade and manufacturing trends.</p>

          <p>Lisa from Blackpink attended the Met Gala wearing a black lace blazer over a bodysuit, paired with Louis Vuitton tights, which prompted online discussion about the pattern of the lace. The lace was found to replicate elements of an artwork by American artist Henry Taylor, depicting portraits of figures who have been part of the artist's life. Taylor had previously collaborated with Louis Vuitton's men's wear creative director, Pharrell Williams, embroidering miniature portraits on suits, jackets, and accessories for his debut show in Paris.</p>

          <p>The UK government will allocate ¬£102m to upgrade and expand GP surgeries, aiming to improve patient access and reduce waiting times. This investment, the largest in facilities for five years, will benefit over 1,000 surgeries and is part of broader plans to overhaul the health service. The funding is intended to address the "08:00 scramble" for same-day appointments and improve patient satisfaction, which has declined since the pandemic due to fewer in-person consultations. The NHS Confederation welcomed the boost, emphasizing the need for sustained investment in primary and community care.</p>

          <p>In response to President Trump's call for tariffs on movies filmed overseas, California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed a $7.5 billion federal film tax credit to support the entertainment industry. The proposal aims to retain film and television production in the United States, particularly in California, which has lost business to states and countries offering incentives. The tax credit would be modeled after California's existing program and seeks to counter the potential negative impacts of tariffs on the industry. The industry has been seeking help, just not necessarily this kind.</p>
