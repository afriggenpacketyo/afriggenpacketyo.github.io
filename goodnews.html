          <p>India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate ceasefire, mediated by the United States, after tensions escalated due to an attack on Indian-controlled Kashmir. The article reports that President Trump announced the ceasefire on social media, and Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed the U.S. brokered talks. While Pakistan's Prime Minister thanked President Trump, Indian officials initially accused Pakistan of attacking multiple locations and moving troops to forward areas. Despite these accusations, both countries have agreed to halt cross-border fire, marking a potential step towards resolving regional issues.</p>
