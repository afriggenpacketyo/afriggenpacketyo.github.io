          <p>A new trade agreement reducing import tariffs between the United Kingdom and the United States has taken effect, benefiting sectors like automotive and aerospace. However, the deal does not cover UK steel and aluminum, which still face a 25% tariff that could double if a separate agreement is not reached by the July 9 deadline. British steel industry leaders express frustration over the uncertainty, which complicates production and shipping decisions. The lack of resolution on these critical materials casts a shadow over the otherwise positive trade development. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Germany's annual inflation rate unexpectedly fell to 2% in June, aligning with the European Central Bank's target for the first time in this cycle. This development in Europe's largest economy was lower than the 2.2% anticipated by analysts and adds to evidence that eurozone inflation is stabilizing. The data strengthens the case for the ECB to consider another interest rate cut later this year, potentially in September. Final inflation data for the entire eurozone is expected to confirm a similar trend across the single currency bloc. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals outfielder James Wood achieved a rare feat in baseball by being intentionally walked four times in a single game against the Los Angeles Angels. This marks the first time a player has received four intentional walks in one game since Barry Bonds in 2004. Despite the opposition's strategy to avoid pitching to him, Wood managed to go 1-for-2 with a stolen base, contributing to the Nationals' 7-4 victory in 11 innings. Wood has been a standout player for the team, drawing comparisons to stars like Juan Soto and Bryce Harper.</p>

          <p>Moderna has announced that its experimental mRNA-based influenza vaccine produced a stronger immune response than a currently available shot in a late-stage trial. The positive results clear a path for the company to seek regulatory approval for both the standalone flu vaccine and its combination COVID-flu shot later this year. The trial, involving over 40,000 adults, found Moderna's vaccine was 26.6% more effective overall. This milestone positions Moderna as a front-runner in the race to market a combination vaccine, which could simplify immunizations and improve public uptake.</p>

          <p>A new book by historian Greg Grandin, "America, Am√©rica," argues that the United States could learn valuable lessons about democracy from Latin America. The article suggests that despite a history of political instability, Latin American nations have a rich tradition of social movements grounded in collective ideals and the common good. Many of the region's foundational constitutions enshrined social rights, such as the abolition of slavery and aid for the destitute, long before similar concepts were broadly accepted elsewhere. This history offers a counter-narrative to the U.S. tendency to view itself as the hemisphere's sole democratic guide.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Alexandra Horowitz, who runs the Dog Cognition Lab at Barnard College, understanding dogs begins with appreciating their primary sense: smell. Unlike humans, who are primarily visual, dogs construct their reality from olfactory information, which is constantly changing and moving. This sense shapes their perception of not only space but also time, as the fading scent of a person allows them to register how long someone has been gone. Horowitz suggests that for dogs, smells are not just good or bad but are a rich source of information about the world.</p>
