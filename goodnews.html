They marched from Plaza Olvera to the Federal Building, carrying flowers and uniting in song and prayer, advocating for healing and justice for those detained and deported.

          <p>The reboot of "28 Years Later," directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, blends ambition, quirky characters, and manic editing, though it has a dull central plot. Picking up nearly three decades into a viral pandemic that isolated the British Isles, the film features a safe community on Lindisfarne. The movie's editing and score create a deliberate abrasive and confounding experience, suggesting humanity's natural state is struggle and division. The film is an intriguing comment on human progress, with a mix of smart and silly elements, and it dares viewers to devolve.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Science reveals that state and local policies regulating plastic bag use have significantly reduced shoreline litter. Researchers reviewed over 600 bag policies and 45,000 shoreline cleanups, finding that plastic bag policies led to a 25% to 47% reduction in discarded bags near coastlines, rivers, and lakes over six years. The study indicates that fees on plastic bags may be more effective than bans, especially partial bans, in limiting shoreline litter, bringing insights to the issue of plastic pollution and its threats to marine environments.</p>

Prosecutors also moved to dismiss charges against a second protester arrested at the same time.

          <p>The Lakers' majority ownership is being sold to Mark Walter and TWGC Global for $10 billion. The Buss family has treated the Lakers like their own child for 46 years, but it is time to give their baby to someone with money and vision. The team of Walter has been in the playoffs every year since 2013 and has won two World Series. The new owners will invest money in the Lakers' infrastructure, coaches, scouts, and facilities.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has extended the deadline for TikTok's sale in the US for another 90 days. The video-sharing app faced potential ban due to concerns over national security, unless it was sold by its Chinese parent company, ByteDance. Trump signed an executive order delaying the enforcement of the law for a third time. The new deadline for a deal is September 17, as authorities in Beijing will need to approve any sale. White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the extension ensures that Americans can continue using TikTok with data safety assurances.</p>
