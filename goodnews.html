          <p>President Trump refuted claims he backs down on tariff threats, a strategy dubbed "Trump Always Chickens Out" (TACO). He asserted his tariff announcements have led to productive trade negotiations, citing the EU's willingness to meet after his tariff threats. Trump defended delaying a 50% tariff on EU goods, framing it as a negotiation tactic that jumpstarted trade talks. He criticized the question as "nasty" while maintaining that his moves have helped the U.S. gain ground in trade negotiations. Optimism score is based on the fact that he believes that his tactics are effective.</p>
