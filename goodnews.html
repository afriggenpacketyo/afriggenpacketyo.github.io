          <p>Alibaba Group Holding has announced plans to significantly increase its capital spending on artificial intelligence, building on an existing commitment of 380 billion yuan. The company's CEO, Eddie Wu Yongming, stated the goal is to become the world's leading full-stack AI service provider, from computing power to advanced models. This move reflects surging demand for AI services and a strategic vision where artificial general intelligence (AGI) represents a new technological beginning, potentially transforming industries and solving global challenges. The increased investment aligns with similar large-scale AI spending by major US tech firms.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, securing the seat previously held by her late father, Raul Grijalva. Her victory over Republican nominee Daniel Butierez further reduces the Republican majority in the House of Representatives. The district, which covers a large portion of the state's border with Mexico, is a Democratic stronghold, making her win widely expected. Grijalva campaigned on a platform opposing President Trump's agenda and will serve the remainder of her father's term, becoming Arizona's first Latina member of Congress.</p>

CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company is evaluating a private placement to raise between $15 billion and $20 billion from a select group of investors. The new funds are intended to massively scale Tether's expansion into various sectors, including artificial intelligence, energy, and communications. This move comes as the company aims to strengthen its presence in the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new theoretical paper suggests that a record-breaking high-energy neutrino detected in 2023 could be the first observational evidence of an evaporating primordial black hole. Physicists from MIT propose that the particle, which struck Earth with an energy of 220 petaelectronvolts, was produced by a burst of Hawking radiation as a small black hole exploded. This theory could also explain other high-energy neutrino events and offers a potential solution to the mystery of dark matter, assuming it is composed of such primordial black holes. While still a hypothesis, it provides a testable framework for future experiments to confirm these phenomena.</p>

          <h2>Beijing's National Day Parade Viewed as a Symbol of Cohesion for Hong Kong and Macau</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article presents the perspective that China's recent decennial military parade in Beijing holds significant meaning beyond a simple display of military strength. For observers in Hong Kong and Macau, the event is framed as a powerful declaration of national cohesion and institutional resilience. It serves to connect individuals with the nation's destiny, creating an emotional resonance that transcends personal anxieties in a fragmented world. The author argues that viewing the parade through a non-Western lens reveals its deeper purpose in reinforcing a sense of collective identity and national pride among the Chinese people.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form," citing economic pressure on Russia. This statement, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a departure from his previous suggestions that Kyiv might need to concede territory to end the war. Trump asserted that Russia is a "paper tiger" in major economic trouble, creating an opportune moment for Ukraine to act with support from Europe and NATO. Zelensky hailed the change as a "big shift" and a positive signal from the U.S.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Secret Service has dismantled a large, sophisticated telecommunications network in the New York area that posed a potential threat during the UN General Assembly. Investigators discovered over 300 SIM servers and 100,000 SIM cards capable of sending 30 million texts per minute, powerful enough to disable cell towers. The network was reportedly used for encrypted communication by foreign governments, organized crime gangs, and drug cartels. The operation, the largest of its kind, was triggered by telephonic threats made to senior U.S. officials, and authorities believe it was well-organized and well-funded.</p>

          <p>This article examines the history and impact of China's five-year plans, which have been a cornerstone of its macroeconomic policy since 1953. Despite the country's shift away from a command economy, these plans have guided its transformation from a nation with limited industrial capacity to the "world's factory." The 14 plans implemented over seven decades illustrate China's complex economic trajectory and policy shifts. Beijing is now using this framework to advance its goal of moving up the value chain to become a global leader in innovation and cutting-edge technology, with the upcoming 15th five-year plan expected to be crucial.</p>

          <p>Health organizations and medical experts from around the world are pushing back against the Trump administration's claim of a link between acetaminophen (Tylenol) use during pregnancy and autism. Regulatory bodies including the European Medicines Agency and the UK's MHRA have reaffirmed that the medication is safe for pregnant women, stating there is no new evidence to suggest a causal link to autism. Health authorities in Australia and Spain, along with the World Health Organization, have also rejected the claim, citing robust scientific studies that contradict it and warning against the spread of misinformation.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Oregon believe they have located the remains of "Oak Grove Jane Doe," the state's oldest unidentified victim, whose dismembered body parts were found in the Willamette River in 1946. The case went cold in the 1950s after critical evidence, including the remains, went missing from law enforcement custody. The discovery was made at a cemetery under a headstone marked "Unknown Woman 1946" by the state medical examiner's Human Identification Program. The remains will now undergo advanced forensic testing, offering hope that the victim's identity can finally be restored after nearly 80 years.</p>

          <p>Jerome Cohen, a groundbreaking scholar of Chinese law who influenced global understanding of the country's legal system and human rights for over six decades, has died at the age of 95. As a professor emeritus at New York University's School of Law, he was the first American to practice law in China under Communist rule and was renowned for his foundational work on Chinese criminal procedure. Cohen was also a respected advocate for Chinese dissidents while simultaneously supporting continued engagement with Beijing. He is remembered by colleagues as a true giant in his field who shaped the study of Asian law in the United States.</p>
