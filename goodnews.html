          <h2>Exploring the Financial Interplay Between Annuities and Social Security Benefits</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 14:03:43 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines how annuities can complement Social Security to create a more stable retirement income strategy for seniors. It explains that annuity payments can provide the necessary funds to allow retirees to delay claiming Social Security, which can increase their monthly benefits by approximately 8% for each year of deferral past full retirement age. Furthermore, annuities can help manage the taxability of Social Security income and provide a predictable "paycheck" to cover expenses not fully met by federal benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will implement its Automated Ball-Strike (ABS) Challenge System during the upcoming All-Star Game, marking a significant step toward its potential use in the regular season. Under the system, the pitcher, catcher, or batter can challenge a ball or strike call, with each team receiving two challenges. A successful challenge is retained. This test follows years of implementation in the minor leagues and a trial during spring training, as MLB continues to integrate technology to improve umpire accuracy, which has already risen significantly since 2008.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Philharmonic's 103rd season at the Hollywood Bowl opened with a program featuring Russian composers Rachmaninoff and Prokofiev, reflecting a complex cultural moment. The concert was marked by the notable absence of music director Gustavo Dudamel for most of the summer, as a travel ban has prevented his Simón Bolivar Symphony Orchestra from performing. Danish conductor Thomas Sondergard made his debut, leading a performance that was at times powerful but also highlighted the ongoing relevance and controversy of performing Russian music amid the war in Ukraine.</p>

          <p>Following President Trump's praise of Liberian President Joseph Boakai's "good English," this article provides historical context on the deep ties between the two nations. It highlights that Liberia was founded in 1822 by freed African-American slaves, and English is its official language, explaining the American-style accent. The capital, Monrovia, is named after U.S. President James Monroe, and the country's flag is nearly identical to that of the U.S. This shared history has resulted in significant cultural and institutional influences, which may not be widely known but explain the familiarity Trump noted.</p>

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has indicated that a meeting with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi could be in the works. If it occurs, the meeting would take place on the sidelines of an Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) event and would be the first in-person discussion between the two top diplomats since Rubio took office. Rubio also suggested the U.S. might seek China's assistance in persuading Russia to end the war in Ukraine. The potential for dialogue comes despite Rubio's historically hawkish stance on China, for which Beijing has sanctioned him twice.</p>

          <p>This article delves into the historical and cultural meaning of the term "middlebrow," tracing it back to early 20th-century literary debates. It highlights Virginia Woolf's fierce disdain for the concept, which she defined as a dishonest and fashionable approach to art, distinct from the authentic passions of both "highbrow" and "lowbrow" consumers. Woolf famously declared she would "stab, dead" anyone who called her middlebrow. The essay reflects on how the term has evolved from a pejorative label into a more general descriptor for things perceived as harmlessly pedestrian in contemporary culture.</p>

          <p>A Boston resident, Jean Powers, has created a "not mail" box outside her home to foster a sense of connection with her neighbors and strangers. The box invites people to anonymously share "thoughts, opinions, poetry, secrets and lies," and has received a wide range of responses from silly notes to heartfelt poems and personal confessions. Powers started the project during the pandemic as a way to connect with others in a world that felt increasingly distant. She says the experience allows her to "look into the hearts and souls of strangers" and appreciate a shared, gorgeous humanity.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article outlines several signs that could indicate credit card debt forgiveness is a beneficial financial strategy for those with significant balances. These indicators include situations where monthly interest payments exceed principal reduction, eligibility for a substantial balance reduction, or facing a long repayment timeline that would be more costly than a settlement. The strategy involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than the total amount owed, which can provide significant savings despite potential fees and a temporary negative impact on one's credit score.

This sale makes it the most valuable handbag ever sold at auction, following a spirited 10-minute bidding war. The iconic bag was conceived after Birkin lamented to the head of Hermès on a flight that she couldn't find a suitable bag for her needs. The prototype, which features her initials and other unique marks, was donated by Birkin to a charity auction in 1994.</p>
