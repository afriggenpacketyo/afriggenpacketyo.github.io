          <p>The UK's Transport Secretary has approved a £2.2 billion plan for a second runway at London's Gatwick Airport, a project aimed at boosting economic growth. The expansion involves bringing the airport's existing northern runway into regular use, which could increase annual flights from 280,000 to nearly 389,000 by the late 2030s. While supporters cite job creation and economic benefits, the decision faces strong opposition from environmental campaigners and local groups concerned about increased noise, traffic, and climate impact.</p>

          <p>London held a one-day trial banning vehicle traffic from a section of Oxford Street, a move Mayor Sadiq Khan hopes will pave the way for permanent pedestrianization. The event, called "This is Oxford Street," closed a half-mile stretch of the famous shopping district to vehicles, offering a glimpse of a future focused on shoppers and pedestrians. While many visitors welcomed the change, some local groups and residents have raised concerns about the potential for traffic congestion on side streets and accessibility issues.</p>

          <p>The Big Cat Project has released dramatic footage showing the release of two rehabilitated Amur tigers in Russia. The video captures the immense power and fury of the massive predators as they swat and bite at their cage doors just before being set free. Amur tigers, also known as Siberian tigers, are the largest tiger subspecies and are an endangered species, with only 500 to 600 estimated to be living in the wild. Conservation groups highlight the footage as a reminder of the importance of protecting these majestic animals.</p>

          <p>American runner Cole Hocker claimed the gold medal in the men's 5,000-meter race at the World Championships in Tokyo with a stunning final-lap performance. Hocker was in 11th place at the start of the final 400 meters but unleashed a powerful kick to surge past his rivals and win in 12 minutes, 58.30 seconds. The victory provided redemption for Hocker, who expressed feeling "robbed" after being controversially disqualified from the 1,500-meter event earlier in the championships for jostling.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has suggested that the U.S. team could face negative pressure from the home crowd at Bethpage due to a controversial decision to pay American players. Each member of the U.S. team will receive $500,000, while the European players continue to compete for free. Donald speculates that if the paid U.S. team underperforms, the New York audience, who are paying high ticket prices, might turn on their own players, adding a unique psychological element to the upcoming competition.</p>

          <p>Following a recent Federal Reserve rate cut, the stock market surged to new records, with some Wall Street strategists believing there is still room for growth. Optimism is fueled by easier financial conditions and the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence, which is seen as driving productivity and strong earnings. While some analysts acknowledge that valuations are high by historical standards, they argue that the modern, tech-oriented composition of the S&P 500 justifies these levels, though they also caution against a speculative "melt-up."

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to well-being and aging expert Elissa Epel, chronic stress can accelerate the aging process at a cellular level by shortening telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes. While telomeres naturally shrink with age, prolonged stress speeds up this decline, potentially leading to health issues. Epel suggests that this damage is reversible through daily practices designed to lower stress, such as eating more fruits and vegetables, taking short meditative breaks, and prioritizing deep rest through activities like yoga or breathwork.</p>
