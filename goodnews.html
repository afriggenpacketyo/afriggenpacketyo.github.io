          <p>Warren Buffett announced at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting that he will step down as CEO by the end of the year, designating Greg Abel, the vice chairman of non-insurance operations, as his successor. Buffett, who has led the company since 1965, stated he will still be around to assist, but Abel will have the final say on company operations and capital deployment. This transition marks the end of an era for the $1.1 trillion conglomerate, as Abel, 62, prepares to take the reins. Buffett also stated that 'Trade should not be a weapon' when discussing the economy.</p>

By owning Discover's payment network, Capital One aims to reduce reliance on Visa and Mastercard. CEO Richard Fairbank emphasized the importance of building international acceptance of the Discover network to unlock additional value.

          <p>Nigel Farage's Reform Party has achieved significant success in recent local elections, prompting discussions about his potential to become prime minister. Reform's gains highlight the public's disillusionment with the political system, challenging the traditional two-party dominance. While Labour seeks to demonstrate the positive impact of government, the Conservatives are striving to project a serious image and define their party's identity. Reform's focus now shifts to demonstrating its ability to govern effectively.</p>
