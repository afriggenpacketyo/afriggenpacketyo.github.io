        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Creatine supplements, long favored by athletes for muscle growth, are gaining mainstream popularity for a range of purported health benefits, from cognitive enhancement to blood sugar regulation. Decades of research confirm that creatine monohydrate, when combined with resistance training, effectively helps build lean muscle mass and improve short-burst athletic performance. However, evidence for its other advertised benefits, such as improving bone health or brain function, is still emerging and considered less conclusive by scientists. While generally considered safe for healthy adults, experts advise choosing third-party certified products and caution that a significant portion of the population may not experience noticeable effects from supplementation.</p>

          <p>A young bald eagle recently visited the famous Big Bear nest of eagle parents Jackie and Shadow, leading to widespread speculation that it was their offspring, Gizmo, returning home. Observers of the 24-hour webcam noted several features matching Gizmo, including a distinctive dark tail, a gap in its left-wing feathers, and a unique upturn at the corners of its mouth. While it's common for eaglets to return shortly after their first flight, a visit from a nearly six-month-old juvenile is considered unusual. The potential homecoming has delighted thousands of online fans who followed the turbulent nesting season, which included the loss of one of three chicks to a storm.</p>

As the first hotel built from the ground up in the area in 15 years, Reset aims to provide modern hospitality without impacting the local housing supply, which has been strained by the rise of vacation rentals.</p>

          <p>In a candid interview, 'Eat, Pray, Love' author Elizabeth Gilbert discusses her new memoir and her path to recovery from what she identifies as a sex and love addiction. Gilbert explains how for decades she compulsively used romantic relationships for stimulation and sedation, a pattern that culminated after the death of her partner, Rayya Elias. She describes her recovery as a process of learning to be in a healthy relationship with herself, taking accountability for her own life, and finding contentment in solitude. Gilbert shares insights on recognizing addictive behaviors and emphasizes the importance of self-care and establishing boundaries before considering new romantic partnerships.</p>

          <p>The Broad museum in Los Angeles is preparing for the largest-ever solo exhibition of artist Robert Therrien's work, aiming to provide a deeper understanding of the man behind the museum's iconic oversized table sculpture. Therrien, who passed away in 2019, was a pivotal figure in the L.A. sculpture scene, known for his large-scale works that evoke childhood memories and feelings of being small in a large world. The exhibition, titled 'This Is a Story,' will feature 120 pieces, including sculptures, photography, and paintings spanning his entire career. Curators hope the show will illuminate his experimental and influential role within the broader history of sculpture in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka enters her US Open semi-final against Jessica Pegula with a remarkable record of consistency, having reached the semi-finals in 12 of her last 13 Grand Slam appearances. However, her powerful style has often been undermined by mental errors at critical moments, resulting in only three titles from those deep runs. This year, she has fallen short in the final or semi-final of all three previous majors due to what she describes as losing emotional control. To overcome this hurdle and defend her US Open title, Sabalenka has added 10-time Grand Slam doubles champion Max Mirnyi to her coaching team to help manage the immense pressure.</p>

          <p>This opinion article reflects on the recent press conference where ten of Jeffrey Epstein's victims spoke on the steps of the U.S. Capitol, marking a significant moment in the ongoing scandal. The author argues that the event represents a shift where the survivors' voices, long ignored by law enforcement and media, are now being amplified and heard across the political spectrum. The piece frames the Epstein saga not as a political conspiracy, but as one of money and power used against the vulnerable. The public testimony is presented as a powerful continuation of the #MeToo movement, demanding that 'shame must change sides' and holding powerful figures accountable.</p>

Two men were arrested in Egypt, where authorities seized equipment and uncovered a complex financial network allegedly used to launder millions in advertising revenue.

          <p>West Ham midfielder Lucas Paqueta is reportedly considering suing the Football Association after an independent commission cleared him of spot-fixing allegations. The Brazilian player was charged by the FA in May 2024 for allegedly getting booked deliberately to influence the betting market, but he was acquitted of all four charges in July 2025. Newly published written reasons from the commission questioned the FA's reliance on an internal investigator instead of independent betting data experts. The investigation, which began in August 2023, caused the collapse of Paqueta's potential £80 million transfer to Manchester City, and his legal team is now exploring all options for recourse.</p>

After holding talks, the leaders insisted they are committed to preserving the welfare state while acknowledging the need for reforms, which they aim to agree upon within the year. The joint appearance was an attempt to quell public concern over government instability and demonstrate a united front in tackling the nation's difficult budgetary challenges.

          <p>A recent series of high-level meetings hosted by Chinese President Xi Jinping has provided clearer insight into Beijing's foreign policy priorities and its vision for a multipolar world order. Across discussions with various world leaders, Xi consistently emphasized the importance of multilateralism and a United Nations-centered international system, a message seen as a veiled critique of U.S. unilateralism. These diplomatic engagements highlight China's strategy of casting itself as a champion for the global south and strengthening economic and political partnerships. The overarching theme reinforces China's goal to build coalitions and offer an alternative to the current U.S.-led global framework.</p>

As cars last longer than ever, owners face a complex choice between selling, donating for reuse, or recycling a vehicle that is becoming unreliable and costly to repair. The piece weighs the perspectives of a used car dealer who sees no value, a nonprofit that could repair it for a family in need, and an auto recycler who emphasizes the environmental benefits of taking high-polluting older cars off the road. It details the modern auto recycling process, where nearly every part of a car is salvaged, reused, or repurposed, offering a form of 'afterlife' for the vehicle.</p>

          <p>The Texas hometown of late author Larry McMurtry is experiencing a revival with the reopening of his famous bookstore, Booked Up, as the new Larry McMurtry Literary Center. After McMurtry's death in 2021, the store closed, but it has now been repurposed to preserve his vast book collection and perpetuate his literary legacy through writers' retreats and public events. The celebrated author of 'Lonesome Dove' had aspired to turn tiny Archer City into a major book destination. The new center aims to fulfill that vision, attracting literary tourism and honoring the prolific writer who famously explored and often de-mythologized the American West and small-town life.</p>
