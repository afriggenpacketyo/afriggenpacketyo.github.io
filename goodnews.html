          <p>The United States and the European Union have successfully negotiated a trade deal, narrowly avoiding a looming deadline that threatened higher tariffs. President Trump announced the agreement, which establishes a 15% tariff on most European goods, a rate lower than the previously threatened 30%. As part of the deal, the EU has also committed to purchasing $750 billion in U.S. energy and making $600 billion in new investments in the U.S. The agreement provides stability and predictability for the massive transatlantic trading relationship, though some European officials noted the new tariffs will still make trade more challenging.

          <p>Following the England women's football team's historic Euro 2025 final win against Spain, Downing Street has indicated it has no plans to announce a celebratory bank holiday. This decision aligns with the precedent set after the team's 2022 Euro victory and the men's 1966 World Cup win. While a victory parade is scheduled in London, the government appears to be weighing the potential economic cost of an extra public holiday, which has been estimated at over £1 billion. Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who had previously supported the idea, praised the "history makers" for their dramatic penalty shootout victory.</p>

          <h2>Tadej Pogacar Secures Fourth Tour de France Title Amid Novel Montmartre Finish</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 15:54:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogacar has officially won his fourth Tour de France, concluding the race with a significant lead over his rivals. The final stage in Paris featured a novel and controversial addition: three circuits around the steep, cobbled streets of Montmartre, a change from the traditional flat sprint on the Champs-Elysées. While Wout van Aert won the final stage, Pogacar celebrated his overall victory, which he attributed to building a comfortable lead during the tour's second week. Some riders, including second-place finisher Jonas Vingegaard, expressed concerns that the new, narrow climb added unnecessary stress to the final day.</p>

          <p>The leaders of Thailand and Cambodia are set to meet in Malaysia for peace talks aimed at ending days of deadly border clashes that have killed at least 34 people. The negotiations will be mediated by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is acting in his capacity as the chair of ASEAN. The talks follow continued artillery exchanges between the two nations over contested border temples. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed credit for facilitating the talks, stating he had spoken with both prime ministers and threatened to withhold trade deals if the fighting did not cease.</p>

          <p>In an analysis of the fourth Test between England and India, BBC cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew expressed concern over Ben Stokes' physical condition, noting that the England captain must learn to manage his own workload. Agnew argues that it is clear no one in the England camp can tell Stokes to stop bowling, despite visible signs of physical strain. He emphasizes that Stokes' importance to the team is immense, but for the sake of England's future success, particularly in the upcoming Ashes series, Stokes himself must prioritize his long-term fitness. The article highlights Stokes' critical role and the risk his potential absence poses to the team's prospects.</p>
