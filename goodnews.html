          <p>In its first major strategic move since merging with Skydance, Paramount has acquired the U.S. rights for all UFC events in a seven-year deal valued at $7.7 billion. Starting in 2026, all UFC fights, including 13 marquee events and 30 "Fight Nights," will be available on Paramount+ without additional pay-per-view fees, a significant shift from the current model on ESPN+. TKO Group, UFC's parent company, views the move as an end to the "outdated" pay-per-view system, aiming to consolidate its content on a single platform to attract a wider audience.</p>

Qualley explained that she followed "Southern girl etiquette" in their early courtship, adhering to old-school traditions like not texting twice. She described falling in love quickly after they met in 2021 and feeling an immediate sense of safety and comfort with Antonoff, whom she married in August 2023. The actress also spoke about her preference for a less-connected lifestyle, keeping minimal apps on her phone to feel more immersed in her life.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten years after China's surprising 2015 yuan devaluation sent shockwaves through global markets, its approach to managing the currency has matured significantly. Beijing now utilizes a more diverse toolkit to handle exchange-rate volatility, moving away from the previous strategy of depleting its vast foreign reserves to defend the yuan's value. This shift has led to more stable reserves and a market-based, yet still managed, pricing system. The primary challenge for the next decade will be to further internationalize the yuan while avoiding destabilizing fluctuations in its value. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Clothing subscription service Stitch Fix has reported its first quarterly revenue growth in three years, suggesting its turnaround strategy under CEO Matt Baer is gaining traction. The company, which struggled after a pandemic-era boom, saw modest sales growth and an increase in average order value for the seventh consecutive quarter. While its active client base is still declining, the company has focused on improving its service flexibility, revamping its private brands, and cutting costs. These efforts have narrowed its losses and generated positive free cash flow, indicating a potential path back to profitability.</p>

          <p>Shares of lithium producers, including U.S.-based Albemarle, experienced a significant surge after a major Chinese mine suspended its operations. The Yichun Project, operated by battery giant CATL, halted production because its permit expired. This mine is responsible for approximately 4% of the projected global lithium supply for 2025, and its temporary closure has tightened an already constrained market. CATL has stated it is working to renew the permit and will resume production as soon as possible, but the disruption has already impacted market expectations for lithium prices.

          <p>The cryptocurrency market has seen a significant rally, with Bitcoin's price approaching its all-time high of over $119,000. Simultaneously, Ether surged past the key psychological and technical level of $4,000, reaching its highest point since December 2021. This upward momentum in digital assets has occurred alongside gains in U.S. equity futures. Analysts suggest the crypto surge is fueled by the rapid expansion of U.S. debt, which is driving investors toward hard assets like Bitcoin and gold as a potential hedge against inflation and economic uncertainty.

          <p>Bournemouth's Ukrainian center-back, Illia Zabarnyi, is reportedly set for a medical examination ahead of a significant transfer to Paris St-Germain. The deal for the 22-year-old defender is valued at an initial £54.5 million, with an additional £2.6 million in potential add-ons. This move would mark the third major defensive sale for Bournemouth this transfer window, following the departures of Dean Huijsen and Milos Kerkez. Despite the need to rebuild its defense, the club is poised to make a substantial profit from these collective transfers.</p>

          <p>The transfer of South Korean superstar Son Heung-min to Los Angeles FC is expected to open up significant commercial avenues for Major League Soccer in Asia. As one of the continent's most beloved and marketable athletes, Son's presence in the U.S. provides a powerful platform for LAFC and the league to engage with Asian markets and brands. While some Korean fans were initially disappointed he left European football, many now support his decision. Marketing experts believe LAFC has a 24-month window to capitalize on this opportunity through tours, content partnerships, and endorsements with global Korean companies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has stated that the term artificial general intelligence (AGI) is becoming less useful due to its vague and varied definitions. AGI, the concept of an AI that can perform any intellectual task a human can, has long been a goal for OpenAI. However, Altman now believes it is more productive to discuss different levels of AI capability rather than a binary AGI-or-not distinction. Other experts agree, noting that the sci-fi-like term often creates hype that obscures tangible progress in more specialized AI fields, while serving to attract massive investment.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With several Western nations like France, Canada, and Australia announcing their intent to recognize a Palestinian state, the global diplomatic landscape is shifting. Currently, 147 of the 193 UN member countries officially recognize Palestine, many having done so after the 1988 declaration of independence by the PLO. While Palestine holds non-member observer status at the UN, full membership has been consistently blocked by a U.S. veto in the Security Council. The ongoing war in Gaza has revived momentum for the two-state solution, pushing more countries to reconsider their long-held positions on the issue.</p>
