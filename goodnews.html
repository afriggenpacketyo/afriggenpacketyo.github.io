          <p>President Trump is set to sign an executive order creating a federal task force to oversee preparations for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The White House stated the task force will manage key areas such as security, transportation, and visa processing for the international event. The move is supported by LA28, the Games' organizing committee, which praised the administration's leadership and commitment to delivering a successful event. This follows Trump's previous actions related to sports, including chairing a task force for the 2026 World Cup and signing legislation that provides over $1 billion in federal funding for Olympics security and planning.</p>

          <p>Australia will acquire 11 advanced Mogami-class frigates from Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in a deal valued at AU$10 billion ($6.5 billion). Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles described it as the largest defense-industry agreement ever made between the two nations, reflecting a close strategic alignment. The deal is part of Australia's major military restructuring aimed at enhancing long-range strike capabilities in response to China's military expansion. This marks Japan's first warship export since before World War II, with the first three ships to be built in Japan and the remaining eight to be constructed in Western Australia.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. An investigation across 140 UPS locations found that corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials were being discarded in regular trash bins and sent to landfills not equipped to handle such waste. The settlement includes $1.4 million in civil penalties and funds for environmental projects. UPS, which cooperated with the investigation, stated it has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities to address the issue and ensure compliance with environmental laws.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:12:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prominent market analyst Tom Lee of Fundstrat suggests that any market selloff in August will likely be temporary, advising investors to "buy the dip." He argues that recent economic data, including a weaker-than-expected July jobs report, is solid yet soft enough to prompt the Federal Reserve to implement "insurance" interest rate cuts. Despite concerns over rising inflation and unemployment sparking stagflation fears, market optimism is growing for a rate cut at the September FOMC meeting. Lee's firm believes that this potential for lower lending rates will likely outweigh short-term economic worries for the stock market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles star running back Saquon Barkley has turned down an invitation to serve on President Trump's revitalized council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Barkley stated that due to his busy schedule, he and his family decided it was in his best interest to decline the offer. The council is part of a broader initiative that also saw Trump reestablish the Presidential Fitness Test for schools. Barkley, who has previously golfed with both Trump and former President Barack Obama, explained his past interactions with political figures as showing respect for the office of the presidency, not as a political statement.</p>

          <p>The remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, have been discovered by archaeologists in a cave in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The discovery was made during a survey of caverns near Ingleborough as part of a larger heritage project. Researchers also found evidence that the area was used for human burials during the Neolithic period, shedding new light on the prehistoric human and agricultural history of the region. The project highlights the crucial role of recreational cavers, who often first encounter such finds in locations that are difficult to access, in uncovering underground history.</p>

          <h2>American Eagle Stock Surges Over 20% After Trump Praises Sydney Sweeney Ad Campaign</h2>

          <p>Shares of American Eagle Outfitters surged more than 20% after President Trump praised the retailer's marketing campaign featuring actress Sydney Sweeney. In a social media post, Trump endorsed the ad, which had drawn criticism from some online commentators who accused its "great jeans/genes" wordplay of aligning with eugenics. The president contrasted the campaign with what he termed "woke" advertising from other brands, celebrating Sweeney as a "registered Republican." The stock rally marks a significant positive turn for American Eagle, which has recently faced financial headwinds, including withdrawn guidance and a write-off of unsold merchandise due to slow sales.</p>

          <p>A hiker was rescued by helicopter after falling 25 feet from the top of Big Falls waterfall in Forest Falls, California, and landing in a rocky pool below. The man, who suffered severe but non-life-threatening injuries, was discovered after another person heard his screams for help. A specialized rescue helicopter from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department responded, lowering a paramedic to stabilize the patient before airlifting him to a trauma center. Fire department officials noted that falls are a common occurrence at the popular but dangerous location, where warning signs are often ignored by visitors.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society shows a significant increase in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49, which is linked to a rise in screening rates for this age group. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screenings for this demographic increased by 62% from 2019 to 2023. This led to a 12% annual jump in incidence from 2019 to 2022, suggesting that first-time screenings are successfully detecting cancers earlier. Despite this promising news, researchers caution that screening rates for younger adults remain suboptimal and inequitable across education and insurance levels.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer stated that the stock market's strong rebound on Monday was driven by the impressive earnings and performance of the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. After a weak jobs report caused a dip on Friday, the major indexes surged, with Cramer attributing the resilience to the strength of companies like Microsoft, Meta, and Alphabet. He highlighted Microsoft's "flawless" quarter, Meta's massive user base, and Alphabet's broad success across its platforms. Cramer argued that these cash-rich, dominant companies are difficult to beat, providing a solid foundation for the market even amidst economic uncertainty and potential Fed rate cuts.

          <p>A woman whose twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held firearm has expressed hope as new, tighter gun control measures become law in the UK. Emma Ambler has campaigned for stricter laws since her sister's family was killed in 2020 by her partner, who had lied on his shotgun application. The new rules, effective August 5, require two character references for shotgun applications instead of one and mandate that police speak with partners to identify signs of domestic abuse. The Home Office said the changes aim to ensure only those meeting the highest safety standards can access firearms.</p>

He distinguishes his approach from extreme biohacking, emphasizing a balance between health-consciousness and enjoying life, family, and relationships, while also embracing the inevitability of death.</p>

This strategic push comes as a key competitor, South Korea, is set to lose some of its appeal after announcing it will end value-added tax refunds for foreign tourists seeking cosmetic surgery services.

          <p>New guidance for the UK's National Health Service recommends that patients coming off obesity drugs like Wegovy and Mounjaro receive structured support for at least a year to prevent weight regain. Health assessment body NICE issued the advice, acknowledging that many people regain a significant portion of lost weight after stopping the medication. The guidance emphasizes that weight management is a long-term process requiring ongoing support, including healthy eating habits and physical activity. While an estimated 1.5 million people in the UK use these jabs, most pay privately and will not be eligible for this NHS support.</p>

Following the results, Palantir raised its full-year revenue guidance to over $4 billion.
