          <p>Following a deadly tornado in St. Louis, Mayor Cara Spencer placed the city's emergency manager, Sarah Russell, on administrative leave due to the failure to activate tornado warning sirens. The sirens were not activated because Russell was at a training session and the Fire Department's backup button was broken. The directive to the Fire Department to activate the sirens was also deemed ambiguous, causing further delay. As a result, the city has changed the siren activation protocol, giving the Fire Department sole responsibility to activate the sirens from a staffed office. ()</p>

          <p>Leaders of the United States Institute for Peace (USIP) regained control of their headquarters after a judge ruled the Trump administration's takeover, facilitated by Elon Musk's DOGE, was unlawful. The events began with President Trump declaring USIP "unnecessary" and terminating its leadership, staff, and board. DOGE representatives then seized the building, transferring ownership to the Government Services Administration. The judge's ruling nullified these actions, restoring USIP's leadership and mission to provide analysis and resources for peace around the world. ()</p>

A surge of applicants caused a website error, blocking everyone from applying, and a previous attempt using a first-come, first-served approach overwhelmed the system. Officials have rescheduled the application window for May 29 and implemented measures to handle high traffic, including a virtual waiting room managed by cybersecurity and cloud computing companies. The program has $2 million available to fund 1,000 vouchers, and has already approved 1,022 vouchers to date. ()</p>
