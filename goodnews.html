          <p>Liverpool defeated Bournemouth 4-2 in a dramatic Premier League opener at Anfield. New signing Hugo Ekitike made an impressive debut, scoring one goal and assisting another, but the victory was marred by the team's defensive vulnerabilities. The match also featured emotional tributes to the late Diogo Jota, with both players and fans honoring the former striker. Despite the win, the performance highlighted significant flaws and areas for improvement for the reigning champions under head coach Arne Slot.</p>

While Wall Street welcomes the renewed activity, some experts caution that the exuberant market conditions and significant first-day stock pops are reminiscent of the dot-com bubble, raising concerns about sustainability.

However, with the rollback of federal EV tax credits, the truck's final price may be closer to $28,000, placing it in a more competitive market segment and challenging its core value proposition of affordability.

          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have reached an agreement to scale back the federal takeover of the city's Metropolitan Police Department (MPD). Under the pact, MPD will remain under the command of its local chief, Pamela Smith, not a federally appointed administrator from the DEA. The agreement came after D.C. filed a lawsuit and sought an emergency restraining order against what it called a "hostile takeover." The deal allows the federal government to utilize MPD officers for federal purposes in emergencies but restores local control.</p>
