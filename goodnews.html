          <p>England selector Luke Wright has refrained from confirming Ollie Pope's position as the number three batsman for the first Test against India, even after Jacob Bethell's inclusion in the squad. Bethell, who recently played in the Indian Premier League, returns to the team, presenting a viable option for the batting order. Wright stated that the team will assess conditions and previous performances before making a final decision two days before the Test match in Leeds. With Bethell's impressive performance in New Zealand and the West Indies, his inclusion adds depth and flexibility to the squad, making the final selection a difficult but positive challenge for the selectors. </p>

A satellite tracking device has been attached to Dilly Dally's shell, allowing researchers and the public to monitor her movements and migration patterns.

          <p>A recent Harvard University report indicates that the United States continues to lead China in critical technologies such as artificial intelligence, biotechnology, semiconductors, space, and quantum computing. This lead is attributed to substantial public and private investments, a diverse research workforce, and a decentralized innovation ecosystem. The report emphasizes financial resources as a key factor in the US's competitive edge, distinguishing it from other assessments that focus solely on research output. While China is rapidly closing the gap, the US maintains its position due to its robust investment and innovation infrastructure. </p>

          <p>Experts are discussing the role and importance of best friendships for children, emphasizing that while close friendships can be beneficial, they are not essential for every child's well-being. Clinical psychologist Eileen Kennedy-Moore notes that children with best friends tend to be less anxious and more engaged in school. However, educational psychologist Michele Borba suggests that children need a variety of supportive relationships rather than relying solely on one best friend. Teens report feeling pressure to have a best friend, but experts agree that having reliable people to turn to is more important than adhering to a specific label or relationship structure. </p>

The ONS has apologized for the error and stated that it will use correctly weighted data from May 2025 onward.
