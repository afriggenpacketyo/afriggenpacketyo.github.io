          <p>The CDC projects that the new COVID-19 variant NB.1.8.1, previously linked to a surge in hospitalizations in Asia, could account for more than one in three cases across the United States. The variant was detected in international travelers arriving in the U.S. last month, and now represents nearly half of the COVID infections detected in the CDC's airport surveillance program. Experts note that while NB.1.8.1 appears more transmissible, it does not lead to more severe illness compared to previous variants, and the Trump administration has recently made moves to change access to vaccines for some Americans.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from implementing parts of an executive order imposing new proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration. Judge Casper granted a preliminary injunction sought by 19 state attorneys general, finding that the states were likely to succeed in their case. The decision prevents the administration from requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and from directing the Secretary of Defense to update absentee voting applications for military members and overseas voters. The judge emphasized that Congress, not the president, has the authority to set election requirements.</p>

          <p>Many countries face shortages of blood donors, leading to research into artificial, lab-made blood. Scientists are exploring methods such as genetically modifying red blood cells, neutralizing blood types with gut bacteria enzymes, and creating microscopic artificial blood cells. Researchers in Japan are testing artificial hemoglobin from unused blood bank reserves in humans, with promising initial results. While these approaches show promise, it will take years before safe artificial blood can be produced at scale, making human blood donations essential for the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>The FDA has expanded its approval of Moderna's RSV vaccine, mRESVIA, to include adults under 60 at increased risk of the disease. This follows a late-stage clinical trial showing the vaccine boosts immune responses in younger adults, over a third of whom have underlying conditions that increase RSV risk. While the FDA has approved the expansion, the CDC's vaccine advisory committee must vote to recommend the new age group's eligibility. The new committee, recently appointed by Kennedy, will discuss RSV, HPV, and COVID vaccinations in an upcoming meeting.</p>

          <p>Kim Gordon, co-founder of Sonic Youth, has released a new version of her song "Bye Bye" called "Bye Bye 25," incorporating terms the Trump administration has tried to minimize from public life. The song includes words such as "mental health," "electric vehicle," and "Gulf of Mexico," drawn from a list of phrases federal authorities have scrubbed from government websites and materials. Gordon said she wanted to highlight the dark absurdity of controlling policy by controlling language, creating a deadpan and humorous commentary on the current political climate. The song avoids direct sloganeering, presenting a jumble of terms for reflection.</p>

          <p>Consumer sentiment rebounded significantly in early June, exceeding expectations as concerns about tariffs and inflation softened, according to a University of Michigan survey. The headline index of consumer sentiment rose to 60.5, a 15.9% increase from the previous month, with improvements in both current conditions and future expectations. This shift coincided with a less aggressive stance on tariffs from President Trump, leading to a reduced outlook for near-term inflation. Despite these improvements, sentiment indexes remain below year-ago levels, reflecting ongoing worries about the economic impact of trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
