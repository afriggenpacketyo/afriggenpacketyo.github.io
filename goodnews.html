          <p>WWE Hall of Famer Sgt. Slaughter publicly expressed support for actress Sydney Sweeney amidst a social media backlash concerning her American Eagle advertisement. The campaign, titled "Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans," sparked controversy, with some critics alleging it promoted thinness and even drew comparisons to "Nazi propaganda." However, Sweeney's defenders, including a Fox News Digital columnist, argued that the criticism stemmed from her appearance and a broader anti-woke sentiment, rather than the ad's content itself. Despite the online furor, American Eagle's share price saw an initial rise, suggesting the controversy did not negatively impact the brand's market standing.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation, including former President Trump's "big beautiful bill," has significantly enhanced the use of Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts for individuals with disabilities. These tax-advantaged accounts allow people with disabilities to save and invest money without jeopardizing eligibility for crucial government benefits like Medicaid. Starting January 1, 2026, the ABLE Age Adjustment Act will raise the eligibility age from 26 to 46, potentially qualifying millions more individuals. Additionally, the new law makes permanent tax advantages, such as allowing rollovers from 529 college savings plans into ABLE accounts, providing greater financial flexibility for disabled individuals and their families.

Experts suggest that this enhanced commitment could alleviate Japan's concerns about supporting Taiwan's defense in a potential conflict. However, Japan's eventual decisions on military involvement will likely hinge on perceived U.S. commitment to Taiwan and broader regional power dynamics, a move expected to draw negative reactions from Beijing.</p>
