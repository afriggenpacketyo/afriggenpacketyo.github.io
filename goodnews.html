        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Taxpayers struggling with overdue IRS debt can explore several relief options to reduce, restructure, or pause repayment. Programs like Offers in Compromise, installment agreements, and penalty abatement can help manage tax liabilities. However, these programs don't always mean forgiveness, and interest continues to accrue on outstanding balances. Staying compliant with future tax obligations is crucial to maintain the relief arrangement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP), deeming the actions unlawful. The decision reverses the administration's takeover of USIP, which involved replacing its president and terminating staff. Judge Beryl Howell ordered the reinstatement of the previous leadership, emphasizing that Congress's restrictions on the President's removal power of USIP Board members are constitutional. The ruling underscores the independence of USIP from the executive branch.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's efforts to dismantle the US Institute of Peace. The ruling reverses the takeover by the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which had fired most employees.

The judge ruled all actions against the US Institute of Peace as "null and void," including the removal of its board.</p>

          <h2>House Republicans Propose Eliminating Federal Income Tax on Tips</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-19 14:38:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>House Republicans are considering a proposal to eliminate federal income taxes on tips, which has garnered bipartisan support but also raised concerns. While tipped workers in the bottom 60% of the income distribution could receive an average tax cut of $1,260, some argue the policy could create wage pressure in the service industry. The plan also faces criticism for potentially benefiting middle-income earners more than low-income individuals. Despite these concerns, the "No Tax on Tips" provision appears likely to be included in the final tax bill. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While annuities can offer guaranteed retirement income, understanding the risks to your principal is crucial. Fixed annuities typically protect your initial investment, while variable annuities carry more risk. Surrender charges, early withdrawal penalties, and rider fees can reduce net returns. Investors should carefully review the terms and conditions before investing in an annuity. (not investment advice)</p>
