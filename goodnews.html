          <p>A fourth federal judge has ruled against a Trump administration executive order, this time one targeting the law firm Susman Godfrey. The judge declared the order unconstitutional, marking a consistent series of legal defeats for the president's campaign against major law firms. These orders have been widely criticized by the judiciary as an attack on the legal profession and the right to counsel. The rulings affirm that such punitive actions violate the First and Fifth Amendments and the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage to headline Glastonbury, delivering a musically tight and crowd-pleasing set filled with their greatest hits. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more subdued performance, largely avoiding his past on-stage antics and political commentary. While the show was a polished run-through of their popular songs, some critics noted it felt safe and lacked the band's typical raw energy. The performance marked their only scheduled show of the year, following a long hiatus from touring.</p>

          <p>After a six-week search, Antoine Massey, one of the last two remaining fugitives from a major New Orleans jailbreak, has been recaptured.

Despite a promising start to their chase of 301 runs, the West Indies' batting order crumbled under pressure from the Australian attack. The decisive win gives Australia a strong start in the series, wrapping up the match with two full days to spare.</p>

          <p>The California legislature has passed a measure to more than double the state's annual tax incentives for film and television production, raising the total to $750 million. The move is a significant effort to combat the exodus of productions to other states and countries that offer more generous financial benefits. Supported by Governor Gavin Newsom, the bill aims to revitalize Hollywood's home base and bring back thousands of industry jobs lost in recent years. Industry unions and local advocates have applauded the decision as a crucial step in keeping production and creative talent in California.</p>

Presented in partnership with the ACLU, the runway performance aimed to highlight the dehumanization of immigrants and was met with both praise for its boldness and some criticism. Chavarria stated his intent was to use the luxury platform to elevate truth and personal intent, defining that as true power and fashion.</p>
