          <p>Labour leader Keir Starmer has announced a U-turn on planned cuts to winter fuel payments for pensioners after facing significant political pressure. The cuts, which affected over 10 million pensioners, restricted eligibility to those receiving pension credit and other income-related benefits. Starmer stated that the policy would be changed at the autumn Budget to allow more pensioners to qualify again, although the specifics remain unclear. The move has been met with mixed reactions, with calls for a full reversal and questions about the timing and scope of the changes.</p>

The parliament's legal affairs committee will review the request to waive their immunity, with a final decision to be made by a vote of all 720 members.

          <p>Bitcoin reached a new all-time high before experiencing a slight decline due to rising Treasury yields and broader market pressures on risk assets. The cryptocurrency had been steadily climbing in May, driven by factors such as softer U.S. inflation numbers, de-escalation in the U.S.-China trade war, and Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt. Increased liquidity and regulatory updates have also contributed to bitcoin's gains. Despite the recent volatility, investors remain optimistic about future growth, anticipating further regulatory developments and corporate treasury investments. (not investment advice)</p>

The ship, built in 1881, was found in nine feet of water off Manitowoc and had been buried in the sand before recent storms exposed it. The discovery is exciting because it allows a piece of lost history to resurface, with historians racing to document shipwrecks before invasive mussels destroy them. The J.C. Ames was scuttled in 1923 and was one of the largest and most powerful tugs on the Great Lakes.</p>
