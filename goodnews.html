          <p>Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere's Labour Party has won the parliamentary election, securing him a second term in office. With approximately 28% of the vote, Labour will form a majority government with the support of four other left-leaning parties, narrowly defeating the right-wing coalition. The election campaign focused on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living and the quality of public services, alongside concerns over international instability. The victory is seen as a notable win for social democracy amid a broader right-wing trend in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Murdoch family's succession dispute has concluded with a $3.3 billion settlement that confirms Lachlan Murdoch's control over Fox Corp. and News Corp. The agreement resolves a legal battle initiated after Rupert Murdoch attempted to amend his trust to favor Lachlan. As part of the resolution, siblings Prudence, Elisabeth, and James Murdoch will relinquish their shares and roles in the companies, ensuring the conservative direction of media assets like Fox News and The Wall Street Journal. This settlement effectively ends the long-running family drama over the future of the influential media conglomerate.</p>

          <p>England's cricket captain, Ben Stokes, has returned to training with his county team, Durham, after recovering from a shoulder injury that sidelined him during the last Test against India. His head coach, Ryan Campbell, expressed confidence that Stokes will be prepared for the upcoming Ashes series in Australia this winter. The all-rounder has started batting again, with his bowling recovery expected to take more time. The return of Stokes, along with fast bowler Mark Wood who is also nearing a comeback, is considered crucial for England's chances in the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>China has made remarkable progress in reducing air and water pollution while continuing its industrial expansion, a success attributed to a technology-driven decarbonization strategy. Since 2006, the country has implemented real-time monitoring and made massive investments in green infrastructure. Research indicates a 35.6% drop in average annual PM2.5 levels nationwide between 2015 and 2022, an improvement comparable to what the United States achieved over three decades. This approach demonstrates a model of industrial growth paired with environmental protection, rather than deindustrialization, to achieve cleaner air and water.</p>

          <p>Actor Charlie Sheen is opening up about his past, stating he felt "held hostage" by people who had incriminating information about his private life. In promoting his new memoir, "The Book of Sheen," he discussed how his addiction led to various personal issues, including being extorted to keep certain sexual encounters private. Sheen, who has been sober for eight years, also spoke about revealing his HIV-positive diagnosis in 2015 as a "tremendous relief." He aims to own his stories and be vulnerable about his past to free himself from the feeling of being controlled by it.</p>

          <p>Staff at Angel Island State Park recently captured rare footage of a coyote swimming across the Raccoon Strait, a deep waterway in the San Francisco Bay. The animal was seen paddling about a quarter-mile from shore before safely reaching the island. A small, related population of coyotes has established itself on the island since 2017, likely after the first breeding pair swam the mile-long distance from the mainland. The sighting provides a fascinating glimpse into the adaptability and resilience of wildlife as coyotes continue to expand their presence throughout the Bay Area.</p>

          <p>A Los Angeles Superior Court judge has upheld the city's decision to designate Marilyn Monroe's former Brentwood home as a historic cultural monument, effectively saving it from demolition for a second time. The homeowners, who purchased the property in 2023 with plans to tear it down and expand their adjacent estate, had challenged the landmark status in court. The ruling is a victory for historians and fans who argued the house, the only one Monroe ever owned and where she died in 1962, is an irreplaceable piece of Hollywood history, despite numerous renovations over the years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the Federal Reserve being widely expected to cut interest rates again in September, opening a high-yield savings account may still be a worthwhile financial decision for many. While returns are no longer at their recent peaks, rates on these accounts remain significantly higher—nearly 1,000% more—than those offered by traditional savings accounts. Since the initial rate cuts are expected to be gradual, savers can still benefit from the higher interest in the short term. Furthermore, these accounts provide liquidity and access to funds, which is valuable in an unpredictable economy. (not investment advice)</p>

The vessel, which has a lift capacity of up to 7,500 tons and is used for offshore oil operations, is temporarily visiting Pensacola to wait out heavy weather in the Gulf of Mexico. Previously known as the VB-10,000, it played a key role in the largest wreck removal in U.S. history, salvaging the Golden Ray car carrier.

          <p>The FDA has approved this year's updated COVID-19 vaccines for a more targeted population, primarily adults aged 65 and older and younger individuals with specific medical conditions that increase their risk of severe illness. While officials state anyone can get a vaccine after consulting a doctor, the narrower official approval may limit access for some. Eligible conditions include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, and obesity, among others. The change in strategy means vaccine availability at pharmacies may be more restricted, and some may require a prescription depending on state regulations.</p>
