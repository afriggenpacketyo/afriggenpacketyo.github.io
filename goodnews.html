          <p>Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, was released from immigration detention in Louisiana after a federal judge ordered his release on bail. Khalil, detained for over three months, criticized the Trump administration for targeting him due to his pro-Palestinian activism. He expressed eagerness to reunite with his wife and son, whom he had only seen under strict government supervision. The White House maintains that Khalil engaged in "fraud and misrepresentation," vowing to appeal the decision. Khalil, a permanent resident, had been detained under rarely used powers of the secretary of state, alleging his presence posed a risk to foreign policy.</p>
