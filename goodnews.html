          <p>Chelsea's manager, Enzo Maresca, has publicly stated the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong this summer, despite interest from other clubs. Maresca emphasized his belief that Acheampong has the potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and that the best plan for his development is to remain with the team. The manager's comments dismiss speculation about the young player's potential frustration or departure. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, signed a new five-year contract last year and is seen as part of the club's long-term future.</p>

The pandas‚Äî24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring‚Äîwere sent to the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. Their departure leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return next February.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a link between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research assessed diets rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Among a cohort of nearly 12,500 employees, those who adhered to a typical Japanese diet were found to be less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. Researchers suggest that nutrients like folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, prevalent in the diet, may play a role by assisting neurotransmitter release and providing anti-inflammatory effects.</p>

Massey, 33, was taken into custody peacefully at a residence in the city and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The May 16 jailbreak, which went unnoticed for hours, was described by the governor as the worst in recent state history. Only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his capture. At least 16 people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>

          <p>Sisters Kat Sadler and Lizzie Davidson, the writer and star of the BAFTA-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," discuss the dark humor and real-life inspirations behind their show. The series follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate financial and romantic struggles with a cynical and manipulative approach. Sadler explains that the show, which tackles taboo subjects like mental health and abortion, is influenced by their all-female upbringing and observations of the "bleak" modern dating scene. The success of the first series has allowed them to push the characters into even more depressing, yet humorous, situations for the second season.</p>

          <p>With the growing threat of antibiotic resistance, scientists are revisiting a century-old idea: using bacteriophages, or phages, to treat infections. Phages are viruses that specifically target and kill bacteria, offering a potential solution for incurable superbugs. A BBC correspondent participated in a project, successfully collecting a phage from his toilet that killed bacteria from a patient's persistent infection in a lab setting. While research is ongoing, phage therapy is becoming available on compassionate grounds in the UK, and regulators are creating pathways to support its development as a future medical tool.</p>

She then presented the paintings to each student as a gift, an act that was met with astonishment and appreciation.

The executive orders have sought to punish firms for representing clients or causes opposed by the president.
