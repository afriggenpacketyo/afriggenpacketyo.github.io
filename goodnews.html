          <p>Clark Hunt, the owner of the Kansas City Chiefs, has publicly credited Taylor Swift's relationship with tight end Travis Kelce for a significant transformation in the team's fanbase. Hunt noted that the team has seen an unprecedented increase in female fans, with the ratio shifting from an even split to 57% female, which he believes is likely the highest in the NFL. He described the phenomenon as a "whirlwind" and expressed his happiness for the couple, highlighting the positive impact on the organization and the "Chiefs Kingdom." This "Taylor Swift effect" has been widely recognized for boosting viewership and engagement since 2023.</p>

          <p>Devon and Cornwall Police have successfully seized £180,000 from controversial influencer Andrew Tate, which was a deposit for an Aston Martin Valhalla supercar. A court order confirmed the funds were proceeds from tax evasion and money laundering, originating from a cryptocurrency account tied to the Tate brothers' business activities. This seizure is in addition to £2.7 million previously forfeited by the brothers in December 2024 for failing to pay taxes on £21 million in revenue. Authorities stated the confiscated money will be reinvested into the community to help prevent crime and support victims.</p>

          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is providing essential supplies to students transitioning from the foster care system into college, addressing a critical gap in support. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware that dorm rooms are typically unfurnished beyond basic items. The initiative, started by a Los Angeles county social worker, gives students bedding, towels, school supplies, and even toolboxes, ensuring they have what they need to feel comfortable and equal to their peers. This support helps level the playing field, as statistics show only a small percentage of foster youth attain a bachelor's degree.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales, along with their three children, are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home located in Windsor Great Park. This move places them in a larger residence than their current home, Adelaide Cottage, though it remains close to the children's school. The relocation follows recent minor alteration approvals for the property, which had previously undergone a £1.5 million restoration. The move comes as Buckingham Palace implements cost-saving measures, though Prince William benefits from the profitable Duchy of Cornwall estate to cover personal expenses for his family.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that U.S. President Donald Trump's diplomatic actions have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. This statement came after Trump's summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which did not produce a formal ceasefire but opened the door to further talks. Starmer commended Trump's leadership and welcomed the U.S. willingness to provide robust security guarantees to Ukraine as part of any potential peace deal. He reiterated that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and that UK support for Ukraine remains unwavering.</p>

          <p>Samsung is closing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly driven by the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, such as the Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer a new form factor compared to the traditional smartphone design. Samsung's strategy of offering a wider range of devices at various price points is also contributing to its success. Analysts suggest Apple may soon respond with its own slimmer and potentially foldable iPhone models to compete.</p>

          <p>Fugitive crime boss Jamie Rothwell was brought to justice after inadvertently revealing his location to police through the supposedly secure EncroChat messaging service. While running a multi-million-pound drugs and guns operation from his apartment in Barcelona, Rothwell shared a selfie and a picture of his apartment's view, allowing detectives to identify and locate him. The hack of the EncroChat network in 2020 provided law enforcement with unprecedented access to criminal communications, exposing Rothwell's role in trafficking AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting. He was ultimately extradited and sentenced to 43 years in prison.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy suggests three powerful steps for building emotional endurance, which is the ability to withstand stress without being overwhelmed by negative emotions. The first step is to visualize learning as a winding path, not a straight line, to better tolerate the frustration inherent in growth. Second, she advises engaging in positive self-talk to reframe difficult moments as part of the process. Finally, Kennedy recommends taking on small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, which gradually teaches your body and mind that you can handle discomfort.</p>

Trump stated on social media that the goal is a direct "Peace Agreement" to end the war, not just a temporary ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call between Trump, Zelenskyy, and several European leaders, who reportedly welcomed the U.S. commitment to providing security guarantees for Ukraine. This direct engagement marks a significant development, with Trump suggesting a successful outcome could lead to a subsequent meeting involving Putin.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the question was first asked in 1939. The data also shows that those who do drink are consuming less, with growing concern about the health impacts of alcohol. This trend is supported by sales data and is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where drinking rates have fallen sharply since the 1990s. While reduced alcohol consumption has significant public health benefits, some suggest it may be linked to a broader decline in social interaction.</p>

The firm criticized Avantor's past leadership for "self-inflicted mistakes," such as costly acquisitions and turning down a potential buyout offer at a significant premium.

          <p>The Democratic Party is reportedly recruiting several older, well-known figures for critical Senate races in 2026, highlighting a tension between the need for new leadership and the desire for electability. In Ohio, 72-year-old former Senator Sherrod Brown is planning a comeback bid, while in North Carolina, 68-year-old former Governor Roy Cooper is being heavily recruited. This strategy of relying on familiar, established candidates in pivotal states is seen by some as a pragmatic choice to win tough races, but others view it as an indictment of the party's failure to build a strong bench of younger talent in those regions.</p>

This find is particularly significant as it was located near where a similar object was discovered in 2021, leading experts to believe the pair may have been deliberately buried for a religious or ceremonial purpose.

This technology makes the drones immune to Russian electronic warfare and jamming tactics, a critical advantage on the modern battlefield. The extended range is designed to strike high-value targets that have moved farther from the front lines. While longer cables present technical challenges, such as added weight and potential snags, the development represents a significant potential leap in Ukraine's drone warfare capabilities.</p>
