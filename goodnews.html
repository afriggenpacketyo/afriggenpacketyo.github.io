          <p>Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in a law school graduation speech, strongly criticized President Trump, accusing him of creating a national emergency by repeatedly violating the rule of law. Walz called on graduates to stand up to abuses of power, asserting that lawyers are the "first and last line of defense." He cited Trump's immigration policies and questions about due process as examples of the crumbling of the rule of law. Walz acknowledged the pointed nature of his remarks for a celebratory ceremony, stating that he would not be honoring his oath if he did not address the issue head on.</p>

          <p>Federal courts are resisting the Trump administration's deportation policies, insisting on due process for immigrants. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation. Legal scholars have praised the courts' support of due process but expressed concern that such support was necessary in the first place. The administration has openly flouted the idea of providing due process, even considering suspending the writ of habeas corpus. The article also mentions cases concerning the Alien Enemies Act and a federal appeals court decision requiring a 15-day warning period before deportations.</p>

          <p>Romania's presidential runoff election pits hard-right "sovereignist" George Simion against pro-EU liberal Nicusor Dan, raising concerns in the EU. A Simion victory could trigger a crisis due to his pro-Russian stance and potential shift away from EU and NATO alignment. The election is seen as a historic decision with radical differences between candidates and deep societal divisions. While Simion has moderated his rhetoric, his anti-Ukrainian stance remains, and he lacks experience in governance. Dan represents a pro-European, rule-of-law approach, but faces challenges due to his association with the establishment.</p>
