          <h2>Thailand and Cambodia Agree to Ceasefire Amid Cautious Optimism and Lingering Doubts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:13:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia took effect this week after five days of deadly border clashes, brokered with the help of Malaysia and under pressure from the United States. While leaders expressed optimism, the truce was immediately tested by reports of violations, which Cambodia denied. Analysts suggest the conflict served political purposes for ruling families in both nations and that the ceasefire may hold, though concerns remain about the lack of a third-party monitoring mechanism. The agreement was notably spurred by U.S. threats to delay trade talks and impose tariffs, adding an economic incentive for both countries to de-escalate the military confrontation.</p>

          <p>PayPal has reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, prompting the company to raise its full-year guidance for transaction margin and earnings per share. The company saw a 7% rise in transaction margin dollars and a 12% increase in total payment volume for its Venmo service, its highest growth rate in three years. These results reflect CEO Alex Chriss's strategy to focus on more profitable revenue streams and better monetize key assets like Venmo. Despite the positive report and optimistic forecast, which implies a stronger fourth quarter, the company's stock experienced a slight dip in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>EE to Introduce Mobile Plans with Built-in Internet Restrictions for Teenagers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 07:11:08 EDT</div>

          <p>UK mobile network EE is set to launch new SIM-only phone plans in August designed specifically for teenagers, featuring tiered levels of internet content filtering based on age. The plans aim to protect young users from harmful online content and scams by restricting access at the network level. However, these protections will only apply when using mobile data, not when connected to a Wi-Fi network, which the company cannot control. Despite this limitation, EE, along with children's safety charity Internet Matters, believes the initiative is a positive step toward helping parents manage their children's smartphone usage in an increasingly complex digital world.</p>

          <p>As UCLA football begins its training camp, several critical questions loom, including how quickly new quarterback Nico Iamaleava can master the pro-style offense after his transfer from Tennessee. Coach DeShaun Foster has boldly guaranteed that fan attendance at the Rose Bowl will significantly increase this season, banking on the team's performance. Key challenges include rebuilding an offensive line that struggled last season and replacing standout defensive players lost to the NFL draft. The team is holding its camp away from campus for the first time since 2016, a move intended to foster unity among a roster with many new faces.</p>

          <p>Former U.S. soccer star Landon Donovan believes the upcoming 2026 World Cup, co-hosted by the United States, presents a massive opportunity to inspire a new generation of players and grow the sport's culture. Drawing from his own experience of being captivated by the 1994 World Cup as a child, Donovan stresses the importance of the current national team prioritizing this moment. He recently clarified his criticism of players like Christian Pulisic for skipping the Gold Cup, stating his concern was about the timing of their break at the expense of the national team's development. Donovan asserts that the tournament's return to the U.S. can close development gaps and solidify soccer's place in the nation.</p>

          <p>A fierce competition for a small pool of top-tier AI experts is leading to massive pay packages and a potential cultural shift in Silicon Valley. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft, and Google are reportedly offering huge compensation to lure key AI engineers away from startups, sometimes poaching individuals rather than acquiring entire companies. This trend has put startups like OpenAI on the defensive, forcing them to increase pay to retain talent. While these companies invest billions in acquiring the best minds to develop next-generation AI, some in the industry worry this cherry-picking approach undermines the collaborative and equity-driven culture that has long defined startups.</p>

          <p>The U.S. dollar is poised for its best week of the year, strengthening significantly against the euro after the European Union agreed to a 15% U.S. tariff hike. This development, coupled with promises of increased EU spending on American energy and arms, suggests that President Trump's tariff strategy may be achieving its goals without provoking major retaliatory measures or economic harm. The dollar's rebound occurs as the Federal Reserve begins its policy meeting, though no interest rate changes are expected this week. Markets are also closely watching corporate earnings reports from major tech companies and ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The de Havilland Aircraft Museum in the UK has completed a meticulous restoration of a de Havilland Comet, the world's first commercial passenger jetliner. The aircraft, which first flew with fare-paying passengers in 1952, ushered in a new era of speed and comfort but was quickly grounded after a series of catastrophic structural failures. The restored fuselage, now displayed in period Air France livery, recreates the luxurious interior of the 1950s, from its separate male and female bathrooms to its spacious seating. This exhibit offers a unique look at a pivotal, yet tragic, chapter in aviation history, showcasing the innovations and fatal flaws of the pioneering aircraft.</p>

Plauché recounted his initial anger over the killing, his eventual forgiveness, and his journey to becoming an advocate for survivors of sexual assault.

          <p>An El Segundo-based startup, Shinkei Systems, is using AI-driven robotics to automate the traditional Japanese fish-handling method known as ikejime, which is said to improve the taste, texture, and shelf life of fish. The company's robot, Poseidon, performs the humane killing process, which prevents the buildup of stress hormones and lactic acid that can degrade fish quality. By automating this labor-intensive technique, Shinkei aims to make higher-quality, longer-lasting fish more accessible in the U.S. market, from fine dining restaurants to local grocery stores. The company recently secured $22 million in funding to expand its operations and place more of its robots on fishing vessels.</p>

The 18-month, tuition-free program is designed to train students specifically to service Rolex timepieces, addressing a workforce crisis that has seen the number of U.S. watch and clock repairers decline by 23% in just three years. This initiative comes amid a renewed consumer interest in mechanical watches and a modest rebirth of the American watchmaking industry.
