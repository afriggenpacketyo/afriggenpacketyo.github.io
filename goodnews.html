          <p>A California-based nonprofit called Dec My Dorm is addressing a hidden challenge for former foster youth by providing them with essential supplies to furnish their college dorm rooms. Many of these students arrive on campus with few personal belongings, often feeling isolated and unprepared when faced with an empty room, a stark contrast to peers who have family support. The program, founded after hearing the story of a student who arrived with only a trash bag, not only provides necessities like bedding and towels but also empowers students by allowing them to choose their own items, fostering a sense of identity and ownership. This initiative aims to level the playing field, ensuring these resilient students begin their higher education journey with dignity and a supportive foundation.</p>

          <p>Therapist Sadie Salazar emphasizes the importance of a consistent morning ritual to ground oneself and reduce anxiety, particularly for those with demanding schedules. Her primary rule is to wake up when her alarm goes off, which creates protected personal time before work and family obligations begin. Instead of a rigid, prescriptive routine, she advocates for using this extra hour for flexible, rejuvenating activities like reading, listening to a podcast, or taking a longer dog walk. This approach avoids the pressure of a strict schedule, allowing for creativity and self-care without the risk of feeling like a failure early in the day, thereby setting a positive and calm tone for what follows.</p>

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are planning to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home located within Windsor Great Park, marking a change of residence for the royal family. This move will place them in close proximity to their children's school and their current home, Adelaide Cottage, which they relocated to in August 2022. The new property, which recently underwent minor approved alterations, is nestled in a large natural park, aligning with the Princess's publicly stated belief in the healing power of nature, a theme she has emphasized during her ongoing cancer treatment. The relocation comes as the Duchy of Cornwall, managed by Prince William, reported a net surplus of £22.9 million for the year.</p>

          <p>Matt McClanahan and Lauren McChesney successfully saved Shankweiler's Drive-In Theatre, the world's oldest operating drive-in, from being sold to developers by taking out a $1 million loan to purchase it. The historic Pennsylvania theater, which first opened in 1934, held a special significance for McClanahan, who grew up attending it. To ensure its viability, the couple has modernized the business model by operating year-round and introducing special community events like craft fairs and holiday-themed nights to supplement revenue from film screenings. After a challenging first year, their innovative approach proved successful, with the theater becoming profitable and bringing in nearly $550,000 in revenue in 2024, preserving a piece of cinematic history for a new generation.</p>

          <p>Bournemouth forward Antoine Semenyo has praised the football community's strong and supportive response after he was subjected to alleged racist abuse from a spectator during a match at Liverpool's Anfield stadium. The incident, which is now the subject of a police investigation, prompted immediate acts of solidarity from his teammates, opposing players, and fans in the stadium. Premier League officials have unequivocally condemned the act, reiterating their policy that anyone found guilty of such abuse will face lifetime stadium bans and potential criminal prosecution. The event has reignited urgent discussions about the persistence of racism in the sport, with prominent figures calling the abuse a "disgrace" and advocating for more effective anti-racism education.</p>

          <p>United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer has publicly stated that President Donald Trump's diplomatic actions have brought the world "closer than ever before" to the possibility of ending the war in Ukraine. This commendation was issued following the Trump-Putin summit in Alaska, which, despite not yielding a concrete peace deal, is being framed by some leaders as a significant step in the peace process. Starmer also emphasized that any viable path to peace must directly involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who is scheduled to meet with Trump in Washington. The statement affirmed the UK's "unwavering support" for Ukraine and the continuation of sanctions and pressure on Russia until its "barbaric assault" ceases.</p>

          <p>Samsung is mounting a significant challenge to Apple's dominance in the U.S. smartphone market, driven by the growing popularity of its innovative foldable phones and a broader portfolio of devices at various price points. According to recent data, Samsung's market share surged from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's share declined, indicating a potential shift in consumer preferences away from the traditional rectangular smartphone design. The success of Samsung's Z Fold and Z Flip models, which offer novel form factors and multitasking capabilities, is creating pressure on Apple to introduce more significant innovations. Analysts now widely expect Apple to respond with its own slimmer and foldable iPhone models in the near future to maintain its competitive edge.</p>

          <p>Fugitive Jamie Rothwell, who directed a multi-million-pound drug and weapons trafficking operation from Spain, was apprehended after an international law enforcement operation successfully hacked the EncroChat encrypted phone network. Rothwell, using the handle "livelong," inadvertently sealed his fate by revealing his identity and location when he sent a selfie and a picture of the panoramic view from his Barcelona apartment. The decrypted messages exposed his central role in trafficking high-powered weapons like AK-47s and orchestrating a gangland shooting that severely injured an innocent man. His capture was a major breakthrough, leading to his extradition, conviction, and a 43-year prison sentence, showcasing the impact of the EncroChat hack on organized crime.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Columbia University-trained psychologist Becky Kennedy has outlined three powerful steps for developing emotional endurance, which she defines as the ability to withstand stress and discomfort without being overtaken by negative emotions. The first step is to visualize the learning process as a winding, messy path rather than a straight line, which helps normalize the frustration inherent in growth. The second step involves practicing positive self-talk to actively reframe difficult moments as productive struggles, not failures. Finally, she recommends undertaking small, manageable experiments that push you out of your comfort zone, as these actions build the body's tolerance for discomfort and foster greater resilience in all areas of life.</p>

          <p>Following his high-stakes meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump has announced that he will host Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday for direct talks. The stated goal of the meeting is to discuss a comprehensive peace agreement designed to permanently end the war, rather than establishing a temporary and often fragile ceasefire. Trump revealed that this plan was formulated after a late-night conference call with Zelenskyy and several European leaders, who reportedly praised his efforts and expressed their readiness to support a broader trilateral summit. This development marks a potentially significant step, as Zelenskyy has consistently insisted on Ukraine's direct inclusion in any substantive peace negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup survey has revealed that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level recorded since the organization began tracking the metric in 1939. This downward trend is accompanied by a decrease in self-reported drinking frequency and a notable rise in public concern about the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority of Americans now believing that even moderate consumption is unhealthy. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals, where drinking rates have fallen dramatically since the 1990s. While this shift is widely viewed as a major public health victory, potentially reducing alcohol-related deaths and illnesses, some analysts suggest it may also be linked to a broader societal trend of declining in-person social interaction.</p>

Authorities were able to match the vehicle's identification number to that of Roy Benn, a local businessman who vanished without a trace in September 1967 while driving his metallic blue Buick. The remains are now believed to be his, and his surviving next of kin have been notified of the discovery. The chance find brings a potential and long-awaited resolution to a case that has baffled investigators for decades.</p>

          <p>For several of its most crucial 2026 Senate races, the Democratic Party is turning to well-known, older candidates, a strategy that highlights a central tension between the need for new leadership and the pragmatic desire for proven winners. In Ohio, 72-year-old former Senator Sherrod Brown is planning a comeback bid, while in North Carolina, 68-year-old former Governor Roy Cooper is being heavily recruited to run. While some younger activists and party members lament the reliance on its gerontocracy, seasoned strategists argue that these established figures with high name recognition offer the best, and perhaps only, chance to win in politically challenging states. This approach is seen as a tactical necessity for the tough 2026 Senate map.</p>

          <p>A Ukrainian weapons manufacturer is developing a new generation of first-person-view (FPV) drones that are connected to their operators by spools of fiber-optic cable, a technology that will extend their operational range to nearly 100 kilometers. This innovative design makes the drones effectively immune to Russian electronic warfare jamming tactics, which have become a dominant and highly effective feature of the modern battlefield. The significantly extended range is considered crucial as high-value military targets have been moved farther from the front lines to avoid conventional drone strikes. While longer cables present technical challenges, the development represents a major potential leap in Ukraine's asymmetric warfare capabilities, enabling precision strikes deep behind enemy lines.</p>
