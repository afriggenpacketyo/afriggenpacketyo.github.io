          <p>A review of Premier League predictions made by BBC Sport pundits before the season reveals that not one of the 30 analysts correctly predicted Liverpool's title triumph. Opta's supercomputer, using a complex algorithm, also incorrectly favored Manchester City for the title. However, five BBC pundits correctly included all four teams that finished in the top four, albeit with only one team in the correct position. This highlights the unpredictability of sports and the challenges in forecasting outcomes, even with advanced analytics.</p>

          <h2>Japan Implements New Rice Sales System to Lower Prices</h2>

          <p>Japan has initiated sales of government rice stockpiles via direct contracts to lower soaring prices, with a target of 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms by early June. The move aims to address public criticism of ineffective price control measures amidst rising inflation. The government plans to release around 300,000 tons of rice through contracts with major retailers, bypassing the auction system. This new system also do not require retailers to comply with previous requirements that suppliers who bought auctioned rice would have to return an equivalent amount to the government.</p>
