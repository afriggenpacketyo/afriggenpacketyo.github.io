        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Analysts anticipate that the issue of fentanyl trafficking will be a significant topic in upcoming trade discussions between the United States and China. The powerful synthetic opioid has become a major public health and national security concern in the U.S., where it is the leading cause of death for adults aged 18 to 45. While not a traditional trade item, its inclusion on the agenda could serve as a key point of leverage in broader bilateral talks. Addressing the crisis could potentially ease tensions and pave the way for further cooperation between the two economic powers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Brazil's Rare Earth Exports to China Triple Amid Shifting Global Trade Dynamics</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:47:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the first half of 2025, Brazil's exports of rare earth compounds to China increased threefold compared to the previous year, according to a new report. This surge coincides with record-high Chinese imports of these strategic minerals, fueling speculation that US-China trade tensions are rerouting global supply chains through other economies. While Brazil's overall exports to China have fallen, the significant growth in this specific sector highlights China's efforts to diversify its access to critical resources. This shift reflects both China's industrial policy and the broader ripple effects of the ongoing trade rift with Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Netflix Exceeds Earnings Expectations with 16% Revenue Growth in Second Quarter</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 17:27:50 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Netflix reported strong financial results for the second quarter of 2025, beating analyst expectations with a 16% year-over-year increase in revenue to $11.08 billion. The company attributed the growth to an increase in members, higher subscription prices, and expanding ad revenue. In response, Netflix raised its full-year revenue forecast, signaling confidence in its business strategy. While the company no longer releases quarterly subscriber numbers, it noted healthy membership growth and expects its ad business to continue expanding. Shares dipped slightly in after-hours trading, likely due to a warning of lower margins in the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant move for the digital currency industry, the U.S. Congress has passed the "Genius Act," the first major legislation to regulate stablecoins. The bill, which passed the House with bipartisan support and now heads to the president, establishes a regulatory framework for these cryptocurrencies, which are pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents argue this will foster innovation and provide consumer protection, allowing banks and other institutions to issue their own stablecoins. The legislation is seen as a victory for the crypto industry and aligns with the Trump administration's goal of supporting the sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the White House's announcement of President Trump's diagnosis, this article explains chronic venous insufficiency (CVI). The condition occurs when veins in the legs are unable to effectively pump blood back to the heart, causing blood to pool and leading to symptoms like swelling, achiness, and varicose veins. While it is a common and often benign condition, particularly in older adults, doctors must first rule out more serious causes like heart disease or blood clots. Treatment for CVI typically involves lifestyle changes such as wearing compression stockings, elevating the legs, and exercising to strengthen leg muscles.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has acquitted former HSBC trader Mark Johnson, overturning his 2017 fraud conviction after a nine-year legal battle. Johnson was accused of "front-running" a large currency trade for a client in 2011, a practice his defense and industry groups argued was standard pre-hedging to manage bank risk. Johnson, who served time in both U.S. and UK prisons, was able to launch a new appeal after a law used in his prosecution was overturned. His lawyer stated that justice has finally been achieved in a case that should never have been brought.</p>

          <p>This essay reflects on the history of air travel, arguing that the "golden age" of flying was more of a myth than a reality and that the experience has always been somewhat difficult. While modern air travel is characterized by cramped seats, extra fees, and security theater, early aviation was dangerous, uncomfortable, and lacked basic amenities. The author posits that the perceived glamour was tied to the novelty and wonder of flight itself, a miracle that has since become mundane. The article concludes that the transformation of a technological marvel into a tedious form of mass transit is a natural cycle for any innovation.</p>
