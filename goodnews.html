        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has significantly reduced the previously threatened 250% tariffs on pharmaceuticals and semiconductors imported from the European Union, settling instead on a 15% rate as part of a newly detailed trade agreement. This reciprocal deal mandates that the EU must first pass legislation to eliminate its tariffs on all U.S. industrial goods, including various agricultural products, before the 27.5% tariffs on European car exports are lowered to 15%. While providing crucial protection for sectors like Irish pharmaceutical exporters, the agreement has disappointed the wine and spirits industries, which remain subject to tariffs, highlighting the nuanced outcomes of the intense negotiations.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has put on hold an earlier order for the mass removal of stray dogs from New Delhi's streets, instead directing civic bodies to capture, sterilize, and immunize the animals before releasing them, unless they are rabid or aggressive. The court also introduced a ban on public feeding of stray dogs, instructing authorities to establish designated feeding zones in municipal wards and warning of legal action against violators. This revised directive follows widespread protests from animal rights activists who deemed the initial removal order "illogical" and "inhuman," which had been issued in response to a significant surge in dog bite incidents and suspected rabies deaths across the country.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 02:39:18 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core inflation rate cooled slightly to 3.1% in July, down from 3.3% the previous month, marking its lowest level since March, primarily driven by an easing in rice prices. Despite this moderation, the figure exceeded economists' expectations and remained above the Bank of Japan's 2% target for the 40th consecutive month. Analysts suggest that while food inflation shows signs of easing, overall inflation is still heading towards moderation, which could support a potential rate hike by the BOJ in September or October. The central bank had previously upgraded its inflation forecasts, indicating persistent underlying price pressures in the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

This significant takeover is seen as a source of inspiration for the global Sikh community, with the new owners emphasizing their intention to bring Sikh principles of discipline, trustfulness, and compassion to the club's operations. Experts and community leaders believe this visible representation will inspire greater participation and leadership from Sikhs and other underrepresented groups in British football, fostering a more inclusive environment within the sport.</p>

          <p>Former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra has been acquitted by a Bangkok court of charges of insulting the monarchy, a verdict that relieves a significant legal threat which could have resulted in up to 15 years in prison. The charges stemmed from a 2015 interview where he commented on the 2014 military coup, but the judges found insufficient evidence for conviction, interpreting the lese majeste law literally. This ruling is considered unusual for such cases and provides some relief to the Shinawatra family's political movement, especially as Thaksin's daughter, the suspended Prime Minister Paetongtarn, faces her own high-stakes constitutional court decision.</p>

          <p>The UK government is initiating a significant crackdown on individuals who continue to claim child benefit after permanently leaving the country, aiming to save an estimated £350 million over the next five years. Under new regulations, claimants will generally become ineligible for the benefit if they are outside the UK for more than eight weeks, except in specific exceptional circumstances. A new specialist team, expanded to over 200 investigators, will utilize travel data to identify and stop incorrect payments, building on a successful pilot that recovered £17 million. This initiative seeks to curb benefit fraud and ensure public funds are allocated appropriately.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has lauded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.

These remarks were made during his visit to Taiwan, primarily to thank TSMC for their crucial work on Nvidia's next-generation AI chip platform, Rubin. Huang's endorsement comes amidst the U.S. administration's exploration of acquiring equity stakes in tech companies, particularly those receiving CHIPS Act funding, with TSMC having been promised $6.6 billion for its U.S. fabrication plants. The article also notes Nvidia's plans for a new Taiwan office and briefly references its halt of H20 chip production for China due to security concerns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India and Russia have committed to significantly expanding their bilateral trade ties, a move that signals defiance against mounting U.S. tariff pressure on New Delhi over its substantial purchases of Russian oil. Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar underscored the historical strength of their relationship, announcing plans to boost India's exports to Russia in pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and textiles to address trade imbalances. The strategic partnership, which saw bilateral trade reach a record $68.7 billion, also includes continued cooperation in the hydrocarbon sector. Geopolitical experts suggest President Trump's tariff threats are primarily a leverage tactic aimed at securing trade deals and influencing the Ukraine conflict, rather than solely curbing Moscow's oil revenues.

Similarly, Honda attributed any price changes to enhanced feature content and improved product competitiveness, highlighting its substantial production within the U.S. This stance contrasts with earlier market speculation, indicating a strategic effort by these companies to absorb tariff-related expenses to maintain consumer affordability and market share.

The judge mandated the removal of temporary fencing, lighting, and waste receptacles within 60 days and prohibited new detainee transfers, though Florida officials have already filed a notice of appeal.

          <p>An international team of scientists has uncovered a novel communication mechanism in corn plants, revealing that they release a gas called linalool to prompt nearby plants to alter their soil composition. Published in the peer-reviewed journal Science, this study offers crucial insights into how planting density influences plant growth and defense strategies against herbivores. Researchers conducted surveys in Chinese maize fields, observing that densely planted corn suffered less herbivore damage but exhibited reduced growth. This discovery holds significant implications for agricultural science, suggesting that optimizing the release of such volatile organic compounds could be leveraged to combat pests and substantially increase crop yields globally.</p>
