          <p>Northampton Saints climbed to the top of the Prem table after a decisive 36-19 bonus-point victory against Newcastle Red Bulls at Kingston Park. The Saints scored five tries, despite playing half an hour with a man down due to JJ van der Mescht's two sin-bins. Newcastle, still searching for their first league win since last November, managed to close the gap twice but ultimately couldn't capitalize on their numerical advantage. This result places Northampton ahead of reigning champions Bath, showcasing their strong performance early in the season.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has approved Boeing's request to increase its 737 Max jetliner production to 42 aircraft per month, a significant milestone nearly two years after a near-catastrophic midair incident. In January 2024, the FAA capped production at 38 planes monthly following a door plug detachment on an Alaska Airlines flight, attributed to missing bolts. This approval signals increased regulator confidence in Boeing's production quality, which is crucial for the company's financial turnaround after years of issues including two fatal crashes, groundings, and supply chain problems. CEO Kelly Ortberg anticipates further production increases to meet demand.</p>

          <p>President Trump is actively pursuing several White House construction projects, including a $250 million privately financed ballroom and a proposed arch near the Lincoln Memorial, aiming to solidify his architectural legacy. The ballroom, funded by private donors who attended a recent White House dinner, is reportedly fully financed, with excess funds potentially allocated to the arch. Democrats, however, are pushing for legislative guardrails, with California Rep. Mark Takano introducing bills to ban donor names on White House structures and prohibit federally funded construction during government shutdowns. The article highlights the political tensions surrounding these projects and the president's focus on tangible achievements.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Seven fully preserved skeletons discovered in a water well in the ancient Roman city of Mursa, Croatia, have been identified as Roman soldiers killed 1,700 years ago. Researchers determined the men, aged 18-50, were robust but showed signs of early-life stress, and were likely thrown into the well shortly after death. Injuries on some skeletons, including blunt-force trauma and puncture wounds, suggest they may have died during a 260 C.E. battle or skirmish. DNA analysis indicates none were local to the area, with origins possibly in Northern Europe or the Byzantine Empire, offering insights into Roman military history.</p>
