          <p>The Oval Invincibles secured a decisive seven-wicket victory against the Southern Brave, strengthening their position at the top of the men's Hundred tournament standings. The team's bowlers were instrumental, dismissing the Brave for 133, with standout performances from Jason Behrendorff and Rashid Khan. In the chase, a powerful partnership between Jordan Cox and Sam Curran, who both scored half-centuries, guided the Invincibles to their target with 11 balls remaining. This win places the defending champions four points clear, making them strong contenders for the final stages of the competition.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has agreed to provide the House Oversight Committee with documents from its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking case. The turnover of records is scheduled to begin on Friday, averting a potential clash over a congressional subpoena issued earlier in the month. Committee Chairman James Comer stated that while it will take time to produce all records, he appreciated the Trump administration's commitment to transparency on the matter. The investigation involves the late financier Epstein and his convicted accomplice Ghislaine Maxwell, and has been the subject of intense public and political scrutiny.</p>

The deal follows recent agreements with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, which have significantly boosted TeraWulf's contracted revenue and future growth prospects.

          <h2>Retail Inventory Method Accounting May Obscure True Impact of Tariffs on Profitability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by nearly a quarter of U.S. retailers including Walmart and Target, could be distorting their profitability in the short term as new tariffs take effect. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio rather than tracking the actual cost of each item, it is less responsive to sudden cost increases from tariffs, which can initially make profitability appear stronger than it is. This accounting lag means the full financial impact of the tariffs may not be immediately visible in upcoming quarterly earnings reports from these major companies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering twist on Shakespeare's classic tragedy, imagining a new life for Juliet after she decides not to die. The production, praised as a euphoric dance party, is powered by the chart-topping pop hits of Swedish producer Max Martin, including songs made famous by Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The show's clever book by David West Read successfully integrates the well-known songs into a fresh narrative about female empowerment and second chances. Reviewers have lauded the show for its high energy, witty script, and powerful vocal performances, particularly from the lead actress playing Juliet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age for purchasing an annuity, most insurance companies impose their own limits, typically between 80 and 85 years old. The timing of an annuity purchase is a critical factor, as it significantly affects the cost and the amount of income received. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. However, purchasing later in life can result in higher monthly payouts due to shorter life expectancy, presenting a strategic choice for retirees planning their income streams.

          <p>The conservative media outlet Newsmax has agreed to pay $67 million to settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Dominion Voting Systems. The lawsuit centered on the network's airing of false claims that Dominion's voting machines were used to rig the 2020 presidential election against Donald Trump. While agreeing to the settlement, Newsmax did not apologize and maintained that its coverage was fair and balanced. This outcome follows a similar, much larger settlement in which Fox News paid Dominion $787.5 million over its broadcasting of the same baseless election fraud allegations.</p>

          <p>An analysis of international support for Ukraine shows that the United States has been the largest single-country donor since Russia's 2022 invasion, committing approximately $130.6 billion. However, when combined, European nations and EU institutions have contributed more, with a total of $165.7 billion. This data, compiled by the Kiel Institute, contradicts claims by Donald Trump that U.S. spending has vastly outstripped that of Europe. The aid from both the U.S. and Europe has been a mix of grants and loans, though the U.S. has provided a higher proportion of its aid as direct grants.</p>
