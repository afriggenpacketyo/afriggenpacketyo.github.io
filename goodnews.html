          <h2>Denmark Lowers 2025 Economic Growth Projection Due to Novo Nordisk Performance and US Tariffs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-29 03:18:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark has substantially revised its 2025 economic growth forecast downwards to 1.4% from an earlier 3%, primarily due to a slowdown in the pharmaceutical sector, notably affecting Novo Nordisk. The Danish economy ministry pointed to a significant decrease in U.S. exports in early 2025, influenced by increased competition in the weight loss drug market and a prior inventory build-up. Furthermore, the impact of potential U.S. tariffs on European pharmaceuticals also played a role in this adjustment. Despite these challenges, the ministry maintains that the overall economy remains robust, supported by strong employment figures and an inflation rate expected to stay below 2%. The growth forecast for 2026 was, however, revised upwards. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>YouTube and Fox have reached a new distribution agreement, guaranteeing the continued availability of Fox News, Fox Sports, and other Fox channels on YouTube TV. This resolution comes after a period of tense negotiations and a temporary extension, which had averted a potential content blackout for subscribers. YouTube, an Alphabet subsidiary, had publicly stated that Fox was requesting substantially higher fees than its comparable content partners. The deal is crucial for YouTube TV users, especially with anticipated major sporting events like college football and the NFL season approaching. Federal Communications Commission Chair Brendan Carr praised the agreement, emphasizing its benefit to fans.</p>

          <p>A delegation of senior U.S. Senators, led by Republican Roger Wicker, has arrived in Taiwan to underscore the enduring partnership and security agreement between the two nations. This visit occurs as both Taiwan and China are actively seeking trade deals with the U.S., and amid heightened tensions with Beijing. Senator Wicker affirmed that the upcoming National Defense Authorization Act would include further provisions for Taiwan, signaling continued U.S. support. The trip also comes days before China's major military parade, which Russian and North Korean leaders are expected to attend, adding to the geopolitical complexity. Concerns exist in Taipei regarding potential shifts in U.S. defense commitment under a future Trump administration.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipating a mixed opening as investors focus on upcoming inflation data from major European economies, including France, Spain, Italy, and Germany, ahead of the euro area's flash August reading. Stateside, the personal consumption expenditures price index, a crucial metric for the Federal Reserve, is keenly awaited. This follows Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent speech, which bolstered expectations for a September interest rate cut, with an 85% probability currently placed on such a move. The week has seen European markets swayed by French political developments, questions surrounding Fed independence, and Nvidia's earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have unveiled and successfully tested a vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) drone that strikingly resembles the "Gimbal" UFO, an unidentified flying object sighted by a U.S. Navy F/A-18 pilot in 2015. This experimental aircraft features a radical aerodynamic design centered around an elliptical, ring-like wing with an integrated straight central section, forming a closed-loop structure. Four rotors are strategically mounted at the junctions of the wings and vertical stabilizers, providing both lift and structural reinforcement. This development represents a significant advancement in uncrewed flight, potentially enhancing endurance, stability, and multi-mission versatility for future drone technology.</p>

          <p>DJ Admin, Rick Jansen, is the driving force behind the festive atmosphere in Max Verstappen's dedicated "Orange Army" grandstands at the Dutch Grand Prix. Jansen, who views Verstappen as an icon, has been instrumental in cultivating the vibrant fan culture that follows the four-time world champion. Despite the enthusiasm, this year's event is part of Zandvoort's final hurrah on the F1 calendar after 2026, raising questions about future fan experiences. Jansen's role has expanded significantly since Liberty Media's takeover of F1, transforming race weekends into more festival-like events, though rising ticket prices are now impacting attendance at some Verstappen stands.</p>

          <p>Starting January next year, all young children in England and Wales will receive a free chickenpox vaccine through the NHS, administered in two doses at 12 and 18 months, combined with the existing MMR jab. This initiative aims to protect youngsters from severe, albeit rare, complications of chickenpox and reduce the estimated £24 million in lost income and productivity annually. A catch-up campaign is also planned for slightly older children. The announcement comes as recent data shows none of the main childhood vaccines in England met the 95% uptake target, making this new offering a crucial step in improving public health.</p>

Rooney, who ultimately signed with United at 18, revealed that manager Sir Alex Ferguson initially wanted to wait another year but expedited the transfer to prevent him from joining Newcastle. He also recounted a near-move to Chelsea, which was thwarted by a condition to be loaned to Middlesbrough. Rooney's journey to Manchester United involved emotional negotiations with Everton's chairman and even wearing his wife's cousin's jumper for his signing, highlighting the whirlwind nature of his early career.</p>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the 25th Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit signals a potential easing of strained relations between the two Asian giants. This marks Modi's first visit in seven years, following the deadly Galwan Valley clashes in 2020. Despite deep-seated suspicions and India's widening trade deficit with China, economic challenges like U.S. tariffs are pushing both nations toward reluctant cooperation. While experts remain skeptical about a lasting friendship, the visit offers an opportunity for bilateral talks. India aims to diversify supply chains away from China, but its reliance on Chinese raw materials and components, particularly for EVs, highlights the complex interdependence.</p>

          <p>Russia's state space agency, Roscosmos, plans its first test launch of the Soyuz-5 rocket in December, aiming for full operational status by 2028. This medium-class vehicle, a reincarnation of Ukraine's Zenit-2, will feature powerful RD-171MV engines. The launch represents a significant effort for Roscosmos, which has faced substantial funding shortages and the severance of ties with the European Space Agency since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The agency has shifted launch operations to Kazakhstan's Baikonur Cosmodrome and is selling non-core assets to shore up its activities. This endeavor highlights Russia's determination to maintain its space capabilities despite geopolitical and financial hurdles.</p>
