          <p>Charles B. Rangel, a prominent figure in New York politics and the first Black chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has died at the age of 94. Rangel served in Congress for 46 years, representing Harlem and becoming a mainstay of the Democratic old guard. His career was marked by both significant achievements, such as his role in Hillary Clinton's entry into electoral politics, and controversies, including a censure for ethics violations that led to his relinquishing the Ways and Means chairmanship. Despite the ethics allegations, Rangel remained a popular figure in his district, known for his political agility and commitment to his constituents. </p>

          <p>Democrats are reportedly moving away from using progressive jargon to win back voters who defected to the right and elected Donald Trump. Prominent party figures have expressed concerns that phrases like ‚ÄúLatinx‚Äù have alienated ordinary voters and contributed to election losses. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear noted that Democrats have begun speaking like professors and using advocacy-speak that distances them from everyday people. The shift is seen as an effort to appear more authentic and relatable to a broader range of voters. </p>

          <p>Peter Magyar, Hungary's opposition leader, walked from Budapest to northwestern Romania to gain support from ethnic Hungarians, a key voter group in Hungarian elections. He accuses Prime Minister Viktor Orban of corruption and denounces the poor state of public infrastructure, appealing to those tired of Orban's long rule. Magyar's efforts are amplified by Orban's backing of a pro-Russian candidate in Romania's presidential election, which alienated the Hungarian minority. Magyar aims to portray Orban as prioritizing political interests over the welfare of Hungarian communities abroad. </p>
