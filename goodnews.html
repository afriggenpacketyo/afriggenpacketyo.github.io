          <p>Oracle's stock experienced an 8% increase after the company announced fiscal fourth-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street's expectations. Revenue grew by 11% year-over-year, with net income rising to $3.43 billion. Oracle anticipates adjusted earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.50 for the fiscal first quarter and projects revenue growth between 12% and 14%. The company also forecasts cloud infrastructure revenue to increase by over 70% in fiscal year 2026, driven by partnerships with Cleveland Clinic, G42, and IBM, and the adoption of Oracle's cloud services by Temu.

          <p>Council tax in the UK is projected to increase by 5% annually to finance local services, including policing, as indicated by documents in the Spending Review. Local authorities have the autonomy to raise the tax by up to 5% each year without requiring central government approval, and the Spending Review assumes councils will implement the maximum increase. This tax increase is factored into the government's calculations, which project an average rise in "police spending power" of 2.3% per year in real terms. Chancellor Rachel Reeves clarified that councils are not obligated to raise council tax by the full 5%.</p>

          <p>High-level discussions between the United States and Iran regarding Iran's nuclear program are scheduled to resume in Oman on Sunday, marking the sixth round of talks since April. These talks aim to establish a new accord to replace the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which the U.S. withdrew during Trump's first term. Despite heightened tensions in the region, the U.S. delegation still intends to participate, with Iran expressing optimism that a mutually beneficial agreement ensuring the peaceful nature of its nuclear program is achievable under IAEA supervision.

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker is expected to defend his state's sanctuary policies before GOP lawmakers at a hearing, arguing that his administration stepped in to address the border crisis due to a lack of federal support. Pritzker will criticize border state governors for treating immigrants as political pawns and highlight Illinois' efforts to support new arrivals with processing, shelter, and housing. He will also emphasize that Illinois remains committed to public safety and cooperates with federal immigration officers executing criminal warrants, while prioritizing the state's best interests when allocating resources. Pritzker is expected to invoke his family's history as refugees to advocate for immigration reform. </p>

          <p>Senate Republicans are expressing resistance to the House GOP's plan to significantly reduce green energy tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Concerns are being raised that eliminating these incentives would harm American companies, jeopardize investments in domestic energy production, and result in job losses. A group of GOP senators is advocating for a more measured approach, suggesting an appropriate off-ramp to avoid disrupting businesses that have already made plans based on the IRA. The debate highlights the tension between reducing government spending and supporting the growing clean energy sector. </p>
