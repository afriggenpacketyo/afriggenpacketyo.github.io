          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-26 15:47:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi concluded a visit to the Maldives aimed at reinforcing diplomatic and economic relations as the island nation has recently tilted towards China. Maldivian President Mohamed Muizzu, who previously ran on an anti-India platform, has softened his rhetoric, calling India a "most trusted partner." During the visit, Modi announced a $565 million credit line, reduced debt repayments for the Maldives, and inaugurated several India-funded infrastructure projects. The engagement is seen as a strategic move to counter China's influence in the geopolitically important Indian Ocean region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Director Gurinder Chadha has confirmed that a sequel to the beloved 2002 film "Bend It Like Beckham" is in the works. Speaking to the BBC, Chadha revealed that the recent success of England's Lionesses and the upcoming 25th anniversary of the film make it the right time to revisit the characters. The original movie, starring Parminder Nagra and Keira Knightley, was a cultural phenomenon credited with inspiring a generation of female football players. Chadha is unsure if the sequel will be a film or a TV series but hopes to reunite the original cast for a 2027 release.</p>

          <p>Actress Gwyneth Paltrow has been hired as a "very temporary" spokesperson for Astronomer, the tech company whose CEO resigned after a viral KissCam incident at a Coldplay concert. The CEO and another executive were filmed in an intimate embrace, leading to their resignations following an internal investigation. Paltrow, the ex-wife of Coldplay's frontman Chris Martin, appeared in a video to address the company's newfound public interest, humorously steering the conversation towards its data workflow automation services. The company is attempting to move past the scandal with this unconventional public relations move.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has stated that both Cambodia and Thailand are seeking an immediate ceasefire after three days of deadly border clashes. Trump announced on social media that he had spoken with the leaders of both nations and that he would not proceed with trade deals if the fighting continues. The conflict, which has killed at least 33 people and displaced over 130,000, stems from a long-standing border dispute centered on the 11th-century Preah Vihear temple. While officials from the two countries have not confirmed a meeting, they have expressed willingness to engage in dialogue.</p>

          <p>In a closely watched recall election, Taiwanese voters have rejected a bid to oust 24 lawmakers from the opposition Nationalist Party (KMT). The result is a setback for the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which had hoped to flip the balance of power in the legislature. The KMT and its allies currently form a majority bloc, and the failure of the recall means President Lai Ching-te's government will likely continue to face strong legislative resistance. Supporters of the recall had criticized the KMT for obstructing key legislation and passing reforms seen as favoring China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The debate over how much coffee is safe to drink daily is complex, with experts advising that the right amount depends on individual health and lifestyle. While the FDA recommends a cap of 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, equivalent to about four cups, tolerance varies greatly. Some people may experience anxiety or jitters after just one or two cups. Recent research has linked moderate coffee consumption to some health benefits, but heavy intake has been associated with increased risks for certain conditions. Dietitians stress the importance of moderation and being mindful of how caffeine affects your body.</p>
