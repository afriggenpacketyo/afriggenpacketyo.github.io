          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, moving back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The team overcame recent struggles, including a four-game losing streak and the loss of third baseman Max Muncy to the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered six strong innings, supported by solid defense and timely offense, including a go-ahead sacrifice fly from Mookie Betts in the third inning. The Dodgers' often-unreliable bullpen managed to protect the narrow lead, successfully closing out the game and providing a much-needed morale boost for the team amid a difficult stretch of their season.</p>

          <p>Erin has intensified into a Category 2 hurricane over the Atlantic, becoming the first hurricane of the 2025 season. Forecasters at the U.S. National Hurricane Center expect it to continue strengthening, potentially reaching major hurricane status over the weekend with winds of at least 111 mph. While the storm is not currently projected to impact the United States mainland, residents in the Caribbean, including the Leeward Islands, Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico, are advised to monitor its progress. The hurricane's path is expected to curve northward, bringing heavy rainfall and life-threatening surf conditions to the islands as it passes just to their north.</p>

          <h2>Trump Administration Reaches Agreement to Scale Back Federal Takeover of D.C. Police</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 22:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to scale back its takeover of the Washington, D.C. police force following a lawsuit filed by the city. An agreement reached after an emergency court hearing ensures that Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith will retain command, reversing an earlier order that placed a DEA administrator in charge. U.S. District Judge Ana C Reyes had expressed skepticism about the legality of the full takeover during arguments. The revised directive still allows the administration to use D.C. police for federal purposes, such as assisting with immigration enforcement, but restores day-to-day operational control to local leadership, resolving a tense standoff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the U.S. Department of Justice has rescinded its appointment of a new emergency police chief for the city and agreed to rewrite a directive concerning immigration enforcement. The decision came after a federal judge questioned the legality of the Trump administration's move to assume full operational control of the Metropolitan Police Department under the Home Rule Act. D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will now remain in command of the force. The agreement de-escalates a conflict over local autonomy, although arguments over the federal directive to compel D.C. police to cooperate with immigration authorities will continue.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of California's first accessory dwelling unit (ADU) built under a new law that allows it to be sold as a condominium, separate from the main house on the property. This development marks a significant step in addressing the state's housing crisis by creating a new, more affordable path to homeownership. San José was the first city in the state to adopt this ordinance, and officials hope it will serve as a model for other cities. ADUs, or 'granny flats,' are seen as a key strategy for increasing housing supply, accounting for approximately one-fifth of California's housing growth in 2024.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, has fulfilled a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct a band on his 100th birthday. In the early 2000s, he agreed to lead the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois on this milestone occasion. Although his health now prevents him from traveling, Gabriel was determined to honor his commitment. Last month, he conducted the band remotely from his home in Virginia, leading them through a performance via video link, proving that his word remains his bond even after more than 20 years.</p>

          <h2>Salton Sea Shoreline Contributes Less to Regional Air Pollution Than Previously Believed, Study Finds</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 20:39:10 EDT</div>

          <p>A new report from the Pacific Institute indicates that dust from the exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the Coachella and Imperial valleys. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that the lake bed is the primary source of the region's severe air quality issues, which contribute to high rates of asthma. The research suggests that pollution originates from a wide variety of sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. Consequently, the study's author recommends shifting focus from shoreline dust control to protecting residents through improved indoor air filtration and public health alerts.</p>

          <p>Contrary to common dietary fears, two new clinical trials from India suggest that mangoes may not be detrimental for individuals with type 2 diabetes and could even offer benefits when consumed in moderation. The research found that replacing carbohydrates like white bread with a controlled portion of mango led to improved blood sugar levels, insulin resistance, and other key metabolic markers. The studies indicated that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, challenging the belief that the fruit must be strictly avoided. Researchers emphasize that the key is portion control and substituting mangoes for other carbs within a prescribed diet.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach paying tribute to the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship has generated discussion for its unique depiction of Lakers legend Kobe Bryant. The artwork alters an iconic image of Bryant, showing him in his celebratory pose but wearing a No. 24 Dodgers jersey instead of his classic Lakers gold. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that the choice was made to keep with the mural's Dodgers theme while still honoring Bryant, a feature of murals at other locations of the Eat Fantastic restaurant chain. While some fans have questioned the jersey swap, the artist and owner see it as a way to spark conversation and keep Bryant's legacy alive.</p>
