          <p>U.S. Steel shares saw a boost after President Trump approved its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel, contingent upon a national security agreement. The agreement includes a golden share for the U.S. government, granting the president veto power over key decisions such as relocating headquarters or transferring jobs overseas. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick detailed the government's rights, emphasizing the protection of U.S. Steel's domestic operations. The transaction is described as a "partnership" by Trump, though U.S. Steel will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America, pending customary closing conditions.

Experts remain cautious about whether the momentum can generate broader dialogue on issues like military communications, security, climate, and fentanyl cooperation.

          <p>Congestion pricing in New York City, implemented in January, is showing early signs of success in reducing traffic and funding public transit.

The revenue is earmarked for upgrades to the city‚Äôs public transit network, which is expected to improve commute times and reliability.

          <p>Teenage romance has been declining for decades, with Gen Z experiencing less sexual activity and fewer traditional relationships than previous generations. Despite this, young people still desire genuine connection and intimacy but struggle to navigate confusing modern dating norms.

The pandemic exacerbated this trend, leading to increased screen time and emotional risk-aversion, but many young people express a longing for more authentic, face-to-face interactions.</p>

The biography examines how Ellmann shaped Joyce's image as a cosmopolitan artist, downplaying his political interests and emphasizing his universal themes. It highlights the academic environment of the mid-20th century, where Ellmann's work contributed to Joyce's elevation to a literary saint in postwar universities. Ellmann's biography made Joyce approachable for generations of readers and continues to hold enduring power over readers and scholars.</p>

Psychological violence is prevalent in sports, and parents need to create an environment where children can make their own decisions.

          <p>In Hawaii, scientists are using drones to drop live mosquitoes into forests as a method of saving endangered honeycreepers from avian malaria. The mosquitoes are male and contain a strain of bacteria that prevents successful reproduction, reducing the population of biting mosquitoes. This approach has little ecological downside as mosquitoes are not native to Hawaii. The project is testing drones as an alternative to helicopters for releasing the mosquitoes, with the goal of erecting an invisible barrier to protect the birds.</p>

They express frustration with traditionalist views that encourage women to devote themselves solely to housekeeping and child-rearing. They embrace progressive-leaning views on family policy, such as the importance of remote work and federal parental leave, but acknowledge the trade-offs involved in balancing work and family.</p>
