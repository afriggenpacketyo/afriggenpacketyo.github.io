          <p>The WNBA is investigating allegations of racist comments made by fans during a game between the Indiana Fever and the Chicago Sky, which involved a flagrant foul between Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese. The league has condemned racism and discrimination and is working with the Indiana Fever to ensure a safe environment for all players. Both Clark and Reese have downplayed the foul, but the WNBA Players‚Äô Association has called for swift action. Last season, players who fouled Clark were subjected to racist, sexist, and homophobic comments online.</p>

          <p>Poles have voted in a pivotal presidential election with exit polls indicating a narrow lead for pro-EU Warsaw Mayor Rafa≈Ç Trzaskowski over nationalist historian Karol Nawrocki. Trzaskowski, supported by the centrist Civic Coalition, has pledged to support abortion rights and LGBTQ protections, while Nawrocki, backed by the conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party, presents himself as a defender of conservative values and national sovereignty. With a runoff likely, the outcome of the election will shape Poland's political future and its stance on key issues, including relations with the European Union.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dermatologists advise against storing razors in the shower due to the moist environment promoting bacterial growth and rust, which can lead to skin irritation and infections. Wet razor handles have been found to harbor millions of bacteria, and contaminated blades can cause inflamed razor bumps or folliculitis. Instead, it's recommended to rinse and dry razors thoroughly after use, storing them in a dry place outside the bathroom or in a closed cabinet. Applying after-shave lotion and moisturizer can further prevent skin infections, and razor blades should be replaced every five to seven shaves or sooner if rust or roughness is noticed.</p>
