          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Stephen Miran made a case for substantially lowering the central bank's key interest rate, arguing it is currently about two percentage points too high. He contends that policy changes in areas like immigration and taxation, along with cooling rental costs, have created a new economic landscape that warrants a more aggressive rate cut to avoid risking the Fed's employment mandate. Miran's stance places him in dissent against the more cautious consensus of the Federal Open Market Committee, which recently approved a smaller quarter-point reduction. (not investment advice)</p>

In a separate event, an off-duty ICU nurse saved a jogger's life by performing CPR and later coincidentally became his caregiver at the hospital.

The young male traveled nearly 500 kilometers through Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Austria, attracting a large online following. Wildlife officials tranquilized him near a motorway, fitted him with a GPS tag, and released him near the Czech border. It is hoped that he will now integrate with the small local elk population in the Sumava forest region.</p>

This shift marks a significant change in the beer market, as Modelo had previously taken the top spot from Bud Light following a conservative backlash against the brand. Modelo's decline coincides with challenges faced by its parent company, Constellation Brands, including tariffs and reduced spending from its core Hispanic consumer base. The change in leadership reflects evolving consumer tastes and the lasting impact of brand controversies.</p>

          <h2>Proposed TikTok Deal Establishes U.S. Joint Venture Without Government Equity Stake</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The proposed deal to secure TikTok's future in the U.S. involves creating a new American-based joint venture with investors including Oracle and private equity firm Silverlake. A senior White House official confirmed the U.S. government would not take an equity stake or have a board seat in the new entity. Under the plan, software company Oracle will act as the security provider, overseeing the app's algorithm and the storage of American user data. This structure is intended as a compromise to satisfy both U.S. national security laws and Chinese regulations.</p>

          <p>Google is set to begin its second major antitrust trial against the U.S. Department of Justice, this time concerning its dominant digital advertising technology. A federal judge has already ruled that parts of Google's ad-tech business constitute an illegal monopoly that harms online publishers. This new phase of the trial will focus on determining the appropriate remedy, with the Justice Department advocating for the forced sale of parts of the business to restore competition. Google argues that such a move is unnecessary and would disrupt the internet ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key component of the deal to secure TikTok's U.S. operations involves copying its powerful recommendation algorithm and retraining it exclusively on American user data. A White House official explained that this process will be audited and overseen by tech firm Oracle within a new U.S.-based joint venture. This measure is designed to address national security concerns that the algorithm could be influenced by TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance. The plan aims to create a firewalled version of the technology for the app's 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Medical and scientific experts are emphasizing that there is no credible evidence to support the claim that taking Tylenol (acetaminophen) during pregnancy causes autism. Researchers state that autism spectrum disorder is a complex condition with strong genetic links, involving hundreds or thousands of gene variants, and is not caused by a single medication. The rising number of autism diagnoses is largely attributed to increased awareness, changes in diagnostic criteria, and better screening methods. The disproven theory that vaccines cause autism is cited as a cautionary tale of how misinformation can persist.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point interest rate cut, average 30-year fixed mortgage rates have fallen to their lowest level in nearly three years. For a borrower with a $1 million mortgage, this translates to substantial savings, with a monthly principal and interest payment now around $6,079, compared to nearly $6,700 at the higher rates seen in January. This reduction saves a homeowner approximately $600 per month and over $200,000 in total interest over the life of the loan, making homeownership and refinancing more affordable.
