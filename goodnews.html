          <h2>Tax Deductions on Charitable Donations Skewed Towards the Wealthy, Says Opinion Writer</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 19:23:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Binyamin Appelbaum of the New York Times argues that the current charitable tax deduction system disproportionately benefits wealthy donors and the charities they support, such as museums and universities. He contends that this system incentivizes charities to cater to the rich, creating an uneven playing field. Appelbaum proposes reforms such as matching private donations or emulating Canada's tax credit system to ensure equal federal subsidies for all donors, regardless of income. This article challenges the current system where the wealthy receive larger tax breaks for their donations compared to lower-income individuals, advocating for a fairer approach to charitable giving.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is exploring the creation of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, spearheaded by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, to manage assets and generate public revenue. The proposal has faced resistance within the White House, leading to debates over the fund's mechanics. Sovereign wealth funds typically invest revenue from natural resources, such as oil and gas, to provide financial stability and benefit future generations. While the administration remains committed to safeguarding America's national and economic security, the details of the fund and its potential uses are still under consideration.</p>

Despite a strong performance, Arsenal couldn't overcome PSG, highlighting the uncomfortable truth that they are currently a 'nearly team'. While the team boasts talented players, their inability to secure tangible success puts pressure on manager Mikel Arteta. Arsenal's focus now shifts to securing a top-five finish in the Premier League to ensure Champions League qualification for next season.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced he plans to nominate Dr. Casey Means, a wellness influencer and advocate for the "Make America Healthy Again" movement, as his surgeon general. This decision follows the withdrawal of his previous nominee, Dr. Janette Nesheiwat, who will now work with Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in another capacity. Dr. Means, who earned a medical degree from Stanford, is expected to collaborate closely with Kennedy on wellness efforts. Her nomination has garnered attention due to her views on the American medical system and her co-authorship of "Good Energy," a book about chronic illness.</p>

          <p>Part of a Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after being stuck in orbit since 1972. The lander probe, designed to withstand Venus's atmosphere, may survive re-entry, posing a low risk to people. Experts believe the capsule could land anywhere between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world. Despite the potential for debris to reach the ground, the likelihood of impact on populated areas is considered minimal.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, with analysts predicting further reductions later in the year. A cut to 4.25% from 4.5% is highly likely, which would make borrowing money cheaper for businesses and individuals, but result in lower returns for savers. The Monetary Policy Committee will be closely monitoring inflation and global economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariff policy. Such uncertainty may push down growth and inflation, leading to expectations of more interest rate cuts this year.</p>
