          <p>NFL superstar pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded to the Green Bay Packers from the Dallas Cowboys, ending a four-month contract stalemate he described as the hardest period of his life. The Packers acquired Parsons in exchange for two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark, signing him to a four-year, $188 million contract. Parsons, who will wear number 1, aims to build a legacy with the storied franchise, providing much-needed star power and a consistent pass rush for Green Bay. This move is seen as a full-circle moment for Parsons, who played for a youth team called the Harrisburg Packers.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men aged 18 to 22, previously restricted due to potential military conscription, to cross national borders unhindered. This policy aims to provide young Ukrainians with broader opportunities for education, internships, and legal employment abroad, with the hope that their acquired experience will later benefit Ukraine's development. While the government seeks to maintain strong ties with its youth, demographers express skepticism, believing the rule change will lead to more departures rather than increased returns. This decision highlights Ukraine's complex challenge in balancing its national defense requirements with fostering the future prospects and international engagement of its younger generation.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Washington, D.C., has temporarily blocked the Trump administration's expanded use of expedited removal for undocumented migrants detained in the U.S. interior. Judge Jia Cobb suggested that this policy, which allows for swift deportations without a judicial hearing, infringes on individuals' due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. Historically, expedited removal was largely limited to migrants apprehended within 100 miles of the border and within 14 days of entry. This ruling is a significant setback for President Trump's campaign promise to dramatically increase deportations, although it does not question the constitutionality of the expedited removal statute's application at the border.</p>

          <p>Taylor Townsend, ranked outside the top 100 in singles, achieved one of her career's finest victories by upsetting No. 5 seed Mirra Andreeva 7-5, 6-2 at the US Open. This impressive win propels her to the fourth round, equaling her best major performance since 2019. Townsend also used the platform to thank supporters and address recent controversy, after Jelena Ostapenko's alleged "no class" comments, which sparked accusations of racism and drew public defense from other players. Townsend emphasized the importance of representation and being authentic, stating she is "made for this type of stuff" and stood in her truth, proving her resilience on the biggest stage.</p>

          <p>British tennis player Cameron Norrie lost to Novak Djokovic for the seventh time at the US Open, falling 6-4, 6-7 (4-7), 6-2, 6-3. Norrie reflected on being "a little overconfident" after breaking early in the third set, acknowledging Djokovic's resilience despite the Serb's lower back injury and need for medical timeouts. This challenging match, lasting almost three hours, saw Djokovic produce his best level of the tournament. For Norrie, the defeat comes amidst a career resurgence following a difficult period earlier in the year, having since reached the French Open fourth round and Wimbledon quarter-finals, leaving him with much to smile about despite the loss.</p>

          <p>The bat used by 12-year-old Marco Rocco, a New Jersey Little Leaguer, which led to his suspension for a celebratory bat flip, sold for nearly $10,000 at auction. All proceeds from the signed bat will be donated to his program, Haddonfield Little League, an organization Marco is very fond of. Rocco's bat flip incident in July resulted in an ejection and a one-game suspension, which was later lifted by a judge after his father took legal action. The event garnered significant attention, including support from major leaguers who sided with the boy, and was even commemorated with a pin at the Little League World Series.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh, Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean, have set a new record for rowing non-stop and unsupported across the Pacific Ocean. Their incredible 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia took 139 days, five hours, and 52 minutes, significantly beating the previous record of 162 days. The brothers endured violent tropical storms, including one harrowing incident where Lachlan was swept overboard by a large wave before being pulled back into the boat by a safety line. They successfully raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar and are now looking forward to simple comforts like pizza and a decent night's sleep after their arduous adventure.</p>

          <p>A 10-mile scenic stretch of Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened to the public, just in time for Labor Day weekend, after being closed for years due to extensive storm and fire damage. Heavy rains during the 2022 and 2023 winters triggered slope failures and pavement collapses, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. Repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. While the reopening is welcomed by hikers for increased access and reduced overcrowding on popular trails, officials have issued extreme fire danger warnings for Angeles National Forest, raising concerns about public adherence during the busy holiday weekend.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal appeals court ruled that many of the sweeping tariffs imposed by President Trump on numerous countries earlier this year are not legally permissible, dealing a significant blow to his trade strategy. The court upheld a lower court's finding that Trump exceeded his power under federal economic emergency laws, specifically the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA). The ruling applies to tariffs on goods from Canada, Mexico, China, and other nations, intended to pressure on issues like fentanyl and immigration. While the tariffs remain in effect pending a potential Supreme Court appeal, the decision emphasizes Congress's core power to levy tariffs.</p>

          <h2>China's Equity Markets Rally Amid Domestic Savings and Global Investor Inflows</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's equity markets are experiencing a significant rally, reaching a 10-year high, driven by a potent mix of domestic investors rotating out of low-yield fixed-income products and returning global investors. Analysts, such as Jian Shi Cortesi from GAM Investments, believe there's substantial room for further growth, particularly in "undervalued innovation" sectors like advanced manufacturing, AI, and robotics. This resurgence follows years of underperformance and foreign investor exodus, with Morgan Stanley noting two consecutive months of inflows in June and July. The country's substantial domestic savings pool, estimated at US$22 trillion, is seen as a key catalyst for continued market strength and investor interest (not investment advice).</p>
