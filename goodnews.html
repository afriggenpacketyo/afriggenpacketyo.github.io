          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 12:27:32 EDT</div>

          <p>Costco has entered an agreement with drugmaker Novo Nordisk to sell GLP-1 medications like Ozempic and Wegovy to its members for approximately $499 for a four-week supply. This price is roughly half the typical cost and is available to members with a valid prescription who are paying out-of-pocket, as many insurance plans do not cover these drugs. The initiative aims to provide authentic, affordable medication amidst soaring prices and the proliferation of unregulated compounded versions. With GLP-1 drug use growing rapidly, Costco's market entry could significantly increase access and demand for these popular weight-loss treatments.</p>

          <p>After two decades of extensive restoration work, Egypt has opened the tomb of Pharaoh Amenhotep III to the public in Luxor. The tomb, one of the largest in the Valley of the Kings, dates back over 3,000 years and had suffered from severe deterioration. A Japanese-led project involving over 260 specialists meticulously restored the site, which features a long sloping passageway and chambers decorated with exquisite wall paintings. The site was originally discovered in 1799 but its contents, including the sarcophagus, had been looted long ago.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to parts of a Gaza peace plan proposed by President Trump, notably the release of all hostages. In response, Israel stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, and Trump urged an immediate halt to the bombing of Gaza to facilitate the process. While Hamas accepted key terms like an end to fighting and an Israeli withdrawal, it indicated other aspects require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. U.S. and Israeli officials are reportedly preparing for indirect talks to begin Sunday in Egypt to finalize the details.</p>

Manager Thomas Frank expressed his happiness for the midfielder, noting his performance has been crucial, especially with injuries to other key creative players.

          <p>Veteran pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been added to the Los Angeles Dodgers' roster for the National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. This marks his return to postseason action after being left off the wild-card series roster. Kershaw, who is expected to pitch out of the bullpen, provides experienced left-handed depth against a Phillies lineup with several left-handed hitters. The move is one of two pitching changes for the Dodgers, who are hoping the future Hall of Famer can offer a steadying presence in what could be his final playoff series before his anticipated retirement.</p>

          <p>Despite the federal government shutdown, U.S. stock markets demonstrated strong performance, with the S&P 500 achieving another record high. The healthcare sector saw a significant rally after President Trump negotiated a deal with Pfizer, boosting investor confidence in pharmaceutical stocks. Additionally, the technology and utilities sectors advanced, driven by the ongoing artificial intelligence boom which increases demand for both software and the power required for data centers. The article notes that the market has largely dismissed the shutdown as a non-event, though some analysts remain cautious about its potential long-term economic impact. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite U.S. stock markets reaching record highs, some financial experts suggest that American investors are overly concentrated in domestic assets and should consider increasing their exposure abroad. They argue that international markets, particularly in emerging economies like China and India, may offer better long-term value and growth potential. India is highlighted for its large population, strong demographics, and rapid economic growth, which is driving consumption. The analysis suggests that diversifying portfolios internationally could be a prudent strategy for investors looking beyond the current U.S. market rally. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A civil rights alliance in Pakistan-administered Kashmir has called off days of violent protests after reaching a deal with Pakistani authorities.

He pays just $850 for a two-bedroom apartment in one of the country's tallest residential towers. His income is sourced from VA disability benefits, the GI Bill for his master's degree, and teaching English. Ryan explains that in Vietnam, he has escaped the 'survival mode' and financial pressures he felt in the U.S., allowing him to focus on personal happiness and growth rather than constantly struggling to meet a high cost of living.</p>

Bill Gates reportedly called it the 'stupidest decision' he had ever heard. However, Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's obsession with the customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Risher was impressed by Bezos's vision to expand from books into an 'everything store,' an opportunity he found incredibly compelling, ultimately joining as the company's 37th employee and helping drive its explosive growth.</p>

          <p>A parenting expert and therapist recommends a simple yet profound practice for parents: creating an email address for each child at birth and sending them messages over the years. This creates a digital time capsule filled with memories, stories, and advice that the children can access when they are older. The expert writes notes on birthdays, during special or silly moments, and even during difficult times to capture the full spectrum of life and love. The practice serves as a way to build a legacy and preserve a deep connection, ensuring children have a tangible record of their parents' love and thoughts.</p>
