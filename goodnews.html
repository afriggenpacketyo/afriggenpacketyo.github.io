          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake with an epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, was felt across parts of the New York City area. Residents reported brief shaking and a loud boom, with some initially thinking a car had hit their house. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the quake was minor and not expected to cause significant damage. The event comes after a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake rattled the region in April 2024, but officials reassured the public that there was little cause for alarm.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly overtaken California in adding new utility-scale solar capacity, driven largely by major utilities like Florida Power & Light rather than rooftop installations. A state rule that fast-tracks approval for projects under 75 megawatts has significantly accelerated construction and reduced costs. Despite the state removing climate change from official policy, the economic advantages of solar over natural gas are fueling the boom. However, new federal legislation rolling back tax credits is expected to slow future growth, particularly in the residential sector.</p>

England needs 35 more runs to win, while India requires four more wickets to secure a victory and level the series. The fourth day saw brilliant centuries from England's Harry Brook and Joe Root, but a late surge from India's bowlers shifted the momentum before bad weather suspended play. The thrilling finale will decide the hard-fought series on its last possible day.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 by manufacturing runs through aggressive baserunning, a double-steal, and timely singles rather than relying on home runs. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout to secure a series victory. The win provided a positive end to a nine-game road trip, though concerns remain about the team's overall offensive slump and recent lineup changes involving Shohei Ohtani and Mookie Betts.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has announced it will consult on a compensation scheme for consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance due to hidden commissions. Following a Supreme Court ruling that provided legal clarity, the regulator estimates payouts will likely be less than £950 per deal, with a total cost to the industry between £9 billion and £18 billion. The scheme is expected to cover agreements dating back to 2007, with the first payouts anticipated next year. (not investment advice)</p>
