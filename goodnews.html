          <p>Nvidia has announced its expectation to resume selling its H20 AI chips to Chinese clients after receiving assurances from the U.S. government that the necessary sales licenses will be granted. The sales of these GPUs, which were specifically designed to comply with U.S. export controls, had been halted in April. This development occurs as part of a broader, preliminary trade agreement between Washington and Beijing aimed at easing tech export restrictions. Nvidia's CEO has been a vocal opponent of the controls, arguing they undermine American tech leadership and have significantly reduced the company's market share in China. (not investment advice)</p>

The team is traveling aboard a SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, marking the end of the fourth private mission to the ISS organized by Axiom Space. During their 18-day stay, the astronauts conducted numerous microgravity experiments. The mission was a historic milestone for India, Poland, and Hungary, representing their first astronaut visits to the orbital lab in over four decades.

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a new plan to supply Ukraine with advanced weaponry through NATO allies, who will finance the purchases. The deal involves European nations sending their own Patriot air defense systems to Kyiv, with the U.S. then providing replacements. In a significant shift in tone, Trump also threatened Russia with 100% secondary tariffs on its trade partners if a peace agreement is not reached within 50 days. The president expressed frustration with Vladimir Putin, stating that their diplomatic conversations have not translated into a cessation of Russian attacks on Ukraine.</p>

          <p>A U.S. appeals court has issued a temporary stay, preventing the Trump administration from terminating the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for thousands of Afghans residing in the country. The administrative stay was granted following an emergency motion by the immigration advocacy group Casa, which is challenging the administration's decision. The Department of Homeland Security had announced in April that conditions in Afghanistan no longer warranted the protection, a move that would affect many of the over 82,000 Afghans evacuated after the Taliban's 2021 takeover. The administration has until Wednesday to respond to the court's order.</p>

          <p>Authorities have arrested a man suspected of orchestrating a prank involving a macabre teddy bear that appeared to be made of human skin. The object was discovered at a gas station in Victorville, California, prompting a response from the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department. After examination, the coroner determined the bear was not made of human remains. The creator, a South Carolina artist, confirmed she had recently shipped the unique item to a customer in the area. The suspect was arrested for filing a false report and planting evidence, with officials noting such incidents waste valuable emergency resources.</p>

          <p>Researchers at China's Dalian University of Technology have developed a new manufacturing technique that could significantly improve the performance of aircraft engines, a critical area for the nation's military modernization. The method involves rapidly cooling forged turbine discs made from superalloys, which are essential components that must withstand extreme temperatures and stress. The quality and durability of these discs have historically been a major challenge for China's aerospace industry. This technological advancement is particularly vital as China works to develop its own advanced engines for next-generation fighter jets.</p>

          <p>Bob Becker, an 80-year-old runner from Fort Lauderdale, has made history by becoming the oldest person to finish the Badwater 135, widely considered the world's most difficult foot race. The ultramarathon covers 135 miles through California's Death Valley, where temperatures can exceed 120°F, and involves significant elevation gain. Becker completed the race with three hours to spare, settling a score after he narrowly missed the 48-hour cutoff time in 2022. His determination and successful finish serve as an inspiration, demonstrating that age is not a prohibitive factor in pursuing extreme endurance challenges.</p>

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles experienced its busiest June in its 117-year history, processing a record number of shipping containers. Port executives attribute the surge to a "tariff whipsaw effect," as importers raced to bring in goods from China before a potential increase in U.S. tariffs. This rush to beat deadlines for taxes on Chinese goods highlights the uncertainty and shifting timelines in international trade policy. While the monthly numbers show an 8% improvement over last year, officials anticipate that cargo volume will likely decrease in the coming months once new, higher tariffs are in place.

Paraguay is one of the few remaining countries that formally recognizes Taiwan over Beijing, and Peña emphasized this reflects his nation's sovereign foreign policy.</p>

          <p>China's growing prowess in drug development was a major focus at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting, according to a report from Jefferies. Nearly one-third of the drug candidate presentations at the world's largest cancer conference involved innovations from Chinese companies, a significant increase from a decade ago. The report, titled "Shopping in China’s Biotech Supermarket," highlights that multinational corporations are increasingly looking to partner with Chinese firms due to their cost efficiency, accelerated development timelines, and promising quality.

          <p>Shares of fintech companies, including Block and PayPal, rallied on Monday after experiencing sharp declines late last week. The initial drop was triggered by reports that JPMorgan Chase plans to charge data aggregators for access to customer financial information, sparking fears of increased operational costs for the fintech sector. However, market analysts have since downplayed the threat, with firms like Evercore ISI and Morgan Stanley suggesting the potential impact would be negligible for larger platforms. They argue the new fees would only slightly increase costs for one-time account verifications and not be a business-breaking expense. (not investment advice)</p>

Cramer suggested that the Trump administration's Federal Trade Commission is more friendly toward M&A, which could encourage more companies to pursue such transactions.
