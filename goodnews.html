          <p>The European football transfer window is active with several high-profile potential moves being reported across major leagues. Liverpool is reportedly preparing a record-breaking £130m offer for Newcastle's striker Alexander Isak, while Manchester United's Rasmus Hojlund is nearing a loan-to-buy deal with Napoli. Other significant discussions include Brentford's rejected £45m bid for Borussia Dortmund's Maximilian Beier and multiple clubs showing interest in players from Chelsea, Manchester City, and Arsenal.

          <p>China is strategically reorganizing its national laboratory system to align with its goal of achieving scientific and technological supremacy, as highlighted by a recent ceremony in Hong Kong. The new model shifts from loosely defined research to a more centralized approach with clear mandates, direct funding, and accountability to Beijing's national strategy. With approximately 500 labs approved under this restructured program, the initiative aims to transform these institutions into efficient machines for technological competition, urging cities like Hong Kong to directly support national development through innovation.</p>

          <p>Singer Sabrina Carpenter has responded to the controversy surrounding the original cover art for her new album, "Man’s Best Friend," which depicted her being submissive to a male figure. In a recent interview, Carpenter dismissed the criticism, stating that the image was not a topic of concern among her inner circle and that her intention was to explore themes of control and the lack of it. Amid the backlash, she released an alternative cover, but maintains that her focus is on her artistic expression and the interpretation of her fans, not outside critics.</p>

          <p>Following a decisive loss to Elena Rybakina in the US Open third round, British tennis player Emma Raducanu reflected on her performance in this year's Grand Slams. She noted that all four of her major tournament defeats came against the world's elite players, suggesting they are extra motivated to prove their top ranking against her. Raducanu is focused on closing the gap with these top opponents, working with her new coach Francisco Roig to improve key areas like her serve and her readiness for fast returns.</p>

          <p>Democratic State Representative Malcolm Kenyatta is undertaking a 105-mile, five-day solo march from Philadelphia to the state capitol in Harrisburg. The protest aims to draw attention to severe budget cuts facing the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (Septa), which he attributes to Republican inaction in the legislature. Kenyatta argues that the funding crisis, which is already causing service cuts affecting workers and students, is a result of misplaced priorities by GOP lawmakers and is using the march to advocate for bipartisan funding solutions.</p>

          <p>Several enterprise technology companies, including MongoDB, Pure Storage, and Snowflake, experienced a significant stock market rally this week after reporting strong quarterly earnings. The positive results suggest that the financial benefits of the artificial intelligence boom are extending beyond chipmakers like Nvidia to software and data management firms. Company executives noted that while full-scale enterprise AI deployment is still in early stages, AI-native companies are driving customer growth and boosting demand for their cloud and data services.

          <p>A federal appeals court has blocked the Trump administration's plan to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 600,000 Venezuelans residing in the U.S. The Ninth Circuit panel unanimously upheld a lower court's injunction, stating that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed in their claim that the administration acted unlawfully. The court found that the DHS secretary does not have the authority under the governing statute to vacate a prior extension of TPS, a program designed to be insulated from shifting political dynamics.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved a new round of COVID-19 vaccines but has significantly changed its guidance on eligibility.

This includes people aged 65 and older and those with other underlying health problems. The shift in policy marks a departure from the broad vaccination campaigns of the early pandemic and raises new questions about vaccine access.</p>
