          <p>President Donald Trump has announced his intention to nominate Sergio Gor, a close aide and director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, as the next U.S. ambassador to India. Gor will also serve as a special envoy for South and Central Asian affairs. The nomination comes at a time of strained relations between the two countries, largely due to trade disputes and planned U.S. tariff increases on Indian goods. Trump expressed his full trust in Gor to represent his agenda in the region, while Vice President JD Vance also praised the appointment.</p>

          <p>Financial analysts continue to view NVIDIA as a top investment for exposure to the artificial intelligence sector, with some raising their price targets significantly. TD Cowen analyst Joshua Buchalter increased the target to $235, citing the company's strong fundamentals and a smooth transition to its new Blackwell-series chips. The analysis suggests NVIDIA is well-positioned to exceed high market expectations and currently trades at a discount compared to competitors like Broadcom. This sentiment reinforces the view that NVIDIA offers the most direct and promising way to invest in the burgeoning AI market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported in March and later returned to the U.S. to face human smuggling charges, has been released from criminal custody in Tennessee. A federal judge had previously blocked immigration authorities from detaining him upon release, ordering his return to his family in Maryland under supervision. Abrego Garcia expressed gratitude for his release after more than 160 days, though his legal team notes he is "far from safe" as deportation threats remain. His release conditions include supervision, employment, and no contact with known MS-13 gang members.</p>

          <p>Excel Parking has paid £10,240 to the Access to Justice Foundation after losing a court appeal against a woman it pursued for thousands of pounds in parking charges. The case centered on the company's controversial rule requiring payment within five minutes of entering a car park, a policy that has since been banned. Hannah Robinson was targeted with demands totaling over £11,000 for repeatedly failing to pay within the short timeframe. A judge dismissed Excel's claim, calling its conduct unreasonable and ordering it to pay legal costs, which were directed to charity as Robinson had pro bono representation.</p>

          <p>After Dan Pelzer of Columbus, Ohio, passed away at 92, his children discovered a 109-page list detailing every one of the 3,599 books he had read since 1962. The meticulously kept record, which began while he was in the Peace Corps, chronicles six decades of reading, with nearly all books borrowed from the Columbus Metropolitan Library. The library shared the list on social media, where it went viral and inspired millions, prompting many to visit and check out titles from Pelzer's collection. His children see the list as a microcosm of his life and his desire to learn about the world.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests a Growing Political Divide Between Young Men and Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-22 19:48:35 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent polling data indicates an emerging political divergence among young people, with young women leaning more to the left and young men more to the right. A 2025 survey found that 20% of young British women identify as left-wing compared to 13% of young men. At the 2024 general election, women aged 18-24 were significantly more likely to vote for Labour or the Green Party, while young men showed more support for the Conservatives and Reform UK. Researchers suggest factors like higher university attendance among women and the influence of social media may be contributing to this growing gender-generation gap.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The price of Ether (ETH) reached a new record for the first time since 2021, driven by comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that hinted at potential interest rate cuts. During his annual address, Powell noted that the restrictive policy stance might soon need adjustment, which traders interpreted as a dovish signal. The remarks triggered a market repositioning, with about $120 million in short positions on ETH being liquidated in a single hour, further fueling the price increase. The rally reflects renewed momentum in the crypto market as investors anticipate a more favorable monetary policy environment. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cafes in South Korea are navigating the cultural phenomenon of "Cagongjok," a term for people who occupy tables for long hours to study or work, often with elaborate electronic setups. The issue has become so prevalent that Starbucks Korea recently issued nationwide guidelines to curb extreme cases, such as customers bringing desktop monitors or leaving seats unattended for long stretches. While some independent cafe owners have implemented study time limits or blocked power outlets, others cater to the trend. Experts view the phenomenon as a product of South Korea's hyper-competitive society and a lack of adequate public study spaces.</p>

The new location is expected to enhance accessibility for the over half a million Indian Americans in the region and provide local business leaders with direct access to Indian diplomats. The move provides a positive development for downtown L.A.'s office market, which has been struggling with high vacancy rates.</p>
