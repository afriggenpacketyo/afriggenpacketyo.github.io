          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax after President Trump announced he was terminating all trade discussions with the country in response to the policy. The tax, which would have applied a 3% levy on large tech companies like Google and Amazon, was a point of major contention. Canadian officials stated the withdrawal is intended to facilitate the resumption of negotiations for a new comprehensive economic and security agreement with the United States. The move represents a significant reversal from Canada's earlier stance on the issue.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As electric vehicles (EVs) become more common, an increasing number of passengers are reporting motion sickness, a phenomenon researchers are now studying. Studies suggest that the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs, particularly the regenerative braking systems, are a primary cause. This system, which converts kinetic energy back into battery power, can result in low-frequency deceleration that provokes queasiness. Researchers are investigating solutions to mitigate this effect and improve passenger comfort as the automotive industry continues its rapid transition to electric power.</p>

The two nations had agreed in May to begin the process of resuming trade, and this announcement marks a formal end to the restriction. However, the article notes that it may take a few months for actual shipments to restart as procedural steps still need to be completed by both sides.</p>

          <p>Japan's Fair Trade Commission is set to fine Harley-Davidson Japan K.K. approximately 200 million yen ($1.4 million) for violating antimonopoly laws. The company is accused of imposing excessive sales quotas on its dealers and pressuring them by implying their contracts would not be renewed if targets were not met. This pressure allegedly led some dealers to purchase unsold motorcycles themselves to meet the quotas. In addition to the fine, the antitrust watchdog will issue a cease and desist order to the Tokyo-based unit of the American motorcycle company.</p>
