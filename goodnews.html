        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City midfielder Bernardo Silva has voiced frustration over Premier League scheduling, claiming his team was at an "unfair advantage" against Arsenal. City had only 66 hours to recover from a Champions League match before facing Arsenal, who had significantly more rest time after their European game. Silva, supported by manager Pep Guardiola, argued that such tight turnarounds for crucial matches are not right and impact players' physical condition, calling for more common sense in fixture planning.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has allowed Danish energy company Orsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind farm, overturning a stop-work order issued by the Trump administration. The project, located off the coast of Rhode Island and Connecticut, is 80% complete and is expected to power over 350,000 homes. This ruling represents a significant setback for the administration's efforts to halt the development of the offshore wind industry in the United States, which officials have described as too expensive and unreliable.</p>

Speaking at his party's conference, Davey positioned the Liberal Democrats as a viable alternative to both the Conservative and Labour parties, which he claims voters are turning away from. He argued that Farage aims to model the UK after "Trump's America," a vision he believes is contrary to British values of a decent and caring society.</p>

          <p>Medicare supplemental insurance, or Medigap, helps retirees cover out-of-pocket costs not included in Original Medicare, with 2025 premiums varying widely based on location, plan type, and personal factors. Monthly costs can range from as low as $32 for high-deductible options to over $550 for comprehensive plans, though most beneficiaries pay between $90 and $300. To lower costs, experts advise enrolling when first eligible, comparing plans carefully, and considering options with higher cost-sharing or deductibles. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The White House has blocked a decision by U.S. Steel to cease processing raw steel at its Granite City Works plant in Illinois, invoking a national security agreement with Japan-based Nippon Steel.

This move ensures the plant will continue to receive and process steel slabs indefinitely, protecting approximately 800 jobs at the facility.</p>

Experts suggest that rather than buying physical gold bars or coins, the most efficient way to gain exposure is through exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the price of bullion. Financial advisors generally recommend limiting gold allocation to a small percentage of a diversified portfolio, despite its recent strong performance. (not investment advice)</p>
