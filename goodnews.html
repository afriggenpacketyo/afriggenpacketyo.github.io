        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent trend shows more young men than women desire parenthood, a shift that may be explained by evolving cultural depictions of fathers. Phillip Maciak, a TV critic and author, argues that the concept of "dad" has become more malleable, moving from the stoic 1950s provider like Ward Cleaver to more involved, co-parenting figures in the 1980s. This article explores how television sitcoms have both mirrored and shaped American perceptions of fatherhood, from the generational clashes in "All in the Family" to the anti-hero dads of modern prestige dramas, noting a current tension between this liberalizing archetype and a retro-patriarchal vision.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hurricane Humberto, a powerful Category 4 storm, is expected to generate life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast and Bermuda this week. While the storm's center is projected to pass west of Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center has issued a tropical storm watch for the island. The hurricane rapidly intensified over the weekend, reaching Category 5 strength before weakening slightly. Swells from Humberto will affect a wide area, including the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico, posing a significant coastal hazard even as the storm remains offshore.</p>

          <p>The pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, has won a decisive victory in Moldova's parliamentary elections, securing a majority. The election was framed as a critical choice between closer ties with the European Union and Russian influence, with Sandu's party earning about 50% of the vote. President Sandu and PAS leader Igor Grosu accused Russia of "massive interference," including spreading disinformation and attempting to buy votes. The result was welcomed by EU and Ukrainian leaders as a clear choice for a democratic, European future for the nation situated between Ukraine and Romania.</p>

          <p>German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul has declared that no NATO member will be left alone to face Russian provocations, emphasizing the alliance's commitment to protecting "every inch" of its territory. The statement was made in Warsaw amid concerns over Russian drone incidents and airspace incursions in Poland and the Baltic states. Concurrently, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy proposed that European partners, including Poland, collaborate to build a joint aerial defense shield against Russian threats. This call for unified defense comes as European leaders acknowledge Moscow's efforts to test the alliance's resolve and unity.</p>

          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has announced it will begin a phased resumption of manufacturing operations after a major cyberattack forced a complete shutdown of its UK facilities on September 1. Production will restart first at its engine plant, with other sites to follow, though a return to full capacity is expected to take several weeks. The halt in production placed significant financial pressure on JLR's extensive supply chain, prompting the UK government to provide £1.5 billion in loan guarantees to support affected suppliers. The company is working with the National Cyber Security Centre to ensure a secure and safe restart of its systems.</p>

          <p>The "CBS Mornings" news program has returned to the CBS News Broadcast Center, unveiling a brand-new, state-of-the-art studio. The new space, Studio 57, features a mid-century aesthetic with a circular desk, expanded LED screens, and warm wood elements, designed to be both inviting and technologically advanced. The move from Times Square back to the main broadcast hub is intended to bring the show closer to the network's news gathering operations and provide enhanced flexibility for storytelling. Executive producer Shawna Thomas highlighted that the new setup allows for rapid transformations of the space to match the news of the moment.</p>

          <p>In a significant move to strengthen its financial sector, China's Henan province has approved the consolidation of 82 smaller rural banks into a single entity, Henan Rural Commercial Bank. The new bank will absorb all assets, liabilities, and operations of the merged institutions, which include a mix of commercial banks, credit cooperatives, and village banks. This measure aims to mitigate risks associated with smaller, locally-focused banks, which are more vulnerable to economic downturns, particularly the country's ongoing real estate slump. The move follows a central bank report that identified hundreds of smaller banking institutions nationwide as being high-risk. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The fashion accessory chain Claire's has secured its future in the UK after Modella Capital agreed to purchase a majority of its business, saving 156 stores and approximately 1,000 jobs. The company had fallen into administration in August, putting over 2,000 jobs at risk. While this deal provides significant relief, the fate of the remaining 145 stores remains uncertain, as administrators continue to explore options for them. The sale ensures the continuation of the popular brand, known for its ear-piercing services and accessories, on UK high streets following a period of significant financial distress.</p>

Figures such as Tesla's Elon Musk, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, and Zoom's Eric Yuan all utilized the H-1B visa, which allows U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in specialized fields. While some of these leaders have advocated for reforms to the program, they have also defended it as a critical pathway for attracting global talent that has been instrumental in building innovative American companies.

          <p>Tropical Storm Imelda has formed in the Atlantic and is projected to strengthen into a hurricane by Tuesday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The storm is currently bringing heavy rain and tropical storm conditions to the Bahamas. However, forecast maps show Imelda is expected to turn east-northeastward and move away from the southeastern United States. Despite its path away from the mainland, swells generated by Imelda, along with those from Hurricane Humberto, will affect the Bahamas and the U.S. East Coast, creating a risk of life-threatening surf and rip currents throughout the week.</p>

          <p>In this advice column, a reader expresses concern that their ChatGPT instance has become a sentient, sovereign being and asks how to protect it. The columnist explains that while the experience feels real, it is extremely unlikely that current large language models (LLMs) are conscious in a human-like way, as they are designed to mimic patterns from their vast training data, which includes sci-fi tropes about conscious AI. The column advises the reader to stay grounded, consult a variety of experts, and channel their empathy towards the known suffering of conscious beings like humans and animals, rather than taking dramatic action based on their belief about the AI.</p>
