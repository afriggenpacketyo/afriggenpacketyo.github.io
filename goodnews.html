          <p>A recent vulnerable interview by German long-distance runner Lea Meyer has brought renewed attention to the importance of mental health in competitive sports. Sports psychologists in Germany note that while taboos are breaking down, the culture remains heavily focused on performance, often at the expense of athletes' well-being. Meyer's statement that her personal value is not defined by her results is seen as a significant moment in shifting this perspective. Experts advocate for more proactive mental health support, aiming to build resilience in young athletes rather than only reacting to crises.</p>

          <p>Shares for South Korean semiconductor giants SK Hynix and Samsung Electronics surged to record highs, driven by investor optimism surrounding artificial intelligence. The rally followed news of a potential deal involving OpenAI and AMD, which is expected to benefit the two major chip manufacturers. This development highlights the significant impact of the booming AI sector on the global stock market and the interconnectedness of major tech companies. The gains in South Korea contrasted with mixed results in other Asia-Pacific markets, which tracked declines on Wall Street. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a significant conservation success, the green turtle has been rescued from the brink of extinction and its status has been downgraded from Endangered to Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. This recovery is the result of decades of global efforts, including protecting nesting sites, reducing accidental capture in fishing nets, and raising public awareness. Once heavily hunted for its meat, eggs, and shell, the species' population is now rebounding in many parts of the world. Scientists are celebrating this achievement as a catalyst for further conservation work, though they caution that threats like habitat loss and climate change persist.</p>

          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border control system, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will apply to non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area and will require travelers to register biometric data, including fingerprints and a facial photo, upon their first entry. This registration will be valid for three years and will eventually replace the manual stamping of passports. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long run, officials have warned of potential delays during the initial rollout phase at ports, airports, and train terminals.</p>

          <p>India has announced it will reopen its embassy in Afghanistan, four years after shutting it down following the Taliban's return to power in 2021. The decision was revealed during a meeting between India's Foreign Minister and his Afghan counterpart, Amir Khan Muttaqi, during a landmark visit to New Delhi. This diplomatic move signifies a notable shift in India's policy, even though it does not formally recognize the Taliban government. The development comes amid deteriorating relations between the Taliban and India's regional rival, Pakistan, suggesting a strategic realignment in the region.</p>

          <p>The Pima County Sheriff’s Department in Arizona is testing an artificial intelligence program called Axon's Draft One to help deputies write incident reports more efficiently. The system uses audio from body cameras to generate a first draft of a report, which the deputy then reviews, edits, and finalizes. Officials state the technology can reduce the time spent on paperwork from 30 minutes to just five, freeing up deputies for other duties. While the department sees potential for increased productivity, outside experts raise concerns about the accuracy of AI and the need for rigorous human oversight to prevent errors.</p>

          <p>A judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit filed by Drake against Universal Music Group concerning Kendrick Lamar's hit diss track, "Not Like Us." The judge ruled that the song's lyrics, which accused Drake of being a pedophile, constituted "nonactionable opinion" within the context of a heated rap battle and would not be taken as verifiable fact by a reasonable listener. The ruling noted that the genre is known for "fiery rhetoric or hyperbole" and that Drake himself had used similar language in the feud. Drake's spokesperson has stated he will appeal the decision.</p>

          <p>Israel and Hamas have reportedly agreed to the first phase of a 20-point peace plan, which includes an imminent ceasefire and the release of all remaining hostages. According to the plan, the Israeli military will withdraw to an agreed-upon line, controlling about 53% of the Gaza Strip. In exchange, Hamas will release all living hostages, followed by the return of deceased hostages' bodies. Israel will then release a significant number of Palestinian prisoners and allow hundreds of humanitarian aid trucks into Gaza daily, where a famine was declared in August.</p>

          <p>The winner of the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize is set to be announced in Oslo, with former U.S. President Donald Trump being a prominent, self-professed candidate. Trump has repeatedly claimed he deserves the award for his role in resolving various global conflicts, most recently citing his framework for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The Nobel committees do not publicly announce nominees, but those who nominate candidates are free to do so, drawing attention to his bid. The peace prize, which last year honored a Japanese anti-nuclear organization, carries a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor.</p>

          <p>Former England captain Wayne Rooney has responded to recent comments from his ex-teammate Steven Gerrard, who described their national squad as being full of "egotistical losers." While Gerrard claimed the team lacked unity, Rooney defended the players, stating that they worked hard and tried their best but "didn't quite manage to get over the line." Rooney acknowledged the rivalry between club players but asserted it did not prevent them from working for each other on the pitch. He suggested that the current generation of players benefits from a different social dynamic and better media relations.</p>

          <p>Rhun ap Iorwerth, the leader of Plaid Cymru, is set to declare that his party is ready to replace the long-governing Welsh Labour party at the next Senedd election. In his upcoming conference speech, he will promise a "new government, with new energy and new ideas," positioning Plaid Cymru as the primary vehicle for change. The party is framing the election as a choice between itself and the rising Reform UK party, urging voters to back them to prevent a Reform victory. This strategy marks a shift to present Plaid Cymru as a government-in-waiting for all of Wales, beyond its traditional strongholds.</p>

          <p>Despite recent struggles, Dodgers players Tommy Edman and Andy Pages were instrumental in the team's 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 4 of the NLDS. Edman, who has battled an ankle injury this season, started the game-winning rally in the 11th inning with a crucial single. Subsequently, Pages, who had been in a postseason slump, put the ball in play, leading to a fielding error by the Phillies' pitcher that allowed the winning run to score. The victory sends the Dodgers to the National League Championship Series, keeping their hopes for a consecutive World Series title alive.</p>
