          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 13:35:32 EDT</div>

          <p>Ether and cryptocurrency trading stocks experienced significant gains following the congressional passage of the GENIUS Act, a landmark stablecoin bill. The legislation, which now heads to the President's desk, is considered the first major crypto-focused law in the United States. Ether's price reached its highest point since January, and ETFs tracking the cryptocurrency saw record inflows, surpassing those for Bitcoin. Analysts suggest this could signal a shift in market leadership from Bitcoin to Ethereum, bolstered by the new regulatory clarity. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The University of Michigan's latest Survey of Consumers indicates that fears of tariff-induced inflation are subsiding, with outlooks returning to levels seen before recent tariff announcements. The one-year inflation forecast dropped significantly to 4.4% from 5%, while the five-year outlook also declined. Despite this improvement, consumers still perceive a risk of future price increases, and the readings remain above their long-term averages. Economists view the trend as encouraging for the Federal Reserve, suggesting that inflation expectations are becoming better anchored. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the challenges and options for retirees on fixed Social Security incomes who are struggling with credit card debt. While being on Social Security does not disqualify individuals from debt relief, the suitability of programs like debt management, consolidation, or settlement depends on their specific financial situation. These programs evaluate income and expenses to determine eligibility and repayment capacity. The article suggests that options such as debt management plans or credit card company hardship programs can be particularly effective for those with limited, protected income from Social Security.</p>

          <p>In a difficult year for the airline industry, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are significantly outperforming their competitors, accounting for over 86% of the profits among the seven largest U.S. carriers. Analysts attribute their success to strong international networks, a focus on premium cabin sales, and robust loyalty programs, which help insulate them from weaker domestic demand and falling economy fares. While both airlines have trimmed their 2025 outlooks, their strategic emphasis on higher-margin travel allows them to navigate market challenges more effectively than rivals.

          <p>Andrea Gibson, the poet laureate of Colorado who died this week, is being remembered for a career built on accessible, emotional, and empathetic poetry. Gibson rose from the spoken-word scene to gain a large online following, using platforms like Instagram to share work that was direct and unabashedly focused on themes of love, anxiety, and gentleness. While sometimes criticized as "Instagram poetry," Gibson's style resonated with a broad audience, including those who did not typically read poetry. Their work valued the power of connection and used a public platform to spread a message of generosity and understanding.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 12:56:27 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK Home Office has announced that its spending on hotels for asylum seekers decreased by nearly a third in the last fiscal year, from £3 billion to £2.1 billion. This reduction was primarily achieved by moving individuals into cheaper accommodations, such as shared housing, and by renegotiating contracts. Despite the cost savings, the number of people in asylum hotels was higher in March 2025 than the previous summer, and experts warn that a recent surge in small boat crossings could increase reliance on hotels again. The report also noted financial losses from scrapping previous asylum housing plans.</p>

          <p>Following a sharp 8.5% drop in Abbott Laboratories' stock, some financial analysts are defending the company, calling the market's reaction "too punitive." The sell-off was triggered by a slight reduction in the company's growth outlook, which CEO Robert Ford described as an "overreaction" caused by a slower-than-expected recovery in its diagnostics business in China. Jefferies upgraded the stock to a "buy," viewing the current headwinds as temporary and highlighting the company's strong fundamentals and potential for future growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chevron has successfully completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation, a deal that gives it a major stake in Guyana's vast offshore oil reserves. The merger was finalized after an international arbitration panel ruled against Exxon Mobil, which had claimed a right of first refusal over Hess's assets in the lucrative Stabroek Block. Exxon, which leads the Guyana oil project, said it disagreed with the ruling but would respect the outcome and welcome Chevron to the venture. The resolution removes significant uncertainty that had been weighing on Chevron's stock performance.</p>

The investigation was launched over on-stage comments related to a band member's upcoming court case on a terror-related charge. After consulting with the Crown Prosecution Service, police concluded there was "insufficient evidence to provide a realistic prospect of conviction." The band, known for their pro-Palestinian stance and controversial statements, called the investigation an act of "political policing intimidation," asserting that no laws were broken.</p>
