          <p>The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily reduce the prices of some of its most popular drugs for American consumers. As part of the deal, these medications will be available at significant discounts on a new government-operated website called TrumpRx.gov. In exchange for this and a commitment to invest in U.S. manufacturing, Pfizer's products will receive a three-year exemption from potential pharmaceutical-specific tariffs. The company stated this move will help address the disproportionate costs Americans have paid for medical innovation.</p>

          <p>A group of former inmates is volunteering to help renovate Boston's historic Tremont Temple Baptist Church, America's first integrated church. For volunteers like Felipe Colon, who served 21 years in prison, the restoration work has provided a new sense of purpose and a chance to rebuild their lives. The project involves painstaking tasks such as reupholstering and reinstalling balcony chairs that date back to the 1890s. The pastor and volunteers see the church's renovation as a powerful symbol of personal reform and second chances, with the work expected to be completed in October.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has delivered a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, ruling that top officials violated the First Amendment by targeting pro-Palestinian international students for deportation. In a detailed decision, U.S. District Judge William Young found that the administration misused its authority to suppress constitutionally protected speech and create a chilling effect on student activism. The judge condemned the actions as a misuse of power intended to terrorize non-citizens into silence for expressing views the administration found unwelcome. He also criticized the use of masked ICE agents as a tactic to intimidate.</p>

          <p>India secured a 59-run victory over Sri Lanka in the opening match of the Women's World Cup, overcoming a significant mid-innings collapse. After losing four wickets for just four runs, a crucial 103-run partnership between Deepti Sharma and Amanjot Kaur revived the host nation's chances. Sharma also excelled with the ball, taking three wickets to help bowl Sri Lanka out for 211. The match, played in front of a record crowd for a group game, gives India a strong start as they pursue their first World Cup title in either the men's or women's format.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>When considering debt settlement, it is crucial to identify reputable companies to avoid potential scams. Trustworthy programs are typically accredited by professional organizations like the International Association of Professional Debt Arbitrators and have a transparent fee structure that prohibits charging upfront costs before services are rendered. A safe company will also provide honest communication about the inherent risks, such as potential damage to your credit score, and offer a realistic timeline of two to four years for the entire process. They must also handle funds through a federally insured account that the consumer controls.</p>

          <p>Investment personalities Jim Cramer and Warren Buffett present differing philosophies on the best approach for everyday investors. Buffett has long advocated for low-cost S&P 500 index funds, arguing they provide broad market access and historically outperform most actively managed funds over time. In contrast, Cramer suggests that while index funds should form about half of a portfolio, individuals can and should also research and select individual stocks in an effort to achieve above-average returns. Cramer believes anyone can learn to pick winning stocks and should not settle for simply matching the market's average performance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>DoorDash has introduced a new autonomous delivery robot named "Dot" on the streets of the Phoenix metro area. The red, five-foot-tall bots are designed to handle smaller orders more efficiently than a car, capable of carrying up to 30 pounds and traveling at speeds up to 20 miles per hour. According to the company, Dot is the first robot of its kind able to navigate bike lanes, roads, and sidewalks. An AI-powered platform determines which deliveries are best suited for the new autonomous system, marking a step forward in the future of local commerce.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. For an $80,000 HELOC, current estimates place the monthly payment at approximately $966 for a 10-year repayment period and $759 for a 15-year period. While these costs are lower than in previous months, homeowners should remember that HELOCs have variable interest rates. This means that future payments could fluctuate if the Federal Reserve adjusts rates again, making it important to plan for potential changes. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The widely misunderstood "7-year rule" for credit card debt has three main implications for consumers. Primarily, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, most negative information like unpaid debts must be removed from a credit report after seven years from the first delinquency. Secondly, this timeline often aligns with state statutes of limitations, which typically prevent creditors from suing to collect the debt after a similar period. However, it is crucial to understand that the debt itself does not vanish; collectors can still attempt to contact you for payment, even if legal options are off the table.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners considering a large home equity loan, a $200,000 loan currently translates to monthly payments of approximately $2,463 for a 10-year term or $1,936 for a 15-year term. These costs are slightly lower following recent Federal Reserve rate cuts, and the loan offers a fixed interest rate, providing payment predictability. However, taking on such a significant debt requires careful consideration, as the home serves as collateral, and failure to make payments can result in foreclosure. The viability of such a loan depends heavily on the individual's financial stability and equity position. (not investment advice)</p>

She advocates for abandoning grand resolutions in favor of "micro steps"—small, incremental changes that build healthier habits over time.
