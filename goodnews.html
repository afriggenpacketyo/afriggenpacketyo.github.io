          <p>The White House has announced plans to construct a new $200 million, 90,000-square-foot ballroom, with a capacity for 650 guests, to be completed before the end of President Trump's term. The project, described by Trump as his "gift to the country," will be funded by the president and other private "patriot donors" and will replace the current East Wing. This marks the first major structural change to the executive mansion since the Truman Balcony was added in 1948. The new venue aims to provide a more suitable space for large-scale events, which currently require the use of tents on the South Lawn.</p>

          <p>Following design software company Figma's highly successful initial public offering, its major venture capital backers, including Index Ventures and Sequoia, are holding stock collectively worth around $24 billion. The company's shares surged 250% on their first day of trading, pushing its market capitalization to nearly $68 billion, a significant increase from the $20 billion acquisition price offered by Adobe in a deal that later collapsed due to regulatory concerns. This event marks a bright spot for the tech IPO market, which has been subdued since late 2021, providing substantial paper returns for early investors. (not investment advice)</p>

The Houston Astros reacquired former star Carlos Correa from the Twins to play third base, while the New York Yankees overhauled their struggling bullpen by adding three new relievers, including All-Stars David Bednar and Camilo Doval. The New York Mets also bolstered their bullpen and acquired center fielder Cedric Mullins, and the San Diego Padres were particularly aggressive, trading for seven new players.

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from terminating Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for approximately 60,000 immigrants from Honduras, Nicaragua, and Nepal. The ruling postpones the expirations, which were set to begin in August, until a hearing can be held in November. In her decision, Judge Trina Thompson criticized the administration, stating its actions appeared to be based on a "preordained determination to end the TPS program" rather than an objective review of country conditions. Most of the affected individuals have resided in the U.S. for over two decades.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell reveals that the modern potato evolved from a tomato ancestor approximately 9 million years ago through an ancient interbreeding event. Scientists analyzed hundreds of genomes from both cultivated and wild potatoes to solve the long-standing puzzle of the vegetable's origin. The research indicates that a crucial gene from the ancient tomato, which promotes tuber formation, combined with a gene from a wild potato-like species that controls stem growth. This hybridization was essential for creating the starch-rich tubers characteristic of the potatoes we consume today.</p>

          <p>Following a disappointing penalty shootout loss to Mazatlán, Los Angeles FC (LAFC) faces a must-win situation against Pachuca in the 2025 Leagues Cup to keep their tournament hopes alive. The annual competition features teams from both Major League Soccer and Mexico's Liga MX, with only four teams from each league advancing to the quarterfinals. LAFC's coach, Steve Cherundolo, is expected to field his strongest lineup after resting key players in the previous match. Meanwhile, Pachuca enters the game with momentum after a victory over San Diego, making this a decisive contest for both clubs at BMO Stadium.</p>

          <p>Apple announced a solid fiscal third quarter with a 10% year-over-year revenue increase to $94.04 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by record iPhone sales and a growing services division, with the company setting new revenue records in over 24 countries. Despite the positive results, the stock's modest rise was tempered by a continued lack of specific details regarding its artificial intelligence strategy, an area of intense focus for investors. While CEO Tim Cook reaffirmed the company's commitment to AI, the market appears to be waiting for a clearer roadmap before fully embracing the stock's future potential. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon reported second-quarter results that surpassed analyst expectations for both revenue and profit, driven by strong performance in its e-commerce and advertising divisions. Despite the overall positive report, the company's stock fell in after-hours trading due to a smaller-than-hoped-for revenue beat from its cloud unit, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and mixed guidance for the third quarter. The article notes that while AWS growth slightly accelerated, it didn't match the impressive figures reported by rivals. Management reaffirmed its commitment to investing heavily in AI infrastructure, citing access to power as a significant supply constraint. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a new initiative to increase social diversity within its ranks, the UK government will restrict its main civil service internship scheme exclusively to university students from lower socio-economic backgrounds. The policy change, driven by minister Pat McFadden, aims to make the civil service more reflective of the country it serves. The assessment of a student's background will be based on their parents' occupations when the student was 14. Successful interns from the program will also be prioritized for entry into the Fast Stream, the primary graduate recruitment program for the civil service.</p>
