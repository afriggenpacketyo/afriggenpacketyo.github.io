          <p>Financial experts suggest that a comfortable retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement earnings, though the actual amount varies significantly based on location and lifestyle. The article notes that the median retirement income in the U.S. is around $47,000 annually, which may be insufficient in high-cost areas. To supplement savings and Social Security, it explores strategies for creating guaranteed income streams. Options discussed include purchasing annuities, utilizing reverse mortgages for homeowners over 62, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The massive $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot is driving a significant increase in business for lottery courier services, particularly Jackpocket, which is owned by DraftKings. The company reported a 130% day-over-day increase in ticket sales on its platform, with 15 million Powerball tickets ordered during the current jackpot run. This surge highlights the strategic value of DraftKings' acquisition of Jackpocket, which it uses to cross-sell customers to its primary sports betting and iGaming offerings. The high demand underscores the widespread public enthusiasm for the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Powerball jackpot approaches $1.7 billion, potential winners face significant tax liabilities that vary by state. Regardless of the payout option chosen—a lump sum or a 30-year annuity—a mandatory 24% federal tax is withheld upfront, with winners likely owing more at tax time under the top 37% bracket. The article provides a breakdown of how state income taxes further reduce the take-home amount. However, eight states, including Florida, Texas, and California, do not tax lottery winnings, offering the largest possible after-tax prize for residents in those locations.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has surprise-released "Swag II," a 23-track album that serves as a follow-up to his July release, "Swag." The new record continues his exploration of indie rock and '80s R&B sounds, a departure from his earlier pop and EDM work but consistent with albums like "Journals" and "Changes." The album features collaborations with artists such as Tems, Lil B, and Hurricane Chris, and was created with many of the same producers from its predecessor. Thematically, the article notes that Bieber continues to focus on marriage, fatherhood, and religion in his lyrics.</p>

          <p>English pace bowler Matthew Potts is back in consideration for the upcoming Ashes tour after being released from the T20 squad for the Ireland series. This move allows him to play in the County Championship for Durham, giving him a chance to prove his red-ball form. Potts had been a regular in the Test team but was recently overlooked. However, with another bowler's retirement from red-ball cricket and injury concerns for Chris Woakes, a spot in the Ashes squad has opened up, potentially reigniting Potts' Test career.</p>

          <p>McLaren driver Lando Norris recorded the fastest lap during Friday's practice sessions for the Italian Grand Prix at Monza. His performance puts him in a strong position for a crucial race weekend where he needs to close the 34-point gap to his teammate, Oscar Piastri, in the championship standings. Norris finished just ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc, with Carlos Sainz of Williams in third. Piastri, who missed the first practice session, secured the fourth-fastest time, setting the stage for an intense intra-team battle.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With global equities at all-time highs, financial experts are advising investors to protect their significant portfolio gains by re-evaluating their risk exposure. A key concern is the heavy concentration of mega-cap tech stocks in major indices like the S&P 500, which could make portfolios vulnerable if the market shifts. Analysts suggest that now is an opportune time to diversify by moving some capital from recent winners into undervalued sectors. This strategic shift aims to insulate returns from potential economic headwinds, such as a weakening labor market or changes in Federal Reserve policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have continued their downward trend, with the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage dropping to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, which is widely expected at its next meeting. The cooling 10-year Treasury yield has also contributed to the more favorable borrowing costs for homebuyers. The article advises prospective buyers to act strategically by checking their credit, getting pre-approved, and calculating their budget to take advantage of the lower rates before competition increases.

          <p>The Trump administration is set to issue an executive order that will allow the U.S. to impose penalties on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The new measure establishes a formal designation for "state sponsors of wrongful detention," similar to the existing list for state sponsors of terrorism. This will provide the State Department with tools to sanction offending nations and potentially restrict U.S. passport use for travel to those countries. The order aims to deter hostage-taking and increase pressure on foreign governments to release Americans currently held as political leverage.</p>

          <p>In her upcoming memoir, "Listening to the Law," Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett reflects on the difficult decision to accept her nomination to the high court in 2020. She describes the intense public scrutiny and loss of privacy she and her family faced during a previous consideration, which made her hesitant to repeat the experience. Barrett reveals that she and her husband agreed to proceed only if they could "burn the boats," a commitment to forge ahead without second-guessing their choice. Ultimately, she accepted the nomination out of a sense of duty to the rule of law.</p>

          <p>Tesla's board has proposed a new long-term compensation plan for Elon Musk that could be worth over $1 trillion if he achieves a series of extremely ambitious goals over the next decade. To earn the full award, Musk must increase Tesla's market value eightfold to $8.5 trillion and meet operational milestones, including selling millions of vehicles and humanoid robots. The plan, which offers no salary or bonus, is designed to retain Musk and incentivize him to lead the company through its next growth phase. Some analysts have criticized the proposal's immense scale, questioning if any individual is worth that much.</p>
