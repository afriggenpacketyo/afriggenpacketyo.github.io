          <p>Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party was unsuccessful in its bid to win mayoral seats in three runoff elections in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Candidates from the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) defeated their AfD opponents in Gelsenkirchen, Duisburg, and Hagen. Despite these losses in executive races, preliminary results indicate that the AfD's overall share of the vote in local councils nearly tripled to 14.5%. The outcome is seen as a relief by mainstream parties concerned about the AfD's growing influence.</p>

          <h2>Internal Conflict May Have Caused Collapse of Ancient Sanxingdui Civilization, Scholar Suggests</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New archaeological research suggests that China's ancient Sanxingdui civilization may have collapsed due to a violent internal conflict. A leading scholar proposes that a war for control of the capital city led to a mass exodus and the destruction of key infrastructure, including city walls and religious sites. This theory offers a new explanation for the mysterious disappearance of the Shu kingdom, which dates back around 4,500 years. The Sanxingdui ruins, located in southwestern China, are considered one of the most significant archaeological finds of the 20th century, providing crucial insights into early Chinese civilization.</p>

          <p>Country music icon Dolly Parton has postponed her upcoming Las Vegas residency by nearly a year due to ongoing "health challenges." The 79-year-old singer announced that her doctors have advised her to undergo a few medical procedures, which will prevent her from having adequate rehearsal time for the shows. Parton recently had to cancel an appearance at Dollywood after being diagnosed with a kidney stone that led to an infection. She reassured fans that she is not quitting the music business and has rescheduled the six-date run for September 2026.</p>

Donald's strategy involved deep statistical analysis, early team arrival for acclimatization, and fostering a quiet confidence among the players. His attention to detail, from analyzing player pairings to ensuring optimal hotel conditions, created an environment that players and analysts say was instrumental in securing the rare away win.</p>

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is set to announce a new government initiative aimed at abolishing long-term youth unemployment. The plan will offer a guaranteed paid work placement to every young person who has been out of work or education for 18 months. Those who refuse the offer without a valid reason could face sanctions, including the loss of their benefits. The scheme builds on a previous "youth guarantee" and will be funded from existing budgets, with details to be finalized in the upcoming November Budget. Business organizations have expressed initial support for the proposal.</p>

          <p>China has announced that a crucial Communist Party plenum will be held in October to discuss and endorse the country's 15th five-year plan, which will cover the years 2026-2030. The decision was made at a Politburo meeting chaired by President Xi Jinping, where a draft of the plan was reviewed. The meeting's summary emphasized familiar principles such as developing "new quality productive forces" through high-tech innovation and strengthening leadership to manage potential "worst-case scenario" risks. The plan will be formally approved by the national legislature next March.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-29 02:15:10 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is introducing a new "K visa" program this week, aimed at attracting young foreign graduates in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The initiative is designed to bolster China's tech sector and is timed as the U.S. increases fees for its H-1B worker visas to $100,000 per year. A key feature of the K visa is that it does not require a sponsoring employer, removing a significant hurdle present in the U.S. system. This move is part of Beijing's broader effort to present itself as open to foreign talent and investment amid ongoing geopolitical and trade tensions.</p>

          <p>Moldova's pro-European Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS), led by President Maia Sandu, is set for a decisive victory in parliamentary elections, securing a new majority. The party gained around 50% of the vote, well ahead of the pro-Russian opposition bloc, in a vote seen as crucial for the nation's path toward European Union membership. President Sandu had warned of "massive Russian interference" in the election, and the day was marked by bomb scares and arrests of individuals suspected of plotting unrest. The result solidifies the government's mandate to pursue further integration with the EU.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police is consulting on a new policy that would require its officers and staff to declare if they are members of the Freemasons. The proposal follows a recommendation from the Daniel Morgan Independent Panel report, which found that officers' membership in the secretive fraternity had been a source of suspicion in the unsolved murder investigation. The force stated that concerns have been raised about the potential impact of such memberships on investigations, promotions, and misconduct proceedings, which could compromise impartiality or create a conflict of loyalties.</p>

          <p>In a dramatic Sunday night NFL game, the Dallas Cowboys and Green Bay Packers ended in a 40-40 tie after a back-and-forth offensive battle.

Quarterbacks Dak Prescott and Jordan Love each threw for three touchdowns. The result marked the second-highest scoring tie in NFL history and was a memorable conclusion to a game hyped for the return of star pass rusher Micah Parsons to Dallas after being traded to the Packers.</p>

          <p>The United States has deployed a new advanced air defense system, the Indirect Fire Protection Capability (IFPC), to one of its bases in South Korea. The mobile, ground-based system is designed to intercept threats such as cruise missiles, drones, and rockets, functioning similarly to Israel's Iron Dome. The deployment is seen as a direct response to the evolving military capabilities of North Korea and as a strategic signal to China. This marks the first known instance of the U.S. stationing such a system at an overseas base, enhancing the defense posture of American forces in the region.</p>
