        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article delves into the reasons behind the apparent rise in autism diagnoses, exploring whether there are genuinely more autistic individuals or if changes in diagnostic criteria and increased awareness are the primary drivers. The piece highlights that the definition of autism has broadened over time, encompassing a wider range of individuals, including women and adults who were previously undiagnosed. It also addresses concerns about the potential for glamorizing autism in the media while acknowledging the challenges faced by families with non-speaking autistic children, noting the diversity within the autistic community and the tensions surrounding its definition.</p>

          <p>This article reports on allegations that Jordon Hudson, Bill Belichick's girlfriend, has been exerting influence over his career decisions. She reportedly "forced her way" into a Dunkin' Super Bowl commercial and demanded to be an executive producer on HBO's "Hard Knocks" when Belichick was being considered as head coach of UNC. Hudson allegedly asked NFL Films for "dailies of the proposed show" and said executives needed to "treat her with respect or they wouldn‚Äôt get to use the coach‚Äôs ‚ÄòIP.‚Äô" The report suggests Hudson's involvement extends to communications with UNC staff.</p>

          <p>Singapore is holding elections amidst global economic challenges, with the People's Action Party (P.A.P.) widely expected to maintain its long-standing rule. The election will serve as a test of the P.A.P.'s popularity, particularly regarding its response to the rising cost of living and declining housing affordability. The opposition is gaining traction, with rallies drawing large crowds, but the P.A.P. emphasizes its track record of stability and prosperity. The election also marks a transition in leadership, with Prime Minister Lawrence Wong taking office last year.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to halt efforts to freeze funds to Maine schools, resolving a dispute over the state's support of transgender rights.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have developed an "unparalleled" antivenom using antibodies from the blood of Tim Friede, a man who deliberately injected himself with snake venom for nearly two decades. The antibodies have shown protection against fatal doses from a wide range of snake species in animal tests. Current antivenoms are specific to individual snake species, but Friede's mission could lead to a universal antivenom. Researchers identified two broadly neutralizing antibodies that target neurotoxins and combined them with a drug, resulting in an antivenom cocktail that protected mice against multiple venomous snakes.</p>
