        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Credit card debt forgiveness is often used interchangeably with debt settlement, but it's important to understand the nuances. Credit card debt forgiveness can occur through debt settlement, bankruptcy, or a debt management program. Qualifying typically requires a debt balance of $5,000 to $10,000, being behind on payments, and demonstrating financial hardship. Borrowers should carefully review all debt relief options and understand the qualifications to make an informed decision about regaining financial freedom (not investment advice).</p>

The initial ruling centered on Trump's use of the International Economic Emergency Powers Act as justification for tariffs.
