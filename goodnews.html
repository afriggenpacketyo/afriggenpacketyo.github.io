          <p>Following a meeting at the UN General Assembly, U.S. President Donald Trump indicated a significant change in his perspective on the war in Ukraine. In a social media post, he suggested that Ukraine, with European support, could win back all its original territory, a departure from his previous skepticism. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy praised the meeting as productive and described Trump as "well-informed," viewing the pivot as a potential "game changer." However, reactions in Ukraine and among analysts remain cautiously optimistic, emphasizing that concrete actions must follow the rhetorical shift.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, prospective homebuyers are advised to carefully consider the current economic landscape before entering the market. With mortgage rates near a three-year low, it is crucial for buyers to determine the actual interest rate they qualify for based on their credit history, as this can vary significantly. The article suggests exploring alternatives like mortgage points or adjustable-rate mortgages to secure even lower rates. It also cautions that waiting for further rate drops is risky, as historical trends show rates can rise unexpectedly. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A growing number of retired professional athletes and coaches are transitioning from sports to politics by running for seats in the U.S. Congress in the 2026 midterm elections. Notable candidates include former Yankees first baseman Mark Teixeira, former NFL kicker Jay Feely, and former college football coach Derek Dooley. While name recognition can be an advantage, a successful sports career does not guarantee electoral victory, as demonstrated by several recent high-profile losses by former athletes. These candidates are following in the footsteps of predecessors who successfully made the leap from sports arenas to Capitol Hill.</p>

Some, like comedian Robin Weiss with her "Kugelahs Kugbook," are modernizing classic dishes to connect with their heritage and honor ancestors who survived the Holocaust. Meanwhile, historic recipes like the Manischewitz matzo ball remain staples, preserved in museums and family kitchens. Restaurants are also participating by featuring cherished family recipes on their menus. This blend of old and new reflects a broader trend of rediscovering and sharing diverse Jewish culinary histories for the holiday.</p>

          <h2>Calculating Monthly Costs for an $80,000 Home Equity Loan After Recent Rate Reductions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-24 13:28:41 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners considering tapping into their home's value, the cost of an $80,000 home equity loan has become slightly more affordable following recent interest rate cuts. With a fixed rate, monthly payments are predictable; for example, a 10-year loan at 8.43% would cost approximately $989 per month. While current rates are marginally lower than earlier in the year, the difference is not dramatic enough to make it an automatic choice for all borrowers. The article advises homeowners to carefully calculate their potential savings and compare options before committing to a loan. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Lawsuit Against Hershey Alleging Deceptive Halloween Candy Packaging is Dismissed</h2>

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed a class-action lawsuit filed against The Hershey Company that claimed its Halloween-themed Reese's candies were deceptively packaged. The plaintiffs argued that the wrappers depicted detailed, spooky designs, such as faces on ghosts and pumpkins, which were absent on the actual unwrapped chocolates. The judge ruled that the consumers failed to demonstrate they suffered economic harm, as the candy was not rendered worthless by the lack of artistic detail. The judge noted the issue boiled down to subjective expectations about the product's appearance rather than a tangible loss.</p>

          <p>New research has found that advanced artificial intelligence models are now capable of passing all three levels of the rigorous Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) exam, including the difficult essay-based Level III. The study showed that frontier large language models could complete mock exams in minutes, a task that typically requires humans around 1,000 hours of study over several years. While this demonstrates a significant leap in AI's analytical reasoning for financial decision-making, experts believe the technology will transform the industry rather than replace human analysts. Human context and intent remain critical skills that AI currently cannot replicate.</p>

          <p>Maurice Hastings, a 72-year-old man who was exonerated after spending 38 years in prison for a 1983 murder he did not commit, has received a $25 million settlement from the City of Inglewood, California. His conviction was overturned in 2022 after new DNA evidence not only cleared him but also identified a different suspect, who has since died. A lawsuit demonstrated that an Inglewood detective had falsified evidence and buried information that supported Hastings' alibi. The settlement is believed to be the largest for a wrongful conviction in California's history.</p>

          <p>The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved a proposal to remove the $25,000 minimum equity rule for pattern day traders, a move that would make active trading more accessible for investors with smaller accounts. The rule, established in 2001 during the dot-com bubble, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain this minimum balance. It will be replaced with an intraday margin rule based on the positions taken during the day. The change, which now awaits SEC approval, reflects the evolution of technology and market access for retail investors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Census data, sales of newly built homes surged by a much larger-than-expected 20.5% in August, reaching their highest level since early 2022. This significant one-month gain occurred even before the recent decline in mortgage rates, suggesting that builder incentives and price cuts may have been a primary catalyst. However, economists caution that the data is often volatile and prone to revisions, so the magnitude of the increase may be overstated. The strong sales reduced the inventory of new homes, while housing starts and permits actually slowed during the month. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Beachgoers in Texas have recently encountered multiple "pink meanie" jellyfish, a large and rarely seen species, washed up on the shore. These jellyfish, scientifically known as Drymonema larsoni, can have tentacles reaching up to 70 feet and weigh over 50 pounds. They are named for their bright pink color and primarily feed on the smaller, more common moon jellyfish. First identified as a distinct species in 2011, pink meanies thrive in warm waters and are also found in the Mediterranean and around South Africa. While they do sting, the sensation is reported to be relatively mild.</p>

          <p>On CNBC's "Morning Meeting," investment personality Jim Cramer identified Boeing as his "favorite stock" in his charitable trust's portfolio. His endorsement follows recent efforts by U.S. lawmakers to include Boeing aircraft orders in a trade deal with China and a new partnership with Palantir to integrate AI into its defense and space operations. Cramer noted that the stock's recent pullback of roughly 10% from its highs presents a good opportunity for investors to build a position in the company. The next key catalyst for the aerospace giant would be receiving FAA approval to increase production. (not investment advice)</p>
