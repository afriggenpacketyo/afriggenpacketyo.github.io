          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has charged two Chinese nationals in California for orchestrating an illegal scheme to ship millions of dollars' worth of advanced AI chips, including Nvidia's controlled H100 GPUs, to China. The individuals allegedly used their company, ALX Solutions, to export the sensitive technology without the required licenses, circumventing U.S. export controls designed to limit China's access to high-end semiconductors. Investigators uncovered communications detailing plans to route shipments through Malaysia to conceal their final destination. This case highlights ongoing U.S. efforts to prevent the illicit transfer of critical technology.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A debate is underway among Chinese economists regarding whether to include specific, measurable consumption targets in the country's upcoming 15th five-year plan. Proponents, such as Chang Xiuze from the Academy of Macroeconomic Research, argue for establishing a "household consumption rate" as a key national indicator to boost domestic demand, noting China's rate was a low 39.6% in 2023. However, other influential thinkers express skepticism, questioning the operational feasibility of setting such metrics as official policy goals, highlighting a key point of contention in shaping China's future economic strategy.

          <p>Advanced Micro Devices reported mixed second-quarter financial results, with revenue of $7.69 billion exceeding analyst expectations, yet adjusted earnings per share of 48 cents fell just shy of projections. The company's data center segment grew 14% annually, driven by demand for both AI chips and traditional CPUs, though AI revenue was impacted by U.S. export restrictions on sales to China. While the client and gaming division saw strong growth of 69%, AMD's stock declined in after-hours trading following the announcement and a third-quarter sales forecast that was weaker than anticipated.

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from repurposing over $4 billion in FEMA funds originally designated for natural disaster mitigation. The ruling responds to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued that the administration's termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program was unlawful. The judge found that reallocating the money could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone communities that rely on the funding for critical infrastructure projects. The administration is now blocked from redirecting the funds while the court considers the case further.</p>

The project, which targets one of the world's largest untapped copper deposits, had been stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban government announced a switch from open-pit to more costly underground mining to better protect the historical relics at the site, signaling a renewed push to develop the nation's mineral resources with Chinese investment.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murders and a 4.5% fall in overall violent crime. Property crime also saw a significant 8.1% decline, with motor vehicle thefts falling by a record 18.6% for a single year. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, reflects a continuing downward trend from the spike seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts note that while the numbers are promising, some categories like aggravated assault remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new law requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The measure aims to protect vulnerable tenants from the increasing danger of extreme heat waves driven by climate change. Set to take effect next month with enforcement beginning in 2027, the ordinance applies to both new and old buildings. Officials are encouraging landlords to use passive cooling methods like blackout curtains and reflective roofing, in addition to air conditioning, to comply with the new public health standard.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research based on 20 years of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park shows that female mountain gorillas intentionally seek out familiar females when they move to a new social group. Scientists found that even after years of separation, a dispersing female will gravitate toward others she grew up with or had a recent social connection with. This behavior highlights the crucial importance of female-female relationships in gorilla society, as having an ally helps a newcomer navigate the social hierarchy and potential aggression from resident females. The findings provide new insight into the evolutionary roots of social decision-making.</p>

          <p>Despite significant advances in technology that have made short-term forecasts over 90% accurate, public perception of weather forecasting often remains skeptical. Meteorologists face the challenge of communicating vast amounts of complex data, which is subject to "Chaos Theory," where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. The future of forecasting lies in AI, which can process historical data to predict weather further in advance, and in providing more impact-based predictions. However, experts note that communicating uncertainty and predicting unprecedented climate events will remain key challenges for human forecasters.</p>
