        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mounjaro, a weight loss injection initially licensed for type 2 diabetes, is now available via prescription from general practitioners in England, but only for individuals meeting specific criteria, such as a BMI of 40 or over and the presence of multiple related health conditions. NHS England plans a staggered rollout to manage GP workload and resources, with some practices warning ineligible patients against booking appointments for the drug. Pharmacy organizations express concerns about supply meeting demand, while healthcare staff require training for safe and appropriate administration, including monthly check-ups for patients. Mounjaro has been available in specialist NHS weight loss clinics since March, and other weight loss services remain available to those who do not meet the criteria. The article provides context on the criteria and timeframe for wider availability. The optimism score is based on the potential positive impact of the drug, balanced against the limitations and challenges of its rollout.</p>

          <p>Following America's attacks on Iran, the UK government has made it known that while it was informed in advance, it did not participate in the strikes. The UK has repeatedly called for de-escalation, and there were internal questions about the legality of involvement. The decision by Washington to act alone meant that the UK did not have to make a difficult decision on whether to authorize US warplanes to use UK military bases. Depending on Iran's response, the UK's position and its relationship with the U.S. could face further challenges.

          <p>Prime Minister Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party experienced a record-low result in Sunday's Tokyo assembly election, a race seen as a prelude to July's House of Councillors election. Tomin First no Kai, a regional party established by Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, won the most seats in the metropolitan assembly. The LDP's losses are attributed to a political funding scandal and indicate a shift in voter sentiment ahead of the national election. The results are expected to further strain the Prime Minister's minority government in national politics.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called on China to prevent Iran from closing the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial trade route for crude oil. China is Iran's most important oil customer and maintains friendly relations with the Islamic Republic.

          <p>China has become the world leader in electric vehicles (EVs) through long-term planning, government subsidies, and a focus on dominating future technologies. The country's leadership laid out plans to dominate the technologies of the future. Chinese brands struggled to compete with established European, American, and Japanese car makers in the petrol car market, so they changed the game by moving to electrics. This combination of long-term planning and government funding also allowed China to dominate critical supply chains in battery production. The country has also built the world's largest public charging network. The optimism score is based on the potential for a global transition to sustainable transportation, balanced against concerns about unfair business practices.</p>

          <p>Real Madrid coach Xabi Alonso says he has ‚Äúzero tolerance‚Äù for racism after Antonio R√ºdiger said he was a victim of abuse during their 3-1 win against Mexican side Pachuca at the Club World Cup on Sunday. It was not immediately clear whether the alleged abuse came from the crowd or an opponent. Fifa has yet to comment on the allegations. The article also summarizes the game, in which Jude Bellingham and Arda G√ºler scored late in the first half to help 10-man Real Madrid to a victory. The optimism score reflects the potential for addressing racism in sports, balanced against the persistence of prejudice.</p>

          <p>A magistrate judge in Tennessee has denied the government's motion to detain Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the mistakenly deported Salvadoran native who was brought back to the United States earlier this month. In her order on Sunday, U.S. Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes said the court "will give Abrego the due process that he is guaranteed." Judge Holmes scheduled a hearing for Wednesday to review the conditions of release. Abrego Garcia faces criminal charges for allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. The optimism score reflects the potential for justice and due process, balanced against the complexities of immigration law.</p>

          <h2>Republican Representative's Ectopic Pregnancy Highlights Abortion Law Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 18:42:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Florida Republican congresswoman, Kat Cammack, is blaming fearmongering on the left for the reluctance of hospital staff to give her the drugs she needed to end an ectopic pregnancy that threatened her life. Doctors were worried about losing their licenses or going to jail if they did. Cammack looked up the state law on her phone to show staff and even attempted to contact the governor‚Äôs office. Hours later, doctors eventually agreed to give her the medication. The optimism score reflects the potential for common ground on reproductive health issues, balanced against the polarization of abortion politics.</p>
