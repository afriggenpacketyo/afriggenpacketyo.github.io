        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new robot named HARR-E, developed by Oshkosh Corp., aims to revolutionize residential waste management by providing an on-demand trash pickup service. Users can summon the autonomous robot via an app, and it will travel from a central hub to their home to collect garbage before returning to unload and recharge. The system is designed for planned communities and business parks, promising benefits such as reduced noise pollution, cleaner streets, and lower emissions compared to traditional garbage trucks. The concept recently won a CES Picks Award, signaling significant industry interest.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Filippo Ganna won the shortened 18th stage of the Vuelta a Espana, an individual time trial that was reduced in length due to security concerns over pro-Palestinian protests. The race saw heightened police presence as hundreds of protestors lined the route. In the general classification battle, second-place rider Joao Almeida gained 10 seconds on overall leader Jonas Vingegaard, narrowing the gap to 40 seconds with two competitive stages remaining. Britain's Tom Pidcock finished third on the stage, extending his advantage in the battle for a final podium spot.</p>

          <p>Golfer Patrick Reed has voiced his opposition to the decision to pay American players for their participation in the upcoming Ryder Cup, calling the move "unnecessary." U.S. players will receive a $200,000 stipend in addition to a mandatory charitable donation, a departure from the tradition of playing for national pride. Reed, a former Ryder Cup standout, compared the event to the Olympics, stating that no dollar amount should be attached to representing one's country. He also commented on the strong camaraderie among European players, suggesting it gives them an advantage over the American team.</p>

          <p>Based on recent inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could receive a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) of around 2.7% in 2026, a slight increase from the 2.5% boost in 2025. This would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54. However, the article notes that this increase may be offset by rising costs for other essentials, particularly Medicare premiums, which are also projected to increase significantly. The official COLA will be announced in October after the final month of inflation data is calculated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is launching an inquiry into seven major technology companies, including Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and Snap, over the potential negative effects of their AI chatbots on children and teenagers. The agency is seeking information on how these companies evaluate the safety of chatbots that can simulate human-like relationships and act as companions for young users. The probe will examine issues such as data monetization, the use of personal information, and the steps taken to mitigate harmful impacts.

          <p>Jim Cramer's CNBC Investing Club has announced the purchase of 50 shares of Honeywell, citing expectations that the industrial company will benefit from anticipated interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. The move comes as the market rallies on the latest inflation and jobless claims data, which have increased the likelihood of monetary easing. The club believes lower rates could stimulate economic activity, boosting Honeywell's performance. The article also notes that if not for trading restrictions, the club would trim its position in Broadcom to lock in recent gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has entered an agreement with Ukraine to scale up the production of a Ukrainian-developed interceptor drone that has proven highly effective against Russian Shahed drones. Under the deal, Ukraine will share the intellectual property, and the U.K. will further develop and manufacture thousands of the drones per month for delivery back to Ukraine. The drones are said to cost a fraction of the Russian systems they are designed to destroy. The partnership aims to leverage Ukrainian innovation and British manufacturing capabilities to provide a cost-effective counter to a key threat on the battlefield.</p>

          <p>An opinion column details a six-step morning protocol designed to manage negative emotions, particularly for those who feel worst in the early hours of the day. The routine, based on neuroscience and behavioral science, includes rising before dawn, vigorous physical exercise, and a period of metaphysical practice like meditation or prayer. It also involves strategically timing caffeine intake, consuming a protein-rich first meal to boost serotonin, and dedicating the first hours of work to an activity that induces a state of "flow." The author suggests this structured approach can significantly improve daily well-being.</p>

          <p>A French parliamentary commission has recommended banning children under 15 from social media and implementing a "digital curfew" for those aged 15 to 18. The inquiry, which focused on the psychological effects of TikTok, described the platform as a "production line of distress" that exposes young people to harmful and addictive content. The recommendations also include banning mobile phones in schools and creating a crime of "digital negligence" for parents. The move reflects a growing trend in Europe to regulate children's access to social media, with similar measures being considered in other countries.</p>
