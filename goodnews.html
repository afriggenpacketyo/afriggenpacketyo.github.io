          <h2>Shenzhen's Export Levels Lag Behind National Growth Amid US Tariff Tensions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-23 04:59:05 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shenzhen, China's leading exporter, experienced a 2.9% year-on-year drop in exports in April, contrasting with the nation's 8.1% growth. This suggests ongoing vulnerability to trade tensions with the US, according to municipal customs data. Peng Peng, head of the Guangdong Society of Reform, noted Shenzhen's export performance was volatile in the first four months of the year. Shenzhen's economy, heavily reliant on foreign trade, faces unpredictability and limited policy options amidst global trade turbulence. The decline was primarily driven by an 8.3% decrease in general trade, impacting the city's role as China's Silicon Valley, home to tech giants like Huawei and BYD.</p>

          <p>The German Federal Statistics Office (Destatis) reported that Europe's leading economy experienced a 0.4% growth in the first quarter of 2025, compared to the fourth quarter of 2024.

          <p>Apple has raised trade-in values for iPhones in China to boost demand in a key market facing increased competition. The iPhone 15 Pro Max trade-in value increased to 5,700 yuan ($791), while the iPhone 15 Pro rose to 4,750 yuan. This move signals Apple's continued efforts to stimulate sales amidst declining market share and competition from local rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. In the first quarter, Apple's China shipments fell 8% year-on-year, and its market share decreased from 15% to 13%. Apple also faces supply chain concerns and potential tariffs on electronics.</p>

          <p>Energy regulator Ofgem announced that energy bills in England, Scotland, and Wales will fall by 7% in July, marking the first decrease in a year. This translates to a ¬£129 annual saving for a typical household using gas and electricity. However, charities emphasize that many people still struggle to pay their bills, with collective customer debt to suppliers reaching ¬£4 billion. While cheaper bills are welcome, the drop is expected to be minimal by October, and high debt levels remain a significant challenge for many households.</p>

          <p>The US Mint is preparing to halt the production of pennies following a directive from President Donald Trump, who deemed the coin "so wasteful." The decision is expected to save the US Treasury $56 million annually in material costs. Made from zinc with a copper coating, the penny has been a staple since 1792, with around 114 billion currently in circulation. Advocates for eliminating the penny cite its high production cost and limited utility, while others argue for its usefulness in charity drives. Congress must legislate that prices be rounded up in order to eliminate demand for the coin.</p>
