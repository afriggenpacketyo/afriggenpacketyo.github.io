          <p>Australia has become the first country to lift all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, a move estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, revoke previous bans on sexually active gay and bisexual men donating blood and plasma. While blood donation rules will be updated in 2026, plasma donation rules take effect in July, allowing people in monogamous relationships of six months or more to donate, regardless of gender or sexuality. This decision aims to increase plasma supplies amid rising global demand, while research indicates the changes will not impact blood and plasma safety.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with signing bonuses as high as $100 million, along with substantial annual compensation packages. Despite Meta's aggressive poaching efforts, Altman stated that none of OpenAI's top talent has accepted the offers. This comes as Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seeks to build a leading artificial intelligence team for the company's "superintelligence" AI lab. Meta's efforts underscore the intense competition for AI talent and the perceived rivalry between the two tech giants.</p>
