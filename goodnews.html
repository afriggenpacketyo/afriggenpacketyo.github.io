          <p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has withdrawn its appeal against a judge's ruling that permitted the KalshiEx exchange to offer betting contracts on the outcomes of U.S. political elections. Kalshi CEO Tarek Mansour hailed this as a victory for prediction markets, while financial reform advocates criticized the decision as a betrayal of public interest, arguing it could threaten election integrity. The agreement stipulates that both parties will cover their own costs, and Kalshi will relinquish all legal claims related to the case. Donald Trump Jr. serves as a strategic advisor for Kalshi, which currently offers contracts on various political events.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump falsely claimed that gasoline prices have fallen below $2 per gallon, urging the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. The national average gas price is actually $3.165 per gallon, according to AAA. Trump's claim likely references RBOB gasoline futures, which did touch $1.98 per gallon, but this figure doesn't reflect retail prices as it excludes taxes, transportation, and other costs. GasBuddy's head of petroleum analysis emphasizes that RBOB prices are irrelevant to consumers, as they don't represent what drivers pay at the pump.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump‚Äôs administration is continuing to defend US rules easing access to the abortion drug mifepristone, mirroring the legal stance taken by the previous Biden administration. The Justice Department filed a brief urging a Texas federal court to dismiss a lawsuit by Republican-led states challenging the FDA's easing of restrictions on mifepristone. While the filing doesn't address the merits of the case, it signals the Trump administration is not dropping the government's defense of the drug, despite Trump's previous statements on abortion. The states argue they have standing to sue because their Medicaid programs may incur costs from treating complications related to mifepristone use.</p>
