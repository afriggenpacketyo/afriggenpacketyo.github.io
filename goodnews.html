          <h2>House Passes Domestic Policy Bill After Representative Misses Vote</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The House narrowly passed President Trump's domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, by a single vote. Speaker Mike Johnson humorously mentioned that Representative Andrew Garbarino missed the vote because he fell asleep, despite his crucial role in negotiations. Garbarino stated he was moments away from the House floor when the vote closed, emphasizing his efforts to lift the cap on SALT deductions for Long Island families. The bill, which includes raising the SALT deduction cap to $40,000 for certain incomes, now heads to the Senate, facing an uncertain future due to Republican skepticism.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration released a report from the MAHA Commission, chaired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., outlining major drivers behind chronic diseases in U.S. children, including obesity, asthma, and behavioral health disorders. The report identifies poor diet, environmental chemicals, chronic stress, lack of physical activity, and overmedicalization as key factors. It also suggests corporate influence in the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries contributes to the problem. While acknowledging the report's diagnosis of the issues, some experts raise concerns about the lack of focus on socioeconomic factors and ongoing cuts to public health infrastructure.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist." The new review, using the DOD's terms, found only about 20 books needing removal pending further review. The Pentagon memo was issued to comply with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

          <p>South Africans have expressed disappointment at Donald Trump's treatment of Cyril Ramaphosa during a White House meeting, where Trump repeatedly interrupted Ramaphosa and made unfounded allegations of a "white genocide." Ramaphosa calmly challenged the claims and maintained a diplomatic demeanor, which drew praise from his party. Trump also played a video showing Julius Malema chanting a controversial anti-apartheid song, which South African courts have categorized as hate speech. Despite the hostile reception, Ramaphosa's delegation, including business leaders and athletes, attempted to address Trump's concerns.</p>

The price rise is occurring despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are looking for alternative stores of value.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the U.S., reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over three to five months. The strict drug control policy, implemented in May 2019, added all fentanyl-related substances to China's list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, nearly 1,000 more Americans would have died from fentanyl overdoses.</p>
