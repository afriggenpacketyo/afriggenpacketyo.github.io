          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region saw gains, tracking a rally in technology stocks on Wall Street that lifted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite. Japan's Nikkei 225, Australia's S&P/ASX 200, and South Korea's Kospi all posted increases in early trading. The positive movement occurred despite ongoing concerns about the global economy, with global bond markets remaining a key focus for investors. The U.S. 30-year Treasury yield briefly surpassed 5% following a court ruling on the illegality of most Trump-era tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Authorities in Argentina have successfully recovered "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century painting by Italian artist Giuseppe Ghislandi that was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, valued at approximately $50,000, was originally owned by Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker before his collection was seized by Hermann Göring. The painting was discovered after it was spotted in an online real estate listing for a home in Mar del Plata belonging to the daughter of a former high-ranking Nazi lawyer.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's decision to freeze $2.2 billion in research grants for Harvard University was illegal. The judge described the action as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault" and found that the administration imposed the freeze in retaliation for the university's refusal to comply with demands that violated First Amendment protections. The ruling vacates the funding freeze, which had halted numerous critical research projects, including studies on tuberculosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, and suicide prevention for veterans.</p>

          <p>The UK's defence secretary, John Healey, stated that Britain and its allies are prepared to support Ukraine both before any peace negotiations and in securing a final peace agreement. Speaking in Kyiv, he emphasized that allies would help ensure the safety of Ukraine's skies, seas, and land once a deal is reached. This statement comes as Russia's President Putin conveyed a defiant message from China, vowing to continue the invasion, though Healey suggested this may be bluster due to mounting pressure on Russia.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in the development of AI "agentic frameworks," the foundational tools used to create autonomous AI agents. Tech giant Tencent recently open-sourced its Youtu-Agent framework, following similar moves by ByteDance with its Coze Studio and Alibaba with its Qwen-Agent. These platforms provide the necessary components to build and manage AI agents capable of performing complex tasks for users by planning and executing a series of subtasks, positioning Chinese companies to compete with U.S. counterparts like OpenAI.</p>

          <p>Salesforce announced fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, with revenue increasing 10% year-over-year to $10.24 billion. However, the company's stock declined in after-hours trading due to disappointing revenue guidance for the upcoming third quarter. Despite the soft outlook, the company maintained its full-year revenue forecast and raised its earnings projections. CEO Marc Benioff highlighted strong sales for its new Agentforce AI software, which has secured over 6,000 paid deals since its launch. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport Venezuelan migrants accused of gang affiliation. The court found that the current situation does not legally constitute an "invasion or predatory incursion," which is the required standard for invoking the wartime law. This decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's strategy of rapidly removing certain migrants without standard due process. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction for the plaintiffs in the case.</p>

          <p>The municipal government of Shaoxing, China, has introduced a stimulus measure offering subsidies to individuals who host large banquets. As part of a broader effort to boost consumption, residents can receive up to 5,000 yuan (US$700) if they host five or more tables and spend over 10,000 yuan on the event. This policy highlights the challenge for local officials who are being urged to stimulate economic growth while also adhering to national anti-corruption campaigns that discourage extravagance. The new measures are expected to generate significant additional consumer spending.</p>

          <p>A former police detective shares essential advice on what to do immediately after being involved in a car crash, drawing from a recent personal experience of a head-on collision. The first crucial step is to stop the car and turn off the engine, as failing to do so is a legal offense. After checking for injuries, if possible, the vehicle should be moved to a safe location with hazard lights on; otherwise, occupants should exit and stand well away from traffic. The article stresses the importance of calling 999 if anyone is injured.</p>

          <p>Democrats have successfully negotiated an agreement with North Carolina's state board of elections to prevent nearly 98,000 voters from being purged from the rolls. The settlement resolves a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration's Department of Justice, which had demanded the state deny ballots to voters who registered without providing certain identification numbers. The new agreement allows these voters to provide the missing information via a provisional ballot at the polling place, effectively curing the issue and allowing their vote to be counted.</p>
