          <p>China is reorganizing its military education system by establishing new academies for its service branches, as the People's Liberation Army (PLA) aims to modernize. The Ministry of Defence announced the PLA Ground Force Service Academy in Hefei, the PLA Information Support Force Engineering University in Wuhan, and the PLA Joint Logistics Support Force Engineering University in Chongqing. These academies will recruit high school graduates, providing distinct channels for the Information Support Force (ISF) and Joint Logistics Support Force (JLSF) to strengthen their talent pools and train personnel for modern warfare. This initiative is part of a broader structural overhaul of the PLA since 2016, aimed at achieving a "world-class" military by 2049.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard oral arguments regarding the ability of federal courts to issue nationwide injunctions, a check on presidential authority that President Trump is challenging. The cases involve Trump's executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, which several federal courts deemed unconstitutional and blocked nationwide. The justices appear ideologically divided, with the outcome potentially resting on Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett. If nationwide injunctions are eliminated, challenges to government policies would need to be brought separately in each federal district, creating inconsistent laws until the Supreme Court resolves the issue for the entire country.</p>

          <p>New clinical testing requirements for vaccines may delay the availability of updated COVID and flu shots this fall, potentially limiting access to older Americans and those with chronic health problems. The Department of Health and Human Services indicated that substantial updates to existing vaccines may require additional clinical evaluation, potentially including seasonal flu vaccines. Officials are also questioning the necessity of COVID vaccines for children under 12. Some experts fear these new limits could undermine the use of all vaccines, including those in the childhood immunization schedule, by raising safety doubts and making it difficult for companies to continue production.</p>
