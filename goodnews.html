          <p>The Christian aid group Samaritan‚Äôs Purse is providing assistance to communities in Israel affected by conflict on its northern and southern borders. The organization is building armored ambulance stations and planning a trauma recovery center to support those living with daily fear. Edward Graham, COO of Samaritan‚Äôs Purse, visited the region to meet with survivors, soldiers, and local leaders, offering support and restoring confidence. Samaritan's Purse has donated 42 armored ambulances to Israel‚Äôs national emergency service and is constructing bomb shelters, demonstrating their commitment to helping displaced people return home and rebuild their lives.

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber sheds light on the evolution of flight feathers, which enabled birds to surpass dinosaurs in conquering the skies. The study examined 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, providing insights into feather development during this era. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences highlighted the importance of feathers in generating thrust and lift for birds. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same ability to fly, though some could glide or achieve powered flight. The optimism score is moderate, reflecting the positive advancement of scientific knowledge about the evolution of birds.</p>

          <p>UK scientists have discovered that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth may protect against dangerous infections. The study shows that beneficial bacteria can halve the risk of young children being hospitalized with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from newborns to identify which species were present and how common they were. Bifidobacterium longum, in particular, appeared to have a protective effect, with babies carrying this species being less likely to require hospitalization for lung infections. The optimism score is high, reflecting the potential for developing therapies that boost beneficial bacteria in babies and improve health outcomes.</p>

          <p>A US judge has temporarily halted deportation proceedings against the family of a man accused of a petrol-bomb attack on Jewish demonstrators in Boulder, Colorado. Judge Gallagher ordered deportation proceedings to be halted, citing the potential for irreparable harm.

The judge's order is the latest setback for the Trump administration on immigration.
