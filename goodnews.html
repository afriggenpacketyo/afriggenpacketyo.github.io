          <p>Republican Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, a prominent voice on foreign policy, has announced he will not seek another term after serving 11 terms in Congress. McCaul, who has chaired both the House Homeland Security and Foreign Affairs Committees, stated he will serve out his current term but is seeking a new challenge in national security. A strong advocate for U.S. support for Ukraine, his departure comes at a time of change for Texas Republicans. His announcement adds to a number of House members retiring or seeking other offices, signaling a potential shift in the congressional landscape.</p>

          <p>A Delta Air Lines flight bound for Boston experienced a bird strike shortly after taking off from Miami International Airport, forcing it to make an emergency landing. The aircraft, DL1300, safely returned to Miami without any injuries to passengers or crew. The bird strike reportedly affected one of the plane's two engines, prompting the precautionary measure. After a delay, the flight was able to depart again, arriving in Boston approximately two hours behind its original schedule. Delta issued an apology for the inconvenience caused by the incident, which was handled successfully by the flight crew.</p>

          <p>England cricket head coach Brendon McCullum anticipates a straightforward selection process for the upcoming Ashes tour of Australia, stating that the squad is "pretty settled." The main point of discussion is expected to be the choice of a second spinner to support first-choice Shoaib Bashir. McCullum confirmed that England will likely take a 17-player squad, including up to seven specialist seam bowlers, and will not select a specialist back-up wicketkeeper. He also hinted at ongoing discussions about the vice-captaincy, acknowledging Harry Brook's emergence as a leader within the team as they prepare for the highly anticipated series.</p>

          <p>British supermarket group Sainsbury's has officially ended talks with Chinese e-commerce firm JD.com regarding the potential sale of its general merchandise retailer, Argos. The company announced that the discussions were terminated because JD.com indicated it was only prepared to proceed on a "materially revised set of terms." Sainsbury's concluded that accepting these new terms would not be in the best interest of its shareholders. Despite the collapsed deal, Sainsbury's reaffirmed its financial guidance, stating it still expects to deliver a retail underlying operating profit of around £1 billion for the 2025-2026 fiscal year.</p>

          <p>Oblique Seville has ushered in a new chapter for Jamaican sprinting by winning the men's 100m gold at the World Athletics Championship in Tokyo with a personal best time of 9.77 seconds. His victory marks the first time a Jamaican man has claimed a global 100m title since the legendary Usain Bolt, who was in the stands celebrating. The 24-year-old's triumph comes after past disappointments at major championships, demonstrating his mental fortitude and fulfilling his long-held potential. The win, part of a Jamaican one-two finish, signals a resurgence for the nation in an event recently dominated by the United States.</p>

          <p>Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley is pursuing an aggressive off-field financial strategy, investing millions of his NFL earnings into venture capital funds and technology startups. Following the example of other financially savvy athletes, Barkley lives off his endorsement deals while directing his salary into investments, which reportedly include AI firm Anthropic, Elon Musk's Neuralink, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund. This approach, aimed at creating generational wealth, reflects his awareness of the relatively short career span of an NFL running back. His portfolio demonstrates a sophisticated and risk-aware approach to managing his considerable income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has officially launched her campaign for the deputy leadership of the Labour Party, making a strong appeal for unity. Speaking in Sunderland, she warned that internal divisions would only benefit political rivals like Reform UK and prevent the party from delivering on its agenda. Phillipson paid tribute to her predecessor, Angela Rayner, and pledged to continue a strong campaigning role if elected. Her main competitor is former Commons leader Lucy Powell, setting the stage for a contest seen by some as a reflection on the current direction of the party's leadership.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has continued its flawless start to the Premier League season, securing four consecutive wins, each decided by goals scored in the final minutes of the match. This trend of dramatic, late victories has been dubbed "Arne Time," a nod to manager Arne Slot and a comparison to the famous "Fergie Time" of Manchester United's past. The latest instance was a last-second penalty converted by Mohamed Salah to defeat Burnley. While the need for late goals suggests the team has not yet hit its peak performance, it also demonstrates a formidable resilience and winning mentality that is proving psychologically daunting for opponents.</p>

To compete with digital entertainment, parks are creating meticulously detailed environments and physically intense roller coasters that push the limits of the human body. The goal is to engineer a sense of overwhelming, inescapable fun, managing every aspect of the visitor's experience from queue times to background music. This strategy has proven highly profitable, turning parks into destinations that some visitors find more appealing than reality itself.</p>

          <p>This article features a new poem by Ashley M. Jones titled "In the Beginning, There Was the Word," from her book "Lullaby for the Grieving." The poem powerfully traces the central role of language and faith as sources of identity, resistance, and resilience for African Americans throughout history. It moves from the holds of slave ships, where the spoken word was a connection to God, through the Civil Rights Movement, where activists became messengers of a holy song. The work celebrates the enduring power of a collective voice and the act of creation as a form of prayer, culminating in a declaration that this cultural heritage is an "unstoppable song."</p>

          <p>The financial markets are keenly focused on the Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting, with a 25-basis-point interest rate cut widely anticipated. However, investors will be paying closest attention to Fed Chairman Jerome Powell's subsequent press conference for clues about the future path of monetary policy. This decision comes after mixed inflation data and a significant slowdown in jobs growth, which Powell previously indicated could warrant a policy adjustment. The Fed has been on hold since last year, and its forward guidance will be critical in shaping market sentiment and determining the direction of stocks for the remainder of the year.
