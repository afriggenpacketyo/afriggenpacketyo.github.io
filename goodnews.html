          <p>Hilaria Baldwin described her debut performance on "Dancing with the Stars" as a dream come true, especially with her husband, Alec Baldwin, and their family present to support her. In a pre-performance segment, Alec praised her work ethic, noting that professional dancing was her life before an injury forced her to stop. Following a steamy cha-cha with her partner Gleb Savchenko, some social media users commented on Alec's seemingly stoic reaction in the audience. Hilaria emphasized that her husband has been very supportive of her journey on the show, which represents a return to a passion she thought she had lost.</p>

The London-based company, which spun out of a crypto-mining infrastructure firm, has been named an AI partner for Nvidia, Microsoft, and OpenAI for their UK expansions. Nscale also announced a $6.2 billion agreement with Microsoft to develop hyperscale AI infrastructure in Europe and received a £500 million equity investment from Nvidia. This swift ascent highlights the intense demand for AI data centers and Europe's push for "sovereign AI" capabilities (not investment advice).</p>

The Princess of Wales, Catherine, also made a statement with a golden couture gown and a historic tiara for the state banquet. Stylists and royal experts noted the symbolic choices, such as the use of British designers and color coordination, which conveyed messages of support and reflected the pageantry of the formal occasion.</p>

          <h2>Federal Court Blocks Trump Administration's Planned Overhaul of Health and Human Services</h2>

          <p>A federal appeals court has upheld an injunction preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with a large-scale reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The plan, announced by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., involved firing 10,000 employees and restructuring major agencies like the CDC and FDA. A coalition of 19 Democratic-led states sued, arguing the administration lacked the authority for such wholesale changes, which they claimed would harm public health services. The court rejected the administration's argument that the states could not demonstrate immediate harm, allowing the injunction to remain in place pending a full appeal.</p>

          <p>With U.S. household debt reaching record levels, many Americans are struggling to keep up with payments, particularly on high-interest credit cards. For those whose debt obligations exceed their income, traditional budgeting may not be sufficient. This article outlines several strategies for relief, including debt consolidation to a lower-interest loan, which can make payments more manageable for those with good credit. Other options discussed are debt settlement, where companies negotiate a lower total balance with creditors, and formal debt management plans offered through credit counseling agencies, which restructure payments and reduce interest rates over a set period (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts First Interest Rate Cut Since December Amid Economic Concerns</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 16:20:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has lowered its benchmark interest rate by 0.25 percentage points, bringing the new target range to between 4% and 4.25%. This marks the first rate cut since December 2024 and reflects the central bank's growing concern over a slowing labor market and weakening economic growth. Projections from Fed officials indicate the possibility of two additional cuts before the end of the year, though opinions among policymakers are divided. The move aims to support employment by easing borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, even as inflation remains slightly above the Fed's target (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study of nearly 34,000 veterans suggests that nicotinamide, a form of Vitamin B3, is associated with a lower risk of developing non-melanoma skin cancers. The research, published in JAMA Dermatology, found the greatest benefit among individuals who began taking the supplement after their first skin cancer diagnosis, showing a 54% reduced risk of recurrence. While many dermatologists already recommend the over-the-counter supplement, this large-scale study provides stronger evidence for its use as a secondary prevention measure. The findings may lead to more widespread recommendations, particularly for patients at high risk for common skin cancers like basal and squamous cell carcinoma.</p>

          <h2>Wreckage of Fishing Vessel That Sank in 1929 Identified Off Nantucket Coast</h2>

          <p>A dive team has officially identified a shipwreck discovered 200 feet underwater off the coast of Nantucket as the ST Seiner, a fishing boat that sank nearly a century ago. The vessel was lost in a storm in January 1929 with 21 crew members aboard, and no survivors were ever found. The salvage company Atlantic Wreck Salvage located the wreck site in 2022 and confirmed its identity during dives in July 2025. Distinctive features like a double drum trawl winch and sonar scans matching the ship's dimensions helped confirm it was the long-lost vessel, providing potential closure for descendants of the crew.</p>
