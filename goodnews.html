        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazilian meat giant JBS commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.65 per share, valuing the company at approximately $30 billion. The company's U.S. listing follows a history of corruption and bribery allegations, including a $3.2 billion fine paid by its holding company in 2017 to settle bribery charges. Despite the scandals, the SEC approved JBS's listing in April, and shareholders narrowly approved the move the following month. JBS operates globally, with divisions in Brazil, the U.S., and Australia, and owns over 80% of Pilgrim's Pride. While the company's U.S. debut represents a significant milestone, its past controversies continue to cast a shadow over its operations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the Trump administration from implementing further sections of an executive order seeking to overhaul U.S. elections. The judge's decision prevents the administration from requiring documentary proof of citizenship on the national voter registration form and from barring states from counting mail-in ballots received after Election Day. The ruling affirms that states, not the president, have the power to set election rules, according to the Constitution. This is the second judge to rule against the executive order, which has faced criticism for federal overreach and potential voter suppression.</p>

          <p>A second judge has halted additional provisions of President Trump's executive order related to voting, affirming a pause on requiring documentary proof of citizenship for voter registration. The judge also blocked a provision aimed at preventing states from counting mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day but received afterward. The ruling emphasized that states have the constitutional power to set election rules, not the president. This decision follows concerns from voting officials about federal overreach into their processes. The judge also blocked provisions related to how US citizens abroad, including military members and their families, register and vote, as it appeared contrary to Congress's intent to remove procedural roadblocks for overseas voters.</p>

          <p>With fluctuating economic conditions, it's crucial to assess the benefits of high-yield savings accounts, especially for substantial deposits like $10,000. While interest rates remain relatively high, exceeding traditional savings accounts, potential rate drops loom. High-yield savings accounts offer accessibility to funds, unlike certificates of deposit (CDs), but CDs may provide greater interest-earning potential. The decision to invest in a high-yield savings account depends on individual financial priorities and risk tolerance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A real estate expert identifies subtle issues that can prevent homeowners from receiving full-price offers on their properties. These issues include unusual or lingering odors, a weak online presence with poor listing photos, inadequate lighting, and improper furniture layout. Clutter can also negatively impact buyer perception, making a house appear smaller and disorganized. Addressing these less obvious factors can create a more inviting atmosphere and increase the likelihood of receiving a full-price offer.</p>
