          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-14 15:12:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell indicated that a significant slowdown in hiring presents a growing risk to the U.S. economy, suggesting the central bank may implement two more interest rate cuts this year. Speaking to the National Association of Business Economics, Powell noted that despite a government shutdown affecting data, the outlook for employment has weakened, shifting the balance of risks. He stated that while tariffs have increased inflation, there are no broader price pressures, allowing the Fed to focus more on supporting the job market. This has led to market expectations of rate reductions in the upcoming October and December meetings. (not investment advice)</p>

The company is partnering with Broadcom to co-develop custom AI accelerators, similar to previous agreements with Nvidia and AMD, to create an infrastructure optimized for its models. This vertical integration strategy, part of a campaign called Stargate, aims to achieve greater efficiency, performance, and cost-effectiveness. The moves position OpenAI to compete not just on model capability but as a complete AI ecosystem, controlling the hardware, developer platform, and user experience.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating High-Yield Savings Account Rates Following Federal Reserve Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following recent interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve, the returns on high-yield savings accounts have decreased from their recent peaks, but still offer significant advantages over traditional savings accounts. While rates of 6% are largely gone, savers can still find accounts offering between 4.20% and 4.30%, which is substantially higher than the national average of 0.40% for traditional accounts. Unlike Certificates of Deposit (CDs), these accounts provide liquidity without requiring savers to lock their money away for a fixed term. The article advises consumers to shop around, particularly with online banks, to find the most competitive rates available. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new biography of the late author and adventurer Peter Matthiessen, titled "True Nature," frames his life as a continuous spiritual quest to escape his privileged upbringing and find an authentic self. The article positions Matthiessen's story as a cautionary tale for today's elite strivers who seek fulfillment through external journeys, from space travel to psychedelic retreats. Matthiessen, the only writer to win National Book Awards for both fiction and nonfiction, co-founded The Paris Review while working for the CIA and undertook expeditions to remote locations. His life illustrates that a genuine search for one's "true nature" is an arduous, internal process without shortcuts.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested the central bank is close to ending its program of reducing its bond holdings, a process known as "quantitative tightening." In a speech, Powell stated that the Fed may reach its goal of maintaining "ample" reserves for banks in the coming months, at which point it would stop shrinking its balance sheet. He emphasized that this move is intended to ensure sufficient liquidity in the financial system and does not signal a change in the Fed's broader interest rate policy. The central bank's balance sheet swelled during the pandemic and has been gradually reduced since mid-2022. (not investment advice)</p>

They believe a live-action version would feel too grounded and stilted, losing the expressive freedom that allows the characters to be goofy comedians one moment and high-flying demon fighters the next.

The piece heavily criticizes the response from Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, describing her attack on Starmer as partisan and disconnected from the gravity of the situation.

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving in place a $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him for his false claims about the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. Jones had repeatedly claimed the massacre was a hoax staged by "crisis actors," leading to years of harassment and threats against the victims' families. A Connecticut jury and judge awarded the record-breaking sum in 2022 after finding him liable for defamation and infliction of emotional distress. Jones's lawyers had argued to the Supreme Court that the amount could never be paid.</p>
