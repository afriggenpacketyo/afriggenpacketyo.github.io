          <p>Yankees legend Derek Jeter gave the commencement speech at the University of Michigan, emphasizing the importance of persevering through failure. Jeter, who would have played baseball at Michigan had he not gone pro, shared his own experiences with failure in the minor leagues, where he made 56 errors in his first season. He highlighted that dealing with failure is essential for success and urged the graduates to view setbacks as speed bumps rather than roadblocks. Jeter's speech aimed to inspire the students as they prepare for their professional lives, reminding them that failure is a necessary part of the journey. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators announced plans to cut key interest rates and the bank reserve requirement ratio in an effort to bolster economic growth amidst trade concerns. The People's Bank of China will lower the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and reduce the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting approximately $138.6 billion into the market. These measures were announced hours after the confirmation that Chinese Vice Premier He Lifeng will meet with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent in Switzerland to discuss tariff and trade matters, signaling potential negotiations between the two countries to address the ongoing trade war.

          <p>President Trump adopted a conciliatory tone during a meeting with the new Canadian Prime Minister, Mark Carney, despite months of belittling Canada. Trump expressed his affection for Canada, a stark contrast to his previous statements about potentially acquiring the country. Carney, however, firmly asserted that Canada is "not for sale," pushing back against any suggestion of becoming the 51st state. The meeting, which was expected to be tense, saw Trump covering a wide range of topics unrelated to U.S.-Canada relations, including domestic issues and former President Joseph R. Biden Jr., while Carney remained guarded and focused on maintaining Canada's sovereignty.</p>

          <p>South Asian fans expressed disappointment over the perceived lack of respect shown to Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan and artist Diljit Dosanjh at the Met Gala, their first appearance at the event. During an interview with Khan, Vogue's livestream co-hosts appeared unaware of his global fame, leading to awkward exchanges. Similarly, Dosanjh received minimal attention during the livestream, with the camera quickly panning away from him. Fans felt that the South Asian superstars were not given the same level of recognition as other attendees, despite their significant international followings. A representative for Vogue stated that it was "certainly not intentional" to cut away from Diljit so quickly.</p>

          <p>China, a leading aluminium producer and consumer, relies heavily on imported aluminium ore from Guinea and Australia due to a lack of high-quality bauxite. However, a plant in Shanxi province is being upgraded with French technology that will enable it to produce aluminium from China‚Äôs low-grade ore, previously considered unusable. The technology, developed by French chemist Yves Ocello, neutralizes silica and sulphur, allowing high-silica bauxite to be refined using the Bayer method. This innovation could significantly reduce China‚Äôs dependence on imported aluminium ore and contribute to a greener aluminium industry, aligning with Beijing's two-year plan.</p>

          <p>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney firmly stated that Canada is "not for sale" during an Oval Office meeting with President Trump, following the president's remarks about the border between the U.S. and Canada being "artificial" and romanticizing the idea of Canada joining the U.S. Mr. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of acquiring Canada, despite Canada's repeated rejection of the concept. Carney emphasized that the opportunity lies in partnership and what the two countries can build together, rejecting any notion of Canada becoming the 51st state. Despite tensions on trade and borders, Carney pledged to stand firm against the U.S. president.</p>

The dispute involves a 16-foot fence and metal gate erected without proper permits, violating city ordinances. Despite the efforts, the city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk ultimately lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property at a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting.</p>
