          <p>The Trump administration has announced it will send additional defensive weapons to Ukraine to aid in its defense against Russia, just days after temporarily halting some shipments. President Trump stated the support is necessary because Ukraine is being hit hard and many people are dying. The decision comes after the White House confirmed a pause in shipments to review military stockpiles, a move the president claimed to be unaware of. The renewed support was discussed in recent calls between President Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who described the conversation as fruitful for strengthening Ukraine's air defense.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he is nominating US President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, citing his role in forging peace in the Middle East. The announcement was made during a dinner in Washington where the two leaders celebrated recent US strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. They also discussed a 60-day ceasefire proposal for the conflict in Gaza and the potential for renewed talks with Iran. Trump expressed optimism that regional tensions would settle, while Netanyahu praised the president for his decisive actions, which he believes will lead to greater stability.</p>

Netanyahu's discussions with administration officials also touched upon a potential ceasefire with Hamas, with President Trump expressing optimism about an imminent agreement. The meetings underscore the ongoing diplomatic efforts and strategic coordination between the US and Israel on critical Middle East security issues.</p>

          <p>An Argentine man has discovered his true identity nearly five decades after being born in a clandestine detention center and taken from his activist mother during the country's military dictatorship. He is the 140th "stolen grandchild" to be identified through the efforts of the Grandmothers of Plaza de Mayo. His parents, Graciela Alicia Romero and Raul Eugenio Metz, were forcibly disappeared in 1976. His older sister, Adriana Metz Romero, who was raised by her grandparents, expressed her joy at the discovery. The case highlights the ongoing struggle for justice and identity for the estimated 500 babies stolen by the regime.</p>

          <h2>Economic Anxiety Drives 'Revenge Saving' Trend Among Americans</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 12:38:07 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent survey indicates that many Americans, particularly younger generations, are engaging in "vibe-based budgeting," adjusting their financial habits based on feelings of economic anxiety. This has led to a shift from post-pandemic "revenge spending" to a new trend of "revenge saving," as people build emergency funds in response to concerns about inflation and a potential recession. Financial experts advise that while saving is positive, it should be intentional rather than purely emotional. They recommend strategies like reverse budgeting, where savings goals are prioritized first, and automating contributions to create a stable financial future.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant rally in its stock price, GE Vernova may have more room to grow, according to Jim Cramer and a BMO Capital analyst. BMO raised its price target for the company, highlighting nearly $80 billion in future service-related revenue that is insulated from fluctuations in equipment demand. Cramer suggests that accounting changes in President Trump's new bill could incentivize the company to expand its U.S. production capacity. He also believes the company could secure more orders from overseas customers, particularly in the context of ongoing international trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A provision in a new sweeping budget bill signed by President Trump creates government-seeded investment accounts, nicknamed "Trump accounts," for children. Under the plan, U.S. citizens born between 2025 and 2028 will receive an initial $1,000 contribution from the government into an account that parents can open. While experts call the initial grant "free money" and a no-brainer to accept, they note that existing vehicles like 529 plans or Roth IRAs may offer better tax advantages for specific goals like education or retirement. The accounts aim to encourage early investing, with funds growing tax-deferred until withdrawal.</p>

          <p>German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius has put forward a draft bill that would allow the government to reinstate military conscription under specific emergency security situations. The plan is seen as a compromise, aiming to bolster the armed forces in response to the changed security landscape in Europe without a full return to compulsory service. The bill also seeks to make voluntary service more attractive with significantly higher pay. This move comes as Germany works to meet new NATO guidelines that would require a substantial increase in military personnel in the event of a major conflict.</p>
