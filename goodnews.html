          <h2>Argentina Aims to Boost Copper Production Amid Global Demand Surge</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 01:25:33 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's President Milei is pushing to increase copper production to capitalize on rising global demand fueled by electrification and renewable energy. Milei's administration introduced the Large Investment Incentive Regime (RIGI) to attract large-scale investors with tax and trade benefits. Copper projects alone represent an estimated $16 billion of the $30 billion sought by 20 projects under RIGI. According to ICMM, Argentina is considered a very exciting new copper story with the potential significance of BHP and Lundin's Vicuna copper project being extraordinary, and comparable to Western Australia's impact on iron ore. This project represents a $47 billion opportunity for the Argentine economy through 2040 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles defeated the Dallas Cowboys 24-20 in a season-opening game that included a 65-minute lightning delay. Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected early for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, leading to immediate consequences as the Cowboys scored on their first possession. Jalen Hurts rushed for two touchdowns, and Saquon Barkley added another, while Javonte Williams scored two touchdowns for the Cowboys. The Eagles raised their 2024 championship banner in the locker room before the game, per coach Nick Sirianni's wishes, and ultimately secured the win after a late defensive stop, showcasing resilience and discipline.</p>

          <p>Adm Sir Tony Radakin, the outgoing head of the British armed forces, stated that the UK's national security is secure for the next few years. He bases his optimism on the UK's status as a nuclear power and a NATO member, describing NATO as the "biggest and strongest gun club ever." Radakin praised former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his ministers for their response to the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. He also urged skepticism against arguments that a new non-NATO "axis" was forming, emphasizing the lack of historical trust and mutual support for war fighting among those nations.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he will impose "fairly substantial" tariffs on semiconductor imports from companies that do not shift production to the U.S., while offering exemptions to firms like Apple that expand domestic investments. Trump mentioned that Tim Cook would be in "pretty good shape" due to Apple's commitment to spend an additional $100 billion on domestic manufacturing. The U.S. has been working to onshore its semiconductor supply chain, with major companies like TSMC and Samsung Electronics committing billions to build plants in the U.S. Tech leaders praised Trump's pro-business and AI stances during a White House dinner.</p>

          <p>Bidders seeking to acquire a stake in Starbucks' China operations have submitted offers valuing the business at around US$5 billion. This potential deal would be one of the most significant China unit divestments by a global consumer company in recent years. The offers value Starbucks China at about 10 times its expected earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda) of US$400 million to US$500 million in 2025. The sale comes as Starbucks faces sluggish growth and increased competition from local brands in the Chinese market.</p>

          <p>The Philadelphia Eagles commenced their Super Bowl title defense with a 24-20 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, a game marred by an early ejection. Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected just six seconds into the game for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott, leading to a touchdown for the Cowboys on their first possession. Despite the setback, the Eagles rallied, with Jalen Hurts accounting for 214 yards and Saquon Barkley rushing for 60 yards and a touchdown. The game also featured a 65-minute lightning delay in the third quarter, adding to the unusual circumstances.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump signed an executive order formalizing a trade deal with Japan, establishing 15% baseline tariffs on most Japanese goods, including autos.
