          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered almost £500 million in fraudulent funds over the past year using a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of this sum, £186 million, was related to fraud committed during the Covid-19 pandemic, with the tool also identifying illegal council tax claims and social housing subletting. The Cabinet Office developed the "Fraud Risk Assessment Accelerator" to scan new policies for weaknesses before implementation and now plans to license this technology to allies like the US and Australia. This development comes amid ongoing criticism from civil liberties groups regarding the government's use of AI, citing previous instances of algorithmic bias.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has addressed concerns over the company's staggering $850 billion plan for a 17-gigawatt AI infrastructure expansion, stating it is a necessary response to soaring demand. The project, in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank, is equivalent to the power of 17 nuclear plants and has raised fears of a potential investment bubble. Altman acknowledged the worries but emphasized that such a massive supercomputing network is required to advance AI capabilities and meet the tenfold increase in ChatGPT usage over the past 18 months. He conceded that while some investors may get burned, the long-term societal value of the technology will be immense. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Eddie Wu revealed that Alibaba will expand upon its existing 380 billion yuan AI infrastructure initiative, aiming to become a leading "full-stack AI service provider." The announcement, made at the company's annual cloud conference, also included the official launch of its latest large language model, Qwen3-Max, as part of a broader update to its AI product suite. Wu projected that cumulative global AI investment could exceed $4 trillion in the next five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Datong in China's Shanxi province successfully avoided disaster from this summer's heavy rains, thanks to major infrastructure work completed over 15 years ago. Under former mayor Geng Yanbo, the city widened its main waterway and reinforced its banks, a project initially criticized as wasteful but now praised for saving the city from severe flooding. This outcome is being highlighted as an example of the benefits of long-term investment in disaster resilience. Economists suggest that such infrastructure spending not only improves urban safety but can also serve as a short-term economic stimulus, pointing to Beijing's recent issuance of sovereign debt for disaster prevention.</p>

          <p>Democrat Adelita Grijalva has won a special election in Arizona's 7th Congressional District, securing the seat previously held by her late father, Raul Grijalva. Her victory over Republican nominee Daniel Butierez further narrows the Republican's slim majority in the U.S. House of Representatives. The result was widely expected in the heavily Democratic, Hispanic-majority district that stretches along the state's border with Mexico. Grijalva, a former county supervisor, campaigned on a platform opposing President Trump's agenda and will serve the remaining 15 months of her father's term.</p>

          <h2>Stablecoin Issuer Tether Reportedly Seeking Major Capital Raise at $500 Billion Valuation</h2>

          <p>Tether, the company behind the world's largest stablecoin, is reportedly planning a significant fundraising round that could value the firm at approximately $500 billion. CEO Paolo Ardoino confirmed that the company is evaluating a private placement to raise between $15 and $20 billion from a select group of investors. This valuation would place Tether in the same league as private tech giants like SpaceX and OpenAI. The new capital is intended to massively scale Tether's expansion into new business areas, including artificial intelligence, commodity trading, and communications, as the company also works on re-establishing its presence in the United States.

          <h2>Beijing's National Day Parade Viewed as a Symbol of Cohesion for Hong Kong and Macau</h2>

          <p>This article presents an opinion that China's decennial National Day parade is more than a display of military strength, serving as a significant declaration of national cohesion for territories like Hong Kong and Macau. The author argues that viewing the event through a Western lens misses its deeper meaning from the perspective of national destiny and institutional resilience. The parade is framed as a collective display that helps individuals transcend personal anxieties by creating an emotional resonance with the nation. For Hong Kong and Macau, it is positioned as a tangible symbol of their connection to the mainland's history and future.</p>

          <p>In a significant policy shift, U.S. President Donald Trump has declared that Ukraine can "win all of Ukraine back in its original form," including territory lost to Russia. This statement, made on his Truth Social platform after meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, marks a reversal from his previous suggestions that Kyiv would likely have to concede territory to end the war. Trump attributed his changed position to a new understanding of the military and economic situation, asserting that Russia's economy is in "BIG trouble." Zelensky hailed the reversal as a "big shift" and a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

          <p>This article provides a historical analysis of China's five-year plans, which have been a central pillar of the country's macroeconomic policy since 1953. Despite moving away from a command economy, these successive plans have guided China's transformation from a nation with limited industrial capacity into the "world's factory." The 14 plans implemented to date reflect over seven decades of policy shifts, starting with the initial focus on heavy industry in the 1950s. Beijing is now using this framework to pivot towards becoming a global innovation hub, with the upcoming 15th five-year plan expected to be a crucial step in that process.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Air Force is developing a plan to replace its aging C-17 Globemaster III and C-5M Galaxy strategic airlifters with a single, next-generation platform. This new aircraft, part of the Next Generation Airlift (NGAL) program, is expected to enter service in the mid-2040s. According to the head of Air Mobility Command, the service is prioritizing greater speed, operational agility, and advanced defensive systems to counter growing threats in the air and on the ground. The goal is to procure one versatile aircraft type to fulfill the strategic airlift roles currently performed by two distinct fleets.</p>

          <p>Scottish pop icon Lulu, 76, has publicly revealed for the first time that she is a recovering alcoholic, a secret she kept for decades to protect her public image. In her new memoir, she details how she was a "highly functioning alcoholic," even while competing on the TV show "Strictly Come Dancing." The singer, now nearly 12 years sober, decided to share her story after opening up to her family on her 65th birthday, which led her to enter rehab. She attributes the origins of her secret struggles to a traumatic childhood with an alcoholic father, and hopes that by sharing her story, she can help others and break a family pattern.</p>
