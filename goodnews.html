          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 05:40:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for manipulating Libor and Euribor interest rates overturned by the UK's Supreme Court after a decade-long legal battle. They were among several traders convicted for rigging key inter-bank lending rates but had long maintained they were scapegoats for what was common commercial practice. The ruling follows the quashing of all related US convictions, with the Serious Fraud Office confirming it will not seek a retrial, effectively vindicating the traders' long-standing claims of injustice.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has announced a major trade deal with Japan, establishing a 15% tariff on Japanese goods, a reduction from a previously threatened 25% on automobiles. The agreement reportedly involves Japan opening its markets to certain U.S. products, including agricultural goods and vehicles, and committing to a $550 billion investment in the American economy. While the Japanese Prime Minister welcomed the deal, some U.S. automakers have criticized it, arguing it disadvantages their North American operations, which still face higher tariffs on parts from Canada and Mexico.

          <p>India is set to resume issuing tourist visas to Chinese citizens for the first time in five years, a move aimed at improving strained bilateral relations. The Indian embassy in Beijing announced that applications would reopen, requiring an online form and an in-person appointment at visa centers. China's foreign ministry has welcomed the decision, describing it as a "positive move" that serves the common interest of both nations. This step signals a potential thaw in diplomatic tensions and a desire to facilitate greater people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.</p>

          <p>As heat waves strain power grids, the energy-saving strategy of "precooling" homes is gaining attention, though its effectiveness remains a topic of debate. The method involves significantly lowering a home's temperature during off-peak hours to coast through hotter, more expensive periods. While some utility companies endorse the practice under specific conditions, others warn it could lead to excessive energy use and higher costs. Experts agree that for precooling to work, a home must be very energy-efficient, and suggest that simply maintaining a consistent temperature is often more effective than frequently turning an AC system on and off.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has imposed its first-ever sanctions targeting people-smuggling networks in an effort to curb small boat crossings over the English Channel. The initial list includes 25 individuals and one company, who will face UK asset freezes and travel bans. Among those targeted are suspected Albanian gang leaders and a Chinese company accused of manufacturing inflatable boats used for the crossings. Foreign Secretary David Lammy called the move a "landmark moment," but migration experts caution that the impact may be limited given the vast scale of smuggling operations.</p>

          <p>Shares of major European automakers, including Volkswagen, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz, rallied significantly following the announcement of a U.S.-Japan trade deal. The agreement, which lowers U.S. tariffs on Japanese auto imports to 15%, has fueled investor optimism that the European Union could secure a similar breakthrough in its own trade negotiations with Washington. The EU has been trying to reach a deal to lower auto tariffs, facing a threat of increased levies from the U.S. Analysts note that Japan's success may provide a viable framework for a potential EU agreement.

          <p>China has announced that its southern island province of Hainan will operate under an independent customs regime by the end of the year, a major step in its transformation into a global free-trade port. The new system will allow nearly 6,600 types of goods to enter Hainan tariff-free, a significant expansion from the current level. This policy is a key component of Beijing's strategy to stimulate domestic consumption and could position Hainan as a buffer in global trade disputes. Goods processed on the island with over 30% added value can be sold to mainland China without tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>German software firm SAP, Europe's most valuable company, reported that ongoing U.S. tariff tensions are causing its customers, especially large manufacturers, to delay major purchasing decisions. The company's CFO noted that while deals are not disappearing, approvals are taking longer due to the uncertain economic environment. However, he expressed cautious optimism following the announcement of the U.S.-Japan trade agreement, suggesting that reduced uncertainty could help business momentum recover. SAP reiterated its full-year outlook despite the challenges, after reporting second-quarter revenue that fell just shy of market expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New DNA analysis from skeletons at Catalhoyuk, a 9,000-year-old Neolithic settlement in Turkey, provides strong evidence that the society was centered around women. Researchers found that individuals buried under the same house were often related through their mother's side, indicating a matrilocal system where men moved in with the woman's family. This genetic evidence supports long-held archaeological theories based on female figurines found at the site. The findings suggest women held an elevated status in one of the world's oldest continually inhabited places, offering a fascinating glimpse into prehistoric social structures.</p>
