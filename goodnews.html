          <p>Grammy-winning artist LL COOL J is producing and hosting a new docuseries titled "Hip Hop Was Born Here," which delves into the origins of the genre in New York City. The series features intimate conversations with hip-hop pioneers like Big Daddy Kane and Rev Run, aiming to explore the art form's foundational spirit of empowerment and authenticity. LL COOL J expressed a desire to counter the modern, often shallow perception of hip-hop, which he feels has become overly focused on materialism.

          <h2>Scientists Develop Gene-Editing Technique to Make Mosquitoes Highly Resistant to Spreading Malaria</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 13:02:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have discovered a method to significantly reduce the spread of malaria by making a minor genetic alteration in mosquitoes. By changing a single amino acid in the mosquito's genome using CRISPR gene-editing technology, scientists were able to largely prevent the malaria parasite from reaching the insect's salivary glands. This tweak, which could be spread through a wild population using a gene drive, was shown to reduce infective parasites significantly. While the technology is still years from field deployment and faces controversy over potential ecological consequences, it represents a promising new tool in the global fight against the deadly disease.</p>

          <p>The grocery chain Wegmans is testing AI-powered "Caper Carts" in several New York stores to enhance the shopping experience. Developed by Instacart, these smart carts use cameras and sensors to automatically detect and tally items as they are placed inside, allowing customers to track their spending in real-time. The technology also enables shoppers to skip traditional checkout lines by paying directly on the cart's interactive screen. In addition to convenience, the carts offer personalized product recommendations and in-store navigation, representing a potential future for a faster and more integrated retail environment.</p>

          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan secured his second stage victory in this year's Tour de France, winning a sprint finish in stage 17. The 160.4km stage concluded with a bunch finish after the peloton caught the breakaway riders with just 4km remaining. Milan's victory was aided by a crash in the final kilometer that involved his main sprint rivals, Tim Merlier and Biniam Girmay. With the win, the 24-year-old Lidl-Trek rider extended his lead in the points classification, strengthening his hold on the green jersey, while Tadej Pogacar retained the overall race lead.</p>

          <p>England international and Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has completed a season-long loan move to the La Liga club Barcelona. The deal includes an option for Barcelona to sign the 27-year-old permanently in 2026 for a reported £30.3 million, with the Spanish club covering his full wages for the duration of the loan. Rashford's departure follows a difficult period at Manchester United, where his form declined and he faced disciplinary issues under multiple managers. The move offers a fresh start for the player, who emerged from United's academy and scored 138 goals for the club.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a significant trade deal with Japan, establishing a "reciprocal" tariff of 15% on Japanese exports to the U.S., including a reduction for auto tariffs from a potential 25%.

The deal was confirmed by Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who noted the lowered auto tariffs. The agreement provided a boost to Japanese markets, with major auto stocks soaring on the news.

He emphasized the importance of his competitive seat in maintaining the narrow Republican House majority. The decision clears the field for other potential GOP gubernatorial candidates, such as Rep.

          <p>In a landmark advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that countries can sue one another over the impacts of climate change, including for historical greenhouse gas emissions. While the ruling is non-binding, it is seen as a major victory for climate-vulnerable nations and could pave the way for compensation claims against historically high-polluting countries. The court stated that countries must develop the most ambitious climate plans possible under the Paris Agreement and that broader international law requires all nations to protect the climate system. The decision could significantly influence future climate litigation and international policy.</p>

          <p>The recently announced trade agreement between the U.S. and Japan sets a 15% tariff on most Japanese products, a rate lower than the 25% that had been threatened but higher than a proposed 10% universal rate. A key component of the deal is a specific 15% tariff on Japanese cars, which constitute over a third of U.S. imports from Japan. In return, President Trump stated that Japan agreed to open its economy to U.S. trucks and agricultural goods and to invest $550 billion in the American economy. This accord makes Japan the largest U.S. trade partner to finalize a deal under the administration's recent tariff push. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German cabinet has approved new legislation designed to significantly speed up the procurement of weapons and equipment for its military, the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius called the move a "quantum leap" for national security, aimed at cutting red tape and allowing for faster purchasing to bolster NATO defense capacity. The law raises the value limits for direct contracts, facilitating quicker acquisitions without lengthy tender processes, and provides support for startups developing innovative defense technology. The changes are a response to what Germany identifies as the immediate threat posed by Russia and the ongoing war in Ukraine.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains how credit card minimum payments are calculated, using a $2,000 balance as an example. Issuers typically use formulas such as a flat percentage of the balance (1-3%) or a percentage plus interest and fees, resulting in a minimum payment of around $40 to $60 in this scenario. The article strongly advises against paying only the minimum, as compounding interest can dramatically increase the total cost and repayment time. It suggests that paying more than the minimum is crucial for escaping debt and recommends strategies like balance transfers, debt consolidation, or seeking hardship programs if larger payments are not feasible.

Starting next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, women will be able to set a preference in the app to be matched with other women. The company stated the goal is to provide women with more choice, control, and comfort on the platform. While not a guarantee, the feature increases the likelihood of a woman-to-woman match. This initiative expands on a similar tool previously launched in other countries and is Uber's latest effort to address long-standing safety concerns.</p>
