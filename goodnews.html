          <p>Stocks experienced a significant rally on Tuesday after President Trump announced a delay in implementing steep tariffs on the European Union until July 9, providing more time for trade negotiations. The S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all saw substantial gains, reflecting investor relief. The administration is actively working to strike deals before the 90-day pause on reciprocal tariffs concludes, having recently announced trade agreements with the United Kingdom and China. Maros Sefcovic, the EU's chief trade negotiator, expressed the bloc's commitment to reaching an agreement with the U.S. by the deadline, further boosting market confidence.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Consumer confidence experienced a greater-than-expected improvement in May, ending a five-month period of decline, following President Trump's easing of tariffs. The rebound in consumer sentiment was observed across all age and income demographics, according to the Conference Board. A trade agreement between the U.S. and China earlier in the month reduced tit-for-tat tariffs, leading to a surge in the stock market and subsequent revisions of recession forecasts by Wall Street firms. Despite these positive developments, consumers still face the highest overall average effective tariff rate since 1934, and major retailers have warned of potential price increases.</p>

          <p>Consumer optimism received a significant boost in May due to hopes for improved trade relations between the U.S. and China, according to a recent survey. The Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index jumped to 98.0, a 12.3-point increase from April, exceeding expectations. This positive sentiment was largely attributed to developments in the U.S.-China trade situation, particularly President Trump's decision to halt the most severe tariffs on May 12. The rebound followed five consecutive months of decline, with sentiment improving across age, income, and political affiliation.</p>

          <p>Experts predict three potential scenarios for gold prices in June, including stabilization, a drop, or a rebound, depending on factors such as Federal Reserve policy, inflation, and geopolitical conditions. Prices could stabilize if the Fed maintains its current rate or if tariffs do not significantly impact the economy. A rate hike or positive geopolitical developments could lead to a price drop, while weaker economic data or heightened global tensions could cause a rebound. Experts recommend consulting with an investment professional to determine the best course of action for gold investments. (not investment advice)</p>
