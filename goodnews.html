          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed that Meta Platforms attempted to recruit OpenAI employees with substantial signing bonuses, reaching up to $100 million, alongside attractive annual compensation packages. Altman noted that despite Meta's aggressive pursuit, none of OpenAI's key personnel have accepted these offers. He acknowledged Meta's perception of OpenAI as a major competitor and commended their persistent efforts to innovate in the AI sector. Meta's attempts to bolster its AI division come after reported delays in releasing its latest AI model, signaling Zuckerberg's determination to invest heavily in top AI talent. The context is Meta's ongoing efforts to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Optimism surrounding OpenAI remains high given their ability to retain talent.</p>

          <p>The Florida Panthers clinched their second consecutive Stanley Cup championship, defeating the Edmonton Oilers 5-1 in Game 6 of the final series. This win marks the NHL's first back-to-back champions since Tampa Bay in 2020 and 2021, solidifying the Panthers as a potential dynasty. Sam Reinhart's outstanding performance, scoring four goals, contributed significantly to the victory, while Sergei Bobrovsky's stellar goaltending secured the win. The Panthers' success is attributed to key players like Matthew Tkachuk, Reinhart, and Aleksander Barkov, along with strategic trade deadline acquisitions. The team's journey to victory included overcoming injuries and maintaining a strong, healthy roster throughout the playoffs, leading to their dominant performance and cementing their place in NHL history. The Panthers' win represents a significant achievement for the team and its fans.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Australia has become the first country to eliminate all sexual activity-based restrictions on plasma donation, effectively lifting the ban on gay and bisexual men. The new rules, approved by the country's health products regulator, are estimated to expand the donation pool by 625,000 people. While blood donation still requires a three-month waiting period for individuals engaging in anal sex with new or multiple partners, plasma donation is more accessible due to pathogen inactivation processes. This decision, praised by LGBTQIA+ advocates, aims to increase plasma supplies amid rising global demand and reduce stigma, although some argue that blood donation rules remain conservative compared to other countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge appointed by Biden temporarily blocked the Trump administration's policy limiting U.S. passports to only male and female gender options. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that the policy, which eliminated the "X" gender designation, likely discriminates on the basis of sex and is rooted in prejudice toward transgender Americans. The judge argued that the policy would cause psychological distress and fear for transgender individuals forced to travel with passports conflicting with their gender identity. Trump's executive order had directed agencies to recognize only two sexes, arguing that efforts to eradicate the biological reality of sex attack women.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Massachusetts has blocked the State Department from enforcing an executive order requiring Americans to select their gender assigned at birth on new passports. Judge Julia Kobick ruled that individuals can choose the gender they identify with and can still select "X" on passport applications. The ruling expands on an earlier decision and addresses a lawsuit filed by transgender and nonbinary plaintiffs. The White House criticized the ruling as an attempt to push radical gender ideology, while the ACLU praised the decision as protecting the rights of transgender individuals.</p>
