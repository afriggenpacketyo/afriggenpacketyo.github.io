          <p>Coastal Carolina Chanticleers head coach Kevin Schnall was ejected in the first inning of a crucial College World Series game against the LSU Tigers after arguing with the home plate umpire. Schnall's ejection, along with that of a first base coach, occurred after he voiced his displeasure with several pitch calls. The Chanticleers were hoping to extend the series to a decisive Game 3, while LSU aimed to secure the championship. The article details the circumstances surrounding the ejection and its potential impact on the game's outcome. The game continued without Schnall, as Coastal Carolina sought their second College World Series title.</p>

          <p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the U.S. is prepared to meet with Iran after bombing three of its nuclear sites, but warned that closing the Strait of Hormuz would be "suicidal." Rubio emphasized the U.S. has no plans for further attacks unless provoked and urged Iran to pursue diplomacy. He said the strikes aimed to degrade Iran's nuclear weaponization ambitions, not to attack the Iranian people or seek regime change. Rubio also addressed concerns about potential Iranian retaliation, reiterating that the U.S. will defend its interests and allies in the region. He stated that Iran is enriching uranium well beyond what is needed for a civil nuclear program.</p>

          <p>This article investigates a rumor circulating online claiming that Iranian state TV announced a "great surprise" that the world would remember for centuries. The rumor gained traction on social media, with several news outlets reporting it as fact. However, searches of major wire services found no evidence to support the claim, and the original post on X was deleted. The rumor likely originated from an X account called Tehran Updates, which is not affiliated with any government entity. While the truth about the matter remains unconfirmed, the lack of credible evidence suggests the rumor is likely false.</p>

          <p>Ben Stokes made a key breakthrough after Harry Brook's impressive 99 on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. India was building a lead when Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a 96-run advantage at the close. Earlier, Brook missed out on a century after being dropped twice, but his innings helped England reach 465, trailing India by six runs. Jasprit Bumrah took 5-83 for India. Stokes's late wicket kept England in contention in a closely contested match. The game is poised for an exciting finish.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Middle East ended mostly higher on Sunday, showing resilience after the United States entered the war between Israel and Iran. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by optimism that Washington's involvement would lead to a resolution. In the Gulf, Saudi Arabia's Tadawul closed slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw gains. Egypt's EGX30 was a major gainer, closing significantly higher. Analysts suggest the Gulf's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped isolate it from the conflict. (not investment advice) The removal of the Iranian threat could be viewed positively by international investors.</p>

Tikhanovsky was recently released after five years in solitary confinement and reunited with his wife in Lithuania. He described his imprisonment as a "nightmare" and called for the release of over 1,000 political prisoners still behind bars. Tikhanovsky urged Trump to "just say the word" and ask for the release of all political prisoners. His release came after a visit to Minsk by US special envoy Keith Kellogg.</p>

          <h2>Toxic Phrases to Avoid When Talking to Kids</h2>

          <p>This article outlines five phrases that parents should avoid when communicating with their children, as they can lead to defiance and hinder cooperation. Phrases like "Because I said so," "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]," and "Stop crying. You're fine" can trigger a child's fight-or-flight response. Instead, the article suggests alternative phrases that promote respect, emotional safety, and problem-solving. By shifting to language that honors a child's autonomy while still holding boundaries, parents can create an environment where cooperation feels more natural and children are more likely to listen.</p>
