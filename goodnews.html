          <p>Ferrari is under scrutiny after a disappointing performance at the Miami Grand Prix, where team orders overshadowed concerns about the car's overall pace. Team principal Frederic Vasseur acknowledged that Ferrari's qualifying struggles, particularly with new tires, contributed to their poor grid positions and significant time lost to McLaren. Vasseur remains optimistic about upcoming upgrades at Imola and Monaco, and hopes that stricter rules on front wing deflection will benefit the team, but the team must improve its car to compete with faster teams. Despite the challenges, Lewis Hamilton expressed optimism about the car's potential, believing that underlying issues are holding them back. Optimism score: 60</p>

          <p>A sweeping purge within China's military ranks, including high-ranking officers and defense ministers, casts uncertainty on President Xi Jinping's alleged 2027 deadline for invading Taiwan. The dismissals, potentially linked to corruption or ideological rifts, raise questions about the competence and reliability of Xi's commanders. While China's military has made significant advancements, a lack of battlefield experience among officers and political interference may weaken its effectiveness.

          <p>There is a reversing trend in China as the children of senior officials are increasingly choosing jobs in the public sector, contrasting with the previous trend of pursuing lucrative business ventures. This shift is attributed to the Communist Party's stricter regulations on officials and their families, coupled with a slowing economy.
