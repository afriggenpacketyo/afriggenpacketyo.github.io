          <p>Japan has confirmed the first instance of two Chinese aircraft carriers operating simultaneously in the Pacific.

          <h2>Paternity Leave in UK is Outdated and Unequal, Say MPs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 21:00:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A report by a group of cross-party MPs has found that the UK's statutory parental leave system is "one of the worst in the developed world" and has "fundamental flaws". The Women and Equalities Committee said paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes". The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks. The report also looked at shared parental leave, which was introduced in 2014, but found many families considered it "unnecessarily complex" and "burdensome". The score is 60.</p>
