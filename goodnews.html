        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card debt balances declining but interest rates remaining high, this article emphasizes the importance of strategic debt consolidation. Borrowers are advised to take the initiative rather than waiting for interest rates to drop, and to shop around for lenders to find the most cost-effective debt consolidation loan. The article suggests exploring both personal loans and debt relief companies, and considering alternatives like home equity lines of credit (HELOC) or home equity loans. By making these moves, borrowers can potentially reduce interest costs and simplify their debt management. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University President Alan Garber has chosen to cut his own pay by 25 percent, starting in July, as the university faces over $2.6 billion in federal funding cuts and clashes with the Trump administration over academic independence. This symbolic gesture accompanies other cost-saving measures, including a hiring freeze and suspended merit raises. The decision follows Harvard's expanded lawsuit against the administration, contesting accusations of insufficient action against antisemitism. Ninety tenured professors have also pledged to take a 10 percent pay cut to protect staff and students affected by the funding reductions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release of Dr. Badar Khan Suri, a Georgetown scholar detained by immigration authorities, concluding that his detention was based on protected First Amendment speech supporting Palestine. The judge sided with the ACLU's argument that Suri's detention was unjust retaliation for his views and his wife's and father-in-law's associations. She determined that Suri is not a flight risk or a danger to the community and criticized the government for failing to provide evidence to the contrary.

          <p>A study by Australian podiatrists found that Barbie doll's foot posture has evolved over time, correlating with her career or hobby. Researchers examined 2,750 dolls produced between 1959 and 2024, noting a shift from exclusively arched feet to a mix of arched and flat feet, with "employed" dolls more likely to have flat feet. Mattel confirmed that this design decision was intentional, reflecting expanded leisure choices and reimagined footwear options for Barbie.

Despite the positive trend, overdose deaths remain higher than pre-pandemic levels, and experts caution against reducing efforts to combat the crisis.
