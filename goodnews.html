          <p>Brazilian President Lula da Silva has observed that Ukrainian President Zelensky seems more open to peace talks following their recent meeting, a sentiment he also noted from Russian President Putin. Speaking about his efforts to revive a Brazil-China peace plan, Lula emphasized that the United Nations should take a leading role in mediating the conflict to regain its international authority. This diplomatic push follows a rare alignment in March where China and Brazil supported a U.S.-led ceasefire initiative at the Security Council, signaling a potential shift in negotiations.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region generally rose on Thursday, diverging from Wall Street's downward trend, which was driven by a second consecutive day of selling in major technology stocks like Nvidia. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index saw gains, with automaker Chery Automobile's shares surging in their debut, while South Korea's Kospi remained steady, buoyed by defense stocks. In contrast, U.S. stock futures were flat as investors awaited jobless claims data that could influence the Federal Reserve's future monetary policy decisions amid growing economic concerns.

          <p>Shares of Chery Automobile, China's largest vehicle exporter, jumped 11% during their initial public offering in Hong Kong, raising approximately $1.2 billion. The successful debut occurred despite the cancellation of the formal listing ceremony due to a super typhoon, highlighting strong investor confidence in the company's expansion into European and Middle Eastern markets. Analysts note that Chery's strategy of establishing local manufacturing in various countries provides a crucial advantage, helping to mitigate the impact of steep tariffs imposed by the U.S., Canada, and the European Union on Chinese-made electric vehicles.

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot require states to cooperate with federal immigration agents as a condition for receiving certain FEMA grants. The decision sided with 20 states that argued the policy unconstitutionally held critical emergency preparedness funding hostage to advance an anti-immigration agenda. U.S. District Judge William Smith declared the policy "arbitrary and capricious," stating that the potential loss of disaster funds would cause irreparable harm to public safety. This ruling is a significant setback for the administration's ongoing efforts to penalize so-called "sanctuary" jurisdictions that limit local law enforcement's collaboration with ICE.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court of Canada has issued a temporary stay on the planned culling of almost 400 ostriches at a British Columbia farm, which was ordered following an avian flu outbreak. The farm's owners, who were briefly arrested for obstruction, have been fighting the order from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA), arguing against the destruction of their flock. The case has garnered international attention, with U.S. officials offering to study or re-home the birds. The court's decision pauses the execution while it considers whether to hear the owners' full appeal, with the CFIA maintaining custody of the animals in the interim.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia's Investment in OpenAI to be Paid in Cash, Primarily for Leasing Nvidia's Own Chips</h2>

          <p>Nvidia's substantial investment in OpenAI, potentially reaching $100 billion, will be provided in cash, but the majority of these funds are designated for leasing Nvidia's own advanced GPUs. This arrangement allows OpenAI to spread the high cost of computing power over time rather than making large upfront purchases, which is crucial for the cash-flow-negative startup. While the deal provides OpenAI with necessary capital for its massive data center expansion, it has also raised concerns among some investors about the circular nature of the funding. Critics worry that such deals inflate earnings for both companies without necessarily creating new, independent value in the market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>African nations are importing Chinese-made solar panels at a record rate, with a recent study showing a significant increase in the first seven months of the year compared to the previous year. This surge, led by South Africa, Algeria, and Nigeria, is driven by falling costs and the development of large-scale energy projects by Chinese firms. The imports serve as a key indicator of the continent's rapidly expanding solar capacity. The trend highlights China's dominant role in the global solar technology market and its growing influence on Africa's transition toward renewable energy infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Facing economic pressures from global competition and rising operational costs, some cranberry farmers in Massachusetts are participating in a state-funded program to restore their bogs to their original wetland state. The initiative pays farmers to convert unproductive land, helping to preserve the landscape while providing ecological benefits like water filtration, carbon storage, and storm resilience. Over the past 15 years, the state has restored more than 500 acres, with plans for another 500. For many farmers nearing retirement, the program offers a way to ensure their land is well-managed for future generations while also creating new public recreational areas.</p>

          <p>A jewelry store in San Ramon, California, which had been robbed previously, utilized its security systems to trap a large group of armed robbers, leading to the arrest of seven suspects. On Monday, approximately 20 to 25 masked individuals stormed Heller Jewelers, smashing display cases, but were momentarily trapped inside when a security door locked them in. Although the suspects eventually broke through the door and fled, police were able to track one of their vehicles using helicopters and drones. The store had previously been robbed in 2023, where a tracking device hidden in a stolen Rolex led to the capture of those suspects.</p>

Director Paul Greengrass, known for his focus on realism, cast McConaughey's family members to enhance the film's authenticity. The movie, based on real events, portrays the harrowing decisions made by a bus driver and a teacher to navigate through the inferno that devastated the town of Paradise.</p>

          <p>Jimmy Kimmel's first show back after a suspension by ABC drew an estimated 6.26 million broadcast viewers, an audience roughly four times larger than his season average. The ratings surge came despite about a quarter of ABC's affiliate stations, including those owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, preempting the broadcast. Kimmel was suspended following his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. In his return monologue, Kimmel stated it was never his intention to make light of the event and responded to President Trump's criticism about his ratings by saying, "Well, I do tonight."</p>

          <p>Scientists have made a significant breakthrough in nuclear fusion technology by designing an innovative exhaust system that effectively manages the intense heat generated within reactors. The new "Super-X divertor," tested in a U.K. government-owned facility, uses extended plasma "legs" to cool the plasma before it can damage the reactor walls, a major obstacle in making fusion energy viable. This advancement represents a crucial step toward developing clean, nearly limitless energy from nuclear fusion. Unlike nuclear fission, fusion does not produce long-lasting radioactive waste and could play a pivotal role in reducing reliance on fossil fuels.</p>

          <p>A 6.2-magnitude earthquake struck western and northern Venezuela on Wednesday, with its epicenter located near the oil town of Mene Grande in Zulia state. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake had a shallow depth of 7.8 kilometers, and tremors were felt in neighboring Colombia and on several Caribbean islands. There were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties. Although Venezuela is situated in a seismic region, strong earthquakes are not common, with the last major deadly event occurring in 1997.</p>
