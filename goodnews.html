        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that several endangered marine species, including basking sharks and native oysters, may thrive in UK waters due to rising ocean temperatures. Researchers mapped how 19 threatened species will respond to climate change, predicting new biodiversity hotspots in the North Sea. While mobile species are expected to adapt well, static creatures like sea pens and ocean quahogs may struggle, potentially disrupting ecosystems. The scientists caution that these species still require protection from fishing, pollution, and disease to thrive in their new habitats, while a separate study highlights the increasing likelihood of extreme air temperatures in the UK. The movement of marine species could impact coastal communities, possibly leading to larger fish catches.</p>

          <p>Driven by a desire for more affordable eggs, many Americans are increasingly searching for DIY chicken coop plans and purchasing coops from retailers. Real estate company Eden Emerald Buyers Agent found significant increases in Pinterest searches related to chicken coops in early 2025. Tractor Supply Co. confirmed a rise in chicken coop sales and chick purchases, noting a substantial increase in poultry shoppers over the past five years. Experts advise prospective chicken owners to consider the long-term commitment, financial costs, and legal regulations involved in raising chickens, as well as the potential need to re-home hens after their egg-laying years. Proper care and predator protection are also essential for maintaining a healthy flock.</p>

The number of Chinese companies attending the biennial show has more than doubled since 2023. Many of these companies are making their first appearance in Paris as they vie for a place in the European market, with domestic profits plateauing amid a broader economic slowdown and cutthroat rivalries between firms. Excessive competition within China's domestic market is cited as a key driver for seeking international opportunities.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is widely expected to maintain its current interest rate policy, defying pressure from President Trump, who advocates for rate cuts to stimulate the U.S. economy. Investors predict a 99.9% chance that the Fed will leave rates unchanged, continuing its patient approach amid uncertainties related to tariffs and global economic conditions. While inflation remains relatively low, the Fed is wary of potential stagflation caused by tariffs, which could complicate monetary policy decisions. Trump has criticized Fed Chair Jerome Powell for not lowering rates more aggressively, but Powell has emphasized the Fed's independence and warned about the risks of tariff-induced inflation.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the imposition of tariffs by the Trump administration, businesses are increasingly using "tariff engineering" to lower their duty payments. This involves altering an item's materials or dimensions to fit into a different harmonized system code with a lower tariff rate. While not illegal, this practice requires strategic design choices to create products that qualify for different tariff classifications. Companies in sectors like consumer goods and garments can relatively easily implement tariff engineering, while more heavily regulated sectors face greater challenges due to extensive validation and approval requirements. Examples include adding cubic zirconia to lapel pins to classify them as jewelry and Converse adding felt to sneaker soles to classify them as slippers. (not investment advice)</p>
