          <p>The Edmonton Oilers are competing in Miami to win the Stanley Cup, seeking to end Canada's 30-year drought since 1993. Despite having a significant number of Canadian players in the NHL, American teams have dominated the league's top prize for decades. The Oilers' journey is seen as a unifying force for Canadian fans, especially amidst heightened tensions between Canada and the US, and Trump's digs at Canada. The team's performance is a source of national pride and friendly rivalry with the United States, adding to the stakes of the final games. </p>

          <p>Mayor Karen Bass reduced the hours of a nightly curfew in downtown Los Angeles, allowing businesses to stay open later. The curfew, enacted in response to recent protests and looting, will now begin at 10 p.m. instead of 8 p.m. Bass cited reduced crime as a reason for the adjustment, though the LAPD will maintain a strong presence in the area. The curfew applies to the downtown area from the 5 Freeway to the 110 Freeway and from the 10 Freeway to where the 110 Freeway and the 5 Freeway merge. </p>

The aim is to understand the significance of celebrating Juneteenth in the current historical context. </p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in NIH research grants was illegal. The cuts, which targeted research connected to diversity, equity, and inclusion, were deemed unlawful racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. The judge ordered the reinstatement of grants to the organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The ruling follows earlier actions by the Trump administration to slash NIH funding and prioritize new, vague research priorities. </p>
