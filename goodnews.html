        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fijian Prime Minister Sitiveni Rabuka has firmly stated that a permanent Chinese military presence is not welcome in the South Pacific, emphasizing a desire for the region to remain an "ocean of peace." Speaking in Australia, Rabuka acknowledged China's significant investment in regional development but stressed that this should not lead to superpower rivalries playing out in the Pacific. He reiterated the collective stance of Pacific leaders to pursue policies that are "friendly to all and enemies to none." This statement comes amid growing concerns over China's increasing influence and security pacts in the region, particularly with the Solomon Islands.</p>

          <p>Former President Donald Trump has announced that Israel has agreed to the necessary conditions for a 60-day ceasefire in Gaza, urging Hamas to accept the deal. While Israel has not officially confirmed this agreement, a Hamas official stated the group is "ready and serious" to reach a deal if it guarantees a complete end to the war. The proposal, reportedly mediated by Qatar and Egypt, comes ahead of a scheduled meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This development represents a significant, albeit unconfirmed, step towards de-escalating the long-running conflict that has resulted in tens of thousands of casualties.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 06:00:14 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A commentary in a newspaper affiliated with China's Central Party School suggests the People's Liberation Army is drawing key lessons from recent regional conflicts, implicitly referencing the India-Pakistan conflict. The article argues that modern warfare is no longer a contest of individual weapon performance but rather a battle between integrated, systemic operational capabilities. It notes how a seemingly weaker force, by leveraging a cohesive system of data links, early warning aircraft, and coordinated jets, could overwhelm an opponent using a disjointed mix of weapons from various countries. This indicates a strategic priority for China on developing holistic, interconnected combat networks.</p>

          <h2>Veterinarian Successfully Uses Fish Skin to Heal Injured Bald Eagle</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-02 06:00:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a pioneering medical procedure, a veterinarian in Wisconsin saved a severely injured American bald eagle by using grafts made from sterilized Atlantic cod skin. The eagle, named Kere, was found with its leg ripped open and a deep infection, making euthanasia seem likely. Dr. Kimberly Ammann of the Winged Freedom Raptor Hospital used the fish skin patches, typically used for human wounds, to repair the leg and promote tissue regeneration. After a 10-month rehabilitation, the eagle was successfully released back into the wild, a symbolic event just ahead of the Fourth of July holiday.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani's campaign is being noted for its strategy of framing climate policy through the lens of affordability and quality of life. Instead of focusing on complex, technocratic solutions like carbon taxes, the democratic socialist candidate emphasizes popular, tangible goals like free public transit, a rent freeze, and greening public schools. Supporters argue this approach builds a broader, more resilient political base for climate action by directly addressing voters' everyday cost-of-living concerns. This model is seen as a potential lesson for the broader Democratic party on how to make climate policy more politically palatable and defensible.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Fish and Wildlife is promoting outdoor activity by offering two "free fishing days" this summer, on July 5 and August 30. On these dates, residents and visitors can fish in the state's lakes, rivers, and ocean waters without needing to purchase a sport fishing license. The initiative is designed to provide a low-cost opportunity for beginners to try the sport and experience California's natural resources. While the license requirement is waived, all other fishing regulations, including size and bag limits, gear restrictions, and report card requirements for certain species, will remain in effect to ensure conservation.</p>

          <p>A new law in California now requires all establishments that serve alcohol for on-site consumption, such as bars and nightclubs, to provide drink lids to customers upon request. This measure is intended to help patrons protect themselves from having their drinks drugged. The legislation, which passed unanimously, builds on a previous law that mandated signage informing customers about the availability of drug-testing kits. While establishments can charge a reasonable price for the lids, many are providing them for free as a minor operational cost to enhance customer safety. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control will enforce the new rule during regular inspections.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has approved a plan to spend nearly $425 million generated by Measure ULA, the city's controversial "mansion tax." The funds, collected from a tax on property sales exceeding $5 million, will be allocated to various affordable housing and homelessness prevention initiatives during the 2025 fiscal year. Over $288 million is designated for the production and preservation of affordable housing, while more than $100 million will support programs like tenant income support and eviction defense. Proponents hail the measure as a crucial funding source, while critics in the real estate industry claim it has dampened the property market.</p>

          <p>This article provides a first-person account from a journalist who, after covering the destructive wildfires in Los Angeles, underwent blood testing for lead exposure. The reporter details the personal anxiety and uncertainty faced by residents in fire-ravaged areas regarding invisible health hazards like lead and other contaminants in the air, soil, and water. The piece explores the psychological challenge of processing complex environmental risks while also reporting on the science behind them. Ultimately, the journalist's and many others' test results were reassuringly low, suggesting that while caution is necessary, simple mitigation efforts can be effective in reducing exposure.</p>
