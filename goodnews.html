          <p>A new NATO report indicates that all 32 member states are projected to meet the long-standing defense spending target of 2% of their GDP this year. This marks a significant increase in military investment, driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and pressure from the U.S. However, the report also highlights that only three countries—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently meeting the new, more ambitious goal of 3.5% of GDP. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte emphasized that financial commitments must be translated into tangible military capabilities to ensure effective deterrence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported quarterly earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street expectations, with guidance for the next quarter also pointing to continued strong growth of over 50%. Despite the positive results, the company's stock saw a slight decline in after-hours trading, as its data center revenue came in just shy of analyst estimates. The report confirms massive ongoing investment in AI infrastructure by major tech companies, though it also marked Nvidia's slowest growth rate in nine quarters as it navigates the geopolitical environment regarding chip sales to China.

          <p>After more than two and a half years in office, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has appointed Steve Kang, president of the Board of Public Works, to serve as the city's chief film liaison. The position, which helps film and TV productions navigate city bureaucracy, had been vacant since she took office, causing frustration among industry advocates. The appointment is seen as a crucial step to support the local film industry, which faces intense competition from other locations offering generous tax incentives and less complex filming processes, especially amid a broader production slump.</p>

          <p>The UK government is rolling out the final phase of its expanded childcare plan, offering working parents in England 30 hours of funded childcare per week for children from nine months old. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging eligible parents to apply for the program, which aims to alleviate high childcare costs. However, the expansion has raised concerns among providers about insufficient government funding rates, which may not cover their operational costs. There are also warnings about a potential shortage of staff and available places needed to meet the increased demand.</p>

          <p>A UK charity, Greater Change, is providing direct cash grants to people at risk of homelessness, arguing it is an effective and dignified way to prevent them from losing their housing. The initiative gives money to individuals through a support worker for specific needs like rent deposits or paying off debts, allowing them choice in their recovery. The charity reports that 86% of the people it has supported have moved into stable housing, and it claims the model saves taxpayer money by intervening early. This approach is supported by international studies showing that direct cash transfers are typically used responsibly.</p>

          <p>China's rapid expansion in the electric vehicle (EV) market has made it a dominant force, surpassing Japan as the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023. Led by companies like BYD, which has overtaken Tesla in revenue, Chinese manufacturers are leveraging government subsidies, lower costs, and a strong battery supply chain to gain global market share. This ascent has prompted regulatory scrutiny and new tariffs from the U.S. and E.U. to protect their domestic industries. Analysts predict China will produce four out of every ten cars globally by 2030, fundamentally altering the competitive landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following Nvidia's strong earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer argued against the idea that the market is in an artificial intelligence bubble. He asserted that the massive AI spending by Big Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google is a worthwhile investment, not a repeat of the dot-com bust. Cramer noted that while Nvidia's stock dipped slightly after the report, the underlying growth is real and driven by competent industry leaders. He drew parallels to the dot-com era, suggesting that even if there is a shakeout, dominant companies will ultimately survive and thrive. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores the investment case for Palantir Technologies versus Alphabet amidst recent volatility in the artificial intelligence sector. While Palantir's stock has pulled back following a short-seller report questioning its high valuation, its customer growth and commercial revenue have surged, indicating a strong growth trajectory. In contrast, Alphabet's stock has remained steady, benefiting from a diversified business model that includes dominant search advertising and cloud services alongside its AI ventures. The analysis suggests Palantir remains attractive for growth-oriented investors despite its volatility, while Alphabet offers more stability. (not investment advice)</p>
