        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following President Trump's suggestion that pregnant women should "tough it out" instead of taking acetaminophen, numerous doctors and public health officials are voicing concerns. They emphasize that untreated high fevers during pregnancy can pose serious risks to fetal development, including potential cardiac and central nervous system abnormalities. Medical professionals reiterate that acetaminophen (Tylenol) remains the safest over-the-counter option for pain and fever during pregnancy compared to alternatives like ibuprofen or aspirin. They advise pregnant individuals to follow medical guidance rather than political commentary to avoid harmful outcomes for both mother and baby.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, borrowing costs for home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) have decreased. A comparison shows that a $100,000 HELOC is currently slightly cheaper on a monthly basis than a fixed-rate home equity loan of the same amount. However, the article notes that HELOCs have variable rates, meaning payments could rise if market conditions change, whereas home equity loans offer the stability of a fixed payment. Homeowners are advised to weigh the reliability of a fixed-rate loan against the potential for further savings with a variable-rate HELOC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ukraine has rapidly built a domestic weapons industry, now producing millions of drones annually to counter the Russian invasion and reduce reliance on foreign aid. A key part of its strategy involves long-range drone and missile strikes deep inside Russia, specifically targeting the oil and gas industry, which is a primary source of the Kremlin's revenue. This campaign has successfully hit numerous refineries and pipelines, causing fuel shortages within Russia and reducing its export capacity. This economic warfare, supported by European allies, represents Ukraine's effort to apply its own form of sanctions to cripple Russia's ability to fund the war.</p>

In a recent podcast interview, the 39-year-old credited his wife, Coleen, for helping him manage his drinking and providing crucial support. Rooney admitted that his drinking had gone "too far" at times and believes he could have died without her intervention. He described how she has "managed" him for over two decades, helping him control behaviors that could have had dire consequences.</p>

          <p>A senior Department of Justice official has been ordered by Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to drop an inquiry into a retired FBI agent's involvement in the Sandy Hook defamation lawsuit against Alex Jones. Ed Martin Jr., who leads a "weaponization working group," had sent a letter questioning whether former agent William Aldenberg, a plaintiff in the case, had financially benefited from the lawsuit. After criticism from the Sandy Hook families' lawyer, who called it a "corrupt use of the Department of Justice," Martin sent a new letter withdrawing the request and stating there was no investigation into Aldenberg.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman defended the company's massive infrastructure expansion plans, which total approximately $850 billion in partnership with Oracle, Nvidia, and SoftBank. Acknowledging concerns about a potential market bubble, Altman stated the spending is a direct response to the "near infinite demand" for AI compute, evidenced by ChatGPT's rapid growth. The buildout, equivalent to the power of 17 nuclear plants, is necessary to deliver the next generation of AI capabilities. Altman conceded that in such a rapid technological revolution, some investors will get burned, but he remains confident in the gigantic long-term value of the technology. (not investment advice)</p>

This rule, established in 2001, required traders making four or more day trades in five days to maintain a $25,000 account balance. The change, which awaits SEC approval, will replace the fixed minimum with a more flexible intraday margin rule based on the positions taken.

This is about $150 less per month compared to the rates seen at the beginning of the year, which were above 7%.
