          <p>South Korea's main stock index, the Kospi, surged to an all-time high, fueled by significant gains in Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix. The two tech giants saw their shares soar after announcing a strategic partnership to supply memory chips to the artificial intelligence firm OpenAI. This market rally occurred amid broader positive performance in other Asian markets like Hong Kong and Australia. The strong sentiment in the tech sector successfully overshadowed concerns about a slight increase in South Korea's consumer price index. (not investment advice)</p>

This rush to list reflects a major rebound in the market, as evidenced by the Hang Seng Biotech index, which has more than doubled in value this year.

          <p>Germany is taking steps to address significant shortcomings in its drone defense capabilities, a vulnerability highlighted by recent airspace incursions by suspected Russian drones. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius acknowledged the country is "behind" and is working to acquire new systems like the Skyranger anti-aircraft tank and interceptor drones. The plan also involves amending laws to grant the military more authority to assist police in countering drone threats. Germany is also learning from Ukraine's experience by procuring its own combat drones for the first time.</p>

          <p>Dozens of American flags for former President Trump's recent UK state visit were reportedly replaced at significant public cost because the red stripes were the wrong shade. A government supplier claimed the U.S. embassy objected to the standard red, requesting a brighter "cherry red" instead. This resulted in 66 new hand-sewn flags being produced for display along the Mall and at Windsor Castle. The incident highlights the meticulous diplomatic preparations and expenses involved in hosting high-profile state visits, which also included extensive entertainment for Trump.</p>

          <p>Online fast-fashion giant Shein is expanding into physical retail by opening its first-ever permanent outlets in France. The company will establish "shop-in-shop" concessions within major department stores, starting in Paris before expanding to five other French cities. This move marks a significant strategy shift for the primarily e-commerce brand, which has previously only operated temporary pop-up stores. Shein stated that France's influential fashion market made it a "natural choice" for this venture, which is expected to create around 200 jobs.</p>

          <p>Asian fast-fashion giant Shein has chosen France as the location to open its first permanent physical outlets. It will occupy concessions in department stores first in Paris, followed by five others in the cities of Dijon, Reims, Grenoble, Angers and Limoges. Shein told the BBC on Thursday that France's "influential global fashion market" was a "natural choice" as the firm's testbed for physical stores. The fashion brand has become best known for its discounted and trendy clothes, but has drawn criticism over its environmental impact and working conditions.</p>

This trend is driven by a new generation of Chinese immigrants who are importing regional culinary traditions and chefs directly from China. The boom reflects a growing demand for authentic and diverse food experiences, expanding Paris's reputation as a global gastronomic hub.</p>

          <p>A consortium of lenders has put forward a new rescue plan aimed at preventing the financial collapse of Thames Water, the largest water company in the UK. The proposal includes writing off approximately one-third of the company's nearly £20 billion debt and injecting an initial £5.4 billion to stabilize its finances. The investors assert that their plan can turn the company around without requiring taxpayer money or government intervention. The plan also stipulates that no dividends will be paid to shareholders until at least March 2030, addressing public criticism.</p>

These tests are being conducted in a cave system chosen for its striking resemblance to the lunar subsurface. The robotic dogs act as "scouts," navigating narrow passages inaccessible to humans to perform surveying and exploration tasks. This research is a critical step in advancing the technologies needed for deep-space missions and for identifying potential locations for future human bases on the moon.</p>

Wolf suggests that true breakthroughs come from proposing novel, unlikely ideas, a capability today's AI lacks.
