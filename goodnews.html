          <p>The Trump administration's deadline for transgender troops to voluntarily leave the military has passed, with some accepting discharge while others are determined to challenge the ban. The administration's policy has faced legal challenges and widespread criticism for its discriminatory nature. Many transgender service members have expressed their commitment to continue serving despite the uncertainty and potential hardship the ban presents. Their resilience highlights the ongoing fight for equality and inclusion within the armed forces, which is a matter of civil rights and military readiness.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to improve drone detection and crack down on unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling, with a particular focus on protecting large-scale public events like the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to boost U.S. development of drones and commercial use of the technology for deliveries and other purposes. The initiative is driven by concerns highlighted by drone strikes in the Russia-Ukraine conflict.</p>

          <p>Amazon is reportedly investing in automating its logistics operations, potentially saving $200 billion by using AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries. These robots could deliver packages directly to customers' doors from Rivian electric vans, reducing delivery times and labor costs. Amazon is testing these robots at a San Francisco "humanoid park" obstacle course. Analysts project that automating 10% of U.S. units through robotics-enabled warehouses could lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030 (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A defibrillator installed on Mount Everest by David Sullivan, a 62-year-old man who lost four friends to sudden cardiac arrest, saved a woman's life just three weeks later. Sullivan founded Code Blue CPR to provide CPR training and install life-saving equipment in hard-to-reach places. He installed the defibrillator at over 16,000 feet above sea level and trained local Sherpas and villagers in its use. The device was activated and saved the life of a 30-year-old woman, marking a proud moment for Sullivan and highlighting the importance of accessible defibrillators.</p>
