          <p>AI scientist De Kai argues that living with AI requires a paradigm shift where people ‚Äúparent‚Äù these systems as if they were their children. De Kai believes that since AI learns by absorbing everything we do and say online, we need to be conscientious about who we are around our AI ‚Äúchildren‚Äù. De Kai has spent four decades at the forefront of AI research and advocates for AI ethics. De Kai's new book, Raising AI: An Essential Guide to Parenting Our Future, released on June 3, argues that living with AI requires a paradigm shift. </p>
