          <p>Country music star Carrie Underwood is increasingly embracing a traditional, self-sufficient lifestyle on her farm near Nashville, Tennessee. Along with her husband and two sons, she practices homesteading by growing her own produce, raising livestock, and engaging in activities like canning and crocheting. Underwood has shared her goal of eventually no longer needing to buy food from stores, highlighting how her family's meals are often sourced directly from their garden or from hunting. This shift reflects a desire for a simpler life with a focus on sustainability and eliminating food waste.</p>

          <p>Professor Guo Zaiping, a world-renowned Chinese scientist specializing in advanced materials for energy storage, has joined City University of Hong Kong as the chair professor of energy materials. After a two-decade career in Australia, where she was an Australian laureate fellow at the University of Adelaide, her move is a significant development for Hong Kong's academic landscape. Guo's research is pivotal for developing next-generation rechargeable batteries, with her work potentially revolutionizing the electric vehicle industry by extending driving ranges. Her appointment bolsters an already top-ranked materials science program at the university.</p>

          <h2>UK Government Plans to Protect Pubs and Music Venues from Noise Complaints</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 03:16:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is proposing changes to licensing rules to shield pubs and music venues from noise complaints, aiming to revitalize struggling town centers. The reforms would require developers building near existing venues to install soundproofing and would fast-track permissions for new businesses in designated areas. This initiative seeks to promote outdoor dining and reverse the decline in the pub industry, which has seen numerous closures due to economic pressures and legal battles over noise. While the government touts the changes as cutting red tape, the opposition criticizes the hypocrisy, blaming Labour's tax policies for the industry's struggles.</p>

          <p>Ghanaian President John Mahama has introduced a "24-hour economy" policy aimed at transforming the nation's economy from import-based to self-sufficient. The plan involves key industries operating in three eight-hour shifts daily, with the goal of creating 1.7 million new jobs and boosting GDP. However, the initiative faces significant hurdles, including the need for an estimated $4 billion in funding and infrastructural challenges like an unstable power supply. Economists question the feasibility, noting that the domestic private sector may lack the financial strength to drive such a large-scale transformation without substantial government investment first.

          <p>Claressa Shields successfully defended her undisputed women's heavyweight championship with a commanding unanimous decision victory against Lani Daniels in Detroit. Shields, a native of Flint, Michigan, controlled the fight from the outset, using her superior speed, footwork, and punch variety to overwhelm her opponent. Daniels, a former light heavyweight titleholder from New Zealand, showed resilience but was unable to match Shields' offensive output or defensive sharpness. The win improves Shields' undefeated record to 17-0 and solidifies her status as one of boxing's most dominant figures.</p>

          <p>A mother from Apple Valley, California, has defied incredible odds by having all four of her children born on the same calendar day, July 7th. Nauzhae Drake, 26, welcomed her first son on July 7, 2019, followed by a daughter in 2021, another son in 2022, and her fourth child, a boy, in 2025, all on the same date. Remarkably, none of the births were induced or scheduled, leading Drake to feel it is a "sign from God." A mathematics professor calculated that the probability of such an occurrence is astronomically low, making this family's story a unique and heartwarming coincidence.</p>

          <p>Fan Chunli, a 50-year-old woman from rural China, has become a stand-up comedy sensation by telling jokes about her abusive ex-husband and patriarchal norms. Her performances, which blend humor with poignant social commentary, have resonated deeply with audiences but have also drawn the ire of some government officials. An official warning was issued by one provincial government against jokes that "provoke" gender conflict, reflecting the Communist Party's sensitivity towards feminist discourse. Fan's rise highlights both the power of comedy as an outlet for grievances and the tight constraints on social expression in modern China.</p>
