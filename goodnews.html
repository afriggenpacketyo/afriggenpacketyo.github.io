          <p>In Austin, Texas, Christophe Waggoner is combating the rising cost of Halloween costumes by creating and donating them to families in need. For nine years, he has frequented thrift stores to find materials he can wash, repair, and redesign into unique outfits for children. With the average costume price increasing by 11% this year, Waggoner's efforts ensure that children can experience the joy of Halloween regardless of their family's financial situation. He spends over $5,000 of his own money annually on this project, driven by the belief that every child deserves a chance to be a kid and that his work inspires a cycle of giving.</p>

          <p>American mountaineer Jim Morrison, 50, has made history by becoming the first person to ski down the North Face of Mount Everest via the treacherous Hornbein and Japanese Couloirs. He completed the 9,000-foot vertical drop in just over four hours, a feat previously unaccomplished due to the route's steep, icy conditions and high avalanche risk. Morrison dedicated the historic run to his late partner, famed mountaineer Hilaree Nelson, who died in a 2022 climbing accident in Nepal. After two previously failed attempts due to weather and permit issues, he successfully navigated what he described as a mix of "survival skiing and actual shredding" on the final day of his permit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amidst significant market volatility, Invesco senior portfolio manager John Burrello recommends that risk-averse investors consider income funds utilizing options-based strategies. He argues that these funds offer more structural protection because their performance is not dependent on traditional asset class correlations. This approach can provide reliable downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes, which is particularly relevant as policymakers are expected to cut rates. Burrello advises investors to seek out ETFs managed by institutional-grade professionals and to be cautious of unsustainable yields and high fees in this growing market space.

          <h2>Study Suggests Men Are More Eager to Marry or Cohabitate Than Women, Often for Financial and Emotional Support</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women desire commitment more, a recent study by the Kinsey Institute found that men are more likely to want to speed up relationship milestones like moving in together or getting married. The research, which surveyed 2,000 U.S. singles, indicated that financial savings was a primary motivator for men. Experts also suggest that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their main source of social and emotional support, leading to lower psychological well-being when they are single. This trend is further supported by data from relationship coaching services, which report that men are more likely to sign up for and invest more in coaching.</p>

          <p>Efforts to repair the damaged external power supply to Ukraine's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant are underway, according to the UN's nuclear watchdog. The plant, which is Europe's largest, has been relying on backup diesel generators for four weeks, a situation that poses significant safety risks. The International Atomic Energy Agency stated that both Russian and Ukrainian forces have engaged constructively to establish ceasefire zones, allowing for the complex repairs to proceed safely. Although the Russian-controlled plant is not currently in service, a reliable power source is essential for cooling its six reactors to prevent a potential nuclear incident.</p>

          <p>At 99 years old, Sir David Attenborough has set a new record as the oldest person to win a Daytime Emmy Award. He was honored for his work on the Netflix documentary "Secret Lives of Orangutans" in the outstanding daytime personality category. The renowned naturalist and broadcaster, whose career spans over seven decades, surpassed the previous record held by actor Dick Van Dyke. The documentary, which explores the lives of orangutans in Sumatra, also secured two other awards for music composition and directing. Sir David, who will turn 100 next year, was not present at the ceremony in California to accept the award.</p>

          <p>For only the second time in its 1,500-year history, the Grand Sumo Tournament is being held outside of Japan, taking place at London's iconic Royal Albert Hall. The event features over 40 professional wrestlers, known as rikishi, competing in 100 bouts over five days. Significant logistical efforts were required to maintain the sport's cultural and religious authenticity, including shipping 11 tons of special clay from Japan to construct the sacred ring, or dohyo. The tournament, which first came to London in 1991, aims to introduce the highly traditional Japanese national sport to a Western audience, complete with English commentary to explain its complex rules and rituals.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, a group called Mental Health Is Real Wealth offers a crucial safe space for Black men to discuss their mental health challenges. Founded by Desmond Carter after his best friend's suicide, the bi-monthly meetings address a growing crisis, as suicide rates among Black men have risen significantly. Participants discuss the unique pressures they face, from systemic racism to societal expectations of masculinity, in a supportive environment. Experts note that Black men are less likely to seek mental health support and often receive culturally incompetent care, making community-led initiatives like this essential for fostering emotional expression and breaking generational cycles of trauma.</p>

          <p>Carlynn Greene, who won 30 scholarships to graduate debt-free, advises students to avoid common pitfalls when applying for financial aid. She recommends focusing on local and state-level scholarships rather than highly competitive national ones, as they have smaller applicant pools. Another key strategy is to apply for "intersectionality scholarships" that have multiple specific criteria, such as race, gender, and area of study, to narrow the competition further. Greene also emphasizes that applying for scholarships is a numbers game, suggesting that students should aim to submit applications for 100 to 200 different awards to maximize their chances of success.</p>

He emphasizes that early retirement is an opportunity to redefine one's identity and find new purpose outside of a career, which for him includes hiking, writing, and volunteering.

          <p>The expression "Das crazy," a mix of German and English, has been chosen as Germany's Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The term, which deliberately breaks grammatical rules, is used by young people to express surprise, speechlessness, or irony, and is prevalent in internet and meme culture. Selected through an online vote organized by the PONS Langenscheidt publishing house, the phrase beat out contenders like "goonen" (a term for excessive self-gratification) and "checkst du" (do you understand?). The choice highlights the growing influence of the English language and the trend towards brevity in youth slang, reflecting the fast-evolving nature of modern communication.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett outlines his investment philosophy, categorizing assets into three types and explaining why he avoids gold. He describes the first category as currency-denominated assets like bonds, which he views as a bet on government stability that typically loses value over time. The second category, which includes gold, consists of non-productive assets that investors buy hoping someone else will pay more for them later, a strategy he likens to a chain of hope. Buffett prefers the third category: productive assets like farms or businesses, which generate value and returns based on what they produce, making their intrinsic worth measurable regardless of daily market fluctuations.
