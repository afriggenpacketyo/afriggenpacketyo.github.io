          <p>A federal judge in Washington D.C. has issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the U.S. government from deporting ten unaccompanied Guatemalan children. The ruling came after advocacy groups filed a legal challenge, arguing the removals would violate federal laws that provide specific protections for vulnerable minors. The judge's 14-day block allows for a hearing on the matter, pausing a policy that was part of a broader immigration crackdown and providing a brief reprieve for the children involved.</p>

          <p>EU foreign ministers are considering several new measures to support Ukraine, including the possibility of secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners to weaken its war machine. Other proposals discussed include establishing Ukrainian arms production facilities on EU soil as a "safe haven" and finding ways to utilize frozen Russian assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction. The brainstorming session also touched on shifting the EU's military training mission onto Ukrainian soil post-ceasefire, reflecting a long-term strategic adjustment to the ongoing conflict.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has finalized its largest-ever warship export agreement, a £10 billion deal to supply Norway with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The Ministry of Defence announced that the contract will support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the vessels will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a joint UK-Norwegian fleet of anti-submarine frigates, marking a significant win for the British defense industry.</p>

          <p>A massive restoration effort off the coast of Southern California has successfully revived a vital kelp forest that had declined by 80%. Led by The Bay Foundation, the project involved divers manually smashing nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins, whose population had exploded and decimated the kelp. This "forgotten forest" is crucial for biodiversity, carbon storage, and coastal protection, and its rapid recovery serves as a successful model for marine ecosystem restoration in other parts of the world.</p>

          <p>In an excerpt from his new book, Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores innovative approaches to treating chronic pain, which affects millions of people. He highlights a shift towards "reverse translational research," which starts with a patient's real-world experience rather than beginning in a lab. This method has enabled scientists to map the unique neural signatures of an individual's pain, leading to groundbreaking treatments like deep brain stimulation that can predict and intercept pain signals, offering new hope for managing this debilitating condition.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the ten-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration, "wir schaffen das" ("we can do it"), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. The policy profoundly changed German society and politics, and a decade later, the nation is taking stock of both its successes and challenges. While data shows nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave are now employed, issues of integration and a surge in support for the far-right continue to dominate the conversation.</p>
