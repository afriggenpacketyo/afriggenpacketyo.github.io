          <p>The surviving members of the Beach Boys have paid tribute to Brian Wilson, their frontman and co-founder, who died at 82, recognizing his "genius" and unmatched musical gifts. Wilson's family expressed their heartbreak, with Al Jardine calling him a "humble musical giant" who taught the world how to smile. Wilson formed the Beach Boys with his brothers and cousin, selling over 100 million records and producing hits like "I Get Around" and "Good Vibrations." Fellow musicians such as Bob Dylan, Elton John, and Mick Fleetwood have also shared tributes, highlighting his influence and unique sounds, particularly on the album *Pet Sounds*.

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron has outlined his ambition for France to manufacture cutting-edge chips, positioning the country as a critical tech hub in Europe. Macron's comments arose after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang noted that Nvidia's first GPU was manufactured in France. Macron aims for France to produce semiconductors in the 2-10 nanometer range, requiring TSMC or Samsung to establish local factories. He also touted a deal between Thales, Radiall, and Foxconn to explore setting up a semiconductor assembly and test facility in France, while also highlighting Nvidia's partnership with Mistral to build an "AI cloud."</p>

          <p>Viktor Gyokeres, formerly of Brighton, has become a sought-after player after scoring 97 goals in 102 appearances for Sporting. Despite his impressive performance, Rio Ferdinand expresses doubts about Gyokeres' ability to replicate his success in the Premier League. Sporting's president states they have not received an offer for the striker, though top clubs like Arsenal and Manchester United are reportedly interested. Gyokeres has gone from not playing a single minute in the Premier League to becoming a top transfer target after excelling in loan spells and with Sporting.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between China and the US, Chinese companies are increasingly focused on global expansion, with the US remaining a key market. Camera company Insta360 recently raised $270 million in a Shanghai listing, noting that the US, Europe, and mainland China each account for over 23% of its revenue. Other companies, such as battery giant CATL and robotic vacuum cleaner company Roborock, are also expanding their global presence. This trend reflects a shift towards Chinese businesses building international brands with local offices and employees, moving beyond manufacturing for foreign brands or joint ventures.</p>

          <p>China's launch of mass production for high-performance photonic chips is expected to drive significant advances in artificial intelligence (AI), 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has begun producing 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips, which use light instead of electrical signals. While Europe and the US are established in this field, China's pilot production line is already showing technical gains by overcoming limits for high-speed optical links. TFLN's ultra-fast electro-optic effect, high bandwidth, and low power consumption make it a promising material for photonic chips.</p>
