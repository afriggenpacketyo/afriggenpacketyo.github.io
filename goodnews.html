          <p>Austin Beutner, a former investment banker and Los Angeles Unified School District superintendent, seems to be laying the groundwork for a mayoral campaign against current Mayor Karen Bass in 2026. Indications included a brief appearance of "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" branding on his social media accounts, which was quickly removed. Beutner, who previously held high-level city roles and led the LA Times, would present a formidable challenge to Bass, whose tenure has been marked by significant issues such as the Palisades fire, a billion-dollar budget deficit, and federal immigration enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>China is currently drafting its 15th five-year plan, a crucial blueprint that will outline the nation's development priorities and potentially reshape its infrastructure investment strategy. Historically, these plans have underpinned massive public works projects, like the 2009 stimulus package, which significantly boosted economic growth but also contributed to local government debt. Moving forward, economists and officials anticipate that the upcoming plan will emphasize more technologically advanced and people-focused infrastructure projects. This shift aims to continue driving economic growth while addressing existing financial pressures and fostering a new era of sustainable development. (not investment advice)</p>
