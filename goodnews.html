          <p>Asia-Pacific markets, particularly Japan, reacted positively to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's resignation announcement, with the Nikkei 225 rising 1.5% and the Topix reaching a record high. Investors are now eyeing potential successors like Koizumi Shinjiro and Takaichi Sanae, with the latter's pro-deregulation and anti-interest-rate-hike stance seen as a potential growth driver. Concurrently, the Japanese yen weakened against the dollar, and bond yields rose amidst persistent inflation and fiscal uncertainty. Analysts from BMI anticipate a period of extended uncertainty for Japan into Q4 2025, despite the initial market optimism. (not investment advice)</p>

Chief Operating Officer Yang Qian expressed optimism for "robotic butlers" becoming a reality within five years, despite current AI limitations compared to generative AI. The startup, already generating revenue from institutional sales, plans an initial public offering next year, aiming to make robots accessible to consumers by significantly reducing hardware costs.

          <p>A collaborative China-U.S. study, utilizing seismic data from NASA's InSight lander, discovered that Mars possesses a solid inner core approximately 600km in radius. This finding is significant because, based on current understanding, Mars should not have cooled sufficiently to form such a core, similar in proportion to Earth's. The discovery might reignite discussions about whether Earth was unique in developing plate tectonics. This unexpected geological feature challenges existing planetary formation models and adds Mars to the exclusive list of celestial bodies, including Earth and the moon, confirmed to have solid inner cores.</p>

          <p>Carlos Alcaraz secured his second U.S. Open title by defeating Jannik Sinner in a four-set final, but the match was overshadowed by President Trump's attendance. The President's presence in a luxury box led to enhanced security measures, causing significant delays and long lines for ticketholders, and drew mixed reactions from the crowd. Reports indicated that the U.S. Tennis Association advised broadcasters to mute crowd responses to Trump, who was previously booed at the 2015 U.S. Open. His appearance, following recent tariffs on Swiss products, also highlighted his pattern of attending high-profile sporting events during his second term.</p>

          <p>Margaret, who lives in London, and her husband Peter, residing in Australia, have maintained a faithful and happy marriage for 15 years despite living in different countries. This arrangement, known as "living apart together" (LAT), is uncommon for married couples but allows Margaret to pursue a new career in London after raising four children and earning a PhD. While Peter remains in their family home in Brisbane, the couple prioritizes regular communication to bridge the geographical distance. Experts suggest LAT relationships can provide space for individual interests and identity, contributing to a strong bond when both partners are committed to the unconventional setup.</p>

          <p>The city of Los Angeles has purchased the historic Griffith Park carousel for $1 million, ensuring its preservation and eventual reopening. This "crown jewel" of the park, where Walt Disney reportedly conceived Disneyland, ceased operation in 2022 following its previous operator's death. The carousel, built in 1926 and featuring hand-carved horses, is one of California's oldest wooden merry-go-rounds. Although it requires significant repairs, its acquisition is part of a broader park restoration project expected to be completed before the 2028 Olympic Games. The city's commitment ensures this beloved landmark will continue to delight visitors for years to come.</p>

          <p>Global investors are increasingly diversifying away from U.S. equities towards Asian markets, driven by Asia's burgeoning AI boom and expectations of easing U.S. Federal Reserve monetary policy, according to Bank of America. After a decade of significant inflows into U.S. stocks, investment patterns are shifting, with capital now flowing evenly between U.S. and international markets. The weakening U.S. dollar and the massive projected growth of Asia's AI market, expected to reach nearly $1.2 trillion by 2030, are key factors. Asia offers pockets of opportunity and more favorable valuations compared to expensive U.S. stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Stargazers across Asia, and parts of Europe and Africa, witnessed a spectacular "Blood Moon" on Sunday night during a total lunar eclipse. This celestial event occurs when the sun, Earth, and moon align, causing Earth's shadow to cast an eerie, deep red hue on the moon. The phenomenon is attributed to sunlight scattering through Earth's atmosphere, with shorter blue wavelengths dispersing more easily, allowing red light to reach the moon. People in Asia, particularly India and China, had the best views, while Europeans and Africans caught a partial glimpse as the moon rose.</p>
