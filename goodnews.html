The review is expected to highlight an increased danger from Russia and China, leading to the creation of new defense factories and 1,800 jobs across the UK. The investment will support the procurement of up to 7,000 UK-built long-range weapons, addressing deficiencies highlighted by the war in Ukraine.

          <p>Skateboarding powerhouse Japan has welcomed the new Olympic age limit restricting competition to athletes 14 and older from the 2028 Los Angeles Games, despite the potential impact on its medal prospects. The decision by World Skate aims to reduce the risk of severe injuries among younger children as the technical difficulty of tricks increases. While some Japanese organizers will keep domestic competitions open to younger children, the overall sentiment is that the new restriction is a positive step for the sport's future and the safety of its participants.</p>

          <p>Japan has implemented an amendment to the Penal Code, prioritizing rehabilitation efforts in prisons for the first time in over a century. Imprisonment will no longer be categorized by labor requirements, allowing more time for rehabilitative guidance and education to reduce recidivism. The revised law introduces 24 tailored programs based on inmates' age, characteristics, and needs, including specialized curricula for elderly inmates and those with addiction issues. Inmates will be placed in prisons offering appropriate programs, with reviews every six months to adjust treatment plans as needed.</p>
