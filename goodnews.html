          <p>A new report from the Latino Donor Collaborative reveals that U.S. Latino immigrants generated $1.6 trillion in GDP in 2023, with the total U.S. Latino GDP growing 50% since 2015. This economic output, driven by increased education and entrepreneurship, positions the Latino cohort as a crucial driver of consumption and growth in the American economy. The research, conducted by Arizona State University economists, also warns that potential mass deportations could severely undermine this progress, potentially reducing total U.S. GDP by $2.3 trillion. The findings underscore the significant economic role of this demographic group. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, is set to announce a new investment program called "Pride in Place" to revitalize struggling high streets in over 330 communities. The funding will support locally-backed projects like tackling litter or building new sports grounds, with an emphasis on community involvement in decision-making. The plan also encourages councils to use existing powers to buy and repurpose derelict buildings and block the opening of unwanted betting and vape shops. The Conservative opposition criticized the move, claiming the investment would be offset by business tax hikes.</p>

          <p>With nearly half of Americans lacking a written financial plan, working with a professional advisor can provide crucial guidance, yet many don't know where to start. Experts recommend interviewing at least three advisors to find a good personal fit, as it's a long-term partnership. Prospective clients should conduct background checks using regulatory websites like FINRA's BrokerCheck and ask direct questions about their experience, compensation model, and approach to financial planning. It is important to find a professional with relevant credentials, such as a Certified Financial Planner (CFP), who understands one's specific life circumstances and financial goals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-25 07:30:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Keeneland September Yearling Sale, a major thoroughbred auction, saw record sales of $531.7 million, a significant increase from the previous year. Breeders and industry experts attribute this boom to recently renewed tax breaks, particularly the "bonus depreciation" rule that allows buyers to write off 100% of a racehorse purchase in the first year. This tax incentive, part of a recent spending bill, has reportedly encouraged investment in what is considered a highly speculative business. While the market is currently strong, some analysts caution that many buyers may have overpaid, leading to potential future losses. (not investment advice)</p>

The positive results mark the second consecutive quarter of strong performance, indicating that CEO Daniel Erver's turnaround strategy of tight cost controls and a focus on core products is proving effective. Despite the strong performance, H&M noted that its autumn collections have been well-received but warned that the full impact of U.S. tariffs on imports is expected to materialize in the coming months.

          <p>Patricia Lockwood's new novel, "Will There Ever Be Another You," adds a unique voice to the literature of illness by examining the profound and alienating effects of long COVID. The book follows a writer, also named Patricia, as she navigates the lingering symptoms of the virus, including memory loss, fever, and a sense of being replaced by a new self. The review highlights Lockwood's poetic prose and her ability to capture the deep curiosity and disorientation of chronic illness without offering a tidy resolution. The novel delves into how the condition reshapes one's relationship with language, self, and loved ones.</p>

          <h2>U.S.-Norway Dispute Over Caterpillar Divestment Appears to be Resolving</h2>

          <p>A diplomatic disagreement between the United States and Norway regarding the Norwegian sovereign wealth fund's divestment from Caterpillar seems to be easing, according to Norway's foreign minister. The $2 trillion fund sold its $2.1 billion stake in the U.S. company due to its equipment being used by Israel for the destruction of Palestinian property in Gaza and the West Bank. The move had troubled the U.S. State Department, but the Norwegian government explained that the decision was made independently by the central bank's board based on ethical guidelines, not as a government policy, which appears to have settled the matter.</p>

          <p>In an effort to make iPhones more usable for communication, Apple's iOS 26 update includes new features to screen unwanted calls and texts, which have become a major nuisance for most users. A new AI-powered call screening feature, which is off by default, has Siri ask unknown callers for their name and reason for calling, transcribing the response for the user in real-time. The update also enhances text message filtering, automatically sorting messages from unknown senders and suspected spam into separate folders. While these tools give users more control, they also add complexity and may not be a complete solution to the growing problem of scams.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a landmark ruling, a Spanish court has convicted a man for killing a puppy and for the first time applied a gender violence law to a case of animal abuse. The court on the island of Gran Canaria found the man guilty of throwing the four-month-old puppy he co-owned with his partner off a cliff to inflict psychological harm on her. The judge recognized this as "vicarious violence," a form of abuse where an aggressor harms a child or, in this case, a pet to cause suffering to their partner. The groundbreaking decision highlights Spain's pioneering role in combating gender-based violence.</p>

          <p>In a Carabao Cup match against Huddersfield, brothers Jaden and Reigan Heskey, sons of former England international Emile Heskey, both made their senior debuts for Manchester City. Manager Pep Guardiola brought on the two academy graduates, aged 19 and 17 respectively, in the second half of the 2-0 victory. Jaden, a midfielder, and Reigan, a winger, have been part of City's youth system since the age of eight. Their debut marks a proud moment for their family and continues a trend of sons of former Premier League players, like Erling Haaland, making their mark in English football.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests AI Has Changed the Method, Not the Rate, of Student Cheating</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread concern that AI tools like ChatGPT have caused a surge in academic dishonesty, early research indicates that overall cheating rates have not significantly increased. An education researcher argues that while some students now use AI to complete assignments, this behavior has largely replaced other methods of cheating, such as copying from online sources. Studies show that high levels of cheating existed long before generative AI, driven by factors like academic pressure and a perception that assignments are busy-work. The article suggests the focus should be on understanding why students cheat and adapting educational practices for an AI-filled world.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ticketmaster has agreed to improve its price transparency for consumers after an investigation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The probe was launched following complaints that fans were misled by unclear tiered pricing during the sale of tickets for Oasis's reunion tour. While the CMA found no evidence of algorithmic "dynamic pricing," it noted that the system was confusing. Ticketmaster will now have to provide more advance information about pricing structures and use accurate labeling, reporting regularly to the CMA for the next two years to ensure compliance with the new commitments.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), once the world's third busiest, has fallen to 11th in global rankings as passenger numbers have been slow to recover post-pandemic. The airport is in the midst of a $30-billion overhaul aimed at modernizing its infrastructure and improving the traveler experience ahead of the 2028 Olympics. Key projects include the long-delayed Automated People Mover train, which aims to connect terminals to transit and reduce traffic congestion. Airport officials hope the transformation will reverse the airport's decline and fix long-standing issues, turning it into a world-class facility.</p>
