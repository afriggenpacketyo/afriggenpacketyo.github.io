          <h2>Public Submits Diverse Ideas for UK Banknote Redesign, from Bulldogs to Mobile Phones</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 03:21:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Bank of England's public invitation for banknote redesign ideas has generated over 2,000 responses, despite the declining use of cash. Suggestions range from national treasures like Dudley the British Bulldog to themes celebrating UK maritime heritage with famous ships such as the Mary Rose. Other popular ideas include iconic landmarks like the Angel of the North, classic British children's TV characters, or vintage trains, reflecting a desire for nostalgia. While some advocate for retaining historical figures, others question the necessity of a major redesign given the prospect of a cashless society, with one even suggesting a mobile phone design.</p>

          <p>Heavy metal pioneers Black Sabbath, with their original lineup including Ozzy Osbourne, are set to perform one final, historic concert in Birmingham on July 5, 2025. Titled "Back to the Beginning," this show marks the first time in over 20 years the original members will play together, with proceeds benefiting Birmingham charities. The article recounts Osbourne's challenging life, from his industrial upbringing and early struggles with addiction, to his recent health setbacks, including Parkinson's disease. Despite these difficulties, his enduring love for music and his audience has driven him to this poignant farewell performance, joined by other metal greats.</p>

          <h2>US Space Force Poised for Significant Funding Increase Under Trump's New Bill</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 03:04:19 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's new tax and spending bill is poised to deliver a significant financial windfall to the U.S. Space Force, with a projected 30% year-on-year funding increase to nearly $40 billion in 2026. This includes a $25 billion initial investment in Trump's "Golden Dome" missile defense system, despite ongoing questions about its viability and cost. The funds aim to enhance "space superiority" through interceptors, advanced sensors, and command systems. For defense and space companies, this represents a rare investment opportunity amidst budget cuts elsewhere, with the long funding scope potentially coercing future administrations to continue the project.

          <h2>Pop Mart Unfazed by China's 'Blind Box' Criticism Due to Adult Demographic and Global Reach</h2>

          <p>China's state media criticized "blind box" toys, calling for tighter regulations, which initially caused a dip in Pop Mart International's share price. However, analysts believe the Labubu-maker will remain a top consumer brand, largely insulated from regulatory headwinds. This article explains that Pop Mart's primary demographic is Gen Z and millennials with adequate purchasing power, not young children, unlike some local peers. Furthermore, the company's increasing overseas sales, especially in Southeast Asia and North America, are expected to account for over half of its projected revenue in 2025, further cushioning any domestic regulatory impact and supporting its "dopamine economy" appeal.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe pieces of a small meteor that illuminated the night sky over parts of the UK on Thursday may have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. Dozens of people in the west Highlands reported an orange glow and a "bang," with some describing their houses shaking as if hit by a vehicle. UKMON, which tracks meteorites, calculated the meteor traveled from between Mars and Jupiter at 12,427mph before going dark. The organization is appealing to hillwalkers to look out for the space rock, though finding fragments in the vast mountainous area between lochs Treig and Etricht will be difficult.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump celebrated the passage of his signature tax and spending legislation at a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, calling it the "best birthday present for America." He used the event, officially marking the start of America’s 250th anniversary celebrations, as a campaign-style rally, reiterating election fraud claims and attacking the media. Trump announced plans for a "Great American State Fair" and, surprisingly, a UFC championship fight for 25,000 spectators on the White House grounds. He also indicated a policy shift, suggesting migrant laborers could stay if farmers vouched for them, acknowledging complaints about a depleted workforce.</p>

          <p>British tennis star Emma Raducanu aims to bridge the gap to world number one Aryna Sabalenka and other top players at Wimbledon 2025, despite a strong third-round victory against Marketa Vondrousova. Raducanu acknowledges the need for "more weapons" in her game, including better shot quality and serving, to compete with the sport's elite. While she feels comfortable and "at home" on the grass courts, her previous Grand Slam appearances this season ended in decisive defeats against top opponents like Iga Swiatek. The article highlights her determination to improve and the importance of her tight-knit support group as she seeks to advance further in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Dustin May delivered his best start of the season, pitching into the eighth inning for the first time in a 6-2 victory over the Chicago White Sox, completing a sweep. May, who has battled injuries and missed most of the last two seasons, has become a crucial workhorse for the Dodgers' pitching staff, which has seen numerous arms sidelined. He scattered four hits and struck out nine, taking a perfect game into the sixth inning. Manager Dave Roberts praised May's dependability and consistency, noting his ability to stabilize the rotation and provide the team with a chance to win every time he takes the mound.</p>

          <p>Cochlear, a leading medical technology company, has introduced its new smart hearing system to the Chinese market in June, making China one of the first global markets to receive the technology. The launch occurred through Hainan province and Hong Kong, signifying a fast-lane approach. This advanced implant system differs from traditional hearing aids by directly stimulating the auditory nerve with electrical signals from an external processor equipped with a noise-cancelling microphone, bypassing damaged hair cells in the inner ear. Chief Technology Officer Jan Janssen stated that the implant is particularly beneficial for users experiencing severe and profound hearing loss, for whom conventional hearing aids are no longer effective.</p>
