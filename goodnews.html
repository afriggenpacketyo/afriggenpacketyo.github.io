          <p>The Seattle Mariners secured a 3-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays, marking their first AL Championship Series appearance in 24 years. Cal Raleigh hit a tying homer, and Jorge Polanco delivered the go-ahead and an additional RBI single. Mariners pitchers, including Bryce Miller, Gabe Speier, Matt Brash, and Andrés Muñoz, delivered a stellar performance, limiting the Blue Jays to just two hits after the first inning. The team demonstrated resilience and strong pitching despite short rest from a previous extra-inning game.</p>

          <p>This BBC article playfully explores Britain's national obsession with discussing and complaining about the weather, inviting readers to compare their local forecasts with cities across the world. It questions whether other places truly experience more sunshine or if the UK's "green and pleasant land" is often underestimated. The interactive feature aims to engage the public with meteorological data, encouraging a lighthearted perspective on climate while providing current forecast information. This unique approach highlights cultural attitudes towards weather.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Chinese study involving mice suggests that fathers can pass on the benefits of exercise, such as improved muscle mass, lower body fat, and stronger bones, to their offspring through genetic mechanisms. Conversely, the children of inactive fathers showed poorer performance in physical tests. Researchers from Nanjing University and Nanjing Medical University found that injecting sperm microRNAs from exercised mice into fertilized eggs replicated these positive traits. This research indicates a potential cost-effective route to enhance offspring health through paternal exercise.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have decided to push Shohei Ohtani's next pitching start to later in the National League Championship Series, opting for Yoshinobu Yamamoto in Game 2. Manager Dave Roberts stated the change allows Yamamoto to maintain his regular rest schedule for a potential Game 6. This strategic shift also gives Ohtani more time to focus solely on his hitting, as he struggled offensively in the NL Division Series. The team aims to optimize its pitching rotation and help Ohtani "recalibrate" his performance at the plate.</p>

          <h2>Dow Futures Rise as Markets React to Trump's Reassuring Stance on China Trade</h2>

          <p>Dow futures surged nearly 400 points following President Trump's conciliatory remarks on Truth Social, aiming to calm market nerves after new tariff threats against China. Trump's statement, "Don’t worry about China, it will all be fine!", suggests a potential return to his "escalate to de-escalate" strategy, dubbed the "TACO trade" by some analysts. This shift in tone, coupled with Vice President Vance's comments, led market participants to view the recent tariff announcement as a negotiating tactic rather than a definitive trade war escalation. Investors are considering this a buying opportunity amidst the choppy market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swimming Australia has moved to debunk "fake news" and "fabricated quotes" falsely attributed to Olympic champion Mollie O’Callaghan regarding transgender athlete Lia Thomas. Posts circulating on social media claimed O'Callaghan stated she would not compete in the 2028 LA Games if a transgender swimmer were allowed, and that sharing a pool with Thomas was an "insult and a disgrace." Swimming Australia confirmed O'Callaghan never made such comments and has requested Meta to remove the misleading posts. The governing body reiterated its stance on current World Aquatics guidelines, which bar anyone undergoing male puberty from female categories.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the challenges of maintaining adult friendships amidst busy lives, where around half of friendships are lost every seven years. Psychologist Dr. Marisa Franco explains that life stage changes often make friendships "collateral damage." Relationship expert Claire Cohen emphasizes the importance of transparency, vulnerability, and creative approaches to connection, such as sharing mundane tasks. Science underscores the vital role of friendships in reducing mortality risk, comparable to diet and exercise. Experts advise embracing "messy" lives, prioritizing in-person meetings, and trusting that friends are more supportive than often perceived, encouraging proactive outreach to rekindle bonds.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Psychologists at the University of Sussex are utilizing thermal cameras to study stress, discovering that a drop in nose temperature reliably indicates stress levels and recovery. During an experimental stress test, volunteers' noses consistently cooled by several degrees as blood flow redirected to eyes and ears in a fight-or-flight response. This non-invasive technique, which measures a physical response, could revolutionize stress research by objectively monitoring stress in individuals, including babies or those unable to communicate. Researchers are also applying this method to assess and improve the well-being of great apes in sanctuaries.</p>

          <p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves to pursue comprehensive tax reform rather than "directionless tinkering and half-baked fixes" in the upcoming UK Budget. With pressure to raise tens of billions to meet fiscal rules, the IFS warns against economically harmful tax rises and suggests aligning overall tax rates across different income forms for fairness and growth. Recommendations include reforming property tax and capital gains tax, while cautioning against a wealth tax and restricting pension contribution relief. The Treasury aims for a balance between public service funding and encouraging investment. (not investment advice)</p>
