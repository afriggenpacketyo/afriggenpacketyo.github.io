          <p>A federal appeals court has largely maintained restrictions on immigration raids in the Los Angeles area, affirming a lower court's finding that the operations may have unconstitutionally targeted individuals based on race or ethnicity. The ruling requires federal agents from ICE and CBP to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone and prohibits them from using factors like speaking Spanish or being in a certain location as the sole basis for an arrest. The decision comes after high-profile raids by the Trump administration triggered widespread protests and fear within Southern California's large Latino community.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has increased its stake in data center operator Equinix, viewing the company's recent stock drop as a buying opportunity. The market reacted negatively to Equinix's plans for increased capital expenditures and a downgraded short-term forecast, but Elliott, with its deep experience in the data center sector, sees this as a strategic investment for long-term growth driven by AI demand. Elliott may push for improved market communication, cost structure optimization, and financial engineering to amplify returns for the company. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Surgeons Explain Neobladder Reconstruction Following Deion Sanders' Cancer Treatment</h2>

          <p>Following his treatment for bladder cancer, football coach Deion Sanders underwent a neobladder reconstruction, a procedure where surgeons create a new bladder from a segment of the patient's small intestine. This complex surgery involves removing the cancerous bladder and fashioning a new, functional organ that is then connected to the kidneys and urethra. Because the neobladder is made from the patient's own tissue, it is not rejected by the immune system, though patients must retrain themselves to manage urination, a challenge Sanders has publicly addressed to reduce stigma.</p>

          <p>Jim Irish, a 66-year-old California man in dire need of a kidney transplant, discovered an incredibly rare match in his wife, Mirna. After a grim diagnosis and complications that severely reduced his kidney function, the couple faced a potentially long and difficult wait for a donor. Against odds of approximately 1-in-100,000, Mirna was found to be a compatible genetic match for her husband. After overcoming additional health hurdles, the couple is now scheduled for the transplant surgery, a procedure Mirna calls a "blessing to be able to give life."</p>

          <p>This opinion column pushes back against recent comments from a 76ers executive and others who question the legitimacy of the Lakers' 2020 NBA championship. The author argues that winning inside the Orlando "Bubble" during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic required immense courage, mental fortitude, and resilience from players who were isolated from their families. Instead of an asterisk, the victory deserves an exclamation point for overcoming unprecedented circumstances, and dismissing it is a result of petty jealousy rather than valid criticism.</p>

          <p>In a landmark ruling, former Colombian President Álvaro Uribe has been sentenced to 12 years of house arrest for witness tampering and bribery. He was convicted of paying jailed paramilitary members to retract testimony linking him to the creation of right-wing death squads during the country's long civil war. This is the first time a former head of state in Colombia has been found guilty in a criminal trial, a verdict hailed by human rights groups as a major step against impunity, though Uribe plans to appeal.</p>
