          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a minimally invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into the patient's intracranial vasculature via a neck vein to help a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. This innovative technique, performed on a 67-year-old man suffering from hemiplegia after a stroke, aims to reduce the risks and recovery time associated with BCI implantation methods like those being developed by Elon Musk's Neuralink. The breakthrough represents a significant advancement in neurotechnology and patient rehabilitation.</p>

          <p>A Shandong Airlines flight traveling from Qingdao to Shanghai was forced to make an emergency landing in Nanjing due to an aircraft malfunction. Passengers aboard flight SC4667 reported hearing loud bangs followed by the plane shaking and a distinct burning odor that lasted for several minutes. One passenger speculated that an object might have been ingested by the aircraft's left engine. The airline confirmed the diversion was handled according to safety procedures and that all passengers were safely accommodated. The captain's announcement of the emergency landing and the subsequent smooth process were praised by those on board, highlighting the crew's professional handling of the frightening situation.</p>

          <p>Despite a sloppy performance characterized by a rough start from pitcher Dustin May and defensive errors, the Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 5-4 victory over the Kansas City Royals. The win propelled the Dodgers to sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball. Key offensive contributions from Shohei Ohtani, who hit his 29th home run, and Max Muncy, who added a two-run homer, were crucial in overcoming the early deficit. The game concluded with a dramatic, bases-loaded double play in the ninth inning, sealing a hard-fought win that manager Dave Roberts acknowledged was far from the team's best baseball, but demonstrated their ability to win ugly.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Acheampong, a Chelsea academy product, had a breakthrough season and recently signed a new five-year contract. Maresca praised the young player's potential to become a top defender for the club and emphasized that the best plan for his development is to remain at Stamford Bridge. Sources close to the player have also dismissed suggestions that he is frustrated at the club, reinforcing the long-term plan for him to succeed with Chelsea.</p>

          <p>The four giant pandas housed at Adventure World amusement park in Shirahama, Japan, have departed for China as their loan agreement expires. The departure of 24-year-old Rauhin and her three offspring leaves only two giant pandas remaining in Japan, both at Tokyo's Ueno Zoo, who are also scheduled to return next February. A farewell ceremony drew thousands of visitors who came to say goodbye to the beloved animals. The Wakayama zoo has had a highly successful joint breeding program with China since 1994, raising 17 cubs, but this departure marks a temporary end to the project, concluding a significant chapter of Japan's 'panda diplomacy'.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found a correlation between consuming a traditional Japanese-style diet and lower rates of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. Among nearly 12,500 employees studied, those who adhered to this diet were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. Researchers suggest that specific nutrients, such as the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables, may contribute to improved mental well-being by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, though further research is needed.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. The manhunt has been a multi-agency effort involving state and federal law enforcement, and at least 16 people have been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees. A $50,000 reward remains for information leading to the final fugitive's capture.</p>

The strawberries and cream sandwich, made with sweetened bread and whipped cream cheese, became the chain's top-selling sandwich immediately after its launch. This type of sandwich, featuring fruit and cream between soft white bread, has long been a popular snack in Japan and recently gained global popularity through social media. While unusual to some, the concept taps into a British fondness for pairing fruit with bread, seen in classic jam or banana sandwiches, and introduces a novel culinary item to a wider audience.</p>

The restoration project, undertaken by a Nagoya-based company, has carefully preserved the building's original architecture while adding modern wellness features like private saunas.

The show, which follows two sisters and their mother navigating financial and romantic struggles, is known for its dark humor and unflinching take on taboo subjects like mental health and abortion. Sadler, the writer, draws inspiration from their all-woman household upbringing and the "bleak" modern dating scene she observes online. The new series promises to be even more daring, with the sisters feeling that the success of the first season has given them the freedom to push their characters into even more twisted and funny situations.</p>

The plant, rich in minerals and fiber, is gaining appeal for its health benefits, which are being studied by universities. Researchers have found evidence that the cactus can enhance immune function. This initiative aligns with a global push, supported by the UN, to use the resilient cactus as a sustainable food source in the face of climate change.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists are revisiting a century-old medical concept known as phage therapy as a promising weapon against the growing crisis of antibiotic resistance. The therapy uses bacteriophages, a type of virus that specifically preys on and kills bacteria, to treat infections, including superbugs. A recent project at the University of Southampton successfully isolated a useful phage from a household toilet sample that was able to kill a persistent urinary tract infection in the lab. While regulatory pathways are still being developed, the potential of phage therapy to provide a targeted alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics is generating renewed excitement and hope in the medical community.</p>
