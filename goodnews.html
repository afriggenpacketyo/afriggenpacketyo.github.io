        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new museum exhibition re-examines the career of Rachel Ruysch, a 17th-century Dutch artist who was one of Europe's most celebrated flower painters, even more famous than Rembrandt in her lifetime. Growing up as the daughter of a renowned embalmer and anatomist, Ruysch's environment was filled with preserved natural specimens, which likely influenced her detailed still-life paintings. The article details her professional success, including becoming a court painter and winning the lottery, while also navigating the challenges faced by female artists of her era. Her work is noted for its technical perfection, scientific accuracy, and complex compositions that blended beauty with the darker aspects of nature.</p>

The 22-year-old Slovenia international has agreed to a five-year contract, becoming the club's third major offensive signing of the season. Sesko, who was also a target for Newcastle United, chose to join Manchester United despite their lower Premier League finish last season. Head coach Ruben Amorim and director of football Jason Wilcox praised his combination of pace, physical dominance, and strong character as essential additions to the team.</p>

          <p>A dog named Petunia has been crowned the winner of the "World's Ugliest Dog Contest" at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The annual event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of all dogs, emphasizing that pedigree is not what defines a pet. Petunia and her owner received a $5,000 prize for the victory. Organizers highlight that many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills, showcasing the positive side of animal adoption and encouraging potential owners to consider less conventional-looking companions.</p>

          <p>This article challenges the conventional idea that a "beach read" must be a light or frivolous book, arguing that a vacation can be the perfect time for any type of reading. It suggests that while some may prefer simple escapism, others might use the extra time and mental space to tackle more dense or serious subjects. The piece offers several curated lists from The Atlantic's editors, providing recommendations for books that can redirect one's attention, are perfect for getting lost in, or can help readers navigate new phases in their lives. The overall message is that the best vacation book is simply the one you want to read.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Struggling American shopping malls are finding new life by replacing defunct anchor stores with unconventional tenants, such as churches, entertainment complexes, and community hubs. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to Crossroads Church, which now draws thousands of people weekly and has spurred activity in the mall's other businesses. Industry executives note that subdividing large, empty retail spaces for niche businesses, restaurants, and experiential destinations is driving a rebound in mall traffic. This trend reflects a shift in viewing malls not just as retail centers but as community spaces.</p>

          <p>A preseason NFL game between the Detroit Lions and Atlanta Falcons was suspended after Lions safety Morice Norris sustained a serious injury during a tackle. Medical staff attended to Norris on the field for approximately 20 minutes before he was taken to a hospital, where he was reported to be in stable condition with feeling in all his extremities. Coaches from both teams agreed to end the game early, a decision supported by players who were visibly concerned for their fellow athlete. This incident follows similar game suspensions for serious injuries in the 2023 preseason.</p>

          <p>After a high school football player named Logan Coleridge suffered a concussion, his debilitating symptoms, including dizziness and severe headaches, persisted for months without a clear cause. When traditional therapies failed, a concussion specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed a rare condition called an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in the brain. The AVM, which Logan was likely born with, was the probable cause of his long-standing symptoms. He underwent successful surgery to remove the malformation and is now recovering, with his family advocating for earlier diagnostic imaging in similar cases.</p>

          <p>This article pays tribute to former CIA officer Sandra Grimes, who died on July 25 at the age of 79. In 1991, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to help investigate why the agency's Soviet informants had been compromised in the mid-1980s. Her meticulous investigation into financial records and activity logs was crucial in identifying fellow CIA officer Aldrich Ames as the mole. Ames was arrested in 1994 and convicted of espionage, having been paid millions by the Soviet Union for information that led to the execution of numerous U.S. assets.</p>

          <p>A San Francisco startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern-day alchemical plan to manufacture gold by repurposing neutrons generated during the nuclear fusion process. The idea, which is currently speculative and not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that turning elements like mercury into gold could create a valuable revenue stream to offset the high costs of developing fusion energy. While scientists have previously created minuscule amounts of gold in labs at exorbitant costs, Marathon believes its method could be commercially viable alongside fusion power plants. The concept hinges on the future success of commercial-scale fusion reactors, which remain a decade or more away.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is pushing satellite communications company Viasat to spin off its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) division. In a public letter, Carronade argues that Viasat is "materially misunderstood" and undervalued by the market, which incorrectly views it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm believes separating the high-growth, high-margin DAT business would unlock significant value for shareholders by highlighting its strengths independently of the consumer broadband segment.

          <p>China is moving forward with the development of the Xinjiang-Tibet Railway, a strategic project aimed at connecting its northwestern and southwestern regions. A new state-owned enterprise has been established to oversee the construction, which will link the existing Lhasa-Shigatse line with a new route from Hotan. This will create a nearly 2,000-kilometer artery across the Tibetan plateau. The railway is a key part of a larger plan to establish a 5,000-kilometer high-plateau rail network centered on Lhasa by 2035, enhancing connectivity and enabling diversified operations like tourism and real estate development.</p>

Recommendations include checking if your current plan, like some from T-Mobile, already includes international roaming for basic use. For heavier data users, purchasing a local or international eSIM from providers like Airalo is often a cheaper and more flexible option than daily carrier packages. Finally, the most straightforward method is to maximize the use of free Wi-Fi and prepare for offline use by downloading maps and guidebooks before leaving home. (not investment advice)</p>
