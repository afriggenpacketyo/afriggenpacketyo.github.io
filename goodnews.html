          <p>Astronomers have discovered a rare, Jupiter-sized gas giant named AT2021uey b, located approximately 3,200 light-years from Earth. The planet was found using gravitational microlensing, a method based on Albert Einstein's theory of relativity that has only been successfully used three times before. This technique relies on a massive celestial object passing in front of a more distant star, causing the star's light to bend and magnify, revealing the object's presence. The discovery, first spotted in 2021, required extensive data analysis and highlights a powerful, albeit challenging, method for detecting planets that are otherwise invisible to more common techniques.</p>

          <p>A new educational pilot program is being trialed in primary schools in Kent, UK, teaching children as young as five about sun safety to prevent future cases of skin cancer. The initiative, which will be integrated into nationwide curriculum by 2026, aims to address the rising rates of melanoma, the most serious skin cancer linked to UV exposure. Experts emphasize that sunburn during childhood significantly increases later-life risk, and the program focuses on teaching children to read UV indexes and apply sunscreen correctly. The effort is supported by dermatologists and cancer charities, who highlight prevention as key to reversing the trend of increasing diagnoses.</p>

          <p>Japan successfully launched its 50th and final H2A rocket, marking the end of a 24-year career for the country's flagship space vehicle. The rocket, developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and JAXA, lifted off from Tanegashima Island and placed a government satellite into orbit to monitor greenhouse gases. The H2A series, which had a 98% success rate, is now being replaced by the more cost-effective H3 rocket. The transition is part of Japan's effort to remain competitive in the global satellite-launch market, which is increasingly dominated by private companies like SpaceX.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people participated in Budapest's Pride march, turning the event into a large-scale protest against Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. The march proceeded despite a government ban, which was based on a controversial law equating homosexuality with pedophilia. Budapest's mayor, Gergely Karacsony, supported the event, framing it as a celebration of human rights and a peaceful defiance of a "hateful power." Many participants, including those who do not typically attend, were motivated by the ban itself, using the occasion to voice broader frustrations with the government's authoritarian direction.</p>

His workload remains limited as he recovers from Tommy John surgery, but his dominant flashes have been a major positive for the team.

He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI using far fewer AI chips, as a prime example of this progress in the ongoing technological race.</p>
