          <p>President Trump announced an agreement with Pfizer to voluntarily lower U.S. drug prices, with the company committing to sell medications to Medicaid at the lowest price offered in other developed nations. As part of the deal, Pfizer will also invest $70 billion in U.S. manufacturing and be exempt from potential pharmaceutical tariffs for three years. The administration is launching a website, TrumpRx.gov, where consumers can directly purchase popular Pfizer drugs like Eucrisa and Duavee at discounts of up to 85%, a move that follows pressure from Trump's "most favored nation" policy.</p>

          <p>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, in collaboration with the FBI and ICE, conducted a major operation in Minneapolis called "Operation Twin Shield," targeting immigration fraud. The investigation reviewed 1,000 cases and found issues in 275, including instances of sham marriages for citizenship, elder abuse and exploitation, and the use of a fabricated death certificate. This operation is the first of its kind following a new rule expanding USCIS's law enforcement duties, signaling a more aggressive enforcement posture under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has introduced a new national education target, aiming for two-thirds of young people to attend university, pursue further education, or complete a "gold standard apprenticeship" by age 25. This marks a significant policy shift away from Tony Blair's 1999 goal of sending 50% of youth to university, placing a greater emphasis on technical and vocational skills. The new ambition, announced at the Labour Party conference, seeks to elevate the status of skills training and better align education with job market needs, a move welcomed by industry groups.</p>

          <p>DoorDash has launched a fleet of autonomous delivery robots, named "Dots," on the streets of Phoenix, Arizona. These five-foot-tall red bots are designed to handle smaller orders, can travel up to 20 miles per hour, and are capable of navigating bike lanes, roads, and sidewalks. The company's AI-powered platform determines which deliveries are best suited for the robots, aiming to create a more efficient and economical system for local commerce. This initiative positions Phoenix at the forefront of automated delivery technology, complementing DoorDash's existing network of human drivers.</p>

          <p>Arianna Huffington, CEO of Thrive Global, is advocating against the "collective delusion" that equates overworking with success, drawing from her personal experience with burnout and scientific evidence. After collapsing from exhaustion in 2007, she realized that success should not come at the cost of one's health and well-being. Huffington now promotes the concept of "micro steps"—small, incremental changes to daily habits—to foster a healthier and more sustainable path to achievement. She emphasizes that data shows individuals are more effective, creative, and resilient when they prioritize time to recharge.</p>

          <p>In his advice column, writer James Parker responds to a reader who has lost the creative fire for their writing project. Parker shares his own experience of losing his passion for writing odes after publishing a book on the topic, a state he calls losing "the odeness." He advises that this creative energy can return, often in an altered form, and suggests broadening one's range to more abstract or unusual subjects. He concludes that odes do not always need to be rapturous or jolly; they simply need to be authentic expressions of observation.</p>

          <p>A new Hulu documentary, "Lilith Fair: Building a Mystery," revisits the iconic all-female touring music festival of the late 1990s, aiming to correct its caricature as "Lesbopalooza" and highlight its cultural impact. Co-founded by Sarah McLachlan, the festival was a pragmatic response to an industry that marginalized female artists, refusing to play their songs back-to-back on the radio. The film showcases how Lilith Fair created a rare sense of community, safety, and collective power for both performers and audiences, demonstrating the commercial and cultural force of women in music.</p>

Musicians perform banned anti-war songs in public spaces, echoing the role artists played during the final years of the Soviet Union. The government has designated many popular artists as foreign agents and outlawed their music, but this has often backfired, increasing their popularity.
