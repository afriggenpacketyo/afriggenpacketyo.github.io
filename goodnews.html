          <p>Senators Tim Scott and Cynthia Lummis are unveiling a framework for a bill to establish regulatory guidelines for digital assets. The proposed legislation seeks to define cryptocurrencies as commodities or securities, allowing crypto exchanges to register with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and reducing SEC oversight. The bill also aims to incorporate measures to prevent money laundering and sanctions evasion. Scott hopes to build on recent bipartisan momentum in the Senate regarding crypto regulation, and the Senate Banking Committee's subcommittee on digital assets will hold a hearing on the bill.

          <p>NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte is encouraging European nations and Canada to concentrate on increasing their defense spending rather than worrying about the United States potentially withdrawing from the alliance. Rutte emphasized that the U.S. remains committed to NATO, but expects its allies to meet their defense spending commitments. The US President Donald Trump has been pushing for non-US partners to increase their defence spending from about 2 per cent of GDP to 5 per cent, a level that Rutte said would be agreed to during the two-day summit, which Trump is scheduled to attend. Rutte acknowledged that the current imbalance in defense spending is a significant source of tension.</p>

          <p>Senator Lisa Murkowski has released a memoir detailing her experiences as a moderate Republican during the Trump era, including her opposition to attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act and her vote to convict Trump after the January 6th insurrection. Murkowski acknowledges the lasting impact of Trump's dominance on right-wing politics and expresses concern about the security of American democracy. She points to the need for Congress to oversee the executive branch and fulfill its constitutional duties, citing potential votes on restricting Trump's ability to bomb Iran and a White House proposal to cut foreign aid.

          <p>Oil prices declined after President Trump cautioned Israel against violating the newly announced ceasefire with Iran. Brent crude prices fell nearly $2 per barrel, reversing gains from the previous session, as concerns about supply disruptions in the Middle East eased. The initial hostilities between Iran and Israel had added roughly 10% to oil prices, but Trump's announcement of a ceasefire has alleviated some of those concerns. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz remains a risk factor, but analysts suggest that oil prices could surge past $100 per barrel in such a scenario. (not investment advice)</p>

Camps also teach children nostalgia for a romanticized American past, which has played a role in their lasting cultural influence.

Reading fiction allows one to escape from their own consciousness and surroundings, and it allows one to be more aware of how an author has manipulated reality. Literature allows one to occupy a place that is totally for oneself, and unaccountable to other people‚Äôs expectations, and the author states that the freedom found in the physical world can be found in the pages of a novel.</p>
