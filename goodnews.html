          <p>Somalia's construction boom in Mogadishu is providing unexpected opportunities for women in engineering.  Fathi Mohamed Abdi and Saadia Ahmed Omar, two young female engineers, are overseeing major projects, despite initial skepticism.  The high demand for skilled professionals is creating space for women in a traditionally male-dominated field.  However, challenges remain, including a lack of mentorship and concerns about building quality and safety.</p>

          <p>A report highlights the UK's relatively meager paternity leave compared to other European nations.  The UK offers only two weeks of paid leave, while countries like Spain (16 weeks), Denmark (24 weeks), and Sweden (90 days reserved for fathers) provide significantly more generous benefits.  Fathers across Europe shared their experiences, emphasizing the positive impact of extended leave on family bonding and reducing parental stress. The UK's system is criticized for being insufficient and complex.</p>
