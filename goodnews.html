          <p>A cohort of European leaders is traveling to Washington to meet with President Donald Trump alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, aiming to align U.S. objectives with their own regarding the war in Ukraine. Their primary goals are to secure robust, NATO-like security guarantees for a post-war Ukraine, halt the ongoing violence, and gain support for a trilateral peace negotiation that includes Zelenskyy at the table with Trump and Putin. This diplomatic effort follows concerns that Trump's stance may have softened towards Russia after his recent summit in Alaska, prompting Europe to reinforce its support for Kyiv's sovereignty and long-term security.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Bournemouth has agreed to a £25 million deal to sign 19-year-old winger Ben Doak from Liverpool, with the transfer expected to be finalized shortly. The deal consists of an initial £20 million fee with an additional £5 million in performance-related add-ons. Doak, a Scottish international who spent last season on loan at Middlesbrough, is seeking more first-team opportunities, which were limited at Anfield. The move is part of a busy summer for Bournemouth, which is actively rebuilding its squad after several high-profile player sales.</p>

          <p>Global markets are showing cautious optimism as European and Ukrainian leaders meet with President Trump to discuss a potential end to the war in Ukraine, but experts are tempering expectations for a swift conclusion. Analysts note that peace agreements are typically lengthy and complex processes, suggesting that Russia may be using the talks to prolong the conflict without committing to a genuine ceasefire. While the prospect of peace is influencing market behavior, particularly boosting European defense stocks, financial experts advise that any resolution will be a long, difficult negotiation rather than a quick fix.

          <p>A Minnesota fisherman using a sonar device on the Mississippi River discovered a submerged 1960s-era Buick, leading to a potential breakthrough in a nearly 60-year-old missing person case. Authorities recovered the vehicle and found human remains inside. The car's VIN number identified it as belonging to Roy Benn, who was reported missing in September 1967 and was last seen driving his Buick Electra. While the remains await formal identification, investigators believe they belong to Benn and have notified his remaining family, bringing them closer to long-awaited closure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new biography, "Baldwin: A Love Story" by Nicholas Boggs, is being hailed as a definitive work on the iconic writer James Baldwin, delving deeply into the connection between his personal relationships and his literary genius. The book meticulously researches how Baldwin's experiences as a Black, gay man in a hostile America, and his complex love affairs abroad, shaped his seminal works like "Giovanni's Room" and "The Fire Next Time." Boggs offers fresh insights, including the discovery of a previously unknown romantic partner, arguing that Baldwin masterfully transmuted the turmoil of his private life into powerful indictments of systemic racism and sexual hypocrisy. The review concludes that this biography should become the new gold standard for Baldwin studies.</p>

          <p>In a personal essay, the writer reflects on inheriting her grandmother's gold watch, a piece prominently featured in a self-portrait, and considers its role as a talisman connecting her to the past. The author explores the idea that jewelry, more than clothing, defines our core identity, becoming a daily emblem of who we are. She contemplates her grandmother's constant self-reinvention—from ballet dancer to painter—and sees her collection of eclectic jewelry as a key part of that performance of self. The essay concludes that our accessories are not superficial but are integral to the process of becoming our most authentic selves.</p>

          <p>This article profiles Zohran Mamdani, the Democratic Socialist candidate for mayor of New York City, examining his efforts to balance his socialist ideals with the need to appeal to mainstream voters. The piece traces his political journey through the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), an organization that helped propel his rise but also presents ideological challenges due to its more radical factions. As Mamdani courts mainstream figures like Elizabeth Warren and softens his past "defund the police" rhetoric, he faces both deep-seated opposition from the city's donor class and the task of uniting a fractious political left to govern a city of 8.5 million people.</p>

          <p>Shares of Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk surged nearly 5% following the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's accelerated approval for its popular obesity drug, Wegovy, to treat a serious liver disease.

This approval marks a significant expansion of Wegovy's applications beyond weight loss and diabetes, making it the first GLP-1 class drug approved for MASH.

After losing his long-held Ottawa-area seat in the last general election, Poilievre needs a decisive victory in this conservative stronghold to re-enter the House of Commons and solidify his leadership ahead of a mandatory party review. The race is unusual, featuring a record 214 candidates, many from a protest group advocating for electoral reform. The margin of his expected victory will be closely scrutinized as a measure of his standing within the party and his ability to challenge Prime Minister Mark Carney.</p>
