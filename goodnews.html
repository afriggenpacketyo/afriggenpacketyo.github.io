          <p>A new biography, "Power and the Palace," reveals that Queen Camilla, as a teenager in the mid-1960s, fought off a man who groped her on a London train. She reportedly struck the assailant with her shoe and subsequently reported him to an official, leading to his arrest. This personal experience is believed to be a key reason for her dedicated support of charities that assist survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault. The story, shared by a former aide to Boris Johnson, highlights a formative event that has shaped her public advocacy work for decades.</p>

          <p>Actor and producer Issa Rae is executive producing "Seen and Heard: The History of Black Television," a two-part HBO documentary exploring the evolution of Black representation in the medium. The series examines how Black creators and artists have revolutionized the industry while facing significant challenges, featuring interviews with icons like Oprah Winfrey and Shonda Rhimes. Rae explains that seeing people who looked like her on TV was essential to her own career, and the documentary will also explore the importance of diversity behind the camera.

          <h2>Federal Judge Rules Trump Administration's Troop Deployment in Los Angeles Was Unlawful</h2>

          <p>A federal court in California has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of National Guard members and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles violated the Posse Comitatus Act. The 1878 law prohibits using the military for domestic law enforcement, which the judge found occurred when troops were used for crowd control and other policing activities during protests. The ruling blocks the administration from using military forces for such purposes in California, though it does not require the withdrawal of troops currently protecting federal property. The decision stems from a lawsuit filed by California Governor Gavin Newsom.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk has asserted that the company's humanoid robot, Optimus, will eventually account for approximately 80% of Tesla's total value. This prediction comes as the automaker faces a sales slump and increasing competition, prompting Musk to shift investor focus toward future technologies like AI-powered robots and robotaxis. While Optimus has not yet been released to the market, Musk has previously suggested it could propel Tesla to a $25 trillion valuation. The company aims to begin pilot production of the robots in its Fremont factory in 2025. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article outlines the process and difficulty of qualifying for a reverse mortgage, a loan that allows seniors to convert home equity into cash. While generally easier to obtain than traditional mortgages, applicants must meet specific federal criteria for the common Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM). Key requirements include being at least 62 years old, using the property as a primary residence, and having sufficient home equity. Lenders also conduct a financial assessment to ensure borrowers can cover ongoing costs like taxes and insurance, and mandatory counseling is required to explain the loan's implications.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, this article explains how consumers facing financial hardship can qualify for forbearance. This temporary relief allows borrowers to pause or reduce payments without penalty, but eligibility typically requires demonstrating a legitimate hardship such as job loss or a medical emergency. A strong prior payment history can improve the chances of approval, and borrowers must proactively contact their card issuers to apply. For those who don't qualify, alternative options like debt consolidation or management plans are also discussed as potential solutions. (not investment advice)</p>
