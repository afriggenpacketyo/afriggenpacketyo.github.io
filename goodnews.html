          <h2>Trump Administration Anticipates UK Trade Deal Announcement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 23:03:21 EDT</div>

          <p>President Trump indicated a potential trade deal announcement with a "big, and highly respected, country" to occur in the Oval Office. This news follows Trump's prior imposition of tariffs, including a 10% tariff on most countries and higher reciprocal rates, which were later suspended for 90 days, though the UK was still impacted by tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum. The announcement has led to a rise in the value of the British pound against the US dollar, signaling potential economic impacts and shifts in international trade relations. The administration has engaged in meetings with trading partners, and this deal could mark the beginning of a series of trade agreements.</p>

          <p>Apple is seeking a pause on a recent court decision in its case against Epic Games, arguing that the ruling could cost the company "substantial sums". The court had found Apple in contempt for violating an earlier order regarding its App Store policies, specifically related to commissions on in-app purchases made through external web links. Apple claims the required changes will negatively impact its business and reduce consumer choice, while Epic Games argues the ruling forces Apple to compete. The judge in the case also made a criminal referral, accusing Apple of misleading the court.</p>
