          <p>Singapore's economy demonstrated surprising resilience by expanding 4.3% year-over-year in the second quarter, significantly outperforming the 3.5% growth forecasted by economists and accelerating from the previous quarter. This robust performance was largely propelled by the manufacturing sector, which grew by 5.5%, highlighting its crucial role in the nation's economic health. However, official government statements from the Ministry of Trade and Industry tempered the optimism, underscoring persistent and significant uncertainty in the global economy. The ministry specifically pointed to downside risks stemming from unclear U.S. tariff policies, maintaining a cautious outlook for the second half of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australia is enhancing its strategic partnership with the Philippines through expanded civil maritime cooperation, including vessel donations, training programs, and educational scholarships. This move is part of a plan to double investment in such initiatives to A$11.5 million by 2029, reflecting deepening diplomatic ties as the two nations approach their 80th anniversary of relations. Analysts note that this strengthening defense alliance occurs as Australia carefully balances its security interests in the region with its significant trade relationship with China. The collaboration aims to bolster the Philippines' maritime capabilities amid regional geopolitical complexities.</p>

          <h2>Technology and Engineering Fields Dominate Chinese Students' University Choices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 20:00:55 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A significant trend is emerging in Chinese higher education, with students increasingly prioritizing technology-focused academic majors like information technology and vehicle engineering. This shift reflects a strategic, state-driven effort to bolster the nation's technological capabilities amid intensified competition with the United States. Fields that were popular two decades ago, such as international trade and urban planning, have been supplanted by engineering disciplines seen as critical for future industrial development. This change in academic priorities indicates a broader alignment of educational pathways with national strategic goals to secure a leading position in global technology.</p>

          <p>The Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland is celebrating a remarkable scientific achievement: 230 years of continuous, daily weather observation. This unbroken tradition of handwritten data, which began on July 14, 1795, constitutes the longest such sequence in the UK and Ireland. The records provide an invaluable resource for climate science, documenting major weather events like the infamous 'Night of the Big Wind' in 1839 and contributing to meteorological advancements like the cup anemometer. The observatory continues its tradition of manual data collection, providing a unique human element in an era of automated weather stations.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers concluded the first half of the baseball season with a 5-2 extra-innings victory over the San Francisco Giants, securing a comfortable 5.5-game lead in the NL West. Despite high expectations from their record-setting payroll, the team's performance has been a mix of highs and lows, marked by a star-studded offense but also an injury-plagued pitching staff and uncharacteristic slumps. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto has been a standout performer, while the bullpen has shown vulnerabilities. The team's first-half success positions them well, but also highlights areas needing improvement as they aim for a repeat championship.</p>

          <p>King Charles has scheduled President Trump's second state visit for September 17-19, a period when the UK Parliament will be in recess for party conferences. This timing effectively removes the possibility of the US president addressing Parliament, an honor extended to past leaders like Barack Obama and Emmanuel Macron but one that would have been controversial for Trump. The visit is seen as a diplomatic success for the White House, while UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer aims to use the strengthened relationship to negotiate on trade issues, particularly tariffs on steel exports. Despite the royal welcome, the visit is still expected to attract public protests.</p>

He posits that despite widespread institutional selling, a bull market is being driven by individual investors, potentially due to a pro-business environment and deflationary pressures from artificial intelligence. Cramer suggests that a laissez-faire regulatory approach and a pro-dealmaking stance from federal agencies are creating favorable conditions for stock market growth, even if the president's methods and rhetoric remain controversial and divisive among professional money managers.
