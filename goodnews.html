          <p>Lewis Hamilton expressed his devastation after hitting a groundhog during the Canadian Grand Prix, which caused damage to his car and impacted his race performance. Hamilton, a vegan and animal lover, was more concerned about the animal's well-being than the setback to his race. The incident occurred on the 13th lap, leaving a hole in the floor of his Ferrari SF-25, and the team estimated that the damage cost Hamilton about half-a-second per lap. George Russell won the race, with Max Verstappen finishing second.</p>

          <p>Music therapy is proving to be as effective as traditional cognitive behavioral therapy in managing the symptoms and anxieties associated with cancer. A recent study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting highlighted the benefits of a hybrid therapy combining talk, music, and lyrical composition. The approach offers a creative outlet for processing emotions, and music therapy differs from passive listening or playing music alone due to the therapeutic collaboration involved. For some patients, music can give expression to emotions for which there are no apt words, offering healing and stress regulation.</p>

          <p>A new drug, Vykat XR, has been approved for treating Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder causing insatiable hunger, while concerns rise over potential cuts to medical research funding. The drug eases the relentless hunger associated with the syndrome, and its research may offer insights into the biology of extreme appetite and binge eating. This breakthrough comes as other drugs are revolutionizing how doctors treat obesity, which affects more than 40% of American adults, but researchers worry that government efforts to dismantle the nation's infrastructure for medical discovery will impact future progress. While a spokesperson said no NIH awards for Prader-Willi syndrome research have been cut, the uncertainty is still present.</p>

The trade corridor aims to connect India with Europe through the Middle East and Cyprus via sea and railway.
