          <p>Japan and NATO have agreed to enhance their collaboration to address pressing global security challenges, including the Middle East crisis, Russia's war in Ukraine, and North Korea's abductions of Japanese nationals. During discussions between Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte in The Hague, both parties affirmed their commitment to elevating cooperation across various sectors, notably in defense industries. SBI Shinsei Bank plans to repay the remaining 230 billion yen in public funds received after the collapse of its predecessor, the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, following Japan's asset price bubble. An earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.0 hit Akuseki Island in the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan, following more than 330 quakes recorded around the chain since Saturday.</p>

          <p>A study led by China suggests that a global solar-wind energy network could meet the world's energy demands by 2050, producing three times the necessary power at a lower cost than independent regional systems. The researchers propose a network that leverages regions with abundant renewable energy potential to supply energy across continents. They acknowledge that establishing such a system requires navigating geopolitical boundaries and crises, such as the Ukraine war. The study highlights that successful global interconnection could improve energy efficiency, ease the economic burden of decarbonization, and provide resilience against conflict and climate extremes. </p>

          <p>Chelsea secured their place in the last 16 of the Club World Cup thanks to a composed 3-0 victory over Esp√©rance. Liam Delap scored his first goal for his new club and although Chelsea finished behind Flamengo in Group D there are benefits to going through in second place. Chelsea will head to Charlotte to face Benfica, who are experienced competitors at Champions League level. The picture does look rosier than after last Friday‚Äôs ragged 3-1 defeat to Flamengo.</p>

          <h2>Left-Wing Outsider Challenges Cuomo Comeback in NYC Mayoral Race</h2>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani, a left-wing New York state assemblyman, is challenging former Governor Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral race. Mamdani has gained momentum by focusing on affordability issues and advocating for policies such as free public buses and universal childcare. The race is viewed as a proxy war between the left and moderates within the Democratic Party. The outcome could have implications for the party nationally as it seeks to take on Donald Trump. </p>

          <p>Once 40 points behind, Mamdani has closed the gap with Cuomo and led in a few polls. He said that voters in the most expensive US city want Democrats to focus on affordability. His platform includes free public buses, universal childcare, freezing rent in subsidized units, and city-run grocery stores. Critics question such ambitious promises, but the millennial progressive, who would be the city's first Muslim and South Asian mayor, has leaned into his roots in a diverse city.</p>
