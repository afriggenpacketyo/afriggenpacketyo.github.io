          <p>Despite leading the fan vote for the WNBA All-Star Game and being named a team captain, Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark was ranked only ninth-best among guards by her fellow players. The voting process combines fan, media, and player rankings, with fan votes accounting for 50%. While Clark was first with fans and third with media, the lower ranking from her peers was notable. Her recent injury struggles and contentious on-court moments this season may have influenced the players' perspectives on her performance.</p>

          <p>A coffee craze is spreading beyond China's cities and into its countryside, fueled by a growing domestic market and social media trends. Consumers are increasingly seeking out rural cafes that offer unique natural settings, contributing to a coffee industry now valued at over $40 billion. However, some observers question the long-term viability of this trend, suggesting that many new cafes rely on a novelty factor that may not be sustainable. Despite this, China's coffee consumption is projected to continue its double-digit growth, marking a significant cultural shift.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers experienced a shift in their roster as NBA free agency began, losing forward Dorian Finney-Smith to the Houston Rockets on a four-year, $53-million contract. Finney-Smith, a key defensive player for the team, had opted out of his previous deal with the Lakers. In a swift response, the Lakers secured a new wing player, agreeing to a two-year, $12-million deal with forward Jake LaRavia.

          <p>Despite widespread concerns, President Trump's tariffs have not yet led to significant inflation in the U.S., with key price indexes remaining relatively stable. Economists point to several short-term mitigation strategies employed by businesses to buffer the impact on consumers. These include aggressively pre-ordering inventory before tariffs took effect, absorbing some of the costs to maintain market share, and utilizing legal loopholes like foreign trade zones to delay duty payments. While these tactics have provided a temporary cushion, experts warn that prices are still likely to rise later in the year if the tariffs remain in place. (not investment advice)</p>
