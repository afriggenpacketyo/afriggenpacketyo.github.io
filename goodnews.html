        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following deadly floods in Central Texas, Senator Maria Cantwell is pressing the Trump administration to invest in modernizing the nation's weather forecasting infrastructure, arguing it will save both lives and money. In a letter to the president, Cantwell outlined recommendations including upgrading Doppler radar, replacing aging weather satellites, and investing in supercomputing to improve forecast accuracy. The push comes as the administration plans significant budget cuts for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). A White House spokesperson responded that the administration is already working to refocus NOAA on its core mission and modernize its technology, moving away from what it terms "climate change activism."</p>

          <h2>Florida Governor DeSantis Responds to Former NY Governor Cuomo's Joke About Moving to Florida</h2>

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis publicly responded to a joke made by former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who quipped he would move to Florida if he loses the NYC mayoral race to socialist candidate Zohran Mamdani. On social media, DeSantis posted, "Don’t New York our Florida!" reflecting his frequent criticism of policies in Democrat-led states. Cuomo, who lost the Democratic primary, is running as an independent and made the comment at a private event in the Hamptons. His adviser later clarified the remark was intended to underscore the high stakes of the election and the perceived risk of electing a socialist mayor to lead New York City.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Fans Await Opening of Highly Anticipated Themed Diner in Hollywood</h2>

          <p>Eager fans lined up outside the new Tesla Diner in Hollywood, a futuristic, saucer-shaped restaurant that Elon Musk has been planning since 2018. The establishment, which features superchargers for electric vehicles and two drive-in movie screens, blends retro American diner style with high-tech elements. Despite social media rumors of a public opening, the diner remained closed to the general public on Monday afternoon, though it had held a soft opening for first responders and Tesla Club members over the weekend. Musk has suggested that if the concept proves successful, Tesla will establish similar diners in major cities worldwide, expanding the brand's unique lifestyle appeal.</p>

          <p>PepsiCo has announced the upcoming launch of a new prebiotic cola, aiming to capture the growing market of health-conscious consumers. The new beverage, available in cola and cherry vanilla flavors, will contain prebiotic fiber, five grams of cane sugar, and no artificial sweeteners, with only 30 calories per serving. This move comes after PepsiCo's nearly $2 billion acquisition of Poppi, a popular prebiotic soda brand marketed as a healthier alternative. The introduction of this product is part of Pepsi's broader strategy to offer healthier options and boost sales, which also includes launching protein-enhanced snacks and removing artificial ingredients from popular chip brands.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has confirmed the withdrawal of all 700 active-duty U.S. Marines from Los Angeles, more than a month after their deployment by the Trump administration to address protests. The deployment, which was met with strong objections from state and city officials who deemed it unnecessary and provocative, was intended to protect federal property during demonstrations against immigration enforcement sweeps. A Pentagon spokesperson stated the marines' presence had achieved its aim of restoring order and upholding the rule of law. This redeployment follows the earlier withdrawal of 2,000 National Guard troops, marking an end to the controversial federal military presence in the city.</p>

          <p>Argentina has announced it will ease visa requirements for Chinese nationals, a significant diplomatic gesture toward Beijing as President Javier Milei's administration navigates its foreign policy. Under the new policy, Chinese citizens holding valid U.S. or European Union visas will no longer need a separate Argentine visa for tourism or business travel. This change comes amid delays in trade negotiations with the United States and growing American unease over Argentina's strengthening relationship with China. The move highlights the delicate balancing act Argentina faces as it seeks to maintain positive relations and economic ties with both global superpowers.</p>

          <p>Players at the WNBA All-Star Game wore shirts with the message "Pay us what you owe us" to highlight their ongoing labor negotiations with the league. The demonstration follows a recent meeting where players and the WNBA failed to reach a new collective bargaining agreement after players opted out of the last one. A key issue is the revenue-sharing model; players are seeking a larger share of the league's growing income, which currently stands at 9.3% for players compared to the NBA's roughly 50-50 split. With the WNBA's rapid growth in viewership, merchandise sales, and expansion, players argue their salaries should reflect their contribution to the league's success.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For homeowners needing $20,000, home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) offer lower interest rates than personal loans or credit cards. As of July 2025, the average interest rates for both products are nearly identical, with a HELOC at 8.27% and a home equity loan at 8.28%. This results in almost the same monthly payment for a 10- or 15-year term. However, a key difference is that HELOC rates are variable and can change with market conditions, while home equity loan rates are fixed. Borrowers should consider this variability, as even a small rate increase could raise monthly payments. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article advises savers considering a $20,000 short-term certificate of deposit (CD) to weigh several factors in the current economic climate. While short-term CDs currently offer high interest rates around 4.50%, providing protection against market volatility, savers may earn more over time with a long-term CD despite its lower rate. The analysis also points out that the most competitive CD rates are typically offered by online banks, which may require moving funds from a traditional, local institution. Given the penalties for early withdrawal, it is crucial for investors to carefully compare options before committing a large sum. (not investment advice)</p>

The images show several uncrewed aircraft that do not match known Chinese designs, appearing to be advanced drones intended to operate alongside crewed fighter jets. This development aligns with China's broader push into crewed-uncrewed teaming capabilities, with designs like the GJ-11 stealth UCAV at the forefront. The potential reveal underscores China's rapidly advancing position as a global leader in uncrewed aviation technology, pursuing capabilities the U.S. military has moved away from in the unclassified domain.</p>

          <p>Archived comments from the late billionaire investor Charlie Munger have resurfaced, revealing his pointed advice on homeownership. At a 1998 Berkshire Hathaway meeting, Munger stated he believed buying a house was primarily a need for married couples, famously quipping, "The single people, I don't care if they ever get a house." He framed homeownership as a decision of utility, suggesting it should be pursued when one's life circumstances, particularly family needs, require it. This perspective contrasts with the common view of home buying as a default milestone, offering a pragmatic, if blunt, take that resonates today amid soaring home prices and affordability challenges for many individuals.</p>
