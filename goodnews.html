          <p>Georgia Governor Brian Kemp announced that he will not seek the Republican nomination for the Georgia Senate seat in 2026, a key contest for control of Congress. Kemp stated that being on the ballot next year is not the right decision for him and his family. He has committed to working with Senate GOP leadership and President Trump to ensure a strong Republican nominee. This decision leaves the race open, with potential candidates facing a tougher path against incumbent Democratic Senator Jon Ossoff.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir raised its revenue guidance after experiencing a surge in commercial and government revenue driven by increased adoption of its artificial intelligence software. CEO Alex Karp cited a "tectonic shift" in the adoption of Palantir's software, with commercial revenues growing 71% and government segment sales jumping 45%. The company is forecasting that U.S. commercial revenues will exceed $1.178 billion this year, attributing government sector growth to greater U.S. defense sector adoption of its tools. Palantir's revenues grew 39% year-over-year, and net income rose significantly.</p>
