          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at mitigating national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to enhance drone detection and identification, and to combat unlawful uses such as spying and drug smuggling. This initiative is particularly important in light of upcoming large-scale events like the FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to promote U.S. development and commercial use of drone technology, including deliveries and other applications.</p>

          <p>Amazon is reportedly investing in automating approximately $200 billion in logistics costs, which includes using AI-powered humanoid robots for deliveries. Morgan Stanley analysts estimate that these robots, which are being tested at a San Francisco "humanoid park," could reduce delivery times and labor costs. The firm sees this as a key driver of "more durable market share gains" in Amazon's logistics network. The analysts project that increased automation in warehouses could lead to $2 billion to $3 billion in annual savings by 2030, positioning Amazon as a leader in leveraging physical AI robots for financial returns.

          <p>Centrus Energy, the only publicly traded uranium enricher globally, seeks to reduce the U.S.'s dependence on foreign state-owned companies for nuclear fuel. With President Trump's goal to quadruple nuclear power capacity, the U.S. currently relies on foreign sources for about 70% of its reactor fuel. The looming ban on Russian uranium imports by 2028 exacerbates the need for domestic enrichment capacity. Centrus aims to provide competition in the market and address the lack of American-owned fuel cycle capacity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion piece discusses the anti-managerialism driving the Trump administration, highlighting the effort to dismantle the bureaucracy. It suggests that the administration's war against the bureaucracy is rooted in the belief that a permanent ruling class of unaccountable managers and bureaucrats has usurped democracy. This idea is described as the central principle of the new right, aiming to roll back bureaucratic control in various aspects of life. The piece argues that understanding this anti-managerialism is crucial to comprehending the administration's efforts to transform American institutions.</p>
