          <p>The Prime Video series 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' has captured a massive audience, sparking intense online debates over its central teenage love triangle involving two brothers. The show's popularity is attributed to its nostalgic evocation of 2000s romantic comedies and its effective use of the classic love triangle trope, providing viewers with a form of escapism.
