          <h2>UK Spending Review Reveals Increased Public Spending Amid Internal Disputes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-07 10:21:22 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming Spending Review in the UK, presented by Chancellor Rachel Reeves, is expected to show a significant rise in public spending, exceeding ¬£650 billion by 2029-30, roughly ¬£100 billion more than when Labour took office. This increase, illustrated in a Treasury document shared with the BBC, aims to avoid accusations of austerity, though it masks internal government disputes over departmental allocations. While some departments like the NHS are slated for substantial funding increases, others, such as the Home Office, are still arguing for more cash to meet promised policing levels. The review will allocate substantial funds to long-term projects, but short-term spending will remain tight, and the government faces pressure to present a convincing narrative to a skeptical public. This review aims to reassure financial markets and demonstrate a clear plan for rebuilding Britain through investments in security, health, and long-term projects.</p>

          <p>This news digest covers several key updates from Japan and around the world, including ongoing trade negotiations between Japan and the United States, where common ground on tariff issues is still being sought. Additionally, over half of rice-producing firms in Japan believe that store prices for rice are too high, raising concerns about consumer aversion. South Korea's new President Lee Jae Myung will make his diplomatic debut at the upcoming G7 summit in Canada, while in Kyoto, a Chinese tourist was slashed with a knife after an argument.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade-long study interviewing parents of highly successful children reveals five key strategies: fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to individual children, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, cultivating a genuine love for knowledge, and motivating with love rather than being a coach. Parents who encouraged a sense of possibility and stayed positive had children who internalized this outlook. Understanding a child's interests and aligning learning with those interests was more effective than simply emphasizing practical skills. The study also highlighted the importance of allowing children to learn from everyday tasks and fostering self-sufficiency.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Arsenal forward Bukayo Saka has been excluded from the England squad set to face Andorra, with manager Thomas Tuchel expected to field an experimental lineup for the World Cup qualifier. Saka's omission is likely due to fitness concerns, as he has only completed one full training session during the week. Tuchel is considering deploying Chelsea's Reece James in an unfamiliar left-back position, while Liverpool's Curtis Jones is an option on the right side of defence. Chelsea playmaker Cole Palmer is anticipated to make his debut under Tuchel, and Declan Rice may be rested for the upcoming friendly against Senegal.</p>

He highlights that learning what you don't want to do is equally valuable in clarifying your professional direction. Jassy credits his success to his willingness to explore and adapt, emphasizing that reliability, trustworthiness, and a strong work ethic are more important than mastering every skill immediately.</p>

The upgrade reflects concerns over China's dominance in rare earth refining and processing and the potential for further trade restrictions.
