          <p>JPMorgan Chase is updating its Sapphire Reserve card with new benefits and a higher annual fee of $795, a 45% increase. The bank claims users will receive over $2,700 in annual benefits, including doubled point value for select travel offers and a $500 annual credit at specific hotels and resorts. Additional perks include a $300 dining credit at select restaurants, a $300 credit for StubHub or Viagogo purchases, and free subscriptions to Apple TV+ and Apple Music. Customers spending at least $75,000 annually gain top-tier status at Southwest Airlines and IHG Hotels and Resorts, and JPMorgan also launched a Sapphire Reserve business card with similar perks.

          <p>An analysis of McLaren's Formula 1 team dynamics questions whether the team should prioritize Oscar Piastri over Lando Norris, given Piastri's more consistent performance this season. While Piastri has outperformed Norris in championship points and head-to-head statistics, the article argues that Norris possesses comparable outright speed, but has been prone to errors. The article notes that McLaren does not typically prioritize one driver over the other, except in specific circumstances. The analysis suggests Norris needs to address his mental state to avoid over-striving and reduce errors.</p>

          <p>Streaming services, including YouTube, Netflix, and Paramount+, have for the first time overtaken traditional television in overall U.S. viewership, according to a Nielsen report. In May, streaming platforms captured 44.8% of TV usage, surpassing cable and broadcast networks, which accounted for 44.2%. YouTube led the streaming services with 12.5% of viewership, followed by Netflix at 7.5%. This shift reflects a steady migration of viewers from linear television to streaming, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, though broadcast networks still command significant viewership during the NFL season.</p>

          <p>Bullet train services between Tokyo and northeastern Japan were suspended for over five hours after a train stopped between stations in Tochigi Prefecture.

          <p>The UK has seemingly discovered a successful approach to gain favor with President Trump, securing the first trade deal with the U.S. and earning Trump's personal approval. Trump cited his liking for the UK as the reason for their protection from further tariffs, emphasizing the fantastic relationship between the two nations. Despite ideological differences between Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, strong cultural links and the UK's avoidance of trade and foreign policy conflicts with Washington contribute to the positive relationship. The article suggests Trump's genuine liking for Starmer and the UK's cultural ties are key factors in their preferential treatment.</p>

          <p>Despite claims that the Trump Organization's newly announced T1 smartphone will be manufactured in the U.S., experts believe it will likely be made in China. The phone, retailing for $499 and running Android, is expected to be designed and manufactured by a Chinese original device manufacturer (ODM). Analysts cite the lack of local manufacturing capabilities in the U.S. as a major obstacle. The debate over smartphone manufacturing location arose after Trump threatened tariffs on imported devices, urging Apple to produce iPhones in the U.S., a move deemed nearly impossible by experts.</p>

Trump acknowledged the Japanese as 'tough' negotiators but expressed confidence in reaching a deal. The discussions followed ministerial-level negotiations where Japan sought concessions on U.S. tariffs. Trump suggested that the U.S. might simply issue a letter stating the terms of trade, implying a firm stance in the negotiations.</p>

          <p>Pharmaceutical companies like AstraZeneca, Pfizer, and Merck are investing heavily in antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) as potential replacements for chemotherapy in cancer treatment. ADCs are designed to deliver chemotherapy directly to cancer cells, sparing healthy cells and reducing side effects. While it may take years for ADCs to fully replace chemo, some companies believe they have shown the ability to do so in certain settings. The pharmaceutical industry is working to refine the treatments, targeting the right cancer-causing proteins and developing new payloads for these drugs.</p>

Temperatures are forecast to be as high as 28C in London on Tuesday, with high pressure building across the UK likely to bring the first heatwave of 2025 later in the week. The UKHSA said an increase in demand for health services by vulnerable people is likely, as well as an increase in risk to health for individuals aged over 65 years or those with pre-existing health conditions.</p>

          <p>The Mayor of London is moving forward with plans to pedestrianize parts of Oxford Street, banning vehicles from a 0.7-mile stretch between Oxford Circus and Marble Arch. The plan aims to rejuvenate Oxford Street as a global shopping destination, with City Hall claiming two-thirds of people support the principle. The mayor's proposals depend on obtaining permission to establish a new mayoral development corporation. Concerns remain regarding traffic diversion, accessibility, and the quality of the retail offering, with detailed proposals to be consulted on later this year.</p>
