        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators unveiled sweeping policy steps, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to stimulate economic growth amid trade worries. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates by 10 basis points to 1.4% and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points, injecting approximately $138.6 billion into the market. These measures also include support for financing key sectors like technology and real estate, as well as a new relending tool for consumption and elderly care. While analysts suggest these measures indicate greater urgency to bolster the economy, they also note that domestic credit demand may not significantly increase without additional fiscal policy measures.

          <p>Morocco, emerging as a key automotive manufacturing hub in Africa, is leveraging its free-trade agreement with the European Union to become a crucial conduit for Chinese companies circumventing tariffs. Chinese investment in Morocco's energy and electric vehicle sectors has surged, but rising tensions between the U.S., Europe, and China pose a difficult balancing act for the country. The Trump administration could pressure Morocco to choose sides, potentially impacting its economic ties with China. This article highlights the delicate position of connector countries like Morocco in a global trading system reshaped by trade restrictions and geopolitical rivalries.</p>

          <p>Five Venezuelan opposition figures, who had been sheltering in the Argentine diplomatic residence in Caracas for over a year, have been rescued and are now in the United States, according to Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This development comes as Venezuela attempts to ease relations with the Trump administration amid threatened oil sanctions. These activists ran a consequential presidential campaign from the residence, helping to organize voter turnout and collect tally sheets. Their departure occurs weeks before regional elections, while roughly 900 political prisoners remain detained in Venezuela.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill proposed in England and Wales aims to punish criminals who refuse to attend their sentencing hearings with up to two additional years in prison. The legislation, prompted by cases where killers of Sabina Nessa, Zara Aleena, and Jan Mustafa refused to face their victims' families in court, seeks to prevent offenders from "opting out" of justice. The bill also addresses disruptive behavior in court, and could strip offenders facing whole life orders of privileges within their cells. Victims' families have hailed the development as a step in the right direction.</p>

          <p>Residents of the fire-ravaged Tahitian Terrace mobile home park in Pacific Palisades are closer to returning home after the park was included in the federally funded debris removal program. This decision follows weeks of uncertainty for residents, whose homes were destroyed in the January 7 Palisades fire. FEMA approved the inclusion due to the unique characteristics of the property, immediate threats to public health and safety, and the owners' financial constraints. The federal cleanup will remove asbestos and other hazardous materials, accelerating the reopening of the park.</p>

          <p>China's tourism sector is experiencing a surge, defying the broader economic slowdown as domestic travel continues to rise. Surging interest in history and culture is helping, as well as infrastructure development, with high-speed trains encouraging travel to smaller cities. Retail sales, including food, rose by 6.3% during the holiday from a year ago, according to official figures, and tourism revenue increased by 8% to 180.27 billion yuan. The Chinese government has also extended visa-free policies to attract foreign tourists, with inbound travel rising by more than 40% from last year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers lost to the Miami Marlins in extra innings, with bullpen fatigue contributing to the defeat. Tony Gonsolin delivered a solid start, and Shohei Ohtani had another productive game, but the Dodgers' overworked bullpen faltered late. Minor league reliever JP Feyereisen gave up the walk-off single after the team was forced to use less-than-ideal pitching options due to workload concerns for their top relievers. The loss highlights the Dodgers' need to manage their bullpen effectively throughout the season.</p>

          <p>President Trump adopted a friendly tone during a meeting with new Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a stark contrast to his previous months of belittling Canada. Despite earlier posts mocking Canadians, Trump stated his love for Canada and sought "friendship" as the top "concession." Mr. Carney, however, remained guarded, while Mr. Trump veered off-topic, discussing various unrelated subjects. The meeting, initially anticipated to be tense, concluded on a seemingly cordial note, with Trump emphasizing the importance of maintaining friendly relations with Canada.</p>

The city attorney ruled against a closed meeting, and Musk lost his appeal to keep the fence and gate on his property at a Zoning and Planning Commission meeting.</p>
