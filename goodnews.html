          <p>Top advisers, including Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, presented President Trump with a plan to establish a U.S. sovereign wealth fund, but the White House has expressed reservations about the proposal. The fund, intended to invest assets from natural resources for public benefit, faces debates over its mechanics and spending priorities. Trump has previously suggested using such a fund to acquire a stake in TikTok, which is facing a potential U.S. ban if ByteDance does not divest.</p>

          <p>A piece of the Soviet-era spacecraft Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 as part of a mission to Venus, is expected to crash back to Earth this week after remaining in orbit for over half a century. Experts believe that the lander probe, a tough, spherical object, may survive re-entry due to its robust heat shield. While the risk to people on the ground is considered low, the capsule could potentially land anywhere between 51.7¬∞ north and south latitude, covering most of the inhabited world.</p>

          <p>The Bank of England is widely expected to cut interest rates, potentially reducing them to 4.25% from 4.5%, a move that would lower borrowing costs for businesses and individuals but could also reduce returns for savers. Analysts say further rate cuts are likely later in the year, influenced by the rate of price rises in the UK and global economic uncertainty, including President Trump's tariff policies. This would be the fourth rate reduction from last year's peak of 5.25%, and the second this year.</p>
