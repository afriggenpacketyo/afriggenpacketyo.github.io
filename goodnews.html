          <p>Pupils at a primary school in east London have been instructed to stay indoors due to a buzzard nesting in the playground, raising concerns about potential attacks. The buzzard, nicknamed Brenda by the students, has reportedly swooped on residents in the village, prompting Havering Council to provide advice on deterrents. As buzzards are a protected species, intervention options are limited, but the school is using the situation as a learning opportunity, educating children about birds of prey. A bird of prey expert visited the school with a Chilean blue buzzard eagle to teach the children about buzzard behavior and conservation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are grappling with the environmental impact of excessive visitor numbers, a phenomenon known as overtourism. Overtourism strains infrastructure, depletes local resources, and negatively affects the quality of life for residents. The rise in short trips and the influence of film locations contribute to the problem, exacerbating the climate crisis. Cities and regions are implementing measures such as limiting traveler numbers, imposing taxes, and promoting attractions outside city centers to manage visitor flows and encourage more sustainable travel practices.</p>

          <p>Red Bull made two critical errors during the Spanish Grand Prix, according to a recent F1 analysis. The first mistake was ordering Max Verstappen to concede his position to George Russell after their Turn One incident, a decision based on perceived FIA penalties. The stewards later ruled that no further action was necessary, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. The second error was pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car, a decision that Verstappen immediately questioned, and Horner admitted they should have left him out on his soft tires.</p>
