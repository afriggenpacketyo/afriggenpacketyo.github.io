Truist raised its price target for Amazon, citing credit card data that suggests strong North American revenue. Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo increased his target for Goldman Sachs, highlighting strength in capital markets, while Morgan Stanley noted Microsoft's recent 10% dividend increase as a sign of a strong total return profile. These analyses align with the investment theses for holding these stocks in a diversified portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since it sank in 1916, divers have recovered artifacts from the Britannic, the sister ship of the Titanic. The vessel, which was serving as a hospital ship during World War I, struck a mine and sank in the Aegean Sea. An 11-member deep-sea diving team retrieved items including the ship's bell, a navigation light, and silver-plated first-class trays from the wreck, which lies nearly 400 feet deep. The recovered artifacts are now undergoing conservation in Athens and will be displayed in a new Museum of Underwater Antiquities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death at age 89, this article reflects on the career of Robert Redford, an actor whose immense talent often appeared effortless. From his star-making role in 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' to his nuanced performance in 'All the President’s Men,' Redford embodied a quiet professionalism that grounded his characters. Despite his iconic status and classic good looks, which sometimes overshadowed his craft, his skill was in making complex roles seem natural and convincing. His legacy is not just one of a movie star, but of a subtle and masterful actor who profoundly shaped American cinema.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has lifted travel restrictions on Hungarian citizens that were imposed by the previous administration in 2021. The earlier restrictions were due to security concerns over Hungary's policy of granting citizenship to nearly one million people abroad without adequate vetting. Effective September 30, the validity period for travel authorizations under the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) will be restored from one year to two years, also allowing for multiple entries. The move is seen as a sign of warming diplomatic relations between Washington and Budapest under their current leadership.</p>

          <p>As of mid-September 2025, the price of gold stands at approximately $3,652 per ounce, though this value is subject to constant fluctuation. Gold is often considered a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge, with its price influenced by a variety of factors. These include fundamental principles of supply and demand, prevailing economic conditions, inflation rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. Additionally, movements in the U.S. dollar, central bank policies, and overall market sentiment play a significant role in determining the precious metal's day-to-day value.

          <p>With average mortgage rates recently dropping to their lowest levels since October 2024, many homeowners are contemplating refinancing. Financial experts suggest that individuals with current rates above 7% should begin exploring their options, as today's rates offer potential savings. Key considerations include a homeowner's immediate financial needs, such as lowering monthly payments or consolidating high-interest debt from credit cards. While some analysts predict rates could fall further by year-end, they also caution that waiting carries the risk of missing out on current savings, making now a potentially opportune time to act.

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump cannot fire Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook ahead of this week's pivotal policy meeting on interest rates. The 2-1 decision denies the administration's emergency request to pause a lower court's ruling that blocked the termination. Trump had moved to fire Cook "for cause" over allegations of mortgage fraud, a move widely seen as part of his campaign to influence the central bank's decisions. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court, highlighting the ongoing clash over the Fed's independence.</p>
