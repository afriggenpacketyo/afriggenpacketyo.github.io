          <p>Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for allegedly trespassing at an ICE detention center while protesting its opening. Baraka, who is also running for governor, had previously filed a lawsuit against the facility, arguing it lacked proper permits. Interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba stated Baraka ignored warnings from Homeland Security officials, while Representative LaMonica McIver defended Baraka, stating he did nothing wrong. Baraka was released without bond and charged with a misdemeanor, claiming he was targeted during the protest.</p>
