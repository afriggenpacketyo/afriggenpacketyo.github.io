        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Britain and the European Union have finalized a landmark agreement aimed at boosting security cooperation and easing trade barriers nearly a decade after the Brexit vote. The deal, unveiled by Prime Minister Keir Starmer and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, includes encouraging European countries to allow British citizens to use electronic gates at borders and easing restrictions on traveling with pets. While politically contentious, the agreement is projected to bring significant economic benefits to Britain, potentially adding billions to its economy annually, though some concessions were made on fishing rights to reach the deal. The agreement seeks to improve relations after the UK's departure from the EU and address emerging challenges in European security and trade.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As economic uncertainty persists, annuities are gaining traction as a means to secure retirement income, offering guaranteed lifetime payments and market volatility protection. However, experts caution that annuities come with fees, limited access to funds, and complex terms that require careful consideration. While annuities provide tax-deferred growth and customizable options, it's essential to balance annuity investments with other accessible assets and to consult a financial advisor to determine suitability. Fixed annuities also pose an inflation risk if they lack a cost-of-living adjustment, making it important to understand current economic conditions before investing (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the announcement of former President Joe Biden's diagnosis with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, medical experts have weighed in on potential treatment options and prognosis. Despite the severity of the diagnosis, with a Gleason score of 9, doctors emphasize that hormone-sensitive prostate cancer can be effectively managed with treatments like hormone therapy, chemotherapy, and radiation. While Biden's age (82) is a factor, his overall physiology will determine the best course of treatment, with experts suggesting he could potentially live for 10 years or more with the disease. Biden's diagnosis is a reminder of the prevalence of prostate cancer, which affects one in eight men.</p>

          <p>French police have recovered the bust of Jim Morrison, the iconic frontman of The Doors, 37 years after it was stolen from his grave at the P√®re Lachaise cemetery in Paris. The sculpture was found during a search related to a fraud case. Morrison's grave remains a popular destination for rock fans, despite the singer's death in Paris in 1971 being shrouded in mystery. The Doors, known for hits like "Riders on the Storm" and "Light My Fire", were influential figures in the counterculture movement of the late 1960s and early 70s.</p>

Asda also expressed optimism that the agreement could substantially lower costs and bureaucracy for fresh produce imports and goods destined for Northern Ireland.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sleep specialists suggest that dietary choices can significantly impact sleep quality, advising individuals to adopt eating habits that promote restful nights. Consuming foods rich in tryptophan, such as almonds, salmon, and yogurt, can aid in the production of serotonin and melatonin, which regulate sleep. Swapping sugary and processed foods for fruits and vegetables provides essential nutrients and fiber that support deeper sleep. It's also crucial to avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening, as well as alcohol right before bed, and to refrain from eating heavy meals close to bedtime.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are pushing forward with a vote on President Trump's tax bill this week, despite ongoing disagreements within the party.

Speaker Mike Johnson is navigating these divisions, aiming for a delicately balanced package that can pass the House and gain Senate approval. The inclusion of a debt limit increase adds urgency, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warning of potential inability to pay bills by August without action.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has reportedly ceased mentioning Elon Musk on Truth Social, signaling a distancing from the tech mogul after a period of close collaboration. Musk, who led efforts to cut the federal budget, has faced public disapproval and ridicule, leading to a diminished role in the administration. GOP insiders suggest Musk's political influence has waned due to unpopularity. Despite this shift, the White House maintains that the work of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) will continue, though without directly acknowledging Musk's involvement.</p>

While Prime Minister Lu√≠s Montenegro has ruled out an alliance with Chega, the party's surge reflects growing anti-immigration sentiment and economic resentments among Portuguese voters.
