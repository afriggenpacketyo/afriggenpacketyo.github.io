Starbucks' shares sold off after its earnings report, despite the company stating its turnaround is ahead of schedule. Palo Alto Networks saw a decline after announcing its largest-ever acquisition, a $25 billion deal for CyberArk, which introduces some execution risk but also positions the company in the critical identity security market.
