          <p>According to former Microsoft AI head Harry Shum, China is rapidly advancing in artificial intelligence algorithms, even as it lags significantly behind the United States in chip technology. Speaking at a summit, Shum noted that the chip production gap is substantial, but China can innovate by focusing on algorithm engineering to overcome computing power constraints. He cited the Chinese startup DeepSeek as a prime example, which achieved results comparable to top U.S. competitors like OpenAI using far fewer resources. This highlights a strategic shift in China's approach to competing in the global AI race.</p>

          <p>Investor Warren Buffett has announced a new donation of $6 billion in Berkshire Hathaway stock to five charitable foundations, continuing his long-standing pledge to give away the majority of his wealth. This contribution brings his total philanthropic giving since 2006 to approximately $60 billion. The largest portion of the new donation is designated for the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust. In a statement, Buffett attributed his wealth to sound decisions and the effects of compounding, reiterating that his will directs about 99.5% of his estate to be used for philanthropic purposes after his death.</p>

          <p>The Chinese historical fantasy series "Legend of Zang Hai" has become a global streaming hit, indicating the growing international appeal of China's cultural exports. The show, which follows a protagonist's quest for revenge amid political intrigue, topped viewership charts in 15 regions and trended globally on social media platform X. Its success is attributed to its complex plot, high production value, and integration of traditional Chinese cultural elements like shadow puppetry. This trend suggests that Chinese-produced television dramas are increasingly finding a worldwide audience, potentially serving as a new form of cultural influence or soft power.</p>

          <p>DHL Express has restored full service in Canada after a nearly three-week labor dispute ended with unionized workers ratifying a new four-year contract. The agreement, approved by 72% of Unifor members, includes a 15.75% wage increase, enhanced benefits, and new protections related to automation. The strike and subsequent lockout had forced the company to halt all parcel deliveries on June 20. The union credited the resolution to a new federal law banning the use of replacement workers, which it claims was a key factor in reaching a fair agreement and ending the standoff.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied another motion by Donald Trump to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed by the men wrongfully convicted in the Central Park Five case. The lawsuit accuses Trump of defamation for statements made during a 2024 presidential debate, where he allegedly claimed the men had killed someone and pleaded guilty. The judge ruled that Pennsylvania's Anti-SLAPP law, which protects against lawsuits targeting free speech, does not apply in federal court. This decision allows the case, brought by Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron McCray, and Korey Wise, to proceed.</p>

          <p>As the tenth anniversary of nationwide same-sex marriage legalization approaches, a Maryland couple who were pioneers in the state's fight for marriage equality are reflecting on their journey. Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage. Although their initial court case was unsuccessful, their advocacy helped pave the way for the state to legalize marriage equality in 2012. They express concern over new legal challenges to marriage rights, viewing them as cruel and disheartening efforts that threaten to roll back hard-won protections for the LGBTQ community.</p>

          <p>A team of mechanical engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has designed and built a custom printer that adds braille to beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was initiated at the request of the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which sought a way to make products more accessible. The students' invention can punch braille onto materials that commercial printers cannot handle and was specifically designed to be operated by BISM's employees, many of whom have low or no vision. The printer has already produced 400 labels for a special fundraising beer.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq achieved record highs this week, a surprising outcome given the recent U.S. military action against Iran's nuclear facilities. The market rallied after initial fears of a wider conflict subsided, with a significant drop in oil prices signaling to investors that the event would not systemically impact economic growth or inflation. This de-escalation, combined with investor speculation about potential Federal Reserve rate cuts, fueled the positive momentum on Wall Street. The article notes that while risks remain, the market's focus has shifted back to economic fundamentals and corporate earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New research on skeletons from the 9,000-year-old city of √áatalh√∂y√ºk in Turkey suggests it may have been a matriarchal society where females held significant influence. After analyzing the DNA of over 130 skeletons, scientists found that genetic connections within households were primarily traced through the female line, indicating husbands may have moved into their wives' homes. The study also revealed that grave goods were five times more common for females than for males, suggesting preferential treatment. These findings challenge traditional assumptions about patrilineal societal structures in ancient civilizations and point to a system where identity and status were passed down through mothers.</p>

A driver had contacted authorities after spotting what they believed was a tiger cub along a remote stretch of Highway 166 in San Luis Obispo County. An officer dispatched to the scene found the dead bird instead, and the Department of Transportation was notified for its removal.

The event drew support from international figures, including the EU's equalities commissioner and dozens of European Parliament members, who attended to show solidarity with Hungary's LGBTQ community. Participants marched to advocate for diversity and protest what they describe as a law that infringes on their fundamental rights to love and express themselves freely.</p>
