          <p>Dan Wang observes China as an "engineering state," highlighting its rapid development and extensive infrastructure projects. China has quickly built advanced transportation systems, including subways and high-speed rail, in a fraction of the time it took the United States to develop similar systems. The country excels in civil, electrical, nano-, computer, solar, and space engineering, all considered matters of national security. China produces significantly more STEM graduates than the U.S., and most of its top officials are engineers, contrasting with the U.S., where lawyers often hold such positions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge ruled that President Trump's federalization of parts of the California National Guard was illegal and ordered him to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer stayed the order briefly to allow the Trump administration to appeal, which they promptly did. Trump had federalized 4,000 members of the California National Guard and mobilized 700 U.S. Marines to respond to protests in Los Angeles against federal immigration enforcement actions. Newsom and California's attorney general sued to reverse Trump's federalization of the Guard, arguing it was done without the governor's consent, marking the first time a president had taken such an action.</p>

          <p>A federal judge blocked the Trump administration from deploying the California National Guard in Los Angeles, ordering President Trump to return control to Governor Gavin Newsom. Judge Charles Breyer found that California officials are likely to succeed in their challenge to the president's decision to federalize members of the National Guard in response to protests in Los Angeles, granting their request to block his use of the forces to assist immigration agents during raids. Breyer stated that Trump circumvented Newsom when he called the California National Guard into federal service, failing to follow procedural requirements laid out by Congress. The Justice Department swiftly notified the court that it is appealing the order.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily ruled against President Trump's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles, siding with California's argument that the president erred in activating the guard. The order requires Trump to return control of the National Guard to California Governor Gavin Newsom. District Judge Charles Breyer rejected the administration's argument that the courts lack authority to review a president's decision on National Guard deployment. Trump had deployed 4,000 California National Guard and several hundred U.S. Marines to Los Angeles over the objections of Governor Newsom, citing attempts to impede immigration agents as a form of rebellion.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China around 8,000 years ago, potentially earlier than previously believed. Archaeologists from Chinese and US institutes analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region. The study found that pigs were consuming humans' cooked foods and waste, indicating a domestication process alongside the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East, now part of the Middle East.</p>

Most parties, including the LDP's coalition partner, the Komeito party, and Tomin First no Kai, are using social media to appeal to voters. Major issues at stake include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, child-rearing, and measures against heat.</p>

          <p>Chinese solar and energy-storage companies are pursuing overseas expansion as a key strategy for long-term survival amid ongoing trade tensions and tariffs. Despite a temporary truce in the tariff war between the US and China, solar panel exports from China and Southeast Asia to the US remain subject to high tariffs. Chinese firms are diversifying their production base, with significant planned capacity expansion in the Middle East and Africa. Executives at the SNEC PV+ Photovoltaic Power Conference and Exhibition in Shanghai emphasized that localizing production abroad is essential due to the impact of tariffs.</p>

Koizumi's actions are reminiscent of his father, former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi. Koizumi, the 44-year-old son of the former Prime Minister, has taken a series of steps to address the issue including releasing government stockpiled rice at about half the market value through direct contracts with retailers. Koizumi's resurgence comes as the LDP faces an upcoming election with a public frustrated by rising prices.</p>
