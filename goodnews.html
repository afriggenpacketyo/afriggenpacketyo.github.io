          <h2>US-UK Trade Deal Eases Some Tariffs, Falls Short of Comprehensive Agreement</h2>

          <p>President Trump unveiled a trade agreement with the UK, rolling back some import taxes on cars and steel in exchange for increased access for American beef and ethanol. While Trump hailed the deal as a "breakthrough," analysts noted its limited substantive benefits, with goods from the UK still facing higher tariffs than before recent announcements. The agreement drew criticism from American carmakers and muted responses from farmer groups, reflecting its narrow focus and potential political motivations. Overall, the article suggests the deal offers a political victory for Trump with limited economic impact, indicating a pattern of prioritizing deal-making over substantive changes.</p>

          <p>An investigation by Amtrak's Office of Inspector General revealed that at least 119 Amtrak employees and doctors participated in a $12 million health fraud scheme from 2019 to 2022. Employees accepted cash kickbacks from healthcare providers in exchange for their insurance information, which was then used to file fraudulent claims for services never provided. While some employees have retired or been criminally charged, a significant number are still employed by Amtrak. Amtrak has stated it is taking steps to address medical insurance fraud and has implemented measures to enhance fraud prevention and empower employees to report suspected wrongdoing.</p>

          <p>Chinese academics are proposing a revision of World War II history, advocating for the start date to be moved back to 1931 with Japan's invasion of Manchuria, rather than Germany's 1939 invasion of Poland. This perspective aims to highlight China's role in the war against fascism and challenge the "Western-centric" view. The proposal comes as countries globally commemorate the 80th anniversary of the war's end. President Xi Jinping is scheduled to attend a Victory Day parade in Moscow, marking Nazi Germany's surrender to the Soviet Union in 1945.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with Britain, increasing market access for American farm exports in exchange for arrangements like allowing Britain to export 100,000 cars per year into the U.S. with a 10% tariff. The agreement maintains a 10% baseline tariff on most goods but removes additional tariffs on steel and aluminum. While many details are still being worked out, the deal signals Trump's intent to maintain the universal tariff while negotiating country-specific tariffs. The agreement provides insights into Trump's tariff approach, indicating that eliminating all new levies may be difficult for other countries.</p>

          <p>India is considering eliminating tariffs on certain imports from the U.S., including steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a shift from its protectionist trade policies. This move comes as India faces pressure from the U.S. and seeks to boost economic growth through foreign investment and global market access. Experts have varying views on the potential impact of zero tariffs on India's domestic industries, with some suggesting limited consequences for certain sectors.

However, an increase in the full-year commodity cost inflation outlook has led to a reduced price target, though the brand's value and customer experience position it well to navigate economic challenges.</p>
