          <p>Tottenham has appointed Thomas Frank, previously the manager of Brentford, as their new head coach, with a contract extending until 2028. Frank succeeds Ange Postecoglou, who was dismissed earlier in the month despite leading Spurs to victory in the Europa League final in May. During his seven-year tenure at Brentford, Frank guided the club's ascension from the Championship to the Premier League in 2021. Tottenham finished 17th in the top flight last season but qualified for the Champions League after winning the Europa League final against Manchester United.</p>

          <p>Celine Song's film "Materialists" stars Dakota Johnson as Lucy, a Manhattan matchmaker who is weighing comfort versus struggle in her love life. Lucy is torn between two suitors: Harry, a wealthy private equity manager, and John, a struggling actor and cater-waiter. The film explores the intersection of love and money, questioning whether a sensible girl can justify shackling herself to a broke creative. While the film has strong moments and hilarious lines, it ultimately falls short with a contrived happy ending, though it is still considered to be a solid watch.</p>

          <p>Consumers planning to purchase a new car may want to act quickly, as tariffs are expected to drive prices higher. Current sticker prices are still near pre-tariff levels, partially because many models were built before the new rules took effect. The Trump administration has imposed a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and many foreign-made auto parts, adding to existing metal import duties. Experts suggest that these tariffs will likely lead to increased car prices unless significant changes occur in the near term (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Despite fears that President Trump's tariffs would increase inflation, traditional data points measuring inflation have not yet reflected this. Consumer and producer prices rose only 0.1% in May, indicating benign inflation readings. The limited impact of tariffs in May is attributed to pre-tariff stockpiling, a lagged pass-through of tariffs into import prices, and a lack of pricing power for companies. Economists believe the impact of tariffs will likely materialize in the coming months (not investment advice).</p>
