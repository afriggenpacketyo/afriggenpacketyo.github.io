          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal with the United Kingdom, expected to boost relations between the two countries. The agreement, teased earlier on Truth Social, led to gains in the stock market and cryptocurrency values, with Bitcoin approaching $100,000. The deal aims to solidify the relationship between the U.S. and the UK, potentially easing the impact of recent tariff increases and benefiting sectors like the British auto industry. The New York Times reports that Prime Minister Keir Starmer's cultivation of Trump has paid off with this agreement.</p>

          <p>Experts offer guidance on whether to use an inheritance to pay off credit card debt, advising that the decision depends on individual financial circumstances and goals. Paying off high-interest debt can provide an immediate return and reduce financial stress, but it may not be the best option if balances are low or the inheritance has specific restrictions. Alternatives such as debt management programs and debt consolidation loans are also discussed for those without access to an inheritance.</p>

          <p>A Florida federal judge dismissed most claims against celebrities and YouTubers who promoted the cryptocurrency exchange FTX. The judge ruled that plaintiffs failed to prove that the celebrities had sufficient knowledge of FTX's misconduct to be held liable. The lawsuit stemmed from FTX's collapse in November 2022, accusing celebrities of endorsing the exchange without disclosing their financial incentives. The ruling narrows the scope of the litigation, excluding stars like Tom Brady, Stephen Curry, and Kevin O'Leary from most of the claims.</p>

Governor Andrew Bailey warned of the unpredictability of the global economy due to US tariffs.

The decision comes as details of a tariff deal between the UK and US are set to be announced later. Five members voted to cut rates to 4.25%, two voted in favour of a larger reduction to 4% and two voted for no change.</p>
