          <p>With food prices rising, many parents are facing increased financial pressure to provide meals for their children during the school summer holidays. This article shares several cost-saving strategies from families, including meticulous planning, creative cooking, and minimizing waste. Key tips include buying reduced "yellow sticker" items, especially meat, to store in the freezer, and organizing daily food portions in separate bags to make supplies last longer. Utilizing local food pantries that offer surplus groceries for a small fee has also proven to be a vital resource for families struggling with the higher cost of living.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to limited space, the historic Hollywood Forever Cemetery has introduced a new five-story vertical mausoleum, adding a modern architectural feature to the iconic Los Angeles landmark. The Gower Mausoleum provides final resting places for approximately 13,000 people and has already sold out two of its five floors since opening in January. The design emphasizes natural light and offers views of the city, aiming to create a peaceful environment for visitors. This development is part of the cemetery's broader strategy to integrate community life with its traditional purpose, hosting events like festivals and movie nights.</p>

          <p>A collection of anecdotes from people over 50 reveals vastly different and often problematic norms that were common in high schools decades ago. These experiences, which would be considered shocking today, include teachers openly bullying students, the common presence of firearms in student vehicles for hunting, and designated smoking areas on school property. Other recounted issues involve corporal punishment, lax supervision on field trips, and gender-discriminatory dress codes and class requirements, illustrating a significant cultural shift in educational standards and student safety over the years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A group of students preparing for their GCSE exams opened time capsule letters they wrote to themselves as 11-year-olds in 2021, just as they returned to school after a COVID-19 lockdown. The letters capture their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, with questions about girlfriends, career ambitions, and whether the world had returned to normal. The exercise, organized by a teacher to instill motivation during a disruptive period, served as a poignant reminder of their personal growth and the unique challenges their cohort faced. Their entire secondary education was shaped by pandemic-related restrictions like remote learning and social bubbles.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Guatemala have successfully freed nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by rioting inmates in Guatemala City. The riots were initiated by members of the Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha gangs, who were demanding the return of ten of their leaders who had been transferred to a different facility. This incident is part of a series of recent prison disturbances in the country linked to gang power struggles. The violent rivalry between these two major gangs continues to be a significant security challenge for Guatemalan authorities.</p>

          <p>A new collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley's career, focusing on music he recorded in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period includes his last Top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and sessions that occurred shortly before he was considered for a role in the film "A Star Is Born." Friends of Presley believe that losing the movie role contributed to a decline in his career before his death in 1977. The box set offers insight into a time when the rock and roll pioneer was navigating a changing musical landscape and personal turmoil.</p>

          <p>Sunderland started its first Premier League season since 2017 with a decisive 3-0 victory against West Ham, marking the club's first top-flight win in August since 2010. After a scoreless first half, the newly promoted side dominated with goals from Eliezer Mayenda, Dan Ballard, and Wilson Isidor. The win is a significant moment for the club and its supporters after an eight-year absence from the top division that included a drop to League One. The performance of several new signings, part of a £132 million summer spending spree, suggests the team may be well-equipped to compete at this level.</p>

          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is partly attributed to the growing momentum of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors beyond the traditional smartphone slate. While Apple still leads, Samsung's wider range of price points and its willingness to experiment with new designs are creating renewed competition, with analysts anticipating Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026 to counter the trend.
