          <p>Following childbirth, many new parents experience a significant drop in their sex drive, a topic recently highlighted by reality TV star Holly Hagan-Blyth. Experts explain that this change is due to a combination of physical healing, drastic hormonal shifts, and the psychological adjustment to parenthood for both partners. Relationship therapists emphasize the importance of open communication to alleviate pressure and misunderstanding between couples during this period. The article notes that addressing these challenges openly can help couples navigate the transition and maintain intimacy in their relationship.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists searching for the lost tomb of Queen Cleopatra have discovered a submerged ancient port near the Taposiris Magna Temple, about 30 miles west of Alexandria, Egypt. The Egyptian-Dominican mission used advanced sonar technology to map the seabed, revealing an ancient shoreline and harbor that was once connected to the temple by a tunnel. The discovery of anchors and pottery from the Ptolemaic period provides new evidence that the site was a significant maritime hub. Lead archaeologist Dr. Kathleen Martinez remains convinced the temple complex is the true resting place of Cleopatra.</p>

          <p>A commentary piece reflects on how "South Park" creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone have consistently opposed anti-Mexican sentiment and have recently intensified their satire against the Trump administration's immigration policies. The author connects this to their $40 million restoration of Casa Bonita, an iconic, sprawling Mexican-themed restaurant in Colorado. The author's visit to the reopened restaurant revealed a celebratory atmosphere where Mexican culture is presented as cool and enjoyable for a diverse crowd. The article argues that this project, alongside the show's content, serves as a form of positive public relations for Mexican culture in a hostile political climate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are developing a new curriculum that uses augmented reality (AR) to teach spatial thinking skills to preschoolers, a crucial foundation for later success in STEM fields. The program, developed by the Education Development Center and partners, uses interactive games on iPads to help young children understand concepts like an object's position relative to others. The curriculum combines digital activities with hands-on tasks and read-alouds, making learning engaging and interactive. Teachers involved in the project report that it provides a structured and enjoyable way to teach spatial vocabulary, which is often overlooked in early education.</p>

          <p>Amid a boom in data center construction fueled by artificial intelligence, California lawmakers have passed a bill requiring these facilities to report their water consumption. The legislation, now awaiting the governor's signature, aims to provide localities with the necessary data to plan for the significant water demands of these server-packed buildings. Data centers, particularly those in arid western states, use vast quantities of water for cooling systems. This move reflects growing scrutiny over the environmental impact of the tech industry and the need to manage vital resources responsibly in drought-prone regions.</p>

          <p>In a television interview promoting her new book, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her relationship with California Governor Gavin Newsom, including an anecdote about him not returning her call when she sought his presidential campaign support. Harris downplayed any friction, stating Newsom has a "great sense of humor" and would be fine. She also voiced strong support for a controversial California redistricting measure championed by Newsom, framing it as a necessary "fight fire with fire" tactic against Republican efforts in other states. Additionally, Harris commented on the reinstatement of talk show host Jimmy Kimmel, hailing it as a victory for "the power of the people."</p>

          <p>The trend of giving children alternatively spelled names, such as "Oaklynn" or "Sadilynn," has sparked online communities dedicated to mocking these "tragedeighs." This article explores the motivations behind the trend, including a desire for uniqueness and the feminization of traditionally masculine names, and the intense, often classist, backlash they receive. Baby name experts note that while the practice has historical roots, social media has amplified both the trend and the vitriol against it. The phenomenon highlights societal tensions around tradition, individuality, and social status as expressed through the personal act of naming a child.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-23 05:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A novel process known as phytomining is being developed to extract valuable metals from the soil using hyperaccumulating plants. These specific species can absorb high concentrations of elements like nickel, which can then be harvested by burning the plants to create a metal-rich "bio-ore." Proponents say this method is more environmentally friendly than conventional mining, as it can clean contaminated land with near-zero carbon emissions. While the technology shows promise, especially for communities on land unsuitable for agriculture, its scalability remains a major challenge, and it is unlikely to replace industrial mining operations entirely.</p>
