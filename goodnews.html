          <p>Despite recent market volatility, a Fidelity Investments study shows that many investors, particularly newer ones, remain confident in their portfolios. However, seasoned investors are more cautious, highlighting a divide in risk tolerance. Certified financial planner Tim Maurer advises that all investors should "always be calibrating" their risk based on their long-term goals and changing life circumstances. Experts recommend maintaining a well-diversified portfolio, including stocks and high-quality bonds, and utilizing vehicles like ETFs to navigate uncertain market conditions.

          <p>A Condor Airlines flight traveling from Greece to Germany was forced to make an emergency landing in Brindisi, Italy, after the crew received a fault message and passengers reported seeing flames near an engine. The airline stated there was a "reaction near the engine" caused by a disturbance in airflow, which prompted the pilots to perform a controlled shutdown of the engine. The aircraft, carrying 273 passengers and eight crew members, landed safely with no injuries reported, though some passengers had to spend the night at the airport due to limited hotel capacity.</p>

          <p>Excel Dryer, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of electric hand dryers, has successfully shifted its entire supply chain to American-made parts, a goal its founder pursued long before recent trade disputes. The company's leadership stated that increased tariffs on Chinese goods only reinforced their decision to source domestically, a challenging process that took eight years to complete. By 2023, the firm achieved its objective of using 100% U.S.-sourced components, allowing it to avoid tariffs and control its production process more effectively, demonstrating a viable alternative to offshoring for some American businesses.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced he will start interviewing candidates for the next Federal Reserve chair after Labor Day, with a list of 11 potential replacements for current Chair Jerome Powell. The White House is reportedly eager to advance the process to push for interest rate cuts, which the administration believes will stimulate the housing market. Bessent reiterated this desire, suggesting a significant rate reduction could facilitate a home-building boom and help control future inflation. The list of candidates includes current Fed governors, economists, and Wall Street experts. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the persistent disputes in the South China Sea stem from two mutually exclusive narratives, where one side's defensive actions are seen as aggressive by the other. This perception gap is rooted in conflicting national interests, ambiguous post-World War II territorial arrangements, and differing interpretations of historical claims versus international law. The author suggests that without a joint, fact-based, and collaborative process to narrow this divide, de-escalation will remain difficult. A peaceful resolution requires moving beyond national pride and historical grievances to find common ground.</p>

          <p>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has lauded the recent White House summit on Ukraine as a significant breakthrough, particularly highlighting President Trump's commitment to providing security guarantees for the nation. While European leaders had been anxious about the meeting's potential risks, Starmer expressed satisfaction with the progress made toward a potential peace process involving Russia, Ukraine, and the U.S. The UK government's focus is now on ensuring Ukraine is in the strongest possible negotiating position, with Trump's pledge of "cast iron" security guarantees seen as a key factor in providing Kyiv with greater flexibility.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the history of the thong bathing suit, revealing its creation was a political statement by Austrian-born designer Rudi Gernreich. In 1974, after Los Angeles banned public nudity on its beaches, Gernreich designed the minimalist garment as an act of protest, aiming to liberate the body rather than sexualize it. A gay man and an early LGBTQ+ rights activist, Gernreich was a fashion pioneer who championed unisex clothing and challenged societal norms. His designs, including the topless "monokini" of 1964, were decades ahead of their time and remain relevant in today's discussions about body positivity and censorship.</p>

          <p>According to U.S. Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, the UK government has withdrawn its demand for Apple to create a "backdoor" for accessing the encrypted data of American citizens. The claim follows a months-long dispute that began when the UK issued a notice under its Investigatory Powers Act, which Apple challenged legally. The U.S. government, including President Trump, had strongly opposed the move, arguing it would compromise the civil liberties and privacy of Americans. It remains unclear how this development will affect the UK's access to data of its own citizens or Apple's data protection policies for UK customers.</p>

The breakthrough came after renewed talks with a government-appointed mediator. A key issue resolved in the new agreement is pay for work performed on the ground before flights.

          <p>The article explores the recent explosion in popularity of matcha, suggesting its second wave is driven less by its traditional flavor and more by its cultural currency on social media. The drink's vibrant green color and the ritual of its preparation make it highly "aesthetic" and shareable on platforms like TikTok. Unlike its previous niche trendiness in the mid-2010s, matcha is now mainstream, often consumed in highly sweetened and customized latte forms that mask its earthy taste. This trend reflects a broader consumer desire for experiential products and a sense of shared reality in an algorithmically isolated world.</p>

          <p>This article reviews Spike Lee's latest film, "Highest 2 Lowest," a remake of Akira Kurosawa's "High and Low" starring Denzel Washington as a successful music producer facing a moral dilemma. The plot centers on his chauffeur's son being mistakenly kidnapped instead of his own, forcing him to confront his detachment from the world outside his luxury high-rise. The review praises the film's energetic, distinctly New York style, particularly in its latter half, and Washington's sharp performance. It interprets the film as a self-aware satire from Lee, questioning what happens when an influential artist risks losing his edge.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of single men are choosing to become fathers on their own, often through surrogacy, a path once almost exclusively taken by women. This growing trend reflects rising singlehood rates and a cultural shift where fatherhood is seen as a central source of purpose for men, independent of romantic partnership. While the process is logistically complex and prohibitively expensive for many, organizations like Men Having Babies are seeing a surge in interest. This demographic shift challenges traditional family norms and highlights how modern concepts of masculinity are evolving to embrace nurturing and caregiving roles.</p>
