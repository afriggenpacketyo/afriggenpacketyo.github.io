          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's injunction against a state law that criminalizes the entry of undocumented immigrants into Florida. The decision keeps the law on hold while legal challenges proceed, based on the argument that it unconstitutionally infringes on the federal government's exclusive authority over immigration. The law, signed by Governor Ron DeSantis, has been criticized by civil liberties groups as cruel and dangerous. A federal judge previously found the state's attorney general in contempt for failing to ensure the law was not being enforced.</p>

          <p>For Americans struggling with high-interest debt, various relief options are available, each with distinct advantages and disadvantages. Debt settlement can significantly reduce the total amount owed but may severely damage credit scores, while credit counseling offers a structured debt management plan that preserves credit but does not lower the principal balance. Other strategies include debt consolidation programs, which combine debts into a single loan, and temporary credit card hardship programs for those facing short-term financial difficulty. This article suggests that understanding the specific pros and cons is crucial for choosing the right path toward financial stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Singer Olivia Rodrigo has been praised by her crew for providing free and accessible therapy services throughout her 102-date "Guts" world tour. Rhythm guitarist Daisy Spencer described the 22-year-old as "the dreamiest boss of all time," highlighting how the resource was available to the entire crew, even during off-time. Rodrigo, whose father is a family therapist, has been open about her own positive experiences with therapy since she was a teenager. This initiative places her among other musicians like Lewis Capaldi and Ariana Grande who have actively promoted mental health support for their teams and fans.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic has advanced to his 14th Wimbledon semifinal after a hard-fought victory over Italy's Flavio Cobolli, setting a new record for men's semifinal appearances at the tournament. The seven-time champion overcame a strong challenge from Cobolli, winning in four sets. His victory sets up a highly anticipated match against world number one Jannik Sinner, who defeated American Ben Shelton in straight sets despite concerns over an elbow injury. This semifinal will be a rematch of their French Open encounter, where Sinner was victorious, though Djokovic has won both of their previous meetings on grass at Wimbledon.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Minutes Reveal Divided Opinions on Future Interest Rate Cuts</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Minutes from the Federal Reserve's June meeting show that while most officials anticipate interest rate cuts this year, there is significant disagreement on the timing and extent of the reductions. The summary revealed a divide between concerns over potential tariff-driven inflation and signs of a weakening labor market. Opinions ranged from some members believing a cut could be appropriate as soon as July to others who felt no reductions were needed in 2025. The committee ultimately maintained its key borrowing rate, adopting a cautious, data-dependent approach amid economic uncertainty and political pressure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With federal student loan payments resuming and significant changes to repayment programs looming, borrowers are encouraged to explore options to make their payments more affordable. Strategies include enrolling in an income-driven repayment (IDR) plan before they are phased out, which can cap monthly bills based on income. For short-term struggles, requesting deferment or forbearance can provide a temporary pause, though interest may still accrue. Other options this article suggests are refinancing to a lower interest rate for those with good credit, seeking employer or state-based repayment assistance, and setting up autopay for a small interest rate discount.

          <p>A new HBO documentary, "My Mom Jayne," directed by her daughter Mariska Hargitay, seeks to re-evaluate the legacy of actor Jayne Mansfield beyond her image as a Marilyn Monroe variant. The film explores how Mansfield, an intelligent and talented performer, strategically used her bombshell persona to navigate the restrictive Hollywood studio system of the 1950s. While acknowledging her unfulfilled dramatic potential, the documentary dignifies her as a shrewd operator and mother, not just a tragic figure. It frames her story within the context of a changing Hollywood, where her carefully crafted image eventually became a liability.</p>

          <p>Following deadly flash floods in Texas, New Mexico, and North Carolina, water rescue experts are stressing the importance of public preparedness and avoidance. Experts note that just six inches of fast-moving water can be powerful enough to knock an adult over, and survival once caught in a torrent is largely a matter of luck. They advise having a planned response rather than a reactive one, which includes owning a weather radio, understanding warning levels, and preparing a 'go-bag' with essentials. For drivers, the primary advice remains to never attempt to cross a flooded roadway, as the water's depth and the road's integrity are unknown.</p>

          <p>The Volkswagen Group announced a 47% year-over-year increase in electric vehicle sales for the first half of 2025, with 465,000 units sold globally. This growth in the EV segment, particularly a nearly 90% surge in Europe, helped offset declines in China and North America, leading to a slight 1.3% increase in the company's total global deliveries. However, the company faced challenges in the U.S. market due to new tariffs and intense competition from domestic brands in China, where its EV sales fell by a third, highlighting a varied performance across different regions.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An earthquake swarm involving hundreds of small tremors has been detected at Mount Rainier in Washington, marking the most significant seismic activity at the volcano since 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano Observatory reported that the swarm began early Tuesday and was ongoing, but assured the public there is no cause for concern. The earthquakes are too small to be felt at the surface and are not expected to cause any damage. Scientists believe the activity is likely caused by the movement of water within the earth's crust above the magma chamber, not by rising magma.</p>
