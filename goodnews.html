          <p>Representative Michael McCaul highlights a provision in President Trump's tax bill that could allocate $12 billion to reimburse states, particularly Texas, for expenses incurred in securing the border during the Biden administration. McCaul emphasizes that Texas bore the brunt of the federal mission due to the Biden administration's failure to deliver on border security, spending over $11 billion on efforts like building the border wall and detention facilities. The measure, included in a "managers amendment," is now headed to the Senate, where Senator Cornyn is expected to champion it, with confidence from McCaul that it will remain in the bill. Governor Abbott expresses gratitude for the allocation, recognizing it as a reduction of the financial burden Texas incurred addressing a national issue. </p>

          <p>Violent crime rates in the US are experiencing a significant decrease, reversing the pandemic-era spike and returning to pre-pandemic levels. Murder rates have fallen substantially in 2024 and 2025, with projections suggesting this year could see the lowest murder rate in US history. Factors contributing to the decline include the easing of pandemic-related disruptions, government investments in community violence interruption programs, and stabilization of police forces. Despite these positive trends, public perception often lags behind reality due to bad news bias and the focus on outlier events. </p>

          <p>An Alabama study reveals that climate-resilient construction methods, particularly the Fortified standards, significantly reduce hurricane damage and insurance claims. Homes built or retrofitted to Fortified standards experienced fewer and less costly claims during Hurricane Sally in 2020. If all impacted homes had met these standards, insurers could have saved up to $112 million, and policyholders could have saved nearly $35 million in deductibles. The study supports Alabama's approach of mandatory insurance discounts for Fortified homes and grant programs to help homeowners afford retrofits, potentially serving as a national model. </p>

          <p>Social Security recipients, particularly those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI), will receive two checks in May due to scheduling anomalies. SSI recipients will receive their May and June payments in May, while traditional Social Security payments are issued on Wednesdays based on birthdate. This occurs because June 1 falls on a weekend, prompting an early June payment. The same pattern will repeat in August and October, with no SSI payments in the subsequent months. </p>
