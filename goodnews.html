          <p>Fears of a price increase for Germany's popular döner kebab have been allayed after a wage dispute was resolved at Birtat, a major producer of döner meat skewers. Strikes at the company had raised concerns among restaurant owners and consumers about potential supply shortages and rising costs for the beloved street food. The settlement ends the labor dispute, providing relief to the industry and its customers. The news comes during a typically quiet summer period for German politics, but the potential impact on a cultural staple had captured public attention.</p>

The nonprofit provides free, community-based doula services to offer specialized support, advocacy, and comfort during pregnancy, childbirth, and postpartum periods. Doulas act as a liaison between mothers and medical staff, ensuring patients feel heard and their birth plans are respected. This initiative aims to address systemic disparities and improve outcomes in a healthcare system where Black women are significantly more likely to die from pregnancy-related complications.</p>

The comet, discovered last month, is traveling at 130,000 mph and poses no threat to Earth, passing closer to Mars. Hubble's observations have helped refine the size of its icy core to no more than 3.5 miles across, revealing a teardrop-shaped dust plume and a faint tail. The object will make its closest approach to the sun in late October and should be visible to telescopes through September.</p>

The 85th-ranked wildcard defeated four Grand Slam champions, including Naomi Osaka in the final, to secure the victory. Her performance makes her the youngest player to achieve such a feat since Serena Williams in 1999. Mboko, who started the year ranked outside the top 300, has now surged to No. 24 in the world, marking a breakout moment for the rising Canadian star ahead of the US Open.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the coast of Norfolk as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted a picture of their boat on social media, stating he had alerted authorities to the "dinghies coming into Great Yarmouth." It was later confirmed by the Coastguard that the crew was rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for motor neurone disease research. After learning of his error, Lowe apologized for the false alarm and pledged a £1,000 donation to their charity.</p>

          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has announced he will host a "peace summit" at the White House for the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan. The meeting between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan is aimed at signing an official peace agreement to end their long-standing conflict. The two nations have fought multiple wars over the disputed Karabakh region, which Azerbaijan recaptured in a 2023 offensive. Despite previous talks, a lasting resolution has been elusive, making this U.S.-brokered summit a potentially significant diplomatic development for the South Caucasus region.</p>

          <p>A cultural commentary reflects on the prevalence of teen idols named Bobby in American popular music during the late 1950s and early 1960s. Before the British Invasion, charts were frequently topped by singers like Bobby Darin, Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydell. The popularity of the name Robert for boys in the 1930s and 40s meant a generation of young men named Bobby came of age during this era. This confluence of naming trends and the rise of the teen idol created a unique musical moment where songs about "Bobby" were ubiquitous.</p>

          <p>In a podcast discussion with Garry Kasparov, geopolitical analyst George Friedman outlines his realist perspective on U.S. foreign policy, arguing that national interest, not ideology, is the primary driver of international relations. Friedman suggests that President Trump's seemingly chaotic approach reflects a necessary deconstruction of an obsolete post-World War II global system. He remains optimistic about America's future, viewing the current political turmoil as a normal, cyclical crisis that precedes a period of calm and regeneration, similar to past moments of institutional reinvention in U.S. history.</p>

          <p>Premier League club Aston Villa has completed the signing of striker Evann Guessand from French club Nice in a deal worth an initial £26 million. The 24-year-old Ivory Coast international scored 12 goals for Nice last season and was named their player of the season. His arrival provides a much-needed reinforcement to Villa's attacking options, as manager Unai Emery sought to bolster his squad following the departure of several players. This is Villa's second major signing of the summer transfer window, which has been constrained by financial regulations.</p>
