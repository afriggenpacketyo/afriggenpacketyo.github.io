          <p>The Hepworth Wakefield art gallery has successfully raised £3.8 million to acquire Dame Barbara Hepworth's sculpture, "Sculpture With Colour (Oval Form) Pale Blue And Red." The 1943 wooden carving, which had been in private ownership, was at risk of being exported from the UK. A major public fundraising appeal, supported by over 2,800 donations and significant grants from the National Lottery Heritage Fund and Art Fund, met the target ahead of the deadline. The gallery announced the important piece will now go on permanent public display in the artist's home city of Wakefield and will also be loaned to other UK institutions.</p>

          <p>Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that China and India should act as partners, not adversaries, during a two-day visit to Delhi for talks with his Indian counterpart, S. Jaishankar. This meeting marks a significant step towards normalizing relations, which deteriorated after deadly border clashes in the Himalayas in 2020. Both sides acknowledged a recent positive trend, discussing issues from trade to border stability, with Yi noting that stability has been restored at the borders. The visit is seen as groundwork for a potential meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping, signaling a thaw in diplomatic tensions.</p>

          <p>A writer shares her personal journey of being diagnosed with very high cholesterol after years of unlearning an eating disorder. Having recovered from anorexia, she had embraced a diet without restriction, which ultimately led to health complications. The article explores the complex challenge of adopting a healthier diet for medical reasons without relapsing into disordered eating patterns, criticizing societal health messaging that conflates weight with health and often triggers those with a history of eating disorders. She reflects on the difficulty of navigating a world where health-conscious choices are often misinterpreted as a desire for weight loss, highlighting the need for more nuanced approaches to diet and well-being.</p>

          <p>Thirty years ago, Mike Tyson's return to boxing after a prison sentence for sexual assault marked a pivotal moment for the sport's pay-per-view model. His fight against Peter McNeeley, which lasted only 89 seconds, shattered viewership records despite its farcical nature, demonstrating that spectacle could triumph over competitive substance. The event, promoted as "He's Back," attracted a massive celebrity audience and generated a record $96 million in television revenue. This article reflects on how the fight established a blueprint for modern boxing spectacles, paving the way for celebrity matches and influencer bouts by proving Tyson's enduring, mystique-driven drawing power.</p>

          <p>Social media platforms are fundamentally altering the way people communicate, driven by engagement-focused algorithms that reward viral content and memes. In an interview, author Adam Aleksic explains that this phenomenon, which he terms "Algospeak," is creating a new lexicon and rewiring how language evolves, often at an accelerated pace. The discussion highlights how platforms like TikTok and Instagram incentivize certain types of speech and linguistic trends, leading to the rapid adoption of new words and phrases across a global user base. This digital evolution is transforming language in real-time, with implications for culture and communication.</p>

          <p>A landmark wooden church in the Swedish city of Kiruna is being moved in its entirety to a new location 5 kilometers away. The 672-ton structure is being relocated to protect it from ground subsidence caused by the expansion of the world's largest underground iron ore mine. The complex, two-day journey involves hoisting the church onto giant remote-controlled trailers and moving it at a slow pace. This event is a key part of a larger, decade-long project to move much of the Arctic town, financed by the mine operator LKAB, to ensure the safety and preservation of its historic buildings.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly discussing acquiring a 10% equity stake in Intel, which could make the U.S. government the chipmaker's largest shareholder. According to a Bloomberg report, the plan involves converting some or all of Intel's $10.9 billion in grants from the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act into company equity. This move aligns with the administration's strategy of creating government-backed national champions in strategic industries to revitalize U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. While discussions are ongoing and the plan is not finalized, it follows a recent $2 billion investment in Intel by SoftBank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The private members' club chain Soho House has agreed to a $2.7 billion (£2 billion) acquisition deal that will return the company to private ownership. The consortium is led by U.S. hotel group MCR Hotels and private equity firm Apollo, with actor and investor Ashton Kutcher set to join the board. Since going public in 2021, Soho House has struggled to turn a profit and faced criticism that its rapid expansion diluted its exclusive brand. The deal offers $9 per share, an 18% premium over its recent trading price, as the new owners aim to stabilize the business long-term. (not investment advice)</p>

The images show a white prototype hovering with its rotors in a vertical position, similar to the U.S. V-22 Osprey. While the development marks a significant milestone for China's aviation industry, tilt-rotor technology is known for its mechanical complexity, high costs, and historical safety concerns.

          <p>The US Open has reimagined its mixed doubles tournament, attracting top singles stars like Carlos Alcaraz, Novak Djokovic, and Iga Swiatek with a lucrative $1 million prize and a shorter format. The move is intended to elevate the event's profile and boost fan engagement, but it has drawn criticism from doubles specialists who feel sidelined. Critics, including British player Jamie Murray, argue it devalues the Grand Slam title by becoming a "glorified exhibition" that directs large appearance fees and prize money to already high-earning singles players. Supporters, however, believe the star power will bring more attention to the sport.</p>

          <p>Researchers have utilized artificial intelligence to generate facial reconstructions of Welsh convicts who were deported to Australia in the 19th century. A team of volunteers traced the lives of 60 individuals from Anglesey, who were often transported for minor crimes like theft. By combining detailed prisoner records, historical sketches, and, in some cases, photos of modern descendants, they created digital portraits of what these people may have looked like. The project sheds light on the harsh justice system of the era and the personal histories of the estimated 162,000 convicts who formed a foundational part of modern Australian society.</p>

          <p>A growing number of travelers are opting for "coolcations," choosing destinations with more temperate climates over traditional Mediterranean hotspots amid concerns about record-breaking heatwaves and wildfires. Tourists are increasingly booking trips to places like Scandinavia, the Scottish Highlands, and Slovenia, or shifting their travel to the cooler spring and autumn months. This trend, driven by the climate crisis, is causing a behavioral shift in European tourism. While this may alleviate overtourism in southern countries, it also poses economic challenges for nations like Greece and Spain that are heavily reliant on peak-season summer travel.</p>

          <p>While the United States experienced a significant collapse in its commercial honeybee colonies, China's bee population has grown to a record 15 million colonies, solidifying its status as the world's top honey producer. According to Chinese researchers, the key difference lies in management techniques. The U.S. model often involves large, clustered apiaries with thousands of colonies and minimal intervention, making them more vulnerable to disease and environmental stress. In contrast, Chinese beekeeping typically involves smaller, more mobile operations where beekeepers actively manage their hives, leading to healthier and more resilient bee populations.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's recent visit to the White House appeared to be a strategic success, allowing him to navigate a tense diplomatic environment without major concessions. Unlike a confrontational meeting in February, this encounter was more composed, with Zelenskyy focusing on securing U.S. security guarantees and expressing readiness for a meeting with Vladimir Putin. While he remained quiet on the contentious issue of a ceasefire before peace talks, he effectively presented Ukraine's battlefield situation to President Trump. The key outcome of the trip was not a final resolution but the buying of more time for Ukraine amid ongoing international pressures.</p>
