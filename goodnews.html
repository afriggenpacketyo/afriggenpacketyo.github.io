          <p>New Zealand's All Blacks have secured the Bledisloe Cup for the 23rd consecutive year after a 33-24 victory over Australia's Wallabies in Auckland. Despite a strong comeback from Australia that narrowed the score, a late try by Cam Roigard sealed the win for New Zealand. The victory extends the All Blacks' unbeaten streak at Eden Park to 52 matches and places them at the top of the Rugby Championship standings. Australia has not won at the Auckland venue since 1986, continuing a long-standing drought.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The architectural and urban planning principles long championed by King Charles are significantly influencing the design of a new generation of towns in England. The government's plans for 12 new towns emphasize walkability, environmental sustainability, and "gentle density" with traditional housing styles like terraces, avoiding high-rise buildings. These concepts align with the King's projects like Poundbury, which prioritize community spaces and local materials. Once criticized by the architectural establishment, his views on creating humane, community-focused environments are now being embraced as part of the mainstream approach to addressing housing needs.</p>

          <p>A specialized Ministry of Defence unit has identified the remains of two Scottish soldiers, Lance Corporal Gordon McPherson and Lieutenant James Grant Allan, over a century after they were killed in the Battle of Loos. The discovery was made at a construction site in northern France, leading to a meticulous investigation involving archaeological analysis of artifacts, census records, and DNA testing with living relatives. The identification of McPherson was aided by the unusual discovery of Newcastle Corporation Tramways buttons with his remains. The soldiers were laid to rest with full military honors at the Loos British Cemetery, bringing closure to their families.</p>

According to officials, the meeting will focus on Hegseth's vision for restoring a "warrior ethos" within the armed forces and will introduce new standards to achieve this goal. The unusual summons brings together officers in command positions from around the world for what might be a brief but significant event.

          <p>One year after Hurricane Helene caused widespread devastation in Western North Carolina, volunteer pilots are reflecting on their critical role in the immediate aftermath. With roads washed out and communication lines down, these pilots were among the first to witness the destruction and provide aid, conducting rescues and delivering essential supplies. Pilots like Al Mattress and Tim Grant coordinated efforts, working with groups like the United Cajun Navy to bring in helicopters and planes. Their missions rescued stranded residents and delivered vital items like medicine and diapers, showcasing a massive community and volunteer response to the natural disaster.</p>

          <p>Startup founders are sharing their experiences of recovering from business failure, a process that often involves significant emotional and professional challenges. Entrepreneurs like Ismael Dainehine and Klaas Ardinois describe the pain of disappointing investors, laying off employees, and grappling with a loss of personal identity tied to their ventures. The transition back to corporate life can also be difficult, with some facing an "entrepreneurship penalty" from recruiters. However, many find that the skills learned from running a business—such as multitasking and understanding diverse business functions—make them highly valuable employees, emphasizing the importance of reframing failure as a learning experience.</p>

          <p>To attract more foreign visitors and stimulate its tourism sector, China is continuing to relax its visa requirements, offering several ways to enter the country without a visa. Passport holders from 55 nations can now stay for up to 10 days while transiting through major Chinese cities and international airports. This policy is part of a broader effort to ease entry hurdles, which includes allowing nationals from a growing list of countries to stay for up to 30 days visa-free. The most recent update allows Russian citizens a 30-day visa-free stay, signaling Beijing's ongoing commitment to opening up for international travel.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Women's Rugby World Cup final between England and Canada puts a spotlight on the significant financial gap in the sport. England's team is fully professional, with 32 players on full-time contracts supported by the world's best-funded union and a strong domestic league. In contrast, Canadian players might earn around £6,420 annually from the national body, which had to crowdfund to cover World Cup preparation costs. Despite this disparity, Canada has performed exceptionally well, challenging the idea that massive investment is the only path to success and raising questions about the future development of women's international rugby.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ahead of the Women's Rugby World Cup final, several of England's top players are reflecting on their lives before the sport became professional. Hooker Amy Cokayne still serves as an RAF police officer, balancing her military career with elite rugby. Veteran Marlie Packer, part of the 2014 amateur World Cup-winning squad, worked as a plumber and had to take unpaid leave to compete. Other players, like Lark Atkin-Davies and Hannah Botterman, were a primary school teacher and a painter, respectively. Their stories illustrate the dramatic transformation of women's rugby in England from an amateur pursuit to a fully professional sport.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new peace movement appears to be gaining traction in Germany, with major anti-war protests planned across the country. A recent demonstration in Berlin, organized in part by politician Sahra Wagenknecht, drew over 10,000 people calling for an end to arms deliveries and active peace negotiations regarding the conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine. While the movement is currently fragmented compared to historical German peace protests, issues like the debate over reintroducing compulsory military service could mobilize larger numbers, particularly among young people. The growing resistance is set to culminate in large demonstrations on October 3, Germany's reunification day.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves is advocating for an "ambitious" youth migration agreement with the European Union, hoping it will improve the country's economic forecasts ahead of the autumn Budget. Reeves argues that an exchange scheme for workers aged 18 to 30 would benefit economic growth and businesses. She has urged the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) to factor the potential positive impact of such a scheme into its financial projections, which could reduce the need for future tax hikes or spending cuts. The proposal, which critics claim is a partial return to freedom of movement, would be time-limited without a right to remain. (not investment advice)</p>
