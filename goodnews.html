          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is urging increased tracking of a new norovirus strain, GII.17, due to concerns that it may disrupt the typical seasonal pattern of outbreaks. Last year's norovirus season began in October, earlier than usual, driven by the emergence of GII.17, which has now become the dominant strain in the U.S. Several other countries also experienced unusually large or shifted waves of norovirus infections after GII.17's surge. Researchers are uncertain whether GII.17 will continue to cause an earlier onset of the norovirus season or if GII.4, the previously dominant strain, will regain prevalence.</p>
