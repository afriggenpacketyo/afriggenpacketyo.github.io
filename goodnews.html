          <p>A group of White South Africans arrived at Dulles International Airport on Monday after the Trump administration granted them refugee status in the United States. President Trump directed officials to allow South Africans of European descent to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program, alleging they have faced discrimination by South Africa's post-apartheid government. The South African government has strongly denied the allegation.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in the United Kingdom recently uncovered a Late Bronze Age settlement and cremation cemetery dating back 3,000 years while constructing a highway. The excavation site, located on the construction site of Europa Way in Suffolk, revealed 18 burials dating back to 1200 B.C., along with remains of structures and ancient artifacts. Finds included postholes of roundhouses, cremation urns, a copper-alloy pin, and a rare flint quern used for grinding grain.

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war, according to the article. The U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. The agreement, which suspends tariffs for 90 days, aims to allow further negotiations focused on opening China to American businesses. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated that the two countries shared an interest in avoiding economic decoupling, with China agreeing to suspend countermeasures adopted in retaliation for escalating tariffs.</p>

          <p>Sharpe James, the former mayor of Newark, New Jersey, who served for 20 years and oversaw a downtown resurgence, has died at the age of 89. James was known for his charismatic leadership and efforts to upgrade blighted neighborhoods, but his legacy was later tarnished by a corruption scandal. He was convicted of conspiring to sell city-owned properties to a former companion at a fraction of their value. Despite the scandal, James is credited with revitalizing Newark's downtown and bringing hope to its Black and Hispanic population.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer advises investors against chasing Monday's market rally following the U.S.-China deal to cut tariffs, cautioning that the market's enthusiasm is indiscriminate and that selling pressure could soon re-emerge, negatively impacting even strong companies. He suggests that rallies are a time to raise cash rather than invest, and recommends selling stocks when the market appears overheated and buying when it looks unnecessarily weak. While acknowledging the positive impact of the trade discussions, Cramer notes that the agreement is temporary and investors should closely monitor trade talks for a longer-term deal.</p>
