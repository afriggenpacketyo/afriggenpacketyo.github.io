          <p>Marines and National Guard personnel deployed to Los Angeles amid protests will operate under specific rules of force, primarily focused on protecting federal buildings and personnel. These troops will not patrol streets or detain protesters, and their weapons will generally remain unloaded unless self-defense is necessary. Rubber bullets and pepper spray are also prohibited under current guidelines, which could change if President Trump invokes the Insurrection Act. The Los Angeles Police Department emphasized the need for clear communication among agencies to ensure a coordinated and lawful response. </p>

          <p>A report by UK MPs has deemed the country's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. Currently, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers and second parents to take up to two weeks off work, receiving ¬£187.18 a week or 90% of their average earnings, whichever is lower. The government is conducting a review to explore how best to support working families. </p>

          <p>New government guidance in England allows teachers to use AI to speed up marking and write letters home to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face teaching. The Department for Education emphasizes that AI should only be used for low-stakes marking and that teachers must always check its results. Teachers are also permitted to use AI to generate routine letters to parents, such as those regarding head lice outbreaks. While some educators see this as a moral responsibility due to pupils already using AI, others warn of risks such as data breaches and errors. </p>
