          <p>Delta Air Lines reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings and a strong forecast for the end of 2025, driven by rising airfares and sustained demand for premium travel. The article highlights the airline's adjusted earnings of $1.71 per share and revenue of $15.2 billion, both surpassing analyst expectations. CEO Ed Bastian noted an increase in cash sales since July and no signs of consumer pullback in luxury products. Delta's strategic culling of less profitable flights has also contributed to improved domestic unit revenue. (not investment advice)</p>

A club legend as a player, Wellens led the team to a World Club Challenge victory in 2023 but could not maintain the domestic dominance of previous coaches. The article notes his contract was not renewed after the team finished fifth and exited the Super League play-off semi-finals. Chairman Eamonn McManus described it as a difficult decision, acknowledging Wellens' role as a "supreme ambassador."</p>

          <p>PepsiCo announced stronger-than-expected third-quarter revenue, reaching $23.94 billion, even as sales volumes for snacks and beverages declined in North America. The article highlights that net income fell 11% to $2.6 billion, but adjusted earnings per share still beat forecasts. The company is responding to weakened demand, partly due to inflation, by focusing on value brands and removing artificial colors from products. Activist investor Elliott Investment Management has also taken a stake, urging PepsiCo to streamline its portfolio and consider refranchising bottlers. (not investment advice)</p>
