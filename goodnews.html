          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba arrived in Canada for the G7 summit, preparing for discussions on global growth, trade disputes, and the Russia-Ukraine war. A key focus will be his meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump to address tariffs impacting Japan's export-driven economy, particularly on cars, auto parts, steel, and aluminum, as a House of Councillors election approaches. Ishiba intends to stress the importance of G7 unity in tackling global issues, including the situation in the Indo-Pacific region where China's influence is growing. He also plans to explore potential talks with leaders from South Korea, Ukraine, and Australia, while the G7 is unlikely to issue a joint declaration, opting instead for documents on specific points.</p>

          <p>Taiwan has placed China's Huawei and SMIC on its trade blacklist, further aligning with U.S. trade policy amid rising tensions with Beijing. The two Chinese chip firms are now on Taiwan's "Strategic High-Tech Commodities Entity List," requiring domestic firms to obtain licenses before shipping products to them. This move reinforces existing U.S. export restrictions already followed by companies like TSMC and aims to tighten loopholes. The new domestic export controls could also increase penalties for potential breaches in the future.</p>

          <p>Premier Li Qiang's recent remarks and escalated policy support indicate Beijing's concerns about the property sector, which continues to drag on China's economic growth and consumption. A State Council meeting emphasized the need to optimize existing policies, enhance implementation synergy, stabilize expectations, stimulate demand, and mitigate risks in the property market. The meeting highlighted plans for a thorough stocktake of ongoing projects and land supplies, with urban-renewal projects receiving more land and financing aid. The ultimate goal is to halt the sector's decline and stabilize it amidst external economic turmoil.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers two-way star Shohei Ohtani will make his pitching return Monday against the San Diego Padres, marking his first MLB game as a pitcher since August 2023. Ohtani underwent right elbow surgery and was initially expected to return after the All-Star break, but injuries to the Dodgers' bullpen accelerated his comeback. He recently had a promising live batting practice, and manager Dave Roberts noted Ohtani's eagerness to pitch, while rookie right-hander Roki Sasaki's return remains uncertain due to a shoulder impingement. Ohtani also had a strong performance as a batter, going 3-for-3 with two runs in a win against the San Francisco Giants.</p>

The Bible has been kept in Westminster Abbey's library collection since its creation, only being used in service once. Bishop Morgan presented the book to Gabriel Goodman, a fellow Welshman and the dean of Westminster Abbey, with a Latin inscription, marking it as a gift to the library.</p>

          <p>Protesters in Barcelona, Mallorca, and other Spanish cities used water pistols against tourists to demonstrate against mass tourism, which they believe is exacerbating housing shortages and eroding local culture. The coordinated protests, also seen in Venice and Lisbon, reflect growing discontent with the impacts of overtourism on residents' lives. Protesters argue that rising rents, displacement of traditional businesses, and the dominance of tourist-oriented services are making it difficult for locals to afford housing and maintain their way of life. While some tourists laughed off the water attacks, others acknowledged the underlying concerns of residents feeling pushed out of their own communities.</p>

          <p>Shares of Santos surged over 15% after receiving a non-binding takeover offer of $18.72 billion from a consortium led by Abu Dhabi's National Oil Company (ADNOC). The offer, priced at $5.76 per share, represents a 27.73% premium over Santos' previous closing price. The Santos board intends to unanimously recommend shareholders vote in favor of the transaction, pending a superior proposal. The acquisition would grant the consortium control over Australian liquefied natural gas operations and stakes in PNG LNG and Papua LNG, aligning with XRG's focus on natural gas, chemicals, and lower-carbon energy solutions.</p>

          <p>Japan is shifting from a reactive to a preemptive cyber defense posture, enacting legislation to track online communications and shut down harmful servers. The government is urging private firms, which operate most of Japan's critical infrastructure, to take proactive steps to protect key systems and data. This move comes amid growing cyber threats from state-backed hackers, primarily from China, North Korea, and Russia, and criminal groups. The legislation encourages cross-border collaboration, and the government plans to introduce a full-fledged preemptive defense system by 2027, using AI to combat increasingly sophisticated attacks.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales grew at the fastest pace since December 2023, jumping 6.4% year-on-year in May, driven by government subsidies and consumer goods trade-in programs. This increase provides a positive sign for the world's second-largest economy, which has been grappling with persistent deflation. However, industrial output slowed to 5.8%, and fixed-asset investment expanded by 3.7%, both slightly below expectations. Declining property prices continue to pose a challenge, potentially dampening consumer sentiment, and officials acknowledge the need for further action to stabilize the real estate market.</p>
