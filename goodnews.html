        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A CNBC study has identified the top ten states for workers in 2025, with Texas, Florida, and Georgia leading the list. The rankings were determined by factors such as workforce educational attainment, STEM worker concentration, state training programs, and net migration of skilled labor. The report notes that while the nationwide labor shortage has largely eased, significant worker deficits persist in some states. Texas was named number one due to its large pool of homegrown talent, high concentration of career-focused high school students, and strong worker productivity, making it a prime location for companies seeking a robust workforce.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a court ruling that blocked a federal rule to automatically remove medical debt from credit reports, consumers must now take personal action to manage these financial burdens. This article outlines five effective strategies for individuals to clear medical debt from their credit history. These methods include disputing billing errors, negotiating settlements with collection agencies, and applying for hospital financial assistance or charity care programs. Additionally, consumers can explore debt management plans through credit counseling or verify if their debt qualifies for automatic removal under the credit bureaus' existing policies for small balances under $500.</p>

          <h2>Financial Analyst Suggests IMAX is a Strong Investment in the Film Industry</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-16 12:33:36 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to CNBC's Jim Cramer, IMAX presents a compelling investment opportunity within the struggling movie industry due to its unique and successful business model. Unlike traditional theaters, IMAX primarily sells or leases its high-demand theater systems and provides maintenance, allowing it to profit from the premium ticket prices theaters can charge. The company reported its best-ever first quarter, is on track for record box office receipts, and is expanding significantly in international markets. With a strong pipeline of films and partnerships with streamers like Netflix and Apple, IMAX's growth potential is considered high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The European Commission has proposed a seven-year, €2 trillion budget framework that significantly boosts defense and space investment to €131 billion, a fivefold increase. Announced by President Ursula von der Leyen, the budget aims to address current geopolitical realities while also dedicating about 35% of funds to climate and biodiversity initiatives. The plan seeks to streamline access to funding and introduces new revenue streams, including duties on e-waste and tobacco, to avoid increasing member state contributions. The proposal, which also triples migration management funds and allocates €100 billion for Ukraine, requires unanimous approval from member states.</p>

          <p>The new "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, debuted with a successful $122 million at the domestic box office. In a recent interview, Gunn explained his approach to the iconic character, emphasizing a more human and vulnerable portrayal to create a more balanced universe of heroes. He highlighted the central theme of kindness in an unkind world, drawing a parallel between Superman showing compassion to his nemesis, Lex Luthor, and people showing tolerance for differing political beliefs. Gunn also discussed Superman's identity as an immigrant, a core element established by his creators, the children of immigrants Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency markets saw a rebound as investor optimism grew for the potential passage of key U.S. crypto legislation this week. Bitcoin and ether prices rose, along with shares of related companies like Circle and Coinbase, recovering from a brief dip after the bills initially stalled in the House. An Oppenheimer analyst suggested the passage of the stablecoin-focused GENIUS Act and the broader CLARITY Act is a matter of 'when,' not 'if.' President Trump also indicated that several Republican opponents had reversed their stance, boosting confidence that a regulatory framework for the industry is forthcoming.

Ratajkowski had taken a break from her acting career around 2020 to reassess her professional life and priorities, during which time she fired her management team and wrote a book. She stated her return felt natural, particularly for a project with Dunham, who is her first female director and wrote the part specifically for her. The series explores millennial themes of navigating life in one's 30s, with Ratajkowski's character grappling with unfulfillment despite apparent success.</p>

The crew, from the nonprofit Fundación 911, specializes in swift water rescue and brought cadaver-detecting K9s to help locate victims after the Guadalupe River flooded. The group's founder, Ismael Aldaba, described the effort as a mission to help their "brothers," and their presence was praised by local fire officials as crucial to the operation.

          <p>Goldman Sachs reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst expectations, largely due to a stellar performance by its trading divisions. The bank's traders generated $840 million more in revenue than anticipated, with equities trading revenue jumping 36% to $4.3 billion. This success is attributed to increased market volatility spurred by President Trump's tariff policies, which benefits trading-heavy firms like Goldman. Investment banking fees also saw a significant 26% rise as more advisory deals closed. The strong results highlight the bank's ability to capitalize on turbulent market conditions, with its stock up 23% this year.</p>

          <p>A report from Deutsche Welle suggests First Lady Melania Trump may be a surprising advocate for Ukraine within the White House. President Trump recently revealed that his wife often points out the discrepancy between his cordial phone calls with Vladimir Putin and Russia's subsequent missile strikes on Ukrainian cities. This has led to a flurry of positive reactions on Ukrainian social media, with users nicknaming her "Agent Melania Trumpenko." Growing up in the former Yugoslavia, her background is seen by some as giving her a unique understanding of the threat posed by Russia, potentially influencing the President's recent hardening stance and deadline for a ceasefire.</p>

          <p>A nurse in Scotland, Sandie Peggie, has been cleared of gross misconduct by NHS Fife following a dispute over sharing a changing room with a transgender colleague. Peggie was suspended last year after objecting to Dr. Beth Upton, a transgender woman, using female facilities. The internal hearing found insufficient evidence to support the allegations, which included misconduct and misgendering. The case has brought attention to the complexities of balancing transgender inclusion with the rights of cisgender women. An employment tribunal brought by Peggie against the health board is ongoing, focusing on whether her treatment was unlawful under the Equality Act.</p>

          <p>Republican senators have successfully amended a government spending reduction bill to exempt the President's Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) from cuts. The original proposal sought to rescind $400 million from the globally recognized HIV/Aids program, but bipartisan concern led to the funds being restored, leaving the total proposed cuts at $9 billion. Pepfar, launched under President George W. Bush, is credited with saving tens of millions of lives, particularly in Africa. The amendment, supported by the White House, means the revised bill must now return to the House of Representatives for another vote before a key deadline.</p>
