          <p>The NJ Transit strike ended after the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen (BLET) approved a deal, but train service will resume on Tuesday. The strike, which halted trains for four days, concluded after negotiations led to a fair and fiscally responsible agreement, according to Governor Phil Murphy. NJ Transit needs 24 hours to conduct safety checks on hundreds of trains and miles of rail lines, and trains will not be operational on Monday. The contingency plan including bus service from park-and-ride lots will continue until Tuesday.</p>

          <p>President Trump's domestic policy bill advanced in the House after conservatives initially blocked it due to concerns over insufficient spending cuts. Negotiations led to four conservative representatives voting present, allowing the bill to proceed with some minor modifications. The bill, which extends tax cuts and increases spending on military and border security, faces further hurdles in the Rules Committee and potential opposition from blue-state Republicans and the Senate.

          <p>Nicusor Dan, the liberal and pro-EU mayor of Bucharest, won the Romanian presidency after defeating right-wing nationalist George Simion.

Dan secured 54% of the vote, attracting support for fighting corruption and maintaining support for Ukraine. Simion attacked the EU and called for cutting aid to Kyiv. The election was marked by turbulence and unhappiness with mainstream parties.</p>

          <p>China's retail sales growth slowed to 5.1% in April, missing analysts' expectations and indicating ongoing concerns about consumption. Industrial output grew 6.1% year-on-year, surpassing estimates but slowing from March. Fixed-asset investment rose 4.0%, slightly below expectations, with real estate investment declining. The urban unemployment rate eased to 5.1%. Trade-war fears have receded after the U.S. and China agreed to roll back most tariffs for 90 days, providing room for further negotiation. The Chinese government has implemented stimulus measures to stimulate consumption and support businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump's budget bill cleared a key House hurdle after four conservative Republicans voted "present" following negotiations.

          <p>Following former President Joseph R. Biden's diagnosis of prostate cancer that has spread to his bones, experts emphasize that while the cancer is serious and incurable, advances in treatment now extend survival by years. Cutting off testosterone is the first line of attack, using drugs to block its production. Additional treatments like chemotherapy or radiation may also be used, depending on the cancer's spread. Federal research funding, particularly through Mr. Biden's cancer moonshot effort, has contributed to these advancements. Survival rates have almost tripled in the last decade.</p>

The economic performance suggests that China's economy is holding up well despite external pressures, with stimulus measures potentially on hold for now.</p>
