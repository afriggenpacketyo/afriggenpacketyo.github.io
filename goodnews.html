          <p>Shohei Ohtani struck out six in three simulated innings as he continues to recover from elbow surgery. Manager Dave Roberts stated that there is a "north of zero" chance of Ohtani returning as a pitcher before the All-Star break. Ohtani threw 44 pitches and used all his pitches, including sliders, with his fastest pitch clocked at 96 miles per hour. The pitcher is trying to get into the 60-70 pitch range, then he can start envisioning and dreaming about being in the game, which leads to a score of 80.</p>
