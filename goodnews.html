          <p>The largest piece of Mars ever discovered on Earth, a 54-pound meteorite, is set for auction at Sotheby's in New York with an estimated value of $2 million to $4 million. Found in Niger in November 2023, the rock represents nearly 7% of all known Martian material on our planet. Scientific analysis confirmed its origin by comparing its chemical composition to data from the Viking space probe. The auction also features a juvenile Ceratosaurus dinosaur skeleton, highlighting a growing market for significant natural history artifacts.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams in Tibet May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Flow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that China's mega-dam project in Tibet might not cause the water crisis in India that many feared. By analyzing data from two existing large dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that water flows downstream during the dry season have actually increased. Specifically, low flows in February were up by over 50 percent, suggesting the dams help regulate water levels. This evidence counters concerns about potential droughts and indicates a more complex environmental impact from the massive infrastructure projects.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a final lasting just 57 minutes. This marked the first time in 114 years that a player failed to win a single game in the women's final at the tournament. For the 24-year-old from Poland, this is her sixth Grand Slam title, maintaining a perfect 6-0 record in major finals. The match was a significant milestone for Anisimova, who was competing in her first Grand Slam final after returning from a career break in 2023.</p>

          <p>Drake sought to reassert his cultural relevance by headlining three nights at London's Wireless festival, following a contentious public feud with Kendrick Lamar. His performances were marked by a star-studded lineup of special guests, including Lauryn Hill, Dave, and Central Cee, effectively turning the shows into a celebration of his collaborators. Each night focused on a different era of his career, with a particular emphasis on his connections to UK rap and grime. The enthusiastic reception from the massive crowds and the support from fellow artists signaled that despite recent controversies, his appeal and showmanship remain strong.</p>

          <p>China's private space sector is experiencing a significant boom, with private investment expected to constitute 45% of the industry's total by 2025. The global space economy is projected to reach $1.8 trillion by 2035, driven by new interests in space travel, manufacturing, and resource mining. Companies like i-Space and LandSpace are leading China's private charge into orbit. This opinion article suggests that Hong Kong, with its international financial hub status, is well-positioned to become a crucial financing and innovation center for this rapidly growing high-tech industry.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Boeing is reportedly exploring the possibility of restarting production of its iconic C-17 Globemaster III military transport aircraft, which was discontinued in 2015. The original decision to halt production was driven by a lack of new orders and defense budget cuts, after the U.S. Air Force completed its procurement. However, recent global conflicts have renewed interest in the C-17's unique capabilities, such as its large cargo capacity and ability to land on short, undeveloped runways. Reviving the production line would be a significant challenge, as the original Long Beach factory has been closed and is for sale.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several start-ups, including UK-based Better Dairy, are developing cheese made from lab-grown casein, a key milk protein produced through precision fermentation, aiming to replicate the taste of traditional dairy. This technology avoids using animals and could offer a higher-quality alternative to current plant-based options, which have seen declining sales. However, these companies face challenges, including high production costs, regulatory hurdles for "novel foods," and consumer concerns about ultra-processed foods. They hope to win over consumers by first targeting products like frozen pizza before achieving price parity with supermarket cheese.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the UK reality show "Love Island" is experiencing a resurgence, with its growth on social media, particularly TikTok, outpacing its television audience. Analysis shows the show's official accounts have gained millions of new followers, with many viewers preferring to consume the drama through short clips, recaps, and creator commentary on the platform. While this engagement model brings in new audiences, some worry that it fundamentally changes the viewing experience. It compresses character arcs into bite-sized, potentially out-of-context clips, taking "the reality out of the reality TV."</p>

          <p>Sweden secured a dominant 4-1 victory over eight-time champions Germany, finishing at the top of their group in the Women's Euro 2025 tournament. The win was a major statement of intent from a Swedish side that has historically been a runner-up but has never lifted the trophy since the inaugural 1984 championship. Midfielder Johanna Rytting Kaneryd expressed confidence that there is "something different" about the squad this year and that they can go all the way. After winning all three group games, Sweden will now advance to the quarter-finals, potentially setting up a rematch with their 2022 semi-final conquerors, England.</p>
