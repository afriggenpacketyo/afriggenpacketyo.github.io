          <p>During the second day of the 2025 Ryder Cup, Team Europe's Jon Rahm executed a spectacular chip-in for birdie from a difficult position in the rough beside a bunker. The incredible shot on the eighth hole helped him and his partner, Tyrrell Hatton, regain the lead in their match against U.S. players Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay. Rahm's shot was a crucial moment, quelling the momentum the American team had been building after winning two previous holes. The sensational play continued Rahm's outstanding performance, having already won both of his matches on the first day of the event.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that his military has received a U.S.-made Patriot anti-aircraft system from Israel and that it has been operational for a month. This marks a significant development, as Israel had previously been hesitant to provide direct military aid to Ukraine, balancing its relations with Russia. The move suggests a potential shift in Israel's policy, possibly influenced by Russia's strengthening ties with Iran. Zelenskyy also stated that Kyiv expects to receive two more Patriot launchers this autumn, bolstering its defense capabilities against aerial attacks.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its publication, Judy Blume's novel "Forever" is remembered as a cultural touchstone that provided a rite of passage for many teenagers. The article explores the unique power of teen literature to validate the anxieties and desires of young readers by reflecting their own experiences. Books like Blume's were particularly groundbreaking for depicting sexuality from a female protagonist's perspective, a rarity in popular culture. They serve as an invitation for young people to imagine their futures and feel understood in thoughts that are often difficult to articulate, highlighting the singular importance of art discovered during adolescence.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, a pioneering journalist who became the first Black woman to work as a television reporter on the U.S. West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Breaking barriers in the 1960s in an industry dominated by white men, Davis became a trusted and unflappable presence in Bay Area news. Throughout her career, she covered major historical events from the assassination of Harvey Milk to the AIDS crisis, earning numerous accolades and opening doors for a new generation of journalists of color. Colleagues and public figures remember her as a courageous mentor who gave voice to her community.</p>

          <h2>New ETF Launched to Provide Retail Investors Access to Private Credit Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 11:00:01 EDT</div>

          <p>Simplify Asset Management and VettaFi have partnered to launch a new actively managed ETF, giving retail investors access to the rapidly growing private credit market. This asset class, which involves lending to companies by non-bank institutions, has historically been available only to institutional and high-net-worth investors. The new fund aims to provide liquid, indirect exposure to private credit through publicly traded business development companies (BDCs), offering a potential source of high-yield income without the traditional lockups and high fees. The move capitalizes on the recent boom in private credit, making it more accessible to the general public. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has sold the remainder of its stake in Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer BYD, concluding a highly profitable 17-year investment. In response, a BYD executive publicly thanked Buffett and his late partner Charlie Munger for their long-term support, calling the selling of stocks a normal part of investing. Despite the amicable farewell, BYD's shares have fallen significantly this year amid signs of slowing growth, including a recent cut to its 2025 sales target and its first quarterly profit decline in over three years.

          <p>The U.S. economy is showing surprising strength, potentially staved off from a recession by a 'wealth effect' driven by a resilient stock market. This market growth is powering consumer spending, particularly among higher-income individuals who own the majority of stocks. However, economists warn that this creates a significant vulnerability; if the stock market, which is trading at high valuations, were to decline, consumer spending could quickly contract. With minimal job growth, such a downturn could easily trigger the recession that many have been expecting, making the current economic stability potentially precarious. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anson Funds, an activist investor, is publicly calling for the sale of Clear Channel Outdoor (CCO), arguing the timing is right for a buyout. This move follows a previous activist campaign that prompted CCO to divest its European and Latin American assets, transforming it into a more focused and valuable U.S. pure-play company. Despite these changes, CCO's stock has underperformed, and Anson believes a sale to a strategic buyer or private equity firm offers the best path forward for shareholders.

          <p>Relationship experts advise that interracial couples can build stronger bonds by proactively engaging in four essential conversations. These include openly discussing racial and cultural differences rather than ignoring them, and consciously co-creating a new, blended family culture that respects both partners' backgrounds. Couples should also learn to negotiate compromises on cultural or spiritual practices to avoid conflict. Finally, it is crucial to develop a plan to support each other as a united front when facing biases from family, friends, or the wider community, ensuring both partners feel protected and understood.</p>

          <p>Aerospace company Honeywell is developing an advanced cockpit alert system called Surface Alert (SURF-A) to give pilots more time to react to potential runway hazards. The technology is a response to a recent increase in serious runway incursions and near-misses at U.S. airports. By using GPS data to provide earlier warnings of traffic on a runway, the system aims to prevent collisions during critical phases of flight like takeoff and landing. The FAA and NTSB have been urging the adoption of such advanced alerts to enhance aviation safety in increasingly congested airspace.</p>

The author uses this historical event to argue that the First Amendment's protection of free speech is most critical when applied to offensive and hateful ideas. The ACLU lawyer involved, who is Jewish, reflected on the pain the case caused but maintained that if speech can be denied because it's offensive, officials gain the power to silence any expression they dislike.
