          <h2>Gallup Poll Reveals Record Low in U.S. Alcohol Consumption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:10:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new Gallup poll reveals that the percentage of Americans who consume alcohol has fallen to a record low of 54%, a significant drop driven by growing concerns about the health risks associated with even moderate drinking. This shift reflects an evolving scientific consensus that any alcohol intake can have negative effects, including increased risks of cancer, depression, and anxiety. Younger demographics, aged 18 to 34, are particularly influenced by this messaging, with a higher percentage believing moderate drinking is harmful. The trend also highlights a societal move towards greater acceptance of sobriety, with popular challenges like Dry January and the rise of mocktails contributing to this cultural change.</p>

          <p>The NBA's board of governors has unanimously approved the sale of the Boston Celtics to a group headed by Bill Chisholm, marking the second-largest sale price for a U.S. sports franchise at a reported $6.1 billion. Chisholm, a Massachusetts native and co-founder of private equity firm STG Partners, will become the Celtics' governor, acquiring at least 51% ownership initially, with plans to increase this stake by 2028. This significant transaction reflects the escalating valuations in professional sports and ensures a new leadership era for the storied basketball team. The outgoing owner, Wyc Grousbeck, is expected to transition out of his role over the next few years.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-13 23:05:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Virginia Tech study, involving 182 volunteer dog-and-handler teams, has successfully demonstrated that trained pet dogs can effectively detect the elusive egg masses of the invasive spotted lanternfly. These destructive pests, which promote mold growth and threaten plants, are difficult for humans to locate due to their camouflage. Dogs, leveraging their superior sense of smell, achieved over 80% accuracy in indoor tests and more than 60% in outdoor, real-world conditions, outperforming most human searches. Researchers hope this breakthrough will lead to wider training of dogs to combat this and other invasive species, offering a fun and fulfilling activity for dog owners while protecting local environments.</p>

          <p>Viral photos of rabbits in Colorado with black, horn-like growths have sparked online speculation, with some dubbing them "zombie-rabbits." Colorado Parks and Wildlife confirmed the images are real, explaining the rabbits are infected with Shope Papilloma Virus, a relatively harmless disease common in the Midwest. The growths, or papillomas, typically disappear as the rabbits' immune systems fight the virus, posing no harm unless they obstruct eating or vision. This condition is believed to have inspired the mythical "jackalope" and has contributed to scientific understanding of virus-cancer links. The public is advised not to touch infected animals.</p>

He also expressed a desire to move the company away from political divisions to reach a broader audience. The new ownership structure, with the Ellison family holding 50%, aims for long-term growth rather than short-term earnings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters swiftly contained a small brush fire that consumed one acre of dense brush in Highland Park's Ernest E. Debs Regional Park on Wednesday afternoon. Fanned by light winds and high summer temperatures, the blaze did not threaten nearby homes, and no evacuations were necessary. Helicopters were deployed to drop water on the dry vegetation, while a smoky haze briefly covered the area. One firefighter received treatment for apparent heat exhaustion during the response. Hand crews remained on site to address any lingering hotspots, and the precise cause of the fire is currently under investigation.</p>

          <p>Juneau, Alaska, is recovering after a record-breaking glacier outburst flood from Suicide Basin, near the Mendenhall Glacier, caused the Mendenhall River to crest at an unprecedented 16.65 feet. While the immediate flood threat has subsided and temporary "Hesco" barriers largely protected hundreds of homes from widespread damage, the event highlights a persistent climate-related challenge. These annual floods, resulting from the retreating glacier forming a water-filled basin, are projected to continue for decades. The community is now assessing damage, with some recreational areas remaining closed, underscoring the ongoing need for long-term mitigation strategies against glacial melt.</p>

          <p>A new survey by TravelPerk indicates that over half of business travelers, and 73% of C-suite executives, are now bringing loved ones, including partners, children, and even pets, on their work trips. This trend, known as "bleisure" travel, allows professionals to reclaim family time and significantly reduce personal travel costs by leveraging company-covered expenses. While many employees don't openly broadcast these plans, companies generally accept the practice as long as business objectives are met and expenses are clearly separated. This evolving dynamic highlights a shift in work-life balance and a desire for more integrated travel experiences.</p>

          <p>Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones is on the verge of losing his Infowars show, studio, and brand, as a Texas state judge ordered the company's assets turned over to a receiver. This action aims to compensate the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting victims' families, who won a $1.3 billion defamation case against Jones for spreading false conspiracies. The receiver is authorized to seize property and control websites, potentially leading to a quick end for the Infowars brand. This development marks a significant step towards accountability for Jones's malicious harassment, with the possibility of the Infowars brand being sold to a satirical site.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in the British Medical Journal suggests that drug treatment for newly diagnosed ADHD can significantly reduce the risk of substance misuse, suicidal behavior, transport accidents, and criminality. These wider benefits are linked to the medication's ability to manage impulsive and distractible symptoms common in ADHD. The research, based on 148,500 people in Sweden, found reductions in both first-time and recurrent instances of these issues. This evidence highlights the comprehensive positive impact of ADHD medication on patients' lives, providing crucial information for treatment decisions, especially given the increasing diagnoses and long waiting times for specialist access.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. President Donald Trump's measures to curb China's shipbuilding industry are prompting South Korean shipbuilders to increase investments in Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries. Analysts suggest this strategic shift helps South Korean firms address domestic constraints like limited capacity and labor shortages, and bolster their competitiveness against China. HD Hyundai, for instance, plans to invest $550 million to revive a shipyard in the Philippines, aiming to build up to 10 vessels annually and hire 7,000 workers by January 2026. This move reflects a broader realignment in global supply chains and manufacturing in response to international trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>
