          <p>The Tall Ships Races, described as Scotland's largest tourist event of the year, has commenced in Aberdeen. Hundreds of thousands of visitors are anticipated to view the dozens of international vessels, with festivities including concerts by bands like Deacon Blue. Despite a yellow weather warning for heavy rain, the event began with large crowds, celebrating the city's maritime history and fostering international friendship among young sailing crews. This marks the third time Aberdeen has hosted the event, which runs for four days before the ships sail to Norway.</p>

          <p>The government of Congo and the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group have signed a declaration of principles aimed at establishing a permanent ceasefire in the conflict-ridden eastern Congo. The agreement, brokered in Qatar, commits both parties to signing a comprehensive peace deal within a month, aligning with a U.S.-facilitated agreement from June. This marks the first direct commitment since the rebels captured key cities, a major escalation in a conflict that has displaced millions. The success of the deal hinges on complex issues, including the withdrawal of rebel and Rwandan forces.</p>

          <p>The government of China's Guangxi province has launched a major artificial intelligence competition, dubbed the "AI super league," to cultivate tech start-ups with a focus on Southeast Asian markets. The event, which runs through September, features 17 tracks including e-commerce, smart agriculture, and tourism. With a kick-off ceremony held simultaneously in eight cities including Hong Kong and Bangkok, the initiative leverages Guangxi's long-standing role as a hub for China-ASEAN cooperation.

          <p>Two prominent UK end-of-life charities, Marie Curie and Hospice UK, are calling for a nationwide policy to exempt terminally ill individuals from paying council tax. This campaign follows Manchester City Council's recent decision to become the first local authority to implement such a scheme, which waives the tax for residents with a prognosis of less than 12 months to live. Proponents argue the measure provides crucial financial and emotional relief, easing the burden of bills during an incredibly challenging time. The move is intended to offer peace of mind and compassionate support for those facing end-of-life care.</p>

          <p>Conservationists are celebrating the successful breeding of the California red-legged frog in Southern California for the first time in 25 years, thanks to an innovative conservation effort. The project involved relocating frog eggs from Mexico's Baja Peninsula to their historic range, a complex international collaboration. A key breakthrough came from using a custom-built artificial intelligence model to sift through thousands of hours of audio recordings to detect the frogs' mating calls. This technological assistance confirmed the re-introduced population was successfully reproducing, marking a significant victory in the fight against extinction for the threatened species.</p>

          <h2>Nutrition Experts Offer Guidance on Evaluating High-Protein Snack Claims</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-19 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As high-protein snacks flood the market, nutrition experts advise consumers to look beyond marketing claims. Many products labeled "high-protein" also contain significant amounts of sugar or are highly processed, diminishing their health benefits. Experts suggest a simple calculation: a truly high-protein food should derive 30% or more of its total calories from protein. They also recommend checking the nutrition label for at least a 20% Daily Value (DV) of protein and prioritizing whole food snacks like Greek yogurt, nuts, or cottage cheese for a more balanced nutritional intake.</p>

          <p>To curb impulsive and emotionally-driven spending, financial therapists and consumer experts suggest asking a series of introspective questions before making a purchase.

It is also important to evaluate if the spending fits within your budget without drawing from essential funds, and to research products to ensure value. By being more intentional and aware of the motivations behind a purchase, consumers can make more mindful financial decisions and avoid regrettable buys.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese researchers has developed a groundbreaking method for delivering CAR-T cell therapy, a personalized treatment for blood cancers and other diseases, that is significantly cheaper and easier than conventional approaches. Instead of engineering the cells in a lab, their new technique uses gene therapy tools to produce the cancer-fighting cells directly inside the patient's body. The method has been successfully used for the first time to treat four patients with multiple myeloma. This innovation could make the highly effective but prohibitively expensive therapy much more accessible.</p>
