          <p>As the United States increases trade restrictions, China is strengthening its economic ties with Latin America, positioning itself as a reliable partner. Brazil is planning a major rail link to Peru's Chancay megaport, backed by Chinese financing, to reduce dependency on Atlantic shipping lanes, and Colombia is considering joining China's Belt and Road Initiative. Experts suggest that US trade policies, especially tariffs, are pushing Latin American countries closer to Beijing, which offers a consistent long-term strategy compared to Washington's fluctuating approach. While Latin American countries seek to maintain relationships with both the US and China, the trend indicates a clear shift towards growing Chinese influence in the region.</p>

          <p>The annual inflation rate in the U.S. dropped to 2.3% in April, the lowest since February 2021, according to a Labor Department report. The consumer price index rose 0.2% for the month, slightly below expectations, as President Donald Trump's tariffs began to impact the slowing U.S. economy. Shelter prices were the primary driver of the inflation gauge, increasing 0.3% in April. Economists are concerned that tariffs could lead to inflation shocks, though some importers may have absorbed tariff costs for now. (not investment advice)</p>

Preliminary results indicate that the Socialists have obtained 82 seats in the 140-seat Parliament, drawing support from voters who back the country's efforts to join the European Union. The opposition Democratic Party-led coalition secured 52 seats. Rama's party has pledged to secure EU membership within five years, though the opposition argues that Albania is not yet ready to meet the necessary requirements.

          <p>Senate Democrats are preparing to place holds on President Trump's Department of Justice nominees in response to concerns about a potential gift of an airplane from Qatar to be used as Air Force One. Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a leading Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that holds would be placed until the Attorney General provides answers regarding the plane. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is expected to announce the Democrats' intentions during floor remarks. This move is largely symbolic, as Republicans can still advance nominees through the normal process, even with Democratic holds in place.</p>

The plan aims to boost growth by cutting red tape and lowering energy costs. However, the scale of the spending puts Germany on a potential collision course with the EU's Stability and Growth Pact, which requires member states to keep deficits below 3% of GDP. Critics warn that special treatment for Germany could undermine EU fiscal discipline, while others argue that the spending is necessary to stimulate economic growth during a critical time for the EU.</p>

Debt management plans offer structured repayment with professional assistance, while debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to reduce the total amount owed.
