          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence in reaching a trade agreement with China, stating that the "makings of a deal" are in place ahead of an August 12 tariff deadline. While he characterized the recent two-day negotiations in Stockholm as tough, he indicated that only a few technical details remain to be resolved. The potential pact aims to de-escalate a trade dispute that saw both nations impose significant tariffs on each other's imports. Bessent noted that President Trump would personally need to approve any final agreement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Chase has opened its 1,000th new branch since beginning a major expansion in 2018, bringing its total to approximately 5,000 locations, the most of any U.S. bank. The milestone was marked at a new branch in Charlotte, North Carolina, a market where the bank is competing directly with Bank of America. This expansion, which has seen Chase enter all 48 lower states, runs counter to the post-financial crisis trend of branch closures. The bank's strategy is focused on capturing more deposits in fast-growing areas, with new branches expected to contribute over $160 billion in incremental deposits.</p>

While the project is intended to empower patients, medical experts have raised significant privacy concerns.

          <p>CVS Health's shares increased after the company reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street expectations, leading to an upgraded profit forecast for fiscal 2025. The positive results were driven by strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and improvements in its Aetna insurance unit, which has been recovering from high medical costs. CEO David Joyner highlighted investments in pharmacy technology and labor as key factors. The company's health services segment, however, saw a decline, offsetting some of the gains from the other divisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's debut on the New York Stock Exchange, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not view AI superintelligence as an imminent threat to the design software company. He argued that Figma's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology are not easily replicable by AI models trained on public internet data. This perspective contrasts with the growing focus on superintelligence by other tech giants like Meta. Figma, which was valued at $19.3 billion in its IPO, is moving forward as a public company after a planned $20 billion acquisition by Adobe was scrapped due to regulatory objections.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately getting yellow cards in four separate matches to influence betting markets and had faced a potential lifetime ban. While the four main charges were found "not proven," Paqueta was found guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation. Paqueta expressed his relief and gratitude, stating he has maintained his innocence from the beginning of the "nightmare" ordeal.</p>

          <p>Shares for both Meta and Microsoft saw significant gains following the release of better-than-expected quarterly earnings, with Microsoft surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization. The strong results are largely attributed to the companies' heavy investments in artificial intelligence, and both plan to continue massive capital expenditures on AI infrastructure to meet booming demand. While analysts see this spending as a boon for chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom, some express caution about the "cavalier" nature of Meta's spending on its new superintelligence initiatives. The results confirm the tech giants' dominant positions in the rapidly growing AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that beat Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to rise despite a persistent loss of broadband customers.

Executives expressed confidence in a new market strategy, including new pricing and a free mobile line offer, to stabilize the broadband business. Strong performance in its content and experiences division, particularly from its film studios and the opening of the Epic Universe theme park, helped bolster the overall positive results.

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif argues for the creation of a Middle East zone free from weapons of mass destruction, a goal he notes has been blocked for 50 years. He proposes a new path forward: the establishment of the Middle East Network for Atomic Research and Advancement (Menara). This regional body would facilitate peaceful nuclear cooperation in energy, medicine, and research among member states that reject nuclear weapons and agree to mutual verification. Zarif contends this cooperative approach can build trust and enhance security, reframing the nuclear issue from one of threat to one of shared progress.</p>
