        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Dutch foundation representing professional footballers has launched a class-action lawsuit against FIFA, arguing its transfer regulations have unlawfully suppressed player wages for two decades. The case, which could involve 100,000 players and seek billions in damages, follows a European court ruling in favor of former player Lassana Diarra. Legal experts are comparing its potential impact to the landmark 1995 Bosman ruling, suggesting it could fundamentally alter player mobility and contractual autonomy. The suit is being advised by Jean-Louis Dupont, the same lawyer who won the transformative Bosman case.</p>

          <p>NASA's acting administrator, Sean Duffy, has directed the agency to deploy a small nuclear power plant on the moon by late 2029, aiming to beat a similar joint effort by China and Russia. The directive warns that the first nation to establish a lunar reactor could declare a restrictive "keep-out zone," hindering the U.S. Artemis program. The plan calls for a microreactor capable of generating at least 100 kilowatts, though no such reactor has yet been licensed or built in the U.S. This ambitious goal comes amid proposed budget cuts for NASA and the absence of a permanent, Senate-confirmed leader.</p>

          <p>LAFC is finalizing a deal to sign South Korean national team captain and Tottenham Hotspur star Son Heung-min, reportedly for a record-breaking MLS transfer fee exceeding $22 million. The acquisition is seen as a monumental event for the league, LAFC, and Southern California's large Korean community. The move is expected to provide a significant on-field boost for LAFC's offense and generate substantial marketing and sponsorship revenue. For Son, 33, playing in the U.S. will also help him acclimate to North American conditions ahead of the 2026 World Cup.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has provisionally fined former star fund manager Neil Woodford and his firm nearly £46 million over the 2019 collapse of his flagship equity fund. The collapse impacted around 300,000 investors, who were unable to access their money. The FCA found that Woodford and his firm made "unreasonable and inappropriate investment decisions," increasing the fund's holdings in hard-to-sell assets, which left it unable to meet withdrawal requests. Woodford's firm has stated it strongly disagrees with the findings and plans to appeal the decision. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scott Anderson's new book, "King of Kings," challenges the idea that Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution was a historical inevitability, instead portraying it as a contingent event shaped by miscalculations and chance. The book argues that the revolution's success stemmed from the Shah's hubris, profound U.S. ignorance and inaction, and the revolutionary camp's ability to outmaneuver them. Rather than seeking a single grand cause, Anderson focuses on the actions of key individuals in the months leading up to the Shah's fall. The account suggests that a series of freakish circumstances, not a pre-ordained destiny, led to the establishment of the Islamic Republic.</p>

          <h2>Evaluating the Pros and Cons of Purchasing an Annuity at Age 70</h2>

          <p>For a 70-year-old, buying an annuity can be a strategic move to secure a guaranteed lifetime income stream, but it requires careful consideration. The primary benefit is that older buyers typically receive higher monthly payments, as insurers factor in a shorter life expectancy. However, the main drawback is illiquidity, as the lump-sum investment is usually locked away. The decision depends heavily on individual factors such as health, family longevity, other income sources, and legacy goals. Financial advisors often suggest the period between ages 70 and 75 can be an optimal time for certain annuity products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, has announced that the country will hold general elections in February 2026. This will be the first election since a widespread popular uprising led to the ouster of former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government last year. In a broadcast marking the one-year anniversary of the government's overthrow, Yunus stated that his caretaker government's final and most important phase is to transfer power to a democratically elected body. He confirmed he will step down from his role following the vote.</p>

          <p>Students across Scotland are receiving their exam results, which show a slight increase in pass rates compared to last year for National 5, Higher, and Advanced Higher qualifications. The Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) also reported a narrowing of the attainment gap between students from the most and least deprived areas. The number of entries for Higher exams surpassed 200,000 for the first time since 2014, and a record number of young Scots have been offered university or college placements. Some mail deliveries of certificates to island communities were delayed due to storm conditions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has denied Sean Combs' latest request for bail, ensuring the music mogul will remain in custody until his sentencing on October 3. Combs was convicted last month on two counts of transporting for prostitution. His lawyers had proposed a $50 million bond, arguing he was not a danger or flight risk. However, Judge Arun Subramanian ruled that the circumstances had not changed, citing evidence of violence presented during the trial and determining that Combs still poses a flight risk. The judge also dismissed concerns about jail conditions as insufficient reason for release.</p>
