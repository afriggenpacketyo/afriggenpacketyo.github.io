          <p>The United States and China stated that they have made substantial progress in trade talks held in Geneva. US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent described the discussions as "productive and constructive," while China's Vice Premier He Lifeng said the talks were "in-depth" and "candid." The meetings, which were the first face-to-face discussions since President Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, aimed to de-escalate the trade war that has caused turmoil in financial markets. Both countries are expected to release full details from the talks, which may include cuts to their tariffs. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala of the World Trade Organization praised the talks as a significant step forward.</p>

          <p>The Philippines is holding midterm elections, viewed as a proxy battle between President Ferdinand Marcos and Vice President Sara Duterte. The elections will decide over 18,000 positions, including seats in the House of Representatives and key Senate seats, which will be crucial for a potential impeachment trial against Duterte. Marcos is aiming to advance his political and economic agenda, while Duterte's political future hangs in the balance. The elections are taking place under tight security due to a history of violence, with police and military deployed to protect polling stations.</p>

          <p>UK immigration has seen a consistent trend of rising legal migration over the past 25 years, becoming a prominent social and political issue. Net migration, the difference between the number of people arriving and leaving the UK, has been positive since 1994, with numbers increasing significantly during Labour's time in office. Despite promises from successive governments to reduce net migration, figures have remained historically high. Brexit, intended to give the government more control over immigration, has not led to a decrease in net migration, with recent data showing a decline but still remaining elevated.</p>

          <p>A measure in President Donald Trump's "big, beautiful bill" aimed at restricting federal payments for abortion providers is facing opposition from moderate House Republicans. The measure seeks to make large groups providing abortion services ineligible for federal Medicaid dollars. Some Republicans argue the Hyde Amendment already prevents federal funding for abortion services. Moderate Republicans have communicated to House GOP leaders they may oppose the bill if the provision is included, potentially jeopardizing its passage given the House's narrow Republican majority.</p>
