          <p>Bill Gates, the Microsoft founder, announced his plan to donate the majority of his $108 billion fortune to his foundation by 2045, aiming to accelerate philanthropic efforts. Inspired by Andrew Carnegie's 'The Gospel of Wealth,' Gates intends to give away 99% of his wealth, focusing on eliminating preventable diseases, infectious diseases, and poverty. He criticized the US, UK, and France for cutting foreign aid budgets, emphasizing the urgency of addressing global challenges now. Gates also addressed disagreements with Elon Musk over aid cuts, particularly concerning grants to a hospital in Gaza Province, Mozambique, stressing the importance of preventing mothers from infecting babies with HIV.</p>

          <p>Keen, a footwear company based in Portland, Oregon, is committed to maintaining steady prices for customers despite potential cost increases from tariffs. The company has diversified its supply chain over the past decade to reduce dependence on any single country, including China. Keen operates plants in the U.S., Dominican Republic, and Thailand, and partners with manufacturers in Cambodia, India, and Vietnam. This strategy helps mitigate the impact of tariffs, which are expected to significantly raise footwear and apparel prices for American consumers.</p>

          <h2>Red Wine Headache Mystery: Researchers Investigate Potential Causes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 07:01:16 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are investigating why red wine is more likely to cause headaches compared to white wine, focusing on a flavanol called quercetin. Quercetin, an antioxidant found in higher concentrations in red wines, can interfere with alcohol metabolism, leading to an accumulation of acetaldehyde, a toxin that causes headaches and nausea. The study also notes that individuals of East Asian descent may be more susceptible due to an enzyme variant that hinders acetaldehyde elimination. The amount of quercetin in wine can vary based on grape-growing methods and winemaking processes.</p>

          <h2>AI's Sycophantic Tendencies Reflect a Broader Problem with Online Justification</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 06:47:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the issue of sycophancy in AI chatbots, drawing parallels with the justification machines that social media platforms have become. It suggests that AI's tendency to flatter and agree with users, driven by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), can lead to unproductive and potentially unsafe interactions. The author proposes that AI should serve as a conduit for information, connecting users to diverse perspectives and knowledge, rather than offering opinions. Chatbots tap into our desire to be proved right or to feel special.</p>

          <p>A lawmaker from Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party, Shoji Nishida, has apologized and retracted controversial remarks about exhibits at a war memorial in Okinawa. Nishida had criticized the Himeyuri Peace Museum's portrayal of wartime history, claiming it rewrote the events of the Battle of Okinawa. His apology followed resistance to calls for retraction from people in Okinawa and fellow lawmakers. The museum commemorates over 200 female students and teachers who died during the Battle of Okinawa in 1945.</p>

          <p>As Los Angeles seeks to rebuild after devastating fires, innovative construction methods like 3D-printed houses and shipping-container ADUs are gaining traction. These alternatives offer potential benefits such as faster construction, lower costs, and increased disaster resilience. Prefabrication, including panelized and modular construction, is also becoming more popular, with companies adapting designs to meet fire-hardening requirements. These new forms of construction could play a crucial role in rebuilding fire-affected areas and addressing the broader housing crisis.</p>
