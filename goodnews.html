          <p>Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, acknowledging the company was "mismanaged for a couple of years," has introduced a new turnaround plan called the "green apron service model." The strategy focuses on enhancing hospitality and efficiency by optimizing staffing, implementing a "smart queue" to reduce wait times, and encouraging more personal customer interactions. This plan follows a series of lackluster quarterly earnings and aims to rebuild the company's operational foundation. Niccol, who has a history of successful corporate turnarounds at Chipotle and Taco Bell, expressed confidence that the changes will put Starbucks ahead of schedule for a comeback.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-31 14:40:57 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains a key consumer protection for federally backed reverse mortgages known as the "95% rule." This provision allows the heirs of a homeowner to settle the reverse mortgage debt by paying either the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value, whichever is less. This is particularly significant if the loan balance has grown to exceed the property's market value, preventing heirs from having to pay more than the home is worth to retain it. The rule provides peace of mind for senior homeowners and offers a predictable, more manageable path for their families during estate settlement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, nearly two years after the Football Association (FA) began its investigation. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards in four separate matches to influence the betting market and faced a potential lifetime ban. While the four main charges were found "not proven," Paqueta was found guilty on two lesser counts of failing to cooperate with the investigation, for which a sanction is pending. Paqueta maintained his innocence throughout the process and expressed his relief at the verdict.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced a 90-day extension for the current trade deal with Mexico, postponing the immediate threat of new, higher import duties. The decision was made after a phone call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, with Trump citing the complexities of the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship and border issues. Under the extension, Mexico will continue to face a 25% tariff on fentanyl, cars, and a 50% tariff on certain metals. The move provides more time for negotiations but continues the uncertainty for businesses, as dozens of other countries still face a looming deadline for punitive tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>

Investors are also keen to see growth in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division, which has been constrained by AI chip shortages despite the company's pledge to spend up to $100 billion on AI-related investments this year.

However, the government will also accelerate a planned tariff hike on EV kits to 35%, which will now take effect in January 2027. This decision balances BYD's request for relief with pressure from traditional automakers who warned against the risks of the exemption. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Scientists have identified a new species of stick insect, Acrophylla alta, in a remote rainforest in Far North Queensland, Australia. Weighing 44 grams and measuring 40 centimeters long, it is believed to be the heaviest insect ever found in the country. The insect was discovered high in the canopies of the mountainous Wet Tropics region, a habitat that likely contributed to its remaining undiscovered for so long. Researchers suggest its large body mass may be an evolutionary adaptation to help it survive the colder, high-altitude conditions. Two specimens have been added to the Queensland Museum for further study.</p>

          <p>This article explores whether rolling over a 401(k) to an annuity is a sound financial strategy for those nearing retirement, particularly in the current economic climate of high interest rates. While annuities can provide a guaranteed, predictable income stream to protect against market volatility, the decision comes with trade-offs. Converting retirement savings into an annuity can limit liquidity and growth potential, and often involves fees and surrender charges. The article advises individuals to assess their personal risk tolerance, income needs, and proximity to retirement before making such a significant financial move. (not investment advice)</p>

After receiving feedback from government partners, officials found a way to continue providing the data until at least 2026.
