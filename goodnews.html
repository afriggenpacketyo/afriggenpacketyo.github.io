          <p>A 36-year-old mountain biker from Angus, Scotland, has successfully completed an eight-and-a-half-year challenge to cycle down all 282 of the country's Munros. Sean Green is believed to be only the second person to accomplish this feat, which involves climbing each mountain over 3,000 feet with a bike and then riding down. The semi-professional cyclist and scaffolder described the logistical challenges and time away from his family as the most difficult aspects of the quest. The phenomenon of "Munro bagging" was inspired by Sir Hugh Munro, who first listed the peaks in the late 19th century.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank announced second-quarter net profits of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst forecasts despite challenges from a stronger euro. The German lender confirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with its profit before tax rising 34% year-over-year when excluding prior legal provisions. While the investment banking division saw mixed results, with a strong performance in fixed income but a decline in advisory revenue, the bank remains confident in its overall momentum. The bank's solvency measure, the CET 1 capital ratio, also improved to 14.2%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China to Provide Subsidy Vouchers for Seniors to Boost Elderly Care and Consumption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's government is set to introduce a direct fiscal support program for its aging population by offering monthly electronic coupons to seniors. The subsidies, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, are intended for physically disabled seniors to help cover costs for services like meal assistance, rehabilitation, and day care. This policy aims to alleviate the financial strain on families, stimulate consumption in the elderly-care sector, and bolster the country's social safety net. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to address demographic pressures and foster new economic growth drivers aligned with social welfare.</p>

          <p>Lightyear, a London-based investment app positioned as a European competitor to Robinhood, has raised $23 million in a new funding round. The investment was led by NordicNinja and includes prominent figures from Estonia's tech scene, such as Bolt co-founder Markus Villig and Wise co-founder Taavet Hinrikus. The company, founded by former Wise employees, plans to use the capital to expand into new markets and launch new AI-driven features to assist investors. Lightyear aims to differentiate itself by focusing on long-term investors rather than promoting riskier products like crypto and margin trading.</p>

Simultaneously, Mengniu plans to issue yuan-denominated bonds to refinance existing debt and fund green and social-responsibility projects. This wave of fundraising activity, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors, reflects growing investor demand and a move by firms to shore up liquidity and fuel expansion plans.</p>

          <p>Two former city traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have had their convictions for rigging the Libor interest rate overturned after a decade-long legal battle. The ruling raises questions about potential compensation for the traders and whether other individuals convicted in the scandal will now appeal. Senior politicians are calling for a public inquiry into the affair, particularly focusing on the role of senior bank managers and the Serious Fraud Office's investigation methods. The case has drawn parallels to US proceedings where prosecutors were criticized for outsourcing investigations to the banks themselves.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has affirmed a lower court's decision to block President Donald Trump's executive order aimed at ending birthright citizenship. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the administration's attempt to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary resident parents is unconstitutional. This ruling upholds a nationwide injunction, with the majority arguing it is necessary to provide complete relief to the states that filed the lawsuit. The decision marks a significant legal setback for the administration's policy and moves the issue closer to a potential Supreme Court review.</p>

A team of 25 scientists has set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day expedition to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. The mission, organized by China's First Institute of Oceanography and Russia's Pacific Oceanological Institute, aims to investigate long-term climate response systems.

          <p>A major study published in The Lancet suggests that walking 7,000 steps a day is sufficient to significantly reduce the risk of serious health issues like dementia, cancer, and heart disease. This finding presents a more achievable goal for many people than the commonly cited but less evidence-based target of 10,000 steps. Researchers analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found substantial health benefits at the 7,000-step mark compared to lower activity levels. While most exercise guidelines focus on time, the study's authors suggest a step-count recommendation could be a practical and motivating addition for the public.</p>

          <p>A rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, has been discovered on a La Jolla beach, a species not typically seen in Southern California. An oceanographer from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography found the creature, which is distinguished by its vibrant purple shell and a bubble raft it creates to float on the open ocean. These snails are usually found in warmer subtropical and tropical waters, and their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore currents. While a direct link to climate change is not confirmed, researchers will monitor for more sightings if warm water trends continue.</p>

          <p>South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix has reported record-breaking second-quarter operating profit and revenue, fueled by soaring demand for its high bandwidth memory (HBM) used in AI technologies. The company, a key supplier to Nvidia, saw its operating profit jump nearly 69% year-on-year to 9.21 trillion won. SK Hynix's dominance in the HBM market has challenged competitors like Samsung, and the company expects to double its HBM sales for the full year compared to 2024. It is also preparing for the mass production of its next-generation HBM4 memory. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New regulations under the UK's Online Safety Act now require websites with pornographic content to implement robust age verification for their users. The rules, enforced by the regulator Ofcom, are designed to prevent children from accessing explicit material, with non-compliant sites facing fines up to £18 million. Methods for verification include credit card checks, photo ID matching, and age estimation via selfie. However, concerns remain about user privacy, data security, and the potential for determined individuals to bypass the checks using tools like VPNs, an issue Ofcom says platforms must also address.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers made a surprising admission after his debut at first base, stating he prefers playing a defensive position over being a full-time designated hitter. This marks a significant shift from his time with the Boston Red Sox, where he was reportedly adamant about exclusively handling DH duties and publicly pushed back against a potential move to first base. Devers explained that playing in the field keeps him more active and mentally engaged in the game, rather than solely focusing on his next at-bat. He contributed two hits in the Giants' 9-0 victory over the Braves.</p>
