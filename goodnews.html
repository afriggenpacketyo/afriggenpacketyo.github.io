          <p>Indiana Fever's Caitlin Clark appeared to express relief after successfully making a three-point shot early in a game against the Dallas Wings, an encouraging sign amid a recent shooting slump. Clark, who entered the game with a low three-point percentage for the season, has been navigating the challenges of her sophomore WNBA year. Despite her individual struggles, she was recently named a WNBA All-Star team captain for the second consecutive year, receiving the most fan votes. The game against the struggling Wings was an important matchup for the Fever as they aim to maintain their position in the playoff standings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union has announced it will suspend retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods that were set to begin Monday, creating a window for further negotiations. This decision came after President Trump issued a letter threatening new 30% tariffs on EU goods starting August 1, citing persistent trade deficits as a national security threat. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen stated that the EU's countermeasures will now be delayed until the same date, emphasizing a preference for a negotiated solution. The move temporarily de-escalates a significant trade dispute between the world's largest economic blocs, with EU trade ministers scheduled to discuss their strategy.</p>

          <p>Belgian sprinter Tim Merlier secured his second victory in this year's Tour de France, winning stage nine in a dramatic sprint finish. The win came after a valiant breakaway attempt by Mathieu van der Poel was caught just one kilometer from the end of the 174.1km stage. Van der Poel's audacious effort nearly broke the tradition of sprint finishes in Châteauroux, providing significant excitement to the race. In the general classification, Tadej Pogačar continues to hold the yellow jersey with a 54-second lead over Remco Evenepoel, though his team was weakened by the withdrawal of key rider João Almeida due to injury.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant move for player welfare, FIFA has agreed in principle with the global players' union, Fifpro, to introduce mandatory rest periods. The consensus includes ensuring a 72-hour gap between matches and providing a minimum three-week break for players at the end of each season. This agreement comes after Fifpro filed a lawsuit against FIFA, accusing it of expanding the fixture calendar, such as with the new 32-team Club World Cup, without proper consultation. While Fifpro sees this as a major first step, FIFA's statement also emphasized the importance of creating more global competitions to boost football development worldwide.</p>

          <p>David Heinemeier Hansson, the creator of the Ruby on Rails web framework and CTO of 37signals, emphasizes two critical skills when hiring programmers: writing and coding ability. In a recent interview, he stated that a well-written, specific cover letter is non-negotiable, as strong writing is essential for effective remote collaboration. Equally important is a candidate's practical coding skill, which he evaluates through a take-home test that simulates real-world work. Hansson believes that directly evaluating an applicant's work product is a "superpower" in hiring, far more telling than a résumé, grades, or pedigree.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The geopolitical rivalry between the U.S. and China over rare earth metals is boosting the strategic importance of electronic waste recycling. As China leverages its dominance over the global supply chain, the U.S. is looking for alternative sources, including reclaiming critical materials from discarded electronics. Next-generation recyclers are developing innovative ways to extract not only gold, copper, and lithium but also vital rare earth elements like neodymium from old computers, phones, and EV batteries. This growing "urban mining" industry is seen as a crucial way to build a more localized and secure U.S. supply chain for critical technologies. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The use of investigative genetic genealogy, a technique combining DNA analysis with family tree research, is proving to be a revolutionary tool for law enforcement in solving cold cases. This method, famously used to identify the Golden State Killer, involves uploading crime scene DNA to public genealogy databases to find a suspect's relatives and build a family tree. This article highlights how genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter used the technique to identify a notorious serial killer and help solve dozens of other violent crimes. While the practice has raised privacy concerns, it has also provided justice for victims in cases that were previously unsolvable.</p>

          <p>One year after the assassination attempt on President Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, the U.S. Secret Service has implemented significant security upgrades. The agency has deployed a new fleet of military-grade drones to improve aerial surveillance, a direct response to the fact that the shooter flew a drone over the rally site undetected. Additionally, new mobile command posts, costing up to $1.5 million each, have been established to ensure direct radio communication with local law enforcement, fixing a critical failure from that day. These changes, along with the recent suspension of six personnel, are part of the agency's efforts to prevent a repeat of the incident.</p>

          <p>UK Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander has pledged that the government will make electric vehicles (EVs) cheaper for consumers to purchase. While she did not confirm if this would involve direct grants, she indicated that an announcement on affordability is forthcoming later in the week. The government has also allocated funds to improve charging infrastructure, including £63 million for charging hubs and £25 million for councils to install gullies for easier on-street charging. The move aims to boost EV sales, which are currently lagging behind mandated targets ahead of the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel car sales.</p>
