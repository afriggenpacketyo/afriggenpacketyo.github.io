          <p>England's coach Sarina Wiegman has announced the 23-player squad for the upcoming Euro 2025 Championship, including Lauren James, who is recovering from a hamstring injury, and teenager Michelle Agyemang. Wiegman expressed confidence in James's recovery, hoping she will be available for the first game, and highlighted Agyemang's potential as a wildcard player. England, the Euro 2022 champions, face a challenging group with France, Netherlands, and Wales in the tournament held in Switzerland. The inclusion of both experienced players and emerging talents reflects England's ambition to compete strongly in the tournament.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favor of an Ohio woman, Marlean Ames, who claimed she was a victim of reverse discrimination after being denied a promotion because she is straight. The court overturned a lower court's decision that had required Ames to meet a higher burden of proof, stating that the "background circumstances" requirement was inconsistent with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. This ruling makes it easier to pursue reverse discrimination claims in several states, as Ames alleged she was passed over for a promotion in favor of a gay woman and subsequently demoted and replaced by a gay man. The decision clarifies the standard for reverse discrimination cases and potentially impacts DEI programs.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury yields fell after the latest weekly jobless claims came in higher than expected, with first-time filings reaching 247,000, exceeding the Dow Jones estimate of 236,000. The 2-year yield decreased by more than 1 basis point to 3.864%, while the 10-year Treasury yield dropped by more than 2 basis points to 4.343%. This decline follows a previous day of sharp decreases due to disappointing U.S. data, including weaker-than-expected services sector activity and private sector payrolls. Investors are now closely monitoring May's nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate for further insights into the labor market's health (not investment advice).</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. trade deficit experienced a sharp decline in April as President Trump's global tariffs began to impact imports. This shift suggests that the imposition of tariffs is starting to influence trade dynamics and potentially reshape the flow of goods into the United States. The decrease in the trade deficit reflects a broader trend of adjusting trade relationships in response to the new tariff policies. The implications of this change are still unfolding, but it indicates a notable shift in the U.S. trade landscape.</p>

          <p>Japan has initiated a review of its rice policy in response to soaring grain prices, aiming to boost production and prevent supply shortages. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has pledged to ensure stable rice supplies, as prices have doubled over the past year, prompting the release of government stockpiles. The government is examining the causes of the price surge, initially triggered by a poor harvest, and exploring possible responses, including revisiting export policies and support mechanisms for farmers.

          <p>The European Central Bank (ECB) announced a 25-basis-point interest rate trim, lowering its inflation expectations due to a stronger euro and lower energy costs. Euro zone inflation fell below the ECB's 2% target in May, hitting 1.9%, leading the ECB to anticipate an average inflation rate of 2% in 2025. While the ECB left its growth forecast for 2025 unchanged at 0.9%, President Lagarde noted that the outlook for euro area inflation is more uncertain than usual. This decision comes at a critical time for the euro zone economy, with businesses and policymakers facing increasing uncertainty due to rising geopolitical tensions (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>NBA teams have seen an 8% increase in sponsorship revenue, reaching $1.62 billion this season, driven largely by the proliferation of sponsor patches on team jerseys. The number of jersey patch deals more than doubled year-over-year, with six first-time NBA jersey partners contributing over $80 million in new spending. The opening of the Los Angeles Clippers' Intuit Dome has also helped to drive up overall sponsorship revenue.
