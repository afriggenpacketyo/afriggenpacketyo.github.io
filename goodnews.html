          <p>Online ticket marketplace StubHub has priced its initial public offering at $23.50 per share, establishing a company valuation of $8.6 billion. The pricing falls at the midpoint of the company's expected range as it prepares to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker "STUB." After being acquired by eBay and later reacquired by co-founder Eric Baker's company Viagogo, StubHub's public debut follows several delays. The successful IPO is part of a broader rebound in the market for public offerings after a period of economic uncertainty had slowed activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to make its most significant rate decision of the year, with economists overwhelmingly predicting an interest rate cut. The central bank faces a complex economic landscape, balancing a slowing labor market against inflation that has been creeping higher, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs. This decision comes amid sustained political pressure from President Trump, who has been advocating for lower borrowing costs to stimulate the economy. The Fed's announcement will be closely scrutinized for signals about its future policy direction for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following his death at age 89, Robert Redford is being remembered not just as a Hollywood star but as an artist who intentionally pursued complexity in his work. He frequently rejected simple, heroic roles, instead choosing characters that questioned the American ideal in films like "The Candidate" and "All the President’s Men." This commitment extended to his work as a director and his founding of the Sundance Institute, which has championed independent filmmaking for decades. Redford leveraged his classic movie-star looks to explore nuanced and often critical themes, leaving a lasting legacy on cinema.</p>

          <p>After a legal battle spanning two decades, five partially built, illegal homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon neighborhood are set to be demolished. The decision comes as part of a plea agreement with the property's developers, who pleaded guilty to failing to comply with city orders. The structures, part of a development halted in 2002, have been a source of community frustration and were described as dangerous and dilapidated. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office stated the action will end the long-standing problem, with the owners required to complete the demolition by August 2026.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has suggested that JPMorgan Chase is positioned to become the next non-technology company to achieve a $1 trillion market capitalization. He attributed this potential to the bank's excellence in lending, trading, and capital markets, as well as the strong leadership of CEO Jamie Dimon. Cramer noted that the entire banking sector has been performing well, with stocks seeing both earnings and price-to-earnings multiples increase. Currently valued around $850 billion, JPMorgan's stock has significantly outpaced its peers and recently hit a new 52-week high. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hazy conditions and reduced air quality have been reported near Mount St. Helens in Washington state due to an unusual weather phenomenon. Strong, gusty winds combined with severe drought conditions have kicked up volcanic ash that was originally deposited during the volcano's major eruption in 1980. The U.S. Geological Survey has confirmed this "ash resuspension" is not the result of any new volcanic activity, and the volcano's alert level remains at "Normal." However, officials warn that the airborne ash can be hazardous to aircraft and human health.</p>

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted its strategy to prioritize defense, a stark contrast to the previous season's attack-oriented approach. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, where they prevented the opposition from registering a single shot on target. While the pragmatic style resulted in only one shot on target for Spurs, players and the manager have praised the team's improved defensive structure. The focus on being difficult to beat marks a significant tactical evolution for the North London club this season.</p>

          <p>Google's generative AI application, Gemini, has become the most downloaded free app on Apple's App Store, overtaking its rival ChatGPT.

          <p>The National Hockey League will allow its players to participate in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan, marking their first return to the Games in 12 years. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman stated that after weighing the pros and cons, the league decided it was important to be on such a visible global platform. The decision was driven in part by a strong desire from the players to compete for their home countries at the highest level. A new agreement with the International Olympic Committee addresses previous concerns, changing some commercial arrangements and improving player living conditions during the event.</p>

          <p>Josh Harris, co-founder of the major sports ownership group Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, believes it is unlikely that more sports teams will go public. Speaking at a conference, the owner of stakes in the Washington Commanders and Philadelphia 76ers explained that sports assets have consistently been valued more highly as private entities. He argued that public markets have not fully embraced sports teams and that private ownership better allows for the long-term perspective needed to build a winning franchise without the short-term pressures of public shareholders. This structure is preferable for making multi-year investments.</p>
