          <p>Spinner Tom Hartley is in contention to return to the England cricket team for the upcoming one-day international series against the West Indies, balancing his cricket career with managing his family's garden center. Hartley's Nurseries, a sixth-generation family business, requires him to wake up early, manage staff, and care for plants before his cricket commitments. He believes that having something outside of cricket helps alleviate pressure, providing a sense of perspective regardless of his on-field performance, allowing him to settle on the field knowing there is something for him after cricket and it takes the pressure off a little bit.</p>

          <p>In response to soaring rice prices, the Japanese government is implementing a revised scheme to sell stockpiled rice directly to major retailers. Twenty companies have applied to purchase 110,000 tons of rice, which is over 30% of the planned release. New Agriculture Minister Shinjiro Koizumi stated that the ministry aims to ensure a stable food supply and dispel public anxiety over rising prices, with contracts being finalized and deliveries expected to begin soon. Aeon plans to sell the rice at around 2,000 yen per 5 kilograms, aligning with the government's target to lower prices.</p>

          <p>A study by Chinese scientists has challenged the dominance of Darwinian evolution by demonstrating that acquired traits can be inherited without changes to DNA. Rice plants subjected to cold stress passed on tolerance to low temperatures across multiple generations, bypassing genetic mutations. This research revives the theory of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, who proposed that organisms can pass on learned survival traits. The team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences identified heritable DNA methylation changes as the driver of cold adaptation, positioning Lamarckism as a potential force in evolution.</p>

          <p>Tripadvisor's "Transparency Report 2025" reveals that approximately 8% of the 31.1 million reviews submitted in 2024 were fake. The company's policies on fake reviews changed, leading to a more aggressive stance against incentivized reviews. Tripadvisor uses a three-pronged process of auto-detection, human review, and community feedback to identify and remove fake reviews. Most fake reviews fall into the categories of boosting and member fraud, while paid reviews are a smaller but more pernicious category. (not investment advice)</p>
