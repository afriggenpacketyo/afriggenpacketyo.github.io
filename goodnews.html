          <p>A Mexican navy training ship, the Cuauht√©moc, collided with the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City, resulting in injuries to nineteen people on board. The incident occurred as the ship was departing for Iceland, and officials suspect a mechanical issue may have contributed to the collision. While the ship sustained damage, initial inspections revealed no structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge. Authorities temporarily closed the bridge to traffic but have since reopened it, urging people to avoid the South Street Seaport and DUMBO areas.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of Rwandan refugees, primarily women and children, who fled to eastern Congo after the 1994 genocide in Rwanda have returned home with the assistance of the U.N. refugee agency. The repatriation effort aims to bring back 2,000 people who have been living in exile since the genocide, with many having never seen Rwanda. The refugees will receive emergency assistance and support for reintegration as they return to a country grappling with its own internal conflicts and regional instability. The return is based on a tripartite agreement between Rwanda, Congo, and UNHCR.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed a fiber-optic gyroscope that maintains stability across a wide temperature range, potentially improving navigation for aircraft, ships, and oil rigs. This gyroscope offers a more stable way to measure orientation and turning rates, which is crucial for inertial navigation systems. These systems allow vehicles to measure their movement without relying on external signals like satellites, making them resistant to interference and vital for military and security applications. The development represents a significant advancement in navigation technology.</p>

          <p>The high demand for live shows in China, such as those by Jimmy O. Yang and Coldplay, is driving a tourism spending spree as fans travel across the country for unique experiences. Local governments are capitalizing on this trend by bundling concert tickets with discounted hotel, dining, and tourist bookings to encourage further spending. This approach aligns with Beijing‚Äôs economic agenda to boost domestic consumption amid trade tensions, transforming concert attendance into a comprehensive travel and spending opportunity.</p>

          <p>A rare clue found at a Minneapolis crime scene‚Äîbloody, bare footprints‚Äîled to a decades-long search for answers in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs.

Westrom was tracked down, and his DNA was confirmed to match the unknown crime scene DNA, leading to his arrest. Despite Westrom's denial, forensic experts confirmed the footprints belonged to him, resulting in his conviction for the murder of Childs.</p>

          <p>President Trump scolded Walmart after the retail giant warned that tariffs would force it to raise prices, suggesting the company should absorb the costs instead. Trump stated that Walmart made billions of dollars and could afford to "eat the tariffs" without passing them on to customers. Walmart responded that it would do its best to keep prices low, but cautioned that it would not be able to absorb all the pressure imposed by the tariffs, given the reality of small retail margins. This conflict highlights the tension between the administration's trade policies and the impact on consumers.</p>

          <p>The government is exploring plans to have convicted criminals perform unpaid work such as filling potholes and cleaning bins. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood believes this approach would make punishment more than just a soft option. Probation teams would collaborate with councils and private companies to assign jobs to offenders, with the money earned going to victim's groups. This initiative aims to make offenders work for free, doing jobs the public wants them to do, and demonstrating that crime doesn't pay.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, took 19th place despite strong vocals and harmonies that caught the attention of former winner Conchita Wurst. The main culprit was the song, a manic mix of musical styles lacking consistency. Although the song had clever British touches and witty lyrics, it was too busy and hard to latch onto, as seasoned Eurovision watchers noted. The staging, while camp and fun, lacked the scale and drama of other performances.</p>

          <p>The UK and EU are engaged in intense negotiations ahead of their first bilateral summit since Brexit, focusing on trade barriers, security cooperation, and mobility. Key areas of discussion include a plant and animal health deal, fishing rights, and a youth mobility scheme. While the summit aims to reset relations, the Labour government's "red lines" and concerns about Eurosceptic opposition limit the scope of potential agreements, with France taking a hardline stance on fishing rights and defence contracts. Defence and security cooperation, with the UK hoping to bid for EU arms contracts, are also on the agenda.</p>
