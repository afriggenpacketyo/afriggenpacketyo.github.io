          <p>Paramount has acquired the exclusive U.S. distribution rights for all Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) events in a new seven-year agreement with TKO Group, starting in 2026. The deal, valued at an average of $1.1 billion annually, will move UFC's marquee events and "Fight Nights" to the Paramount+ streaming service, with some events also simulcast on CBS. This marks a significant shift from the UFC's current pay-per-view model, a change that both companies state will broaden the sport's reach to a larger national audience. TKO Group's stock saw a rise following the major media rights announcement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that imported gold will be exempt from tariffs, overturning a recent U.S. Customs and Border Protection ruling that would have applied duties to certain gold bars from Switzerland. The initial ruling caused the precious metal to hit a record high, as it would have subjected key types of gold bars used in futures markets to significant tariffs. Following the president's announcement on social media, gold futures experienced a notable decline. The Swiss Precious Metals Association had previously warned that the tariffs could negatively disrupt the international flow of physical gold. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>British tennis player Emma Raducanu lost a tightly contested match against world number one Aryna Sabalenka at the Cincinnati Open, falling in a final-set tiebreak after a battle lasting over three hours. Despite the loss, Raducanu's performance is seen as a positive sign of her continued resurgence and ability to challenge top-tier opponents as she climbs back into the world's top 40. The display of resilience, particularly in saving multiple break points in a grueling game, highlights her improved mentality. This strong showing builds momentum ahead of the upcoming US Open, a tournament she famously won in 2021.</p>

          <p>The ticketing company StubHub has revived its plans for an initial public offering, now targeting a September debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The company had previously paused its IPO ambitions in April due to market volatility related to tariff concerns. In an updated prospectus, StubHub reported a 10% year-over-year revenue increase for the first quarter, although its net loss also widened. The move signals a potential thawing of the IPO market, which has seen increased activity in recent months after a prolonged slowdown caused by inflation and rising interest rates.

          <p>With U.S. credit card debt reaching a record $1.21 trillion, this article outlines strategies for consumers to negotiate directly with their creditors for relief. Key steps include preparing thoroughly by gathering financial documents, understanding the available options like hardship programs or debt settlements, and maintaining a calm, direct approach when communicating with credit card companies. It is critical to get any new agreement in writing before making payments. While negotiating independently is possible, the article also notes that professional debt relief companies can be valuable for complex situations or when initial attempts are unsuccessful.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has extended the deadline for resuming high tariffs on Chinese goods, delaying their implementation for an additional 90 days until mid-November. The move, formalized through an executive order, was anticipated following recent trade negotiations between U.S. and Chinese officials in Stockholm. Without the extension, U.S. duties on Chinese imports would have reverted to the peak levels seen in April. This delay is the latest instance of the administration's unpredictable trade policy, which has seen tariffs frequently paused, altered, or delayed with little advance notice, creating uncertainty for businesses involved in international trade.</p>

Once a dominant force with over 30 million subscribers at its peak, AOL's dial-up has been largely superseded by faster broadband technology.

          <p>Shares of lithium mining companies, including U.S.-based Albemarle, surged on Monday following reports that a key mine in China has suspended its operations. The Yichun Project, operated by battery giant CATL, temporarily halted production because its permit expired. This mine is a significant contributor to the global lithium supply, accounting for an estimated 4% of the forecast for 2025. Investors reacted to the news by driving up stock prices in anticipation that a reduction in global supply will lead to higher lithium prices, tightening an already constrained market.

          <p>In the current economic climate of high interest rates, a Certificate of Deposit (CD) can offer a predictable and safe return for savers, including those with large sums like $50,000. This article calculates the potential interest earned on such a deposit across various terms, from three months to five years, based on current top rates. For example, a one-year CD at 4.40% could yield $2,200 in interest, while a five-year CD at 4.15% could generate over $11,000. While CDs lack the growth potential of stocks, their fixed rates and FDIC insurance provide a stable alternative for risk-averse investors. (not investment advice)</p>
