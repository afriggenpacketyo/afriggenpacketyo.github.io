          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin, a four-time Olympic medalist, has announced his retirement from the sport at the age of 28. Citing a dwindling motivation and an inability to reignite his competitive fire following the Paris Olympics, the Scottish athlete feels it is the right time to step away. Carlin expressed that he is content with his achievements over a decade-long career and is now looking forward to discovering a new identity beyond cycling. He is now exploring other interests like golf while considering his future career path.</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment manufacturer ASML has sought to ease investor concerns about its 2026 growth prospects, stating that sales are not expected to fall below 2025 levels. This comes as the company simultaneously warned of a significant decline in its sales to China next year due to ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties, including tightening U.S. export restrictions. Despite the challenges in the Chinese market, ASML continues to see strong orders fueled by the global AI boom, maintaining its overall sales growth forecast for the current year.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has provisionally recommended that veterinary practices be required to publish their price lists and disclose their ownership structure. An investigation by the regulator found that pet owners are paying significantly more at practices owned by large corporate groups compared to independent vets, with overall prices rising nearly twice the rate of inflation. The proposed measures, which could also include price caps on medicines, aim to increase transparency and competition within the £6.3 billion veterinary sector. The CMA highlighted that the industry's regulatory framework is outdated and fails to regulate the businesses that own most practices.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' potent postseason offense has been largely driven by the hitters at the bottom of their lineup, who have consistently outperformed the team's top stars. In their 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers in Game 2 of the NLCS, players like Teoscar Hernández and Kiké Hernández provided the key hits, reinforcing a trend seen throughout the playoffs. This depth has allowed the Dodgers to apply relentless pressure on opposing pitchers, even when their main offensive threats are contained. The team's success demonstrates a collective trust and resourcefulness that has been crucial to their commanding 2-0 series lead.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, leaving the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him intact. Jones was ordered to pay the damages to the families of victims of the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting for falsely claiming the massacre was a hoax. His appeal argued that he was wrongly found liable without a full trial, but the lower court had issued a default ruling due to his repeated failure to provide evidence. A lawyer for the families stated they will now proceed with enforcing the verdict, while Jones, who has filed for bankruptcy, contests his ability to pay.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy change for ChatGPT, which will soon allow the generation of "erotica" for verified adult users. This move is part of a broader principle to "treat adult users like adults" and will be implemented in December alongside more robust age-gating features. The company had previously restricted such content to protect users from potential mental health risks but is now relaxing these rules as new safety tools are introduced. This policy shift comes as OpenAI faces scrutiny over its safety practices and aims to give users more freedom while maintaining safeguards for minors.</p>

          <p>Markets across the Asia-Pacific region posted gains on Wednesday, in contrast to declines seen on Wall Street, despite renewed trade tensions between the U.S. and China. The positive performance in markets like Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi occurred even after U.S. President Donald Trump criticized China and threatened further economic retribution. Meanwhile, new data from China showed a larger-than-expected drop in consumer prices, indicating persistent deflationary pressures and sluggish domestic demand. The market movements suggest regional investors are weighing local factors alongside the ongoing geopolitical friction. (not investment advice)</p>

The match saw an early exit for U.S. captain Christian Pulisic due to a leg injury after several heavy challenges from the Australian side. Australia took a surprise lead with a goal from Jordy Bos, but the U.S. responded with Wright's equalizer before he scored the game-winner in the second half.

          <p>Dodgers pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a masterful complete game, the first in a Major League Baseball postseason in eight years, leading his team to a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers. This dominant performance in Game 2 of the National League Championship Series gives the Dodgers a commanding 2-0 series lead. Yamamoto's efficiency on the mound rendered the team's often-unreliable bullpen a non-factor, providing a crucial advantage.

          <p>Amid escalating trade tensions with the United States, some Chinese scholars suggest that external pressure could inadvertently bolster national unity and motivation within China. Yang Jianwen of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences noted that it is a "national character" for external pressure to be transformed into a driving force. This perspective comes as both nations impose new punitive measures, including port fees and sanctions on shipping companies. The ongoing conflict is setting a tone for China's upcoming fourth plenum, where analysts expect the country to emphasize a long-term strategy of resilience without yielding to U.S. demands.</p>

          <p>Despite a generally positive story about his role in the Gaza ceasefire, Donald Trump has strongly criticized the accompanying cover photo in Time magazine, calling it "super bad." He complained on social media that the low-angle shot and backlighting made his hair "disappear" and created a strange, small "floating crown" effect above his head. Trump has a well-known fascination with appearing on the cover of Time, which has previously asked his golf clubs to remove fake covers he had displayed.

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a television advertisement from Red Tractor, the country's largest farm certification scheme, for making misleading environmental claims. The ruling found that the organization provided insufficient evidence to prove its certified farms comply with basic environmental laws, thus exaggerating the scheme's benefits to the public. The complaint was brought by the environmental group River Action, which accused the scheme of "greenwashing." Red Tractor has called the decision "fundamentally flawed," arguing its primary focus is on animal welfare and food safety, not environmental standards.</p>

Prosecutors have charged Chen Zhi, the alleged mastermind behind the Cambodia-based Prince Holding Group, with running the sprawling operation that targeted victims worldwide. The scheme allegedly used forced labor in scam compounds, where trafficked individuals were made to build relationships with victims online before convincing them to transfer cryptocurrency under false pretenses.

One new law requires AI "companion" chatbots to include guardrails preventing discussions of self-harm and to regularly remind minor users they are not interacting with a human. Other legislation increases penalties for creating nonconsensual "deepfake" pornography and requires social media platforms to display warning labels about potential mental health risks for young users.

The driver had drawn the plate, complete with "California" lettering, the DMV website, and a registration sticker. While the CHP post on social media gave the driver "points for creativity," they also issued a $197 fine for violating the state law that requires official, state-issued license plates. The department noted the unusual nature of the stop, which highlighted a driver's artistic but illegal solution to a missing plate.</p>
