          <p>A West Virginia couple, Kari and Bill Cox, turned their personal tragedy into an opportunity to help more children in need. After their daughter Maribeth tragically died, they decided to take in four more foster children, bringing their total to 14. Maribeth's journal, where she expressed gratitude for her loving family, inspired them to continue fostering. This act of selflessness highlights the essence of a mother's instinct and the transformative power of love, offering hope and stability to children with special needs.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish doctoral student at Tufts University, was released from ICE custody after a federal judge ordered her release on bail, criticizing the government's lack of evidence against her. Ozturk was detained in March after her visa was revoked, allegedly due to her pro-Palestinian activism and an op-ed criticizing the university's response to resolutions regarding Israel. Judge William Sessions emphasized Ozturk's commitment to her academic career and peaceful character, stating there was no evidence of violence or advocacy of violence. The Department of Homeland Security had accused Ozturk of supporting Hamas, a foreign terrorist organization.</p>

          <p>Tap water is now safe to drink in areas served by all water systems affected by the firestorms in Altadena and Pacific Palisades, according to state regulators. The last utility with a 'do not drink' notice, Las Flores Water Co. in Altadena, has been cleared to resume delivering drinking water after four months. The State Water Resources Control Board worked with utilities to assess damage and test for potential contamination, with benzene being a primary concern. This restoration marks a significant milestone in post-fire recovery, with approximately 23,000 customers affected by the notices.</p>

          <p>Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts University student, was released from immigration detention after a federal judge ruled her continued detention could chill the speech of non-citizens.

Ozturk, a doctoral student from Turkey, had been detained for six weeks. The judge's decision marks another defeat for the government's efforts to deport international students associated with pro-Palestinian advocacy.</p>

          <p>Kosmos-482, a robotic Soviet spacecraft launched in 1972, is expected to re-enter Earth‚Äôs atmosphere this weekend after being stranded in space for 53 years.

Experts predict that the spacecraft, protected by a heat shield, is likely to survive re-entry at least partially intact. The exact location of its landing remains unknown, but its orbit places it between 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south latitude.</p>
