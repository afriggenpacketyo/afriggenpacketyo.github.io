          <p>Frederick Forsyth, the acclaimed author of thrillers such as *The Day of the Jackal*, has died at the age of 86 after a brief illness, leaving behind a legacy of over 25 books and 75 million copies sold worldwide. Forsyth's career began in the RAF and later transitioned into journalism, working for the BBC and Reuters before revealing his involvement with MI6 for over two decades. His plots often drew from real-life experiences, and his debut novel, *The Day of the Jackal*, about an assassination attempt on Charles de Gaulle, became an instant success and was adapted into a film and TV drama. Forsyth's publisher lauded his professionalism and journalistic rigor, noting his ability to craft thrilling and contemporary stories.</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane, with the judge ruling that some of the claims can be amended by June 23. Baldoni accused the defendants of civil extortion and defamation after Lively filed a complaint in December alleging sexual harassment and retaliation by Baldoni on the set of "It Ends With Us," allegations Baldoni denies. A similar defamation lawsuit filed by Baldoni against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Lively's legal team hailed the decision as a victory, while representatives for Baldoni did not immediately comment.</p>

Judge stated he was surprised by Dobbins' comments, referencing Ken Griffey Jr.'s similar stance against the Yankees.

          <p>Savers could potentially earn between $216 and $880 with a $20,000 short-term certificate of deposit (CD) opened in June, depending on the term length and interest rate. Short-term CDs, ranging from three months to one year, offer higher rates compared to long-term CDs, providing an opportunity to earn a sizable return while maintaining relatively quick access to funds. While high-yield savings accounts offer similar flexibility, CD rates remain fixed throughout the term, protecting against market volatility. Experts advise shopping around for the best rates before committing, but caution against delaying as rates are currently declining. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Critical Minerals Key to Clean Energy Transition</h2>

          <p>Critical minerals, essential for modern devices and clean energy technologies, are facing high demand and supply chain vulnerabilities, potentially hindering efforts to limit climate change. These minerals, including copper, cobalt, and lithium, are vital for producing, storing, and transmitting electricity without greenhouse gas emissions. The International Energy Agency projects a doubling to quadrupling of mineral demands from clean energy deployment by 2040, but uneven global distribution could create bottlenecks and environmental burdens. The US government is taking steps to increase domestic critical mineral production, but international trade tensions and reliance on foreign sources remain challenges.</p>
