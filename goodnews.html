          <p>Japan's economy experienced a contraction of 0.2% in the March quarter, marking the first decline in a year, primarily due to a sharp decrease in exports. This contraction exceeded economists' expectations, raising concerns about the impact of global trade policies, particularly those of the U.S., on Japan's export-dependent economy. The Bank of Japan had previously cautioned about a potential moderation in economic activity due to increased uncertainties and downward pressure from U.S. tariff policies. Despite these concerns, the central bank seems poised to continue raising its policy rate, citing inflation surpassing its 2% target for three consecutive years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>MPs in England and Wales are set to debate a bill to legalize assisted dying, marking the first debate since major changes were made to the legislation. The bill passed its initial stage in the Commons last November and has since undergone intense scrutiny and amendments. The bill would allow terminally ill adults to choose to end their own lives, with a panel of experts overseeing the process instead of a High Court judge. The government quietly made changes to its impact assessment, reducing the upper estimate for the number of assisted deaths in the first year, leading to criticism from some MPs.</p>
