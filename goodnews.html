          <p>Senator Bernie Sanders campaigned with New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani in Brooklyn, advocating against oligarchic control and for progressive policies like rent freezes and increased taxes on the wealthy. The event drew a large crowd, with Mamdani condemning CUNY's dismissal of anti-war professors and criticizing capitalistic greed. Sanders highlighted Mamdani's grassroots movement as a test case for democracy, while also noting the muted support from mainstream Democrats. The campaign aims to mobilize 90,000 volunteers ahead of November's elections, despite alleged interference from Donald Trump.</p>

This marks the second-largest jackpot in U.S. lottery history, with an estimated cash value of $826.4 million before taxes. A winner can choose between a lump sum or an annuitized prize, which includes an immediate payment followed by 29 increasing annual payments. This drawing was the 42nd since the last jackpot win in May, tying a game record for consecutive drawings without a top prize winner.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A collaborative US-China research team has developed an innovative method to launch millimetre-scale robots using the energy from collapsing vapor bubbles. This technique involves rapidly heating light-absorbing materials with a laser, causing water droplets to boil and form bubbles that then violently collapse, generating a powerful launching force. Scientists can control the light to direct the robots' movement, enabling them to launch up to 1.5 meters into the air or swim in water. This breakthrough, detailed in the journal Science, demonstrates cavitation as an efficient propulsion mechanism.</p>

Sabalenka overcame previous Grand Slam final defeats this year to claim her fourth major singles trophy, demonstrating improved emotional composure. Anisimova, despite a stronger performance than her Wimbledon final loss, was visibly emotional after coming up short. Sabalenka's tactical play and formidable tie-break record were key to avenging her earlier loss to Anisimova at Wimbledon.</p>

          <p>Schools across 35 U.S. states are implementing Yondr magnetic pouches to enforce cellphone bans, aiming to reduce distractions and foster better engagement. Students are required to place their phones in these locked pouches, which are then unlocked at designated school exits. While some students appreciate the reduced distractions, others are attempting to bypass the system. Educators and the company's CEO believe the pouches create "phone-free spaces" and promote a cultural shift, despite concerns about cost and implementation logistics in large districts.</p>

Footage showed the ball landing near the boy, given to him by his father, before the woman claimed it was hers and retrieved it. Both the Phillies and Marlins organizations responded, with a Marlins staffer giving the boy a gift bag and Bader later presenting him with an autographed bat.

          <p>UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves' upcoming November Budget will be significantly shaped by recent market volatility and government reshuffles. Despite market fluctuations, Reeves remains confident, dismissing concerns about a "black hole" in public finances and potential IMF loans. The article highlights the fragility of global bond markets and their indirect impact on UK policy, suggesting that any fiscal gaps will necessitate higher taxes or spending cuts. The Office for Budget Responsibility's judgment on UK productivity will be a critical factor in determining the extent of these adjustments.</p>

Bennett emphasizes that women often perform dangerous duties alongside men and need spaces to connect and share their experiences, as traditional veteran groups can be off-putting.

          <p>Ukraine is extensively using decoys, such as plywood tanks and flat-pack artillery models, to trick Russian forces into wasting valuable ammunition and resources. These full-scale imitations, some costing as little as $500, are deployed to mimic real military positions, complete with details like wheel ruts and ammunition crates. The strategy has proven effective, with decoys enduring multiple hits from expensive Russian drones. Russia also employs similar tactics, using cheap imitation drones to overload Ukrainian air defenses. This "decoy war" highlights an innovative aspect of the ongoing conflict.</p>

While designed to enhance security and streamline travel, concerns persist about potential long queues and disruptions at busy entry points like Dover and Eurostar terminals during the initial rollout phase.
