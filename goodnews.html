          <p>The UK Ministry of Defence will invest over £1 billion to develop battlefield technology, incorporating AI and drones to expedite decision-making. A new Digital Targeting Web aims to connect soldiers with real-time information from satellites and aircraft, enhancing target identification. Defence Secretary John Healey highlighted the lessons learned from the war in Ukraine, where AI is used to identify and strike Russian targets. This investment is part of the government's commitment to increase defence spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027, with cyber operations overseen by a new Cyber and Electromagnetic Command.</p>

          <p>Following a U.S. Court of International Trade ruling that President Trump overstepped his authority in imposing sweeping tariffs, the administration is expected to seek alternative legal means. Goldman Sachs analysts suggest the White House could utilize Section 122 of the Trade Act of 1974 for a swift tariff implementation, though it would be temporary. Other options include launching Section 301 investigations or broadening Section 232 tariffs, already in place for steel and aluminum. The administration's appeal of the ruling indicates a determination to maintain its trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has detailed plans to reform the pension industry, including creating £25bn "megafunds" instructed to invest locally to boost economic growth. The chancellor said the reforms would improve returns for workers and increase investments in clean energy and high-growth businesses. Seventeen of the largest pension firms have already approved the reforms in a voluntary agreement, with a legislative back-stop if progress is insufficient by the end of the decade. The government aims to consolidate local authority pension schemes and defined contribution schemes, potentially adding over £50bn of investment in UK infrastructure and businesses.

This strategy, criticized by the U.S. for deepening trade imbalances, aims to transform China into a leading high-end manufacturer in sectors like electric vehicles and semiconductors. While China has missed some key targets from its "Made in China 2025" plan, the push for self-reliance could conflict with the Trump administration's demands in trade talks.

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator suggested that purchases of U.S. defense equipment may help reduce the trade deficit and serve as a bargaining chip in bilateral tariff talks. Ryosei Akazawa met with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba ahead of a fourth round of tariff talks in Washington. While emphasizing that tariff negotiations and security matters are separate, Akazawa indicated that defense purchases could be within the scope of discussions. Japan has been seeking the removal of higher tariffs on cars, car parts, steel, and aluminum.</p>
