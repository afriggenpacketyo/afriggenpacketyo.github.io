          <p>A former EU trade negotiator, John Clarke, suggests that the current tensions between China and the European Union over electric vehicles are not critical, as both sides are interested in collaborating on trade and the green transition to counter potential disruptions from a second Trump presidency. Clarke emphasizes the potential for collaboration in sectors like energy, space, pandemic preparedness, and especially green technology. He notes the EU's need for Chinese environmental technology and goods to achieve its net-zero emissions target by 2050, viewing China as a key part of the solution for an affordable transition.</p>

          <p>David French reflects on the life and career of Justice David Souter, emphasizing his decision to retire from the Supreme Court at a relatively young age, setting an example of knowing when to step aside. The article contrasts Souter's choice with the trend of many politicians and judges clinging to power well into old age, leading to potential negative consequences. It argues that the desire to remain powerful, combined with the support of enablers and a culture obsessed with career success, contributes to this problem. The author concludes by advocating for a shift in values, prioritizing family and humility over the pursuit of power and influence.</p>

However, a closer look suggests that Soto's underlying metrics remain strong, indicating a potential return to his usual exceptional form.

          <p>New research from Stanford University and Japan's Kyushu University has identified the genetic mutation responsible for the orange color in cats, solving a long-standing mystery. The studies, published in Current Biology, involved collecting DNA samples from hundreds of cat owners and analyzing their genomes. Researchers discovered that orange cats have a unique alteration near the ARHGAP36 gene, which activates the gene in pigment cells. This finding intersects with the same pathway responsible for red hair in humans but affects it in a different way, providing new insights into hormonal signaling in various cell types and animals.</p>
