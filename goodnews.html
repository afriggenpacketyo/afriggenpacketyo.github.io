          <p>Media conglomerate Warner Bros. Discovery has announced it is exploring strategic alternatives, including a potential sale, after receiving unsolicited offers from multiple interested parties. CEO David Zaslav confirmed the board will review all options to maximize the value of its assets, which include major franchises like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. This development occurs as the company, still managing significant debt from its 2022 merger, was already planning to split its streaming and cable network businesses. The news caused company shares to jump over 11%, signaling a potential bidding war amid ongoing consolidation in the media industry.</p>

          <p>Shares of plant-based food company Beyond Meat surged nearly 130% on Tuesday, following a 127% rise the previous day, in a dramatic turnaround for the struggling stock. The rally was ignited after the company was added to the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF, triggering a massive short squeeze, as over 63% of its available shares had been bet against. The momentum was further fueled by an announcement of an expanded distribution deal with Walmart. After years of declining value, the stock's sudden revival is seen by some as a sign of a speculative or "frothy" market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Exploring Three Key Reverse Mortgage Options for Retirees</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For retirees on a fixed income, reverse mortgages offer a way to access home equity without incurring monthly payments, a significant advantage in an inflationary environment. This article outlines three primary types of reverse mortgage loans available to homeowners aged 62 and older. The most common is the federally insured Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), which offers consumer protections and flexible payout options. For those with higher-value homes, private proprietary reverse mortgages provide larger loan amounts, while single-purpose reverse mortgages from non-profits offer an affordable option for specific needs like home repairs or property taxes.

          <h2>Revised Guidance on Early Peanut Introduction Prevents Tens of Thousands of Allergies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-21 15:40:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A reversal in pediatric advice over the last decade, which now encourages introducing peanut products to infants early, has successfully prevented an estimated 40,000 cases of peanut allergy in U.S. children. A new study in the journal *Pediatrics* confirms that this change has led to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence among young children. The shift in guidance was prompted by a landmark 2015 study observing lower allergy rates in Israeli children who regularly consumed peanut snacks from a young age. This public health success marks a significant step in curbing the rising epidemic of food allergies in the country.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially launched an AI-powered web browser named ChatGPT Atlas, directly challenging Google's long-standing dominance in the search market. Currently available for Apple's macOS, the browser is built around the ChatGPT interface, allowing users to converse with web pages and use AI to perform tasks. Key features include a persistent ChatGPT sidebar for asking questions about on-page content and an "agent mode" that can complete actions like booking flights or editing documents on the user's behalf. CEO Sam Altman expressed that this new interface represents a significant innovation in browser technology, aiming to eventually supplant the traditional URL bar.</p>

          <p>The FDA has approved Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide pill, Rybelsus, for a new use: lowering the risk of major cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes in adults with type 2 diabetes. This approval further establishes that popular GLP-1 drugs have significant health benefits beyond blood sugar control and weight loss. The decision was based on a trial showing the pill reduced cardiovascular complications by 14% over four years compared to a placebo. All eyes are now on a year-end FDA decision regarding the approval of this pill for obesity treatment, which would offer a more convenient alternative to injections.</p>

          <p>The Japanese yen fell to a one-week low against the dollar after Sanae Takaichi, a hardline conservative, was elected as Japan's first female prime minister. Traders are speculating that her government's preference for fiscal stimulus and looser monetary policy could complicate the Bank of Japan's interest rate strategy. The yen dropped 0.76% to 151.895 per dollar, its largest single-day fall in two weeks. Takaichi's reported plan to appoint Satsuki Katayama, who has previously signaled a preference for a stronger yen, as finance minister adds another layer of uncertainty for currency markets.

          <p>Shares of life sciences company Danaher surged over 6.5% after it provided an upbeat initial forecast for 2026, signaling a return to growth after a period of sluggish performance. While third-quarter results were solid, investors were primarily motivated by management's projection of 3% to 6% core revenue growth and high-single-digit earnings per share growth for 2026. The company also reaffirmed its full-year 2025 guidance, with better-than-expected Q3 results being offset by investments in productivity initiatives. This positive outlook has restored investor confidence in the company, which supplies critical tools and equipment to the pharmaceutical and biotech industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport was prevented thanks to a tip from the suspect's family. The brother of 49-year-old Billy Joe Cagle said the family contacted police after seeing Cagle live-streaming on social media, threatening to "shoot up" the airport. Police arrested Cagle inside the terminal and later found an AR-15-style rifle with 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck. Atlanta's mayor praised the family's quick action, stating that the "See something, say something" principle worked to avert a tragedy. Cagle, who his brother says has a history of mental health challenges, now faces multiple felony charges.</p>

          <p>A high court in Colombia has overturned a bribery conviction against former President Álvaro Uribe, who was sentenced to house arrest in August. The Bogota High Court ruled that the charges of witness tampering and bribery in criminal proceedings were not proven "beyond reasonable doubt," citing methodological errors and biased evaluation of evidence in the initial sentence. Uribe, who served as president from 2002 to 2010, had been accused of bribing former paramilitary members to lie about his alleged links to their groups. An appeal against a separate procedural fraud charge is still ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For individuals overwhelmed by debt, Chapter 7 bankruptcy can offer a fresh start, but eligibility is largely determined by income through a process called the "means test." To qualify, a person's monthly income over the past six months must generally be below their state's median income for a household of their size. If their income is higher, they may still qualify if, after deducting allowed expenses like housing and healthcare, their disposable income is limited. For those who don't qualify, alternatives like Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debt settlement programs, or debt management plans offer other paths to financial relief without the same long-term credit impact.</p>

          <p>The fitness trend of wearing weighted vests to intensify workouts can offer benefits but also carries risks, according to CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook. He explained that the vests can help burn more calories and increase cardiovascular workload, but individuals with underlying health conditions should consult a doctor first. While the impact on bone health is inconclusive, the vests may improve muscle strength and help prevent falls if used correctly. Dr. LaPook advises starting with a weight equivalent to 5% of one's body weight and ensuring a proper fit to avoid putting undue stress on joints.</p>
