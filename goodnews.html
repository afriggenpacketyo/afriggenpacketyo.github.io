          <p>In a new discussion series, leading China experts Professor Li Cheng and Andrew Browne examine the current state and future trajectory of U.S.-China relations. The dialogue addresses the complexities of the relationship between the world's two largest economies, particularly in light of growing trade frictions and the potential policies of a second Donald Trump administration. The experts provide their assessments on the health of bilateral ties following a tumultuous period of tariffs and trade negotiations. Their conversation aims to shed light on how this critical global relationship might evolve in the coming years.</p>

          <p>Chelsea defeated Paris Saint-Germain to win the newly expanded 32-team FIFA Club World Cup, an event hailed as a financial success by FIFA President Gianni Infantino but criticized by others. The article highlights the tournament's significant revenue and prize money, as well as the close relationship between Infantino and former President Donald Trump, who attended the final. However, the competition has faced backlash over player welfare, with concerns about exhaustion and playing in extreme heat. Despite these issues, FIFA announced new player welfare agreements, including mandatory rest periods, as the tournament concluded.</p>

          <h2>Jim Cramer Argues for Separating Politics from Investment Strategy</h2>

          <p>In an address to the CNBC Investing Club, Jim Cramer advised investors to separate their personal political feelings from their financial decisions, particularly regarding the Trump administration. He posits that despite widespread personal dislike for the president, the market has remained resilient, driven by individual investors and pro-business policies. Cramer suggests that factors like deregulation, a favorable environment for corporate mergers, and the deflationary impact of artificial intelligence are creating a bullish market. He argues these elements may outweigh the inflationary pressures of tariffs, creating opportunities for investors regardless of their political leanings. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In his final career match, WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg was defeated by Gunther, who retained the World Heavyweight Championship at Saturday Night's Main Event in Atlanta. The match concluded with Gunther applying a sleeper hold that caused Goldberg to pass out. Following the contest, Goldberg addressed the crowd to thank his family, friends, and fans for their support throughout his illustrious career. The event also featured a shocking upset where LA Knight pinned Seth Rollins, during which Rollins appeared to sustain a legitimate knee injury that required medical attention.</p>

          <p>Justin Bieber has released a surprise 21-track album titled "Swag," which critics describe as a raw, improvisatory, and messy yet beautiful R&B project. The album follows a period of personal and professional upheaval for the artist, and its sound is characterized by murky production and spacey, chillwave-inspired grooves. This release is seen as a continuation of Bieber's periodic shifts away from mainstream pop towards more personal, R&B-focused work, similar to his past albums "Journals" and "Changes." The article suggests the album reflects a modern pop sensibility that values idiosyncratic expression over polished perfection.</p>

          <p>The new film "Superman," written and directed by James Gunn, launched with a strong $122 million opening weekend at the North American box office. This marks a promising start for the new era of DC Studios, which has recently struggled with a series of underperforming superhero films. The debut is the third-largest of 2025 and the first DC title to surpass the $100 million opening mark since 2017's "Wonder Woman." While the domestic numbers were robust, the international box office was softer, with the film earning $95 million across 78 markets.</p>

          <p>World number one Jannik Sinner has won his first Wimbledon title, defeating two-time defending champion Carlos Alcaraz in a four-set final. The victory marks a significant moment for the 23-year-old Italian, who avenged a painful five-set loss to Alcaraz at the French Open just over a month ago. Sinner's composed and clinical performance on Centre Court ended Alcaraz's 24-match winning streak at the tournament. The match is being hailed as another gripping contest between the two young stars who are establishing a dominant and compelling rivalry at the top of men's tennis.</p>

          <p>An old fortune cookie factory in Denver, dating back to the 1940s, has been repurposed into a unique, privately-funded art gallery that is free to the public. Founder Amanda Precourt purchased the dilapidated building nearly a decade ago and, after an eight-year transformation, opened the Cookie Factory in May. The mission behind the space is to provide a place for community gathering and healing through art, a cause personal to the founder. The inaugural exhibition features nature-based work by artist Sam Falls and is part of a long-term vision to offer a rotating selection of artists to the city.</p>

The 27-year-old player has already agreed to personal terms on a five-year contract with the Premier League club. All parties are reportedly working to complete the signing within the next 24 hours, which would allow Gyokeres to join the team for its pre-season tour in Asia later this week.</p>

This is Gotterup's second PGA Tour title and earns him a debut appearance in The Open at Royal Portrush next week.
