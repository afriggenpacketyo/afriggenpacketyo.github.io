          <p>A misplaced antenna caused military air traffic controllers to lose contact with a Black Hawk helicopter near Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, leading to two commercial planes performing go-arounds. Brig. Gen. Matthew Braman stated that the FAA received 'inconclusive' data due to the antenna's incorrect placement, causing confusion. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy expressed frustration, emphasizing the importance of safety after a recent fatal midair collision. The FAA is working to modernize air traffic systems to prevent future incidents, and the NTSB is investigating the May 1 event.</p>

          <p>President Trump has ordered significant reductions to the White House National Security Council, resulting in numerous policy experts being dismissed abruptly. The goal is to streamline operations and eliminate redundancy, shifting responsibilities back to departments and agencies. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been effectively running the NSC, and Vice President JD Vance's national security advisor Andy Baker is taking a top role in the restructured NSC. This move aims to align the NSC more closely with Trump's policy preferences, reducing the influence of dissenting voices.</p>
