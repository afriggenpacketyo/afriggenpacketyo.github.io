          <p>Pfizer has raised its full-year profit guidance for 2025, citing effective cost-cutting measures and better-than-expected second-quarter financial results that surpassed Wall Street estimates. The pharmaceutical giant's revenue was bolstered by strong sales from its COVID-19 products, Comirnaty and Paxlovid, as well as other key drugs like Padcev and Eliquis. The company now anticipates adjusted earnings between $2.90 and $3.10 per share, an increase from its previous forecast. This optimistic outlook comes as Pfizer navigates pressures from the Trump administration to lower drug prices and implements significant internal savings programs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. space agency, NASA, is accelerating plans to build a nuclear reactor on the Moon by 2030, a key step toward establishing a permanent human base on the lunar surface. The initiative is seen as a response to similar ambitions from China and Russia, with concerns that those nations could create exclusive zones on the Moon. While scientists agree that nuclear power is likely the most viable energy source for long-term lunar missions, the ambitious timeline is questioned due to recent NASA budget cuts. The project also raises geopolitical tensions, with some experts worried that the new space race prioritizes national interests over collaborative scientific exploration.</p>

This "Substack summer" has seen a wave of novelists who gained prominence on the platform receive mainstream attention, suggesting a shift in how literary reputations are built.

          <p>China's highest court has showcased 12 legal rulings to demonstrate how the country's landmark private sector promotion law is being implemented, aiming to boost business confidence. The selected cases are intended to guide the judiciary and assure private entrepreneurs of legal protection and equal treatment. Most of the highlighted disputes involved private companies against state-backed entities, such as a case where a medical device manufacturer successfully sued a state hospital for non-payment. These actions are part of a broader effort by Beijing to stabilize the economy and support the growth of private enterprises.</p>

          <p>A GPS-guided robot named Turf Tank is transforming the labor-intensive job of lining athletic fields for sports like soccer and football. The autonomous machine can accurately paint a full-sized field in a fraction of the time it takes a human crew, solving a major logistical problem for groundskeepers managing multiple fields. Developed by an Atlanta-based entrepreneur and Danish partners, the technology is now used by thousands of clients, including professional sports teams like the LA Galaxy and LAFC, as well as numerous universities and high schools. This innovation allows grounds crews to focus on turf management rather than the repetitive task of striping.</p>

          <p>Saudi Aramco announced a drop in second-quarter revenue, attributing the decline to lower prices for crude oil and chemical products. The state-owned oil giant reported an adjusted net income of $24.5 billion, which still beat analyst expectations despite being the tenth consecutive quarter of declining profits. CEO Amin Nasser expressed optimism for the future, forecasting that oil demand in the second half of 2025 will be significantly higher. The company is also maintaining its capital expenditure guidance and focusing on increasing its natural gas production by over 60% by 2030. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Analysts See Signs of Recovery as China's Property Market Slump May Be Bottoming Out</h2>

          <p>China's prolonged property market downturn may be approaching its end, according to analysts who point to stabilizing factors like renewed credit for developers and a shrinking inventory of unsold homes. Fitch Ratings has revised its forecast, now predicting a slower 7% decline in new home sales for the year, an improvement from its earlier 15% projection. A key factor in this potential recovery is the consolidation of the market, with large state-owned developers increasing their market share. This shift is seen as instrumental in bringing stability to a sector that has been in crisis since 2021. (not investment advice)</p>
