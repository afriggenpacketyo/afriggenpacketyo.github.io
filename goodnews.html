          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a 3% annualized rate in the second quarter of 2025, surpassing economists' expectations and reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The growth was significantly influenced by a sharp decrease in imports, a statistical quirk related to the implementation of new trade tariffs. Consumer spending also showed renewed strength, rising by 1.4%, while inflation indicators like the PCE price index remained just above the Federal Reserve's target. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that despite a slight drop, current Certificate of Deposit (CD) rates remain attractive, with many yields above 4%. To maximize returns in an uncertain economic climate, savers are advised to shop around, particularly at online banks which often offer better rates. Strategies like CD laddering—spreading investments across different term lengths—can help hedge against future interest rate shifts and provide liquidity. Experts also recommend choosing term lengths wisely and avoiding automatic renewals to ensure funds are reinvested at the best available rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>US Economic Rebound Prompts Trump to Renew Pressure on Federal Reserve</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-30 09:53:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy's 3% growth in the second quarter, driven largely by a tariff-induced drop in imports, has been seized upon by President Trump to intensify his calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. Despite the strong headline number, analysts note that underlying indicators of private domestic demand have slowed, suggesting a less robust picture. The rebound is seen by some economists as a reason for the Fed to hold rates steady, creating a clear point of contention between the White House and the central bank. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The pro-Palestinian protest group Palestine Action has won a High Court ruling allowing it to legally challenge its proscription as a terrorist organization by the UK government. The ban was implemented after the group caused millions in damage to firms linked to Israel, making support for the group a criminal offense. The judge ruled that the ban could potentially conflict with free speech rights and that a swift review was necessary to avoid legal "chaos" in potential prosecutions. The decision allows for a judicial review of the Home Secretary's actions.</p>

          <p>Amid a challenging housing market, current average mortgage rates are reported to be around 6.79% for a 30-year loan and 6.01% for a 15-year loan as of late July 2025. Refinance rates are slightly higher. Experts advise that borrowers with strong credit profiles can still secure favorable rates by strengthening their credit scores and shopping around among different lenders. While rates are higher than in recent years, there is some optimism that they may stabilize if the Federal Reserve pauses its rate hikes. (not investment advice)</p>

A surge in imports early in the year depressed first-quarter GDP, while a subsequent drop in imports artificially inflated the second-quarter figure. When averaging the two quarters, the economy grew at a more modest 1.25% pace, indicating a slowdown from previous years. (not investment advice)</p>
