          <p>England completed a comprehensive clean sweep of the one-day international series against the West Indies with a dominant nine-wicket victory in a rain-affected match at Taunton. Chasing a reduced target of 106, England reached the total in just 10.5 overs, led by an unbeaten 57 from captain Nat Sciver-Brunt. West Indies struggled after losing early wickets and were further hampered by the absence of star all-rounder Hayley Matthews. England's summer continues with T20s and ODIs against India, building on their success in both the T20 and ODI series against the West Indies, showing a strong performance.</p>

          <p>Former MLB pitcher Steven Register, diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer, found a liver donor in Kristin Johnston, a high school classmate he hadn't seen in 20 years. Johnston volunteered after seeing Register's wife's Facebook plea for a living liver donor. Doctors had given Register a year to a year-and-a-half to live, making a liver transplant his best chance of survival. The surgery involves removing 70% of Johnston‚Äôs liver and transplanting it into Register, with both livers regenerating over time. The families hope their story raises awareness about living organ donation, showcasing a selfless act of kindness and faith.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has reached an agreement with City Council President Marqueece Harris-Dawson to restore police officer hiring that was cut in the recent budget. The agreement ensures that funds will be identified for an additional 240 police recruits within 90 days. This comes after the City Council reduced the number of police officers hired in the coming fiscal year, impacting the mayor's plan to close a $1-billion shortfall. The restoration of police recruits would require an additional $13.3 million for the coming year, reflecting the ongoing debate over public safety and budget priorities in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Amidst political gridlock, French politicians are focusing on addressing historical injustices through symbolic initiatives. Parliament adopted measures to posthumously promote Alfred Dreyfus, compensate returnees from French Indochina, and address Haiti's "double debt." These actions follow a failed attempt to withdraw a controversial retirement age increase, highlighting the legislature's difficulty in enacting structural reforms. While some view these remembrance policies as a sign of social maturity, others suggest they are easier to pass than substantive changes. The initiatives reflect France's ongoing engagement with its past and its efforts to reconcile with historical wrongs.</p>

          <p>Dave Ramsey warns that nearly half of Americans are making a significant Social Security mistake by not saving enough for retirement. Ramsey's study highlights that a large percentage of Americans are not actively saving for the future, leading to potential financial difficulties in their golden years. He recommends creating a savings benchmark of at least 15% of gross income to ensure a secure retirement. With Social Security benefits typically replacing only a portion of pre-retirement income, Ramsey emphasizes the importance of proactive savings strategies. (not investment advice)</p>
