          <p>Paleontologists have discovered a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator named Mosura fentoni in the Burgess Shale of the Canadian Rockies. This creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," was about the length of an index finger and had a circular mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws. The discovery provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period, revealing that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts. The fossil also showed the creature's open circulatory system, offering valuable information about the diversity of life before the Cambrian explosion. </p>

          <p>Opinion writer John McWhorter visits the National Museum of African American History and Culture, finding it a rich and inspiring experience that balances tragedy and joy. The museum's design takes visitors on a journey from the darkness of slavery to the light of progress. McWhorter appreciates the nuanced portrayal of Black history, contrasting it with some current historical thinking that he sees as overly focused on grievance. He argues for a more complex understanding of Black history that acknowledges both the struggles and the achievements of Black Americans. </p>
