          <p>Meta announced the removal of approximately 10 million Facebook profiles in the first half of 2025 for impersonating large content creators. This action is part of a broader initiative to combat spam and unoriginal content, including material generated by artificial intelligence. The company is also implementing stricter measures to promote original creator content and has taken action against 500,000 other accounts for inauthentic behavior. This move comes as other platforms like YouTube also tighten policies against mass-produced, low-quality "AI slop" to maintain content integrity.</p>

In other business news, Amazon refuted negative rumors by announcing its most successful Prime Day event ever, with record sales.

          <p>President Trump has announced a significant agreement with NATO allies to provide large-scale arms deliveries to Ukraine, including critically needed Patriot missile systems. The deal, described as being worth billions, will be funded by European nations, with initial deliveries expected within days. In a major policy shift, Trump also issued a 50-day deadline for Russia to make peace, warning of severe secondary tariffs on countries trading with Moscow if the deadline is not met. This marks a dramatic change in the administration's tone and substance regarding the conflict, reflecting growing frustration with Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Starbucks is increasing its return-to-office requirement for corporate employees to four days a week, starting in October. For staff unwilling to comply with the new policy, the company is offering a voluntary exit program that includes a cash payment. CEO Brian Niccol stated the decision is crucial for the company's turnaround strategy, which focuses on improving sales and the customer experience. This move follows previous efforts to enforce a three-day office week and corporate job cuts, reflecting a broader trend of companies tightening in-person work mandates.</p>

          <h2>Examining the "Age 75 Rule" for Purchasing Annuities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 14:20:51 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the "age 75 rule," a common belief suggesting that retirees should wait until age 75 to buy an annuity to secure higher payouts. While payouts do increase with age because of shorter life expectancy calculations, the rule oversimplifies retirement planning. Waiting until 75 could mean depleting other assets, missing years of guaranteed income, or facing higher costs due to potential health changes. The best time to purchase an annuity depends on individual circumstances, including income needs, risk tolerance, and overall financial goals, rather than an arbitrary age.

          <p>As the academic year approaches, this article provides guidance on navigating the choice between federal and private student loans. It advises students to first exhaust all federal loan options, as they offer fixed interest rates and crucial borrower protections like income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs. However, federal loans have strict borrowing limits. Private loans can fill the funding gap but often lack the same flexibility and may require a co-signer or strong credit history for favorable rates. The recommended strategy is to use federal loans as a foundation and only use private loans to cover remaining costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two recent federal court rulings on whether training AI models with copyrighted books constitutes "fair use" have provided conflicting and nuanced answers, highlighting the legal system's struggle with the issue. In cases against Anthropic and Meta, judges found the training process itself was "transformative" and thus fair use. However, one judge ruled Anthropic's retention of a "pirate library" was not fair use, while the other expressed deep concern about AI's potential to damage the market for authors. The article suggests these initial, differing opinions show that the monumental question of AI and copyright is far from resolved.</p>
