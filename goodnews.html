          <p>Nicusor Dan, a centrist mayor and former mathematics professor, won the presidential election in Romania, defeating George Simion, a nationalist aligned with President Trump. With nearly all ballots counted, Dan secured 54% of the vote, calming fears that Romania might align with Hungary and Slovakia in opposing aid to Ukraine. Simion, who drew 46%, claimed electoral fraud and called for protests, echoing Trump's "stop the steal" efforts. Dan campaigned as a moderate conservative committed to the European Union and NATO, appealing to voters seeking a middle path between polarized political camps.</p>

          <p>A TSMC factory in Arizona, producing advanced semiconductors, embodies the tension in Trump's 'America First' plan. The factory, making 90% of the world's advanced semiconductors, aims to head off tariffs on imported chips. Trump hails it as proof his tariff policy works, yet the factory relies on global technologies. The facility is closely guarded, protecting intellectual property and complex manufacturing secrets, and it signifies the interplay of global economy, technology, and geopolitics, challenging the idea of complete self-reliance.</p>
