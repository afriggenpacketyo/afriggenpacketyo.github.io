          <p>Japanese farmers and chefs are popularizing the prickly pear cactus, incorporating it into dishes like tempura and quiche. This "superfood," known for its rich nutritional content, is gaining national attention, supported by university research indicating its immune-boosting properties. As the United Nations has highlighted its potential for food security amid climate change, this resilient and versatile plant is expanding its presence in Japanese markets and cuisine, moving from an ornamental plant to a staple vegetable.</p>

          <p>The New York Islanders have chosen 17-year-old defenseman Matthew Schaefer as the number one overall pick in the 2025 NHL draft. Schaefer, who played for the Erie Otters in the OHL, is the first defenseman selected first overall since 2021. His selection comes after a season shortened by a collarbone injury and personal tragedy, including the recent loss of his mother to cancer. Overcome with emotion, Schaefer kissed a breast cancer awareness patch on his new jersey after being selected.</p>

However, the event also sparked protests from local residents under the "No Space for Bezos" campaign, who raised concerns about over-tourism and its impact on the city.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses called bacteriophages to kill harmful bacteria. With antibiotic resistance becoming a "silent pandemic," scientists see potential in these highly specific viruses to treat infections, including superbugs. A BBC correspondent participated in a project, successfully finding a phage in his toilet that killed a patient's persistent urinary tract infection in a lab setting. While regulatory pathways are still being developed, phage therapy is gaining traction as a vital alternative to failing antibiotics.</p>

          <p>Molly Schafer, an 18-year-old high school senior in Wisconsin, used her artistic talent to bridge the social gap she felt with her peers. After experiencing social anxiety, she spent over 600 hours painting detailed portraits of 44 of her classmates whom she had grown distant from. She then gifted the paintings to each student, an act that was met with amazement and some regret from classmates who wished they had reached out sooner. Schafer's project served as a powerful reminder about the importance of making an effort to connect with others.</p>

          <p>The 1975 returned to the stage after a long hiatus to headline Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, delivering a slick and professional set filled with their greatest hits. Frontman Matty Healy, known for his unpredictable stage presence, offered a more subdued performance, largely avoiding his past on-stage antics and political commentary. While the band was musically tight and the crowd was enthusiastic, some critics noted the performance felt safe and lacked the raw energy of their past shows. The set was part of a day that also featured a surprise, emotional comeback performance from Lewis Capaldi.</p>

Hazlewood was instrumental, taking five wickets for 43 runs to dismantle the West Indies' top order.

          <p>The California legislature has approved a measure to increase the annual tax incentives for film and television production from $330 million to $750 million. This significant boost, advocated by Governor Gavin Newsom, aims to reverse the trend of productions leaving California for other locations with more generous financial incentives. The state has lost thousands of entertainment industry jobs in recent years, and Hollywood unions have praised the move as a crucial step to bring production back home. The measure is part of a broader effort to ensure California remains the center of the entertainment world.</p>

However, Cramer emphasized his faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and pointed to Apple's history of rebounding from tough periods, suggesting past downturns have proven to be excellent buying opportunities.

The planes, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be conducting atmospheric research as part of the Student Airborne Research Program. Flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet, the aircraft will perform maneuvers like vertical spirals over urban areas, power plants, and landfills to sample gasses and measure surfaces.

The S&P 500 has soared more than 20% since a low in April, reflecting renewed market confidence.
