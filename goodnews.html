          <p>NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy asserted that the United States is committed to winning the "second space race" against China, aiming for a lunar return before President Trump concludes his term. Duffy highlighted the Artemis program as pivotal for both Moon missions and future expeditions to Mars, underscoring its importance for U.S. space dominance. This marks a notable shift in rhetoric, as Duffy is the first NASA chief to openly acknowledge the competitive dynamic with China in space exploration. Despite recent proposals for budget cuts to the agency, sources indicate that the Artemis program remains a major priority, reflecting a strong national ambition for leadership beyond Earth.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Taylor Swift and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce officially announced their engagement, generating immense public excitement and setting new Instagram records. Kelce's proposal occurred at his Missouri residence, featuring an elaborate "enchanted garden" floral display, reportedly costing around $40,000. Swift's unique engagement ring, a custom old mine brilliant cut in a yellow gold bezel setting, was crafted by goldsmith Kindred Lubeck. The couple's romance blossomed after Kelce's memorable attempt to give Swift a friendship bracelet with his number, a story Swift later shared on his "New Heights" podcast, attributing the show to finding her boyfriend.</p>

          <p>A European Court of Justice Advocate General has advised that Bulgaria should not be permitted to refuse identity documents that align with a transgender woman's lived gender identity, even in the absence of gender reassignment surgery. This non-binding legal opinion, which often foreshadows the court's final decision, posits that such refusal violates the individual's right to an identity card and their freedom of movement and residency within the EU. The Advocate General argued that national legislation requiring sex indication based solely on a birth certificate, without allowing for legal recognition of lived gender identity, constitutes a restriction on fundamental rights. This guidance emphasizes the necessity for member states to respect private life and ensure legal recognition for transgender individuals.</p>

The article also highlights the critical role of witnesses, whose accounts can be invaluable for understanding the incident, especially when involved parties have no clear recollection.

          <p>Atlassian has announced its agreement to acquire The Browser Co., a startup renowned for its web browsers featuring artificial intelligence capabilities, for $610 million in cash. This strategic acquisition, expected to close in Atlassian's fiscal second quarter, aims to revolutionize the browser experience for professional users. Atlassian co-founder Mike Cannon-Brookes expressed that current popular browsers are not adequately serving complex work tasks, envisioning an integration of Arc's specialized features and Dia's AI elegance with Atlassian's enterprise expertise. This move underscores a growing industry trend towards embedding advanced AI functionalities directly into tools designed to optimize digital workflows and enhance productivity for power users.</p>

          <p>Broadcom is expected to deliver strong earnings, propelled by the booming demand for artificial intelligence chips and hardware, contrasting with a recent disappointing outlook from a chief rival. Hyperscale cloud providers, including Amazon and Microsoft, are significantly increasing capital expenditures, indicating a sustained "AI arms race." Broadcom, a critical supplier of custom AI chips (ASICs) and networking components, is strategically positioned to capitalize on this growth, with its CEO forecasting robust AI revenue expansion into fiscal 2026. Analysts maintain a positive outlook, suggesting that any stock dip represents a buying opportunity given the company's leadership in the AI semiconductor sector, beyond just GPUs.

          <p>The National Football League has cemented its status as the world's most valuable and profitable sports league, with the average franchise now commanding $7.65 billion, an 18% increase year-over-year. The Dallas Cowboys lead this financial dominance with a record $12.5 billion valuation, driven by unparalleled revenue and sponsorship earnings. The league's robust financial health stems from its immense popularity, evidenced by NFL games accounting for 72 of the top 100 U.S. telecasts in 2024, and lucrative media rights deals totaling $12.4 billion annually. Growing interest from private equity firms in minority stakes has further bolstered valuations, setting a new floor for team prices across the league.</p>

          <p>India and Canada have appointed new envoys, marking a substantial step toward normalizing their diplomatic relations, which were severely strained by allegations of Indian agents' involvement in the assassination of Sikh leader Hardeep Singh Nijjar. Following a fractious period, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney met at the G7 summit, agreeing to pursue "calibrated and constructive steps" to stabilize the relationship. Foreign policy experts believe this renewed high-level dialogue is crucial for resuming trade talks and fostering strategic alignment, particularly as both nations seek to diversify away from reliance on the United States amid its increasingly volatile policies. This signals cautious optimism for future bilateral engagement.</p>

          <p>Despite predictions of their demise in the social media era, high-school reunions continue to be a "bizarrely unkillable institution" in American public life. This article explores their enduring cultural significance, suggesting they function as "autobiographical occasions" where individuals reconcile their present selves with past identities. The author reflects on personal experiences, noting that the pandemic has reignited appreciation for face-to-face interaction, which social media often fails to replicate for long-lost acquaintances. Reunions provide a rare opportunity, typically once a decade, to gauge personal growth, reconnect with old classmates, and deepen lifelong friendships, offering a unique perspective on how far one has come.</p>

Goldman Sachs plans to acquire up to 3.5% of T. Rowe Price's common stock through open-market purchases. This collaboration is seen as a crucial move to invigorate T. Rowe Price, which has faced challenges from significant client withdrawals and underperformance, partly due to its historical reliance on active management and slow embrace of ETFs. The deal also capitalizes on a new executive order from President Trump, aiming to broaden access for investors to alternative assets within 401(k) plans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese investment in Brazil surged by 113% in 2024, reaching US$4.18 billion across 39 confirmed projects, marking its highest level since before the pandemic. This increase positions Brazil as the third-main global destination for Chinese capital, and the leading destination among emerging economies. The report by the Brazil-China Business Council indicates a strategic shift towards smaller projects, particularly those linked to Brazil's industrial policy and the global energy transition, moving away from previous mega-acquisitions. Brazil's appeal lies in its complex and diverse economy, offering opportunities across sectors like industry, natural resources, and electricity, making it a standout for international investment.</p>
