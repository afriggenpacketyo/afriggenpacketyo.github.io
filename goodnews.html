          <p>Oracle's stock price increased by 27% in after-hours trading, driven by strong future guidance for its cloud infrastructure business, which is benefiting from the AI boom. This investor optimism overshadowed the company's reported earnings and revenue for the quarter, which slightly missed analyst expectations. Oracle announced several multi-billion dollar cloud contracts and projected its cloud infrastructure revenue to grow exponentially, reaching $144 billion by fiscal year 2030.

          <p>Key inflation reports, including the Consumer Price Index (CPI), are anticipated to reveal a rise in prices for August, potentially pushing the annual inflation rate to 2.9%. Economists suggest this increase is largely driven by tariff-sensitive goods rather than broader service sector inflation, which is a key area of focus for the Federal Reserve. Despite the expected uptick in headline inflation, analysts believe the underlying trends will not deter the Fed from implementing an interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting.

          <p>Cracker Barrel has suspended its plans to remodel its restaurant interiors, just weeks after reversing a controversial logo change that sparked a significant public backlash. The company had attempted to modernize its image with a minimalist logo and contemporary designs but faced intense criticism from customers and conservative figures who accused it of going "woke." In a statement, the chain acknowledged customer feedback, promising that its "vintage Americana" aesthetic, including rocking chairs and fireplaces, is "Here to Stay."</p>

          <p>Following Angela Rayner's resignation, six Labour MPs have entered the race to become the party's next deputy leader, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson currently leading in securing support from fellow parliamentarians. The candidates, who must gain the backing of 80 MPs, represent different wings of the party, from government loyalists to more critical backbenchers like Bell Ribeiro-Addy. The contest's outcome is seen as significant for Labour's future direction, particularly regarding its positions on welfare, the Gaza conflict, and wealth taxes.</p>

          <p>Following an increased takeover offer for MEG Energy from Strathcona Resources, an institutional shareholder who owns stock in all three companies believes Cenovus Energy is unlikely to sweeten its own bid. Strathcona's new offer values MEG at over $30 per share, a threshold the shareholder feels Cenovus will be reluctant to cross due to the risk of diluting its stock. The situation creates a high-stakes bidding war for MEG, which is considered a prime asset for expansion in Canada's oilsands. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recent analysis by the Tax Foundation indicates that a new tax law signed by President Trump will provide significant tax cuts, though the benefits will vary considerably by state. Residents of high-income states like Wyoming are projected to see the largest average cuts, while those in lower-income states such as Mississippi and West Virginia will see the smallest. The law's structure, which includes a higher cap on state and local tax deductions and larger cuts for high earners, is the primary reason for this geographic disparity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement in Cairo to resume cooperation, potentially relaunching inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. This development follows a period of suspended cooperation after Iran's parliament passed a law halting inspections in response to Israeli and U.S. airstrikes on its nuclear sites in June. The agreement, backed by Egypt, comes at a critical time as European powers are moving to reimpose sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>A sports analysis suggests that Manchester City striker Erling Haaland's phenomenal goalscoring record is due more to his exceptional ability to create high-quality chances than to his finishing skills alone. While his finishing is above average, data shows that his physical attributes—strength, speed, and height—combined with his intelligent movement and anticipation allow him to get into scoring positions far more effectively than other elite strikers. This ability to consistently generate superior opportunities is identified as the primary driver of his record-breaking goal tallies.</p>
