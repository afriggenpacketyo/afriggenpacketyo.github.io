          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has launched a federal effort to identify environmental toxins as the cause of rising autism rates, but many scientists argue that genetic research is more promising. They believe that the increase in autism diagnoses is primarily due to expanding definitions, increased awareness, and improved screening. Scientists have identified hundreds of genes associated with autism, supporting the theory that genetics play a significant role. Researchers fear that Kennedy's focus on environmental toxins could distract from genetic research, which has led to the development of new therapies for those with autism.</p>

          <p>A psychiatrist with extensive experience working with young adults shares five straightforward rules for effective parenting in an age of overwhelming and contradictory advice. These rules include trusting parental instincts, following cultural traditions, focusing on the child's individual interests, prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones, and being authentic rather than striving for perfection.

Norris, despite a strong initial run, made errors on his final lap, allowing Piastri to clinch the pole.
