          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order aimed at reducing national security and public safety threats posed by drones in the United States. The order establishes a task force to improve drone detection and crack down on unlawful uses, such as spying and drug smuggling, with a focus on the upcoming FIFA World Cup in 2026 and the Los Angeles Olympics in 2028. The executive order also seeks to boost U.S. development of drones and commercial use of the technology. The order also included measures to encourage the development of supersonic jets and electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft.</p>
