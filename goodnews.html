          <p>President Trump traveled to The Hague for a NATO summit shortly after authorizing strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and declaring a ceasefire in the Israel-Iran conflict. Trump questioned NATO's core principle of collective defense, refusing to automatically commit to Article 5, while affirming his commitment to allied nations. Iran carried out retaliatory strikes at a U.S. base in Qatar before the ceasefire, but Trump reported no American casualties. Trump seeks increased defense spending from NATO members, pushing for a rise to 5% of GDP, and aims to revitalize industrial capacities for critical minerals and weapons. The summit occurs against the backdrop of the ongoing war in Ukraine, with Trump criticizing the conflict and NATO expansion.</p>

          <p>The Senate is reviewing a version of Trump's budget bill that proposes raising the debt ceiling by $5 trillion to keep the government funded and avoid a potential shutdown. Without action, the U.S. could face a borrowing crisis as early as August, impacting Social Security, veterans' benefits, and tax refunds. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has cautioned that rising deficits could unsettle investors, potentially leading to higher Treasury yields and increased interest rates for consumers. The 10-year Treasury yield remains relatively stable, suggesting that markets are not yet signaling major concerns about the debt level (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A public service announcement from 2008 featuring Hilary Duff discouraging the use of "gay" as an insult has become a cultural touchstone for a generation. The "Think B4 You Speak" campaign by GLSEN aimed to combat anti-LGBTQ+ language during a time when social media was still emerging. Kevin Jennings, the founder of GLSEN, noted the campaign's success in shaping public discourse and reducing the use of the phrase "that's so gay."

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after President Trump announced that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran, signaling a potential easing of U.S. pressure on the country following a ceasefire with Israel. Global benchmark Brent crude fell by 4.66%, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 4.64%. Trump had previously threatened sanctions against any country buying Iranian oil, but China remains the primary purchaser of Iran's oil exports. The market's perception of reduced risk of supply disruptions in the Middle East contributed to the price drop, reversing gains made after the initial strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.</p>

The movie, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, features mutated zombies, odd characters, and a dense plot. The film uses a digital aesthetic, shot mostly on iPhones, to create a disorienting experience. The reviewer notes that the film manages to hold together its freewheeling plot through the main character's desire to save his mother.</p>
