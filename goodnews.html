          <h2>Report Explores Why Trump's Tariffs Have Not Yet Caused Significant Inflation</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 10:11:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite initial fears, President Trump's tariffs have not led to a major spike in U.S. consumer prices, with key inflation gauges remaining relatively stable. Economists attribute this to several factors, including companies pre-ordering inventory to avoid duties, absorbing some costs to protect consumers, and using legal loopholes like bonded warehouses to delay payments. However, experts caution that this stability may be temporary, as these buffering strategies are not sustainable long-term. They anticipate that the impact of the tariffs will likely become more apparent in consumer prices later this year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Business professor and CEO Suzy Welch suggests that job candidates ask a specific question to uncover a company's true values: 'What kind of person should not work at this company?' This question often catches managers off guard, leading to more honest and less rehearsed answers that reveal the real work culture, beyond corporate platitudes. Examples of revealing responses include 'a person who doesn't want to text on weekends' or 'someone who's too social.' Welch advises asking this question at the end of the interview process to gauge alignment between personal values and the company's actual operational environment.</p>

        </div>

          <p>Brittany Newell's new novel, 'Soft Core,' delves into the world of a San Francisco sex worker named Ruth, who navigates her life as a stripper and dominatrix while grappling with existential fears and the mysterious disappearance of her ex-boyfriend. The article reviews the book as a significant entry in the 'sex-workplace novel' genre, praising its sensory details and psychological depth. It explores how the protagonist's professional life, which involves constant role-playing, blurs the lines between her various personas and her true self. The review highlights the novel's focus on the emotional and psychological complexities of the industry, rather than just titillation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the third quarter in a row, public companies have acquired more bitcoin than exchange-traded funds (ETFs), signaling a growing corporate trend to hold the cryptocurrency as a treasury asset. In the second quarter, public firms added approximately 131,000 BTC, an 18% increase, compared to the 111,000 BTC added by ETFs. This trend is attributed to companies emulating the strategy of firms like MicroStrategy to increase shareholder value, a movement bolstered by a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under the Trump administration. Despite this trend, ETFs still hold a larger overall amount of bitcoin. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Euro 2025 women's football tournament beginning in Switzerland, organizers, teams, and fans are bracing for a severe heatwave.

To cope, giant fans have been placed pitch-side to cool the turf, and supporters have been advised to stay hydrated and seek shade.

          <p>This article examines the career of Claire McCardell, a revolutionary American fashion designer from the 1940s and 50s who prioritized comfort and practicality for women. McCardell is credited with popularizing innovations like functional pockets, side-fasteners, ballet flats, and the use of denim in womenswear, effectively creating the 'American Look' of casual sportswear. Despite her immense influence and being a household name in her time, she is now largely forgotten by the general public. The piece explores her pragmatic design philosophy and questions why her legacy, unlike that of contemporaries like Christian Dior, has faded from popular memory.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Marks & Spencer, Stuart Machin, announced that the retailer's online shopping services should be fully operational within four weeks following a major cyber attack in April. The attack disrupted M&S systems for six weeks, forcing a partial shutdown of its website and costing the company an estimated ¬£300 million in profits. While online orders have resumed in most of the UK, services like click-and-collect remain unavailable. The company's next focus will be restoring full operations at its main Castle Donington distribution center, with hopes of resolving the majority of issues by August.</p>

The club is trimming the position to avoid 'getting too greedy' and to raise cash while the market is in an overbought condition, according to its internal indicators.

          <p>The number of babies born to fathers aged 60 and over in England and Wales rose by 14.2% in 2024 compared to the previous year, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). While the total number of births in England saw a slight increase for the first time since 2021, the trend of having children later in life continues, with births to parents under 30 decreasing. Experts find the rise in older fathers notable, given that male fertility typically declines with age. The data also reflects societal trends, including the rising cost of living, which is often cited as a reason for delaying parenthood.</p>
