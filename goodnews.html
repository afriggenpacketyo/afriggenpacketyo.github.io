          <p>The Supreme Court has deferred a decision on President Trump's request to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook from her post, allowing her to remain in the role pending oral arguments scheduled for January. Trump has sought to fire Cook over allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies, in a case seen as a test of the Federal Reserve's political independence. The ruling ensures Cook will participate in upcoming Federal Open Market Committee meetings, potentially influencing decisions on interest rate cuts through the end of the year.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>General Motors and Ford both reported an approximate 8% increase in their third-quarter U.S. auto sales, largely driven by record demand for electric vehicles. The surge in EV sales, which more than doubled for GM, was partly attributed to consumers purchasing vehicles before the expiration of a $7,500 federal tax incentive in September. Industry analysts expect overall EV sales to hit a record high for the quarter, though some auto executives anticipate a potential slowdown now that the federal incentive program has concluded.

The project aims for historical accuracy, using traditional tools and methods from the era to reconstruct the 90-foot vessel believed to be the tomb of King Raedwald. Lacking original plans, the shipwrights are relying on the archaeological imprint of the ship, hand-selecting specific trees and crafting each component to revive a piece of ancient maritime history.</p>

          <p>The Taliban government has restored internet and communication services across Afghanistan following a 48-hour nationwide shutdown that drew widespread international condemnation. The blackout severely disrupted daily life, impacting businesses, emergency services, and flights, while further isolating a population already facing significant restrictions. For many Afghans, especially women and girls barred from education, the internet serves as a crucial link to the outside world, and its return was met with widespread relief in cities like Kabul.</p>

          <h2>All GP Practices in England Now Required to Offer Online Appointment Booking</h2>

          <p>As of today, every general practitioner's practice in England must provide patients with the ability to book appointments online throughout the workday, from 8:00 AM to 6:30 PM. The government-mandated change aims to end the "8am scramble" where patients compete to get through on busy phone lines for a limited number of slots. While ministers believe the move will modernize the NHS and improve access, the British Medical Association has raised concerns about a potential "online triage tsunami" overwhelming already-strained practices.</p>

          <p>Pfizer has agreed to provide significant discounts on some of its prescription drugs for American consumers and to lower prices for Medicaid, President Trump announced. The move was prompted by the president's threat of 100% tariffs on drugs manufactured abroad, with the discounted medications to be sold through a new government-operated website called "TrumpRx." As part of the deal, Pfizer also committed to moving production of medicines for the U.S. market to domestic facilities, which would exempt them from the proposed tariffs.</p>

Berkshire Hathaway already holds a significant 28.2% stake in Occidental Petroleum, an investment Buffett began accumulating in 2022 after being impressed by the oil company's leadership and strategy.

          <p>President Trump has signed an executive order stating that any armed attack on Qatar will be considered a threat to the security of the United States, warranting a potential U.S. response. The order follows a recent Israeli airstrike on Doha, which Israel claimed was targeting Hamas leaders, and for which Prime Minister Netanyahu later expressed regret. The move formalizes a strong security guarantee for Qatar, a major non-NATO ally that hosts the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, solidifying the strategic partnership between the two nations.</p>

Proponents believe that cryptocurrencies pegged to the U.S. dollar offer the potential for faster, cheaper, and more efficient transactions, which could disrupt the traditional payment systems dominated by credit and debit cards.
