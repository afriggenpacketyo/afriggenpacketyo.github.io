          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook is set to join President Donald Trump at the White House to announce a significant increase in the company's U.S. investment commitment, raising it from $500 billion to $600 billion over the next four years. This expanded pledge also includes the establishment of a new American Manufacturing Program. The announcement comes as Apple seeks to navigate potential tariffs threatened by the Trump administration, which could significantly raise the cost of its complex international supply chain, particularly regarding iPhone production. The tech giant's increased domestic investment aims to bring more of its supply chain and advanced manufacturing back to the United States, a move celebrated by the White House as a win for national security.</p>

          <p>Candy manufacturer Mars has partnered with biotech company Pairwise to accelerate the development of more resilient and sustainable cocoa using CRISPR-based gene editing technology. This agreement grants Mars access to Pairwise's Fulcrum platform, which includes a library of plant traits, enabling the company to tailor cacao plants for improved resistance to diseases, heat, and other climate-related stresses. The primary goal is to safeguard the global chocolate supply, which is increasingly at risk from environmental factors. This collaboration reflects a broader trend in agriculture where gene editing offers faster and more precise trait development than traditional breeding methods, promising enhanced crop stability and food security for the future.</p>

          <p>Human foot remains, discovered inside a hiking shoe on the shores of Fish Lake in Utah this May, have been identified as belonging to David White, a man missing since September 1997. Investigators linked the unique 1996-model hiking boot to White's cold case disappearance, which occurred when his boat was found adrift on the lake after he went fishing. Despite extensive searches at the time, no further evidence was found until now. DNA testing confirmed the parental match with 99.9994% certainty, bringing long-awaited closure to his family and the search and rescue team involved for nearly three decades. The discovery provides a definitive answer to a long-standing mystery.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The murder of Minnesota nurse Alexandra Pennig, initially reported as a suicide, was ultimately solved by a crucial piece of forensic evidence: a small metal ring from a bathroom door lock found beneath her body. Matthew Ecker, who was with Pennig at the time, claimed she locked herself in the bathroom and shot herself, after which he broke down the door. However, detectives noted a dry sink, contradicting his claim of washing his hands, and the location of the lock piece suggested the door was forced open *before* the shooting, with Pennig falling on it. This pivotal discovery proved Ecker had lied, leading to his conviction for second-degree murder and a 30-year sentence.</p>

          <p>ESPN has signed a five-year deal worth an average of $325 million annually for the U.S. rights to WWE's major live premium events, including WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, beginning in 2026. All 10 annual premium live events will stream on ESPN's new $29.99 per month direct-to-consumer platform, with select events also simulcast on ESPN's linear networks. This significant agreement, which surpasses NBCUniversal's previous deal, aims to strategically broaden WWE's audience and leverage its younger, more diverse, and female viewership. ESPN Chairman Jimmy Pitaro views this as a fantastic way to expand their audience, reinforcing ESPN's role as an entertainment and sports programming network.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs recently made their public debut at Dvůr Králové Safari Park in the Czech Republic, marking a significant step in a conservation program aimed at reintroducing the breed to its native northern Africa. The three females and one male, born in January, are part of an international effort to boost genetic diversity, with cubs eventually sent to other participating zoos. While a full reintroduction into the Atlas Mountains is a "far distant future," preliminary talks with Moroccan authorities are underway for a conference to assess its feasibility. Fewer than 200 Barbary lions, extinct in the wild since the 1960s, currently live in captivity.</p>

          <p>In a surprising move, German football icon Thomas Müller has signed with Major League Soccer's Vancouver Whitecaps, opting for Canada's Pacific west coast instead of a widely anticipated move to Los Angeles. Whitecaps CEO Axel Schuster hailed the soon-to-be 36-year-old as a "world-class player" and a "transformative moment" for the club, praising his elite chance creation and spatial awareness. Müller, known as the "Raumdeuter" and "Radio Müller" for his on-field intelligence and vocal leadership, is expected to bring invaluable experience and a winning mentality to the youthful squad. Despite concerns about his age and the high-octane MLS style, his footballing IQ is seen as a perfect fit to elevate the team, aiming to push the Whitecaps towards the playoffs and potentially their first North American championship since 1979.</p>

Melo wrote many songs on guitar, resulting in more direct lyrics that often address relationships affected by drinking and drugs. Now sober for 10 months, Melo aims to communicate her truth with the "largest bandwidth," contributing to rock's resurgence, inspired partly by artists like Olivia Rodrigo.</p>

Revenue grew 31% year-over-year to $2.68 billion, surpassing analyst projections, and third-quarter revenue is expected to grow at a "mid-to-high twenties percentage rate." CFO Jeff Hoffmeister noted that anticipated impacts from tariffs "did not materialize," indicating the company is navigating President Trump's trade policies better than feared. Shopify's gross merchandise sales also significantly exceeded expectations, and executives reported no slowdown in U.S. demand.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article compares annuities and Certificates of Deposit (CDs) as low-risk options for retirement planning, emphasizing that neither is universally "better" but rather suited to different needs. CDs offer simplicity, predictability, and FDIC insurance, ideal for short-term goals or as a conservative portfolio anchor, though their returns often struggle against inflation and they don't provide lifetime income. Annuities, conversely, are specifically designed for retirement income, offering guaranteed lifetime payments and addressing longevity risk, but they are more complex with varying fees and limited liquidity. The choice depends on individual priorities, such as maximizing safety and flexibility with CDs versus prioritizing guaranteed lifetime income with annuities, with many retirees finding a combination of both offers the best approach.</p>
