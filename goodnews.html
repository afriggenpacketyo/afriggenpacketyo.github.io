          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington's demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi presented the idea to American special envoy Steve Witkoff in Oman. The proposal involves Iran enriching uranium to a low grade and shipping it to other Arab countries for civilian use, with oversight from international representatives. The joint venture plan would be permanent, unlike the 2015 nuclear deal.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) reversed the firings of over 100 federal employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), which protects coal miners from black lung. The decision came after public pressure and an ABC News report detailing the impact of the firings on black lung health care programs. A federal judge also ordered HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to halt the dismissals. The restored employees oversee the black lung surveillance program and a waiver called Part 90, which allows miners with early-stage black lung disease to transfer to safer roles.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced that the U.S. would lift sanctions on Syria during a state visit to Saudi Arabia, citing the country's new government and its potential for stability. The decision marks a significant shift in policy, breaking the economic stranglehold on Syria. Trump said he made the decision after speaking with Turkey's president and Saudi Arabia's crown prince, and as he tries to drum up Saudi investment in the United States. The announcement was met with celebrations in Syria.</p>
