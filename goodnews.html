          <p>President Trump visited the Kennedy Center to announce the 2025 honorees, which include country star George Strait, actor Sylvester Stallone, singer Gloria Gaynor, actor Michael Crawford, and the rock band KISS. The announcement follows a period of significant change at the cultural institution, where the president has become board chairman and installed allies in key positions. Trump stated that the center was previously in decline and that his leadership is reversing this trend through renovations and a renewed focus. He will host the 48th annual Honors gala, which is set to be televised on CBS.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new forecast from the Senior Citizens League predicts that Social Security beneficiaries could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, a slight increase from the previous year's 2.5% boost. The Social Security Administration determines the annual adjustment based on inflation data from the third quarter, with the official announcement expected in October. While inflation has remained relatively stable, some economists express concern that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to factors like tariffs.

          <p>The grocery chain Wegmans has recalled its brand of medium camembert cheese and several prepared products containing it due to potential contamination with Listeria monocytogenes. The recall, announced via the FDA, affects items sold between July 1 and August 12 across nine states and Washington, D.C. The specific products include the cheese itself, an assorted cheese flight, a grilling camembert kit, and a caramel apple pecan topped brie. While no illnesses have been reported, consumers are urged to return the products for a full refund.</p>

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their A-level, T-level, and BTec results, with top grade distribution expected to be similar to last year. This cohort's results are notable as they sat GCSE exams when grading was being brought back to pre-pandemic standards, resulting in lower overall grades than previous years. The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, predicts a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university, partly due to uncertainty around international student numbers, making domestic students more attractive to institutions.</p>

Lammy attributed the mistake to an "administrative error" and has since purchased a licence and notified the Environment Agency. Anglers over 13 in England and Wales must have a licence for freshwater fishing or face fines up to £2,500. The fishing trip, during which Lammy caught no fish, preceded formal talks between the two officials on international affairs.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is evaluating a list of 11 potential nominees to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair, according to administration sources. The list includes previously unmentioned names like Jefferies' David Zervos, BlackRock's Rick Rieder, and former Fed Governor Larry Lindsey, alongside known candidates like Chris Waller and Kevin Warsh. The process is described as deliberative, with Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent set to interview all candidates before presenting a shorter list to the president. This extensive process suggests a final decision is not imminent. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon's recent expansion of same-day fresh grocery delivery is causing ripples in the stock market, with shares of competitors like Kroger and Albertsons declining. In his analysis, Jim Cramer noted the incredible value proposition of Amazon's Prime membership, which now includes this enhanced service. However, he argued that warehouse club Costco should not be significantly impacted, as its business model is fundamentally different, focusing on in-person volume and price rather than direct competition on delivery. The move highlights the escalating rivalry between Amazon and other major retailers in the grocery sector. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article explores how much of a retirement portfolio one should consider investing in an annuity, particularly given the current economic environment of elevated interest rates and potential future rate cuts. Experts suggest an allocation of 20% to 50%, depending on individual factors like age, risk tolerance, health, and existing guaranteed income sources like Social Security. The primary goal is to create a secure income floor to cover essential expenses. With interest rates potentially declining, now may be an opportune time to lock in higher payouts offered by current annuity contracts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWS NET), a critical U.S.-funded program that predicts and helps prevent global food crises, is coming back online after being abruptly shut down by the Trump administration in January. For decades, aid organizations have relied on the system's data to preemptively position food aid and avert starvation, as it successfully did in Ethiopia in 2016. The shutdown created a dangerous information gap for humanitarian decision-makers. While its revival is seen as a positive step, experts remain concerned about the impact of the shutdown and the future scope of the program.</p>
