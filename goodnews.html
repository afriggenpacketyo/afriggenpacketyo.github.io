          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third quarter, with profits surging 39.1% year-over-year, significantly exceeding market expectations. This remarkable growth is attributed to the sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from major clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI applications, accounted for 57% of its revenue. Advanced chips, those 7-nanometer or smaller, constituted 74% of total wafer revenue, underscoring the industry's shift towards more powerful and efficient processors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured him that India will cease purchasing oil from Russia, although a specific timeline for this action remains unclear. Trump stated this move is crucial for pressuring Moscow over its war in Ukraine, adding that the halt would involve "a little bit of a process." In response, India's external affairs ministry emphasized that its import decisions are guided by consumer interests and energy security. India is currently one of the largest buyers of Russian crude oil, a significant point of contention in its relationship with the United States.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Lakers guard Gabe Vincent delivered an impressive offensive performance during a preseason game against the Dallas Mavericks, despite the team's 121-94 loss.

He finished the game with 22 points, showcasing his potential as a key shooter for the upcoming season.

          <p>The People's Bank of China (PBOC) has set the yuan's daily midpoint reference rate against the U.S. dollar at its highest point in a year. This move comes amid growing market expectations that the U.S. Federal Reserve will implement further interest rate cuts this year. A Fed governor recently noted that ongoing U.S.-China trade tensions have increased risks to the U.S. economy, strengthening the case for rate reductions. The stronger fixing reflects a strategic maneuver by the PBOC to manage its currency's value in a volatile global economic environment influenced by American monetary policy.

          <p>South Korea's Kospi index surged to a new record high, driven by a combination of positive economic news. The rally was fueled by the International Monetary Fund upgrading the country's 2025 growth forecast and comments from the U.S. Treasury Secretary suggesting that a trade deal between the two nations was nearing completion. Major companies like Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor saw significant share price increases, leading the gains. This optimism in the South Korean market provides a bright spot amid broader global economic uncertainty and escalating trade tensions elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani is actively working to break out of a significant postseason slump, taking the unusual step of participating in on-field batting practice during a workout day. Ohtani has struggled at the plate since the start of the playoffs, with just two hits in 25 at-bats and 12 strikeouts. Manager Dave Roberts has emphasized the team's need for Ohtani's bat to succeed. The article also explores whether Ohtani's return to pitching this season has contributed to his offensive struggles, a notion he himself downplayed while acknowledging the physical demands of his two-way role.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from terminating federal workers amid the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by two unions after more than 4,000 employees received reduction-in-force notifications. The judge called the firings "unprecedented" and cited President Trump's own social media posts suggesting the layoffs were intended to punish political opponents by targeting "Democrat Agencies." The order provides temporary relief for thousands of workers and sets up a further legal battle over the administration's actions during the funding lapse.</p>

          <p>A long-lost diary written by Chinese naval officer Lam Ping-yu has shed new light on the role of Chinese personnel in the D-Day invasion of Normandy in 1944. Rescued from a Hong Kong building slated for demolition, the diary provides a detailed firsthand account of the landings from aboard the British battleship HMS Ramillies. Lam was one of over two dozen Chinese officers sent to train and serve with Allied forces in Europe. Historical researchers have since confirmed that at least 14 Chinese officers participated in the naval operations, adding a previously little-known international dimension to the historic liberation of France.</p>
