While acknowledging a "deferral mindset" among homeowners due to economic uncertainty, executives noted positive signs, including a 2.6% rise in transactions over $1,000 and improving sales trends throughout the quarter.

          <p>Kentucky has issued an emergency ban on bromazolam, an unregulated synthetic drug known as "designer Xanax," following its connection to nearly 50 overdose deaths in the state last year. Governor Andy Beshear's action classifies the substance as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, enabling law enforcement to pursue charges for its sale or possession. The move is part of a wider effort by 21 state attorneys general urging the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to implement a federal ban on the dangerous drug.</p>

These initiatives aim to create "sanctuaries" and offer mutual aid to those affected, including street vendors who have lost business due to fear of federal agents in their neighborhoods.</p>

          <p>During his meeting at the White House, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy presented a letter to President Trump from Ukraine's First Lady, Olena Zelenska, addressed to Melania Trump. The letter was a gesture of gratitude for Melania Trump's efforts to raise awareness about the thousands of Ukrainian children who have been abducted by Russia during the war. This diplomatic exchange highlights the humanitarian focus on returning the approximately 19,500 children, an issue Melania Trump had previously addressed in her own letter to Vladimir Putin.</p>

          <p>Air Canada and the union representing its 10,000 flight attendants have reached a tentative agreement, ending a nearly four-day strike that caused widespread flight cancellations and stranded thousands of passengers. The airline plans to gradually restart operations, though it may take up to a week to return to a full schedule. The breakthrough in negotiations occurred after the union defied a government back-to-work order, with the new deal reportedly addressing key issues like compensation for unpaid work time spent on the ground.</p>
