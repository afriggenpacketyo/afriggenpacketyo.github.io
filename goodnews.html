          <p>Palo Alto Networks CEO Nikesh Arora has raised concerns about the adoption of agentic artificial intelligence browsers within corporate environments. In an interview, Arora stated that without robust security controls focused on credentials and enterprise safety, these autonomous AI agents are unlikely to be permitted in businesses within the next two years. He acknowledged the consumer appeal of AI agents for tasks like booking travel but emphasized the significant security risks they pose to enterprises, where credential theft is a primary cause of data breaches. Arora's comments highlight the growing tension between rapid AI innovation and the stringent security requirements of the corporate world.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy has released her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which delves into her raw and turbulent relationship with her late mother, Mary Roy. The book portrays Mary Roy as a formidable and complex figure—a feminist icon, educator, and crusader who was also deeply mercurial. Instead of a hagiography, the memoir offers a candid account of a mother-daughter bond described as a tense but respectful dynamic between two powerful personalities. Roy reflects on how this challenging upbringing, while often bruising, ultimately shaped her into the writer she is today, making her mother her most enthralling subject.</p>

          <p>First Lady Melania Trump hosted a meeting with prominent tech leaders, including the CEOs of Google and IBM, to launch a task force on integrating artificial intelligence into K-12 education. The event, part of the "Presidential AI Challenge," focused on embracing AI in school curricula nationwide, with Education Secretary Linda McMahon stating it's not something to be feared. Tech companies pledged to support the initiative, with Google planning to make AI more accessible in schools and IBM committing to training two million workers in AI skills. The event drew criticism from some watchdog groups concerned about the potential negative impacts of AI on children's mental health.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones explained that the decision to trade star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers was based on financial strategy and "mathematics." Parsons recently signed a record-breaking four-year, $186 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. Jones stated that the substantial draft picks received in the trade, combined with the salary cap space freed up, would allow the Cowboys to afford approximately five top-tier players for the cost of one. He emphasized that the move was not personal but a strategic opportunity to distribute talent and mitigate risks associated with player injuries.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has introduced a measure that would require landlords to ensure their rental units can be maintained at a temperature of 82 degrees or below. This proposal follows a similar law recently passed for unincorporated areas of L.A. County and comes in response to the increasing frequency and intensity of heat waves due to climate change. Proponents argue it is a critical public health issue, as extreme indoor heat is linked to increased deaths and hospitalizations, disproportionately affecting the elderly and low-income residents. The Apartment Association of Greater Los Angeles opposes the measure, citing concerns about increased costs for landlords and tenants.</p>

Building on her previous "Be Best" initiative, she has recently championed the "Take It Down Act" to combat the non-consensual sharing of intimate images and launched a task force on AI in education. Though less public than many of her predecessors, analysts note she is taking a more business-oriented and legislative approach to her platform. Her recent engagement on these topics, including a letter to Vladimir Putin about protecting children, signals a selective but impactful presence on the world stage.</p>

It also advises weighing the pros and cons of waiting for potential future rate cuts against the option of refinancing a loan secured now.

          <p>With the Federal Reserve widely expected to cut interest rates in September, financial experts are advising savers to make strategic moves with their certificate of deposit (CD) accounts. The article suggests that individuals with significant savings, such as $10,000, should consider locking in current high rates before they decline further. Key recommendations include assessing whether to deposit more money for a longer term, shopping directly with online banks that typically offer higher yields, and acting promptly as banks may lower their rates in anticipation of the Fed's decision. These steps can help maximize returns in a changing interest rate environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal jury in San Francisco has ordered Google to pay $425.7 million in damages for violating California privacy laws by improperly tracking the activity of millions of smartphone users. The class-action lawsuit covered a period from 2016 to 2024 and argued that Google collected user data even when privacy controls were enabled, using it to sell targeted ads. Although the damages awarded were far less than the $30 billion sought by the plaintiffs, the verdict is being hailed as a victory for consumer privacy. Google has denied any wrongdoing, stating the decision misunderstands how its products work, and plans to appeal the verdict.</p>
