          <p>Chloe Malle has been appointed as the new top editor of American Vogue, succeeding Dame Anna Wintour, who is stepping aside from the editor-in-chief role after 37 years. Malle, the 39-year-old daughter of Candice Bergen, has been with the magazine for 14 years, most recently as the editor of Vogue.com. Wintour will not be leaving entirely, as she will continue in her role as Condé Nast's chief content officer, overseeing Vogue and other company titles. Malle's appointment signals a significant leadership transition for the influential fashion publication.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Landslides are common geological events that can be triggered by factors like excessive rainfall, earthquakes, volcanic activity, or human actions, as seen in recent deadly incidents in Sudan and Papua New Guinea. They are broadly classified into four types—falls, topples, slides, and flows—based on the movement of materials like rock or debris. While often devastating, research indicates that landslides can be prevented through engineering solutions such as improving drainage and building retaining walls. The U.S. Geological Survey also advises against construction in high-risk areas like steep slopes and erosion valleys.</p>

          <p>Shares of PepsiCo increased by over 4% following a report that activist investment firm Elliott Investment Management has acquired a significant stake in the company, reportedly worth around $4 billion. This move positions Elliott as one of PepsiCo's top five active investors and has sparked speculation about potential changes the firm will push for. The investment comes as PepsiCo has been focusing on cost-cutting measures and improving profit margins to address lagging stock performance. Elliott has a history of successfully driving changes at major corporations. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cadillac is experiencing a significant resurgence in the luxury vehicle market, driven by strong sales of its electric vehicles (EVs). Approximately one-quarter of the General Motors brand's recent sales were EVs, a share far exceeding the industry average and helping it attract customers from competitors like Audi, BMW, and even Tesla. While the traditional combustion-engine Escalade remains its top seller, the success of its EV lineup is repositioning Cadillac as a leader in the automotive industry's electric transition. This shift marks a potential turning point for a brand that has long sought to reclaim its former prestige.</p>

          <p>McDonald's is expanding its value offerings by bringing back its "Extra Value Meals," a strategy aimed at attracting customers affected by economic pressures. The promotion, last seen before the pandemic, will offer a 15% discount on combo meals compared to purchasing the items separately. This move is part of a broader trend in the fast-food industry to use discounts and deals to combat shrinking customer traffic, particularly among low-income consumers. The company plans to promote specific discounted meals and has indicated more deals will be introduced later in the year.</p>

          <h2>Army Secretary Describes How Elite Units Bypass Bureaucracy to Counter Drone Threats</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll revealed that elite units like the 75th Ranger Regiment are using government credit cards to rapidly purchase and test commercial drones and other battlefield gear. This allows them to bypass the Pentagon's slow and cumbersome procurement process, enabling faster innovation to counter evolving threats, particularly from inexpensive drones. While this flexibility allows for quick adaptation at the unit level, Driscoll noted the challenge of scaling these solutions across the entire Army due to bureaucratic red tape. The Army is also shifting its long-term strategic focus to address the "pacing threat" posed by China.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Manhattan office leasing market is showing strong signs of recovery, with activity in August pushing the annual volume to a potential post-2019 high if the trend continues. Leasing increased over 20% from July, driven by a return-to-office push and renewed demand from the tech and legal sectors. This "flight to quality" has tightened availability for new and premium office spaces, while the overall availability rate has fallen to its lowest point since January 2021. The conversion of older office buildings to other uses is also reducing supply and helping to stabilize the market. (not investment advice)</p>

It argues against outright prohibition, which can backfire due to psychological "reactance," and also against passive resignation. Instead, the author suggests parents should focus on strengthening the "gravitational pull of home" by modeling their own values and making their home a welcoming space. While peers influence daily choices, parents retain significant influence over core values, and this long-term influence is more effective than direct confrontation or control.</p>
