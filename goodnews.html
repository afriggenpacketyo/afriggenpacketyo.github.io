          <p>The start of the third round of the US PGA Championship at Quail Hollow was delayed due to bad weather, specifically the threat of lightning in the area. Play was suspended moments before the first shot was to be hit, affecting the scheduled tee times for numerous golfers. Practice had been suspended earlier for 17 minutes for the same reason. The article lists the scheduled tee times and pairings that will be affected by the delay, including notable players such as Rory McIlroy, Xander Schauffele, and Max Greyserman.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is considering policy changes to expand access to in vitro fertilization (I.V.F.), including requiring insurers to cover the procedure for military members and declaring it an ‚ÄúEssential Health Benefit‚Äù under the Affordable Care Act. Aides have been meeting with fertility experts and conservative policy groups to discuss potential actions, with a report expected soon. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine has criticized the White House for not including them in discussions. The administration aims to reduce out-of-pocket costs for I.V.F. treatment amid concerns about declining U.S. birthrates and the procedure's high cost.</p>

          <p>Juan Soto, now with the New York Mets after signing a 15-year, $765 million contract, returned to Yankee Stadium and was met with resounding boos from Yankee fans. Despite his successful stint with the Yankees in 2024, where he led the American League in runs scored, fans showed their displeasure with his decision to join their crosstown rivals. The game marked the start of a Subway Series between the first-place Mets and Yankees, with fans heckling Soto at every at-bat and altering his old Yankee jerseys in protest. The Yankees ultimately defeated the Mets 6-2.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has signaled that a youth mobility scheme could form part of a new deal with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. The proposed scheme aims to provide reciprocal arrangements, similar to those the UK already has with countries like Australia. This move could allow young people in the UK to travel and study freely in Europe without a visa, reversing some effects of Brexit. While details are still under discussion, the agreement is expected to be announced at an upcoming summit.</p>

          <p>Sierra Prindle, a military veteran and runner, experienced years of unexplained calf pain before being diagnosed with Popliteal artery entrapment syndrome (PAES). After numerous doctor visits and misdiagnoses, a specialist finally identified the rare condition, which involves compression of the popliteal artery. Prindle underwent surgery to reroute blood flow, but complications led her to Dr. Sean Lyden at the Cleveland Clinic, who performed a second surgery to remove portions of her gastrocnemius and popliteus muscles. Now recovered, Prindle hopes her story encourages others to persist in seeking answers for their health issues.</p>

The law school acquired it for just $27.50 in 1946. Scholars used spectral imaging and ultraviolet light to verify its authenticity, dating it to the final iteration issued by Edward I in 1300. The article emphasizes the true wealth of the Magna Carta lies in its declarations of individual rights and the rule of law, as exemplified in Clause 39.</p>
