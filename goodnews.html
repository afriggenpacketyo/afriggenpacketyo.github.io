          <p>An independent Member of Parliament, Rupert Lowe, has admitted to mistakenly identifying a team of charity rowers off the coast of Great Yarmouth as "illegal migrants." Lowe posted on social media that he had alerted authorities to the "dinghies coming in," prompting a response from HM Coastguard. It was revealed the boat carried a crew rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. After realizing his error, Lowe pledged to donate £1,000 to their cause, while the rowers, including a former Royal Marine, found the incident "hilarious."</p>

          <p>For the first time, the US Track and Field Outdoor Championships fully integrated Paralympic events, a move seen as a symbolic step toward equity for disabled athletes. However, advocates and athletes argue that this gesture is long overdue and insufficient to ensure global dominance when the Paralympics come to Los Angeles in three years. Despite talented individuals, the U.S. lacks a robust system for developing Paralympic athletes, falling behind nations like China and Brazil that have invested heavily in recruitment and training. Achieving true success will require significant financial commitment and structural support beyond just sharing the spotlight, to bridge the gap from junior to elite competition.</p>

          <p>First-term Missouri Senator Eric Schmitt has established himself as a pivotal ally for President Trump's agenda in the U.S. Senate, recently spearheading the successful passage of a $9 billion spending clawback package. A former Missouri attorney general, Schmitt has built a strong relationship with Trump, frequently golfing with him and championing his America First policies. His colleagues credit his humble yet effective leadership and negotiating skills for uniting the diverse Senate GOP conference behind the rescissions bill, which targeted funds for NPR, PBS, and foreign aid. Schmitt has opted to remain in the Senate, where he is seen as an influential and rising figure within the Republican party.</p>

          <p>U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs has drawn President Trump's ire for her role in presiding over two major lawsuits between Harvard University and the administration. Appointed by President Barack Obama in 2014, Burroughs is known for her extensive legal experience as both a federal prosecutor and a defense attorney, as well as her direct, no-nonsense demeanor in the courtroom. She has handled several high-profile cases, including the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit against Harvard and a challenge to Trump's 2017 travel ban. Colleagues describe her as self-assured and adept at cutting through complexity, qualities on display as she weighs cases concerning federal funding and international student enrollment.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is fast-tracking NASA's plans to deploy a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030 to power a future human base. The directive aims to establish a sustainable energy source for long-term lunar occupation, as solar power is insufficient during the two-week lunar night. The proposed reactor would generate at least 100 kilowatts, enough to power about 80 homes, and is seen as crucial for the U.S. to lead in space exploration against rivals like China and Russia. While necessary for the mission's success, the ambitious timeline and estimated $3 billion cost raise concerns about feasibility, safety, and potential strain on NASA's budget.</p>

          <p>China is deepening its economic engagement with eSwatini, the last African nation to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan, by financing a major dam project. A Chinese state-owned enterprise, Sinohydro, is constructing the US$146 million Mpakeni Dam, which will support irrigation for thousands of hectares of land. This project is part of a larger, African Development Bank-funded water initiative. The move highlights Beijing's strategy of using economic partnerships and infrastructure development to build influence, even with countries that have not formally switched their diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing, signaling a pragmatic approach to its foreign policy goals.</p>

          <h2>Experts Discuss Smartphone Addiction and Strategies for Digital Well-being</h2>

          <p>The pervasive nature of smartphones has led to widespread concern over digital addiction, with over half of American adults feeling they spend too much time on their devices. Research shows that a phone's mere presence, even when silent, can diminish cognitive capacity by pulling at our attention. In response, some people are turning to "dumbphones" or older models like BlackBerrys to escape the addictive design of modern smartphones. Experts suggest that overcoming this dependency requires more than just willpower; it involves creating intentional moments of connection with the real world, whether through nature, friends, or solitary reflection, to interrupt ingrained phone habits.</p>

          <p>Scientists are studying a unique group of individuals known as "SuperAgers"—people aged 80 and older who possess the memory skills of those decades younger. Despite the natural brain shrinkage that occurs with age, the brains of SuperAgers shrink more slowly, allowing them to resist the cognitive decline associated with aging and diseases like Alzheimer's. Researchers at Northwestern University's SuperAging Program have been analyzing this resilient group for over two decades to understand the biological and lifestyle factors that contribute to their exceptional cognitive longevity. Their findings aim to uncover secrets that could help a broader population maintain brain health well into old age.</p>

          <p>The market for space company Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is showing renewed activity after a quiet period, with several firms like Karman Holdings, Voyager Technologies, and Firefly Aerospace successfully going public this year. This marks a shift from the recent trend of space companies listing via mergers with Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs). Analysts suggest that despite geopolitical volatility, the timing is ripe for space IPOs, as these companies align with national priorities and innovation, and investor appetite is growing. The sector's high growth potential and strategic importance are attracting public investment, though competition and reliance on foreign components remain potential challenges.

          <p>Major Chinese technology companies, including Xiaomi, are launching large-scale hiring initiatives, primarily seeking graduates with skills in software research, algorithms, and hardware development. This trend is reinforcing a push among Chinese families for students to pursue majors in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The hiring spree is driven by a strategic need for domestic innovation and talent cultivation as Beijing aims to reduce its reliance on foreign technology amid tightening U.S. export controls on advanced chips. These future-proof careers are seen as a way for jobseekers to secure stable employment in a competitive and strategically vital sector.</p>
