The new model aims to eliminate unnecessary mark-ups and give lenders more choice, a move praised by the Federal Housing Finance Agency director as a creative solution for consumers.

          <p>Astronomers have observed a free-floating "rogue planet," untethered to any star, consuming gas and dust from its surrounding disc at a record-breaking rate of six billion tons per second. This object, named Cha 1107-7626, is exhibiting behaviors previously seen only in stars, such as magnetic activity driving its accretion process, which blurs the line between planet and star formation. The discovery challenges existing theories about how planetary-mass objects form and evolve in the universe.</p>
