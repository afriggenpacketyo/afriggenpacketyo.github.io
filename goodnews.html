          <p>Several major Chinese companies, including AI firm SenseTime and dairy producer Mengniu, are actively raising capital to support liquidity and refinancing needs. This move reflects a noticeable improvement in investor sentiment in the second half of the year, according to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. SenseTime is set to raise funds through a new share issuance to support AI infrastructure and research. Meanwhile, Mengniu plans to issue yuan-denominated bonds for refinancing existing debt and funding green and social responsibility projects. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After a decade-long legal fight, the rate-rigging convictions of two former London traders, Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, have been quashed. The ruling overturns their jail sentences for manipulating the Libor interest rate and opens the door for other convicted traders to appeal. The case raises significant questions about potential compensation, the basis of the original prosecutions by the Serious Fraud Office, and the role of senior bank managers. Calls for a broader public inquiry into the matter are now intensifying.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled against the Trump administration's effort to end birthright citizenship, affirming a lower court's nationwide block on the policy. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found the executive order, which sought to deny citizenship to children born in the U.S. to non-citizen or temporary resident parents, to be unconstitutional. The decision is based on the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment and marks a significant legal setback for the administration's immigration agenda. The case could be appealed to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Frustrated by local opposition, a growing number of states are enacting laws to force cities and counties to allow for more affordable and denser housing. In states like Utah, where the median home price is out of reach for most renters, the housing shortage is seen as a crisis affecting the middle class. While states are using mandates and incentives to encourage development, they face pushback from local governments concerned about strained infrastructure and loss of local control. Despite these efforts, the housing shortage continues to grow in many areas.</p>

          <p>After a five-year hiatus, China and Russia have relaunched joint oceanographic research, sending a team of 25 scientists on a 45-day expedition. The mission, departing from Vladivostok, will focus on studying the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific Ocean. This ninth joint expedition aims to investigate sediment processes and environmental changes over the last 126,000 years. The resumption of these surveys signals a renewed commitment to bilateral scientific cooperation between the two nations.</p>

          <h2>Study Suggests Walking 7,000 Steps Daily Significantly Reduces Health Risks</h2>

          <p>A major new study indicates that walking 7,000 steps a day, a more achievable target than the commonly cited 10,000, can significantly boost health. Published in the Lancet Public Health, the research analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and found this step count was linked to a reduced risk of dementia, heart disease, cancer, and depression. The findings challenge the 10,000-step goal, which originated from a 1960s marketing campaign rather than scientific evidence. Researchers suggest this could encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical tool for well-being.</p>

          <p>A researcher from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography discovered a rare violet sea snail, Janthina janthina, on a La Jolla beach, a species not seen locally in a decade. These pelagic snails, known for their vibrant purple shells and bubble rafts for flotation, typically inhabit warmer tropical waters. Their appearance often coincides with warmer offshore currents, raising questions among scientists about a potential link to climate change. Researchers urge the public to report any further sightings as they monitor for signs of shifting marine ecosystems.</p>

          <p>San Francisco Giants' Rafael Devers, after making his debut at first base, made a surprising admission about his role on the field. Previously, with the Boston Red Sox, Devers had been adamant about serving exclusively as the designated hitter. However, he now states that he prefers playing a defensive position because it keeps him active and prevents him from overthinking his at-bats. This marks a significant shift from his stance during a tense spring training where he reportedly resisted a move to first base with his former team.</p>

The growth, which beat economists' expectations, was primarily driven by a strong performance in exports, particularly in semiconductors and petroleum products. However, private consumption and investment slowed, and economists remain cautious about the second half of the year due to the potential impact of U.S. trade tariffs. The data comes as South Korea continues to negotiate a trade deal with the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

The off-road capable, 912-horsepower vehicle is priced at approximately $46,000 and is positioned as a versatile alternative in a market where Tesla's Cybertruck is not sold. This success for Dongfeng comes as Tesla's vehicle registrations in China have shown a recent decline. The M817's appeal is attributed to its combination of power, off-road features, and competitive pricing. (not investment advice)</p>

As of Wednesday night, the fire was 5% contained, the freeway was reopened, and crews remained on scene for mop-up operations.</p>
