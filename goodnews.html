          <h2>Study Links Increased Screen Time in Children to Emotional and Social Issues</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-10 16:42:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A large international study involving nearly 300,000 children indicates a two-way relationship between screen time and socioemotional well-being. The research found that increased use of devices like TVs, tablets, and gaming consoles is associated with a higher risk of aggression, anxiety, and low self-esteem in children. Conversely, children with pre-existing emotional or social challenges tend to spend more time on screens. The study suggests that limiting recreational screen time, particularly for children under 10, and encouraging alternative activities like interacting with friends and family, can mitigate these risks. The research emphasizes the importance of balance and moderation in screen use to promote healthy development.</p>

          <p>European Union officials are promoting the EU as a stable and predictable partner for Latin America, citing instability arising from the strategic competition between the United States and China. Speaking at a security conference in Brazil, EU representatives emphasized the bloc's commitment to a "green, digital and just transition," contrasting it with China's "export-led, fossil fuel-driven economy." The EU aims to build a development agenda with Latin America based on shared values and long-term cooperation, rather than resource extraction. This outreach is part of a broader effort by Brussels to strengthen ties with the region through increased financing and political collaboration.</p>

          <p>A Chicago Immigration Court judge ruled that Ramon Morales-Reyes, an undocumented Mexican immigrant framed for threatening President Donald Trump, can be released on a $7,500 bond. Judge Carla Espinoza stated that she does not believe Morales-Reyes poses a danger to the community. Despite multiple arrests since 1996, Morales-Reyes has only one conviction for disorderly conduct. The Department of Homeland Security did not oppose the bond request. While no longer under investigation for threats, DHS maintains he is in the country illegally and has a history of arrests. The Trump administration remains committed to deporting illegal aliens, but Morales-Reyes' family is hopeful for his release.</p>
