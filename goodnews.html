          <p>The National Weather Service has significantly expanded its Flood Inundation Mapping (FIM) tool, which now provides flood forecast data for approximately 60% of the U.S. population. This experimental tool offers real-time, interactive visualizations of current and predicted flooding, aiming to enhance the capabilities of forecasters and emergency responders. The expansion includes new coverage for the Great Plains, Southeast, Southwest, West Coast, Hawaii, and parts of Alaska. Officials state the tool has already proven effective in areas like Kentucky, where it aided in the timely evacuation of residents, and it is expected to be fully operational nationwide by next year.</p>

This move is seen as a major step for T. Rowe Price, which has faced challenges amid the shift towards ETFs and passive investing.

Born at home in Georgia during the segregation era, she never received the document, a problem that became acute with the implementation of the federal Real ID law. Her son Derrick initiated the long legal process to prove her existence, which he says was expedited by local media coverage. With the birth certificate in hand, Lovette was able to acquire her Real ID, and the family now hopes to get her a passport for international travel.</p>

          <p>Kerragan Johnson, a 17-year-old track star from Arlington, Texas, who was born with a limb difference, has qualified to represent the United States at the World Para Athletics Championships in India. Despite being born with an amniotic band that led to the amputation of one hand, Johnson has excelled in track and field, choosing to compete against adults to push her limits. She secured her spot on the national team by placing in the 200-meter and 400-meter finals at the USA Outdoor and Para National Championships. Johnson balances her rigorous training schedule with schoolwork and aims to compete in the 2028 Paralympics in Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer has indicated that the UK government is considering the implementation of a digital ID system as a measure to tackle illegal immigration and employment. Starmer suggested that such a program could play an "important part" in reducing incentives for unauthorized entry into the country. He noted that public perception of digital identity has evolved significantly since a previous, unpopular physical ID card scheme was scrapped over a decade ago due to privacy concerns. Officials are examining how a digital ID could streamline right-to-work checks for employers and reduce the use of fraudulent documents, drawing inspiration from Estonia's comprehensive digital identity system.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage in the U.S. has dropped to 6.5%, marking its lowest point since October of the previous year. This continued decline in borrowing costs, reported by Freddie Mac, provides some relief to potential homebuyers by increasing their purchasing power. The downward trend in mortgage rates is largely attributed to growing market expectations that the Federal Reserve will cut its benchmark interest rate at its upcoming policy meeting. While the Fed does not directly set mortgage rates, its decisions heavily influence the bond market, which lenders use as a guide for pricing home loans. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Philosophical and Psychological Perspectives on Reframing Anxiety as a Positive Force</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-04 12:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the idea of transforming anxiety from a debilitating condition into a catalyst for personal growth and adventure, drawing on the philosophy of Søren Kierkegaard. While acknowledging that anxiety disorders are serious medical issues, the author argues that moderate, managed anxiety is a natural human alarm system that can enhance performance and self-awareness. Research suggests that a moderate level of arousal can lead to optimal "flow" states, and transformative life experiences, though stressful, can foster a clearer sense of life's meaning. The article recommends accepting anxiety rather than suppressing it and reframing the physiological response as excitement for a new challenge.</p>

          <p>The NBA is planning to overhaul its All-Star Game format for the 2026 event in Los Angeles, moving to a round-robin tournament featuring three eight-player teams. The proposed structure would consist of two teams of U.S.-born players and one team of international players, a concept long favored by Commissioner Adam Silver to address the league's demographic imbalance. This change comes after widespread criticism of recent All-Star Games for their lack of defensive effort and competitiveness, particularly the 2024 game which ended with a 211-186 score. The new format aims to inject excitement and a higher level of play into the mid-season showcase.</p>

German manufacturers like BMW, Mercedes, and VW are expected to debut new electric models, but they are grappling with job losses, rising costs, and shrinking market share in key markets like China.

          <p>The NFL season kicks off with several compelling questions, including whether the Green Bay Packers are now Super Bowl favorites after acquiring star defensive end Micah Parsons in a stunning trade from the Dallas Cowboys. Another major focus is the development of the six quarterbacks selected early in last year's draft, as they enter a critical second year where progress is not guaranteed. In the AFC, the central question remains whether any contender, such as the Buffalo Bills or Baltimore Ravens, can finally dethrone the Kansas City Chiefs, who have dominated the conference for the past six seasons under quarterback Patrick Mahomes.</p>
