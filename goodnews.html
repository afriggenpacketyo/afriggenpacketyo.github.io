          <p>The Mexican government, led by President Claudia Sheinbaum, is suing Google for complying with a decree by former U.S. President Donald Trump to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America. Mexico argues that Google should differentiate between the U.S. and Mexican territorial waters when applying the name. Google claims its policy is to follow official U.S. government geographic designations, but Mexico's Foreign Ministry has sent letters requesting the company not to label Mexican waters with the new name.</p>

          <p>Rand Laycock, a music conductor diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, has experienced significant improvement in his symptoms through deep brain stimulation (DBS) and adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS). After medications became less effective, Laycock underwent brain implant surgery and received DBS therapy, which delivers electrical currents to specific areas of the brain. He later transitioned to aDBS, a more advanced form that adapts stimulation in real time to better control fluctuating symptoms. As a result, Laycock's tremors are nearly gone, and his dyskinesia is well-managed, allowing him to continue his career and enjoy time with his family.</p>
