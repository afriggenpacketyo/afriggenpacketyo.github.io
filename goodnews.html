          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett stated that the Trump administration remains confident that courts will uphold its tariff agenda, despite recent legal setbacks. Hassett conveyed this assurance following an appeals court decision to reinstate President Trump's tariffs after a previous court order had blocked them. The initial injunction was based on the court's interpretation that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act does not grant the president unlimited authority to impose tariffs. The White House contends that the court order could impede progress in ongoing trade negotiations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article explores the gendered dynamics of working from home, suggesting that men often disproportionately claim dedicated workspace in heterosexual couples. It references Helen Garner's diaries and Jessica Stanley's novel to illustrate how women's work can be subtly sidelined in domestic spaces. The article cites research indicating that women experience more interruptions and less access to unshared workspaces, impacting their emotional well-being and professional lives. It draws a parallel to Virginia Woolf's "A Room of One's Own," arguing that despite progress, intimate domestic spaces remain stubbornly unequal. The article advocates for greater awareness and equity in the allocation of workspace to address the ongoing challenges women face in balancing work and home life.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have developed an infrared contact lens that converts infrared light into visible light, enabling humans to see in the dark. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles consisting of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. The upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals in the dark, even with closed eyes. This innovation holds potential applications in surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations. The innovation provides new possibilities for human vision.</p>
