        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The German government is exploring a simplified process to designate countries of origin as safe, aiming to decrease the number of asylum seekers. Chancellor Merz's Cabinet has approved a draft policy that would allow a country to be declared safe through a simple statutory order, without requiring the consent of the Bundesrat. Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt stated that this measure is part of a broader set of national initiatives to implement an "asylum turnaround." Under German asylum law, safe countries of origin are those where individuals are not subject to political persecution or inhuman punishment, and migrants from these countries are less likely to have their asylum applications approved.</p>

          <h2>Weak Jobs Data Sparks Talk of Federal Reserve Rate Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 15:18:48 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Weaker-than-expected private-sector jobs data has fueled speculation about a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The ADP's monthly report showed a significant drop in May job additions, the lowest in over two years. If the government's nonfarm payrolls report reflects similar weakness, it could prompt the Fed to act to stimulate the job market. Meanwhile, Amazon announced a $10 billion investment in new artificial intelligence data centers in North Carolina, signaling continued growth in the AI sector. This combination of economic data and corporate investment highlights the complex factors influencing the financial landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. plans to require medical schools to offer nutrition courses or risk losing federal funding. Kennedy expressed concern that medical schools focus on treating illnesses with drugs rather than preventing them with food. He intends to announce the policy within a year, though details are lacking. Some nutrition experts are optimistic, while some medical schools claim they already offer sufficient nutrition education. This initiative reflects Kennedy's focus on addressing chronic disease through changes to Americans' diets.</p>
