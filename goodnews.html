          <p>Mortgage demand saw a modest 0.6% increase last week, following a significant 58% surge in refinance applications the prior week. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage decreased to 6.34%, its lowest since September 2024, though rates were volatile after a Federal Reserve cut. While refinance activity is up 42% year-over-year, purchase applications remained largely flat. Experts note continued strength in homebuyer demand despite seasonal trends, with government applications driving the refinance boost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Retirement experts caution seniors to proactively plan for significant financial challenges, including escalating healthcare and long-term care costs, which have risen substantially. Even homeowners without mortgages must budget for property taxes, insurance, and unforeseen maintenance. Additionally, unexpected tax liabilities on Social Security benefits and retirement account withdrawals can impact fixed incomes. Thorough planning, potentially with a financial professional, is essential to navigate these expenses and ensure a comfortable retirement. (not investment advice)</p>
