        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ross Douthat's NYT opinion piece analyzes the Apple TV show 'Your Friends & Neighbors,' which stars Jon Hamm as a New York City moneyman who resorts to theft after losing his job. Douthat contrasts the show's bleak depiction of hyper-affluence with more aspirational portrayals, suggesting that it reflects a shift away from the glamour and security traditionally associated with wealth. The piece explores whether the show's portrayal of the rich as unhappy and financially insecure is accurate, considering factors like the decline of aesthetic distinction and the democratization of desire. This is not investment advice.</p>
