          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from Putnam County Jail and reunited with his family, awaiting trial for human smuggling charges in January. This development follows his mistaken deportation to El Salvador in March, where he alleges torture, and his subsequent return to the U.S. A federal magistrate ordered his release, with an electronic monitoring device expected. His attorney emphasizes that while the release brings relief, the threat of further detention or deportation persists, urging the government to cease actions that could separate his family again.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball is finalizing new media rights agreements with ESPN, NBC, and Netflix, aiming to secure approximately $800 million annually. NBC is set to acquire Sunday night games and Wild Card playoff games for about $200 million per year, while Netflix will gain Home Run Derby rights for $50 million. ESPN will receive a new $550 million package, including MLB TV and in-market games for five local teams. These three-year deals, expiring after the 2028 season, mark MLB's expansion into new media partnerships despite not fully recouping previous losses from ESPN's early exit.

          <p>Ether surged, nearing its record high, following Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's annual address from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, which hinted at potential interest rate adjustments. Powell's comments on a shifting balance of risks possibly warranting a policy stance change led to significant short liquidations in ETH, pushing its price higher. Crypto trading firms noted traders being caught off-guard by the dovish tone, indicating a panicked repositioning. This momentum also lifted shares of ether-focused companies, though some, like ETHzilla, saw declines due to unrelated share resale offers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>IRS Clarifies EV Tax Credit Deadline, Offering Flexibility for Buyers with Binding Contracts</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The federal EV tax credit, worth up to $7,500, is set to expire on September 30 with the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act." However, the IRS has clarified that buyers can still qualify if they enter a binding contract and make a payment before the deadline, even if vehicle delivery occurs later. This flexibility benefits those purchasing out-of-state or custom-ordered vehicles. While the Trump administration is rolling back EV incentives, analysts anticipate a short-term sales bump before a potential drop, as automakers continue to invest in cheaper EV models for long-term growth.</p>

          <p>Intel shares rose after reports suggested the Trump administration is poised to announce the U.S. government will take an equity stake in the chipmaker. President Trump indicated the government seeks about 10% of the company, valued over $100 billion, in exchange for CHIPS Act funds. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick previously stated the government was seeking a nonvoting equity stake as part of a shift in U.S. industrial policy. Intel, which recently secured a $2 billion investment from SoftBank, is building advanced chip factories in Ohio, though construction was slowed due to market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Fifteen young climate advocates, aged eight to 17, have sued the state of Wisconsin, challenging its pro-fossil fuel policies. The lawsuit targets two state laws preventing the public service commission from considering air pollution when permitting new fossil fuel plants and from mandating more carbon-free electricity. Lead plaintiff Kaarina, 17, shared her traumatic experience of being displaced due to climate-exacerbated flooding, highlighting the personal toll. The plaintiffs, supported by Our Children’s Trust, argue these laws violate constitutional rights to life, liberty, and public trust, amid mounting climate impacts in Wisconsin.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, in his Jackson Hole speech, cautiously indicated that conditions "may warrant" interest rate cuts, noting "sweeping changes" in policy and a shifting balance of risks. While acknowledging a resilient labor market, he highlighted rising downside dangers and inflation risks from tariffs. Powell stated that current restrictive policy allows the Fed to "proceed carefully" in considering adjustments. His remarks caused stocks to soar and Treasury yields to fall, despite ongoing political pressure from President Trump for aggressive cuts, as the Fed reaffirmed its commitment to independence and its 2% inflation target.
