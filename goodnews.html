        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1% while major technology stocks saw a decline. This market rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will implement interest rate cuts starting in September. Lower rates are expected to particularly benefit smaller companies, which often rely on borrowed capital for operations and expansion, thus reducing their financial costs. The article notes this shift comes after weaker jobs data and a cooler inflation report, increasing pressure on the Fed to ease monetary policy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts are upgrading their ratings for Palo Alto Networks, suggesting the recent stock sell-off following its bid to acquire CyberArk was an overreaction. Firms like Deutsche Bank and Piper Sandler have raised their price targets, viewing the $25 billion deal as a strategic move that fills a critical gap in identity security. This acquisition enhances Palo Alto's platformization strategy, which aims to consolidate cybersecurity services for customers. The article suggests that market concerns about the deal's cost were short-sighted and that the move positions the company for significant long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

The president, who will host the December gala, also outlined plans for physical renovations to the center, stating his administration has reversed its decline.

          <p>Walmart has announced an expansion of its employee discount program to cover nearly all grocery items, including milk, meat, and frozen foods. The 10% discount, previously limited to produce and general merchandise, will now apply to 95% of store items for its 1.6 million U.S. employees. This move comes as rising tariffs spark concerns about increased consumer prices, which Walmart's CFO has acknowledged the company cannot fully absorb. The expanded benefit is also seen as a strategy to boost employee morale, retain workers, and encourage them to shop at Walmart.</p>

While the terms were not disclosed, CNBC recently valued the Trail Blazers at $3.65 billion.

          <p>Premier League chief executive Richard Masters has stated there are no current plans to stage official league matches outside of England. His comments come as Spain's La Liga and Italy's Serie A are seeking approval to play games in the United States and Australia. A previous Premier League proposal for a '39th game' abroad was shelved in 2008 after widespread criticism. Masters noted that while the idea was once considered for international growth, the league has since achieved this through other means like broadcast partnerships and summer tours, making the controversial concept unnecessary for now.</p>

          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like meat, produce, and eggs in over 1,000 U.S. cities, with plans to reach 2,300 locations by year's end. The move aims to encourage shoppers to add perishable items to their regular Amazon orders, a service that is free for Prime members on orders over $25. The announcement caused a drop in the stock prices of competitors like Instacart, Kroger, and Walmart. This expansion is part of Amazon's broader strategy to overhaul its grocery business and increase its competition in the fast-delivery market.</p>

          <p>Seven-time Grand Slam champion Venus Williams has been awarded a wildcard entry into the US Open, set to make her 25th appearance at the tournament. At 45 years old, she will become the oldest singles player to compete at the event since 1981. Williams returned to professional tennis in July after a 16-month absence, winning a match at the Washington Open. Her return to a major tournament has sparked discussion, with some seeing it as a celebrated opportunity for an all-time great and others arguing it blocks a spot for a younger, developing player.</p>

          <p>The probability of Jefferies Chief Market Strategist David Zervos becoming the next Federal Reserve chair has risen on the prediction market Kalshi. This follows a CNBC report that the Trump administration is considering 11 candidates to succeed Jerome Powell, whose term ends next year. Zervos's odds on the platform jumped to 15%, tying him with former front-runner Kevin Warsh. Fed Governor Chris Waller remains the top contender at 31%. The speculation highlights the administration's focus on finding a candidate who may be more inclined to lower interest rates, a frequent point of contention with the current chair.

This initiative follows similar commitments from the Netherlands and a joint Nordic effort to provide critical equipment. The aid, focused on urgently needed air defense capabilities to counter Russian airstrikes, will be sourced based on Ukraine's priority needs on the battlefield, with most of the equipment being purchased in the United States.</p>
