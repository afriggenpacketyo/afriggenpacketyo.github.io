The book portrays an inner circle that avoided addressing the president's diminishing abilities rather than actively concealing them. Despite the reliance on anonymous sources, the book underscores the Democratic Party's ongoing reluctance to publicly confront questions about Biden's capacity to serve as president.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the form of golfer Rory McIlroy at Quail Hollow, with commentary from other golfers such as Scheffler, Spieth, and DeChambeau. The article details that McIlroy became just the sixth player to win all four majors with his triumph at Augusta National - a result that has had Scheffler purring. Thomas, twice a US PGA winner - including at Quail Hollow in 2017 - said McIlroy's victory was like a wake-up call. Spieth arrives this week in search of the only title missing from his majors resume.</p>

          <p>Iran has proposed the creation of a joint nuclear enrichment venture involving regional Arab countries and American investments as an alternative to Washington‚Äôs demand that it dismantle its nuclear program. The article details that Iran‚Äôs foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, proposed the idea to an American special envoy, Steve Witkoff, when the two men held direct and indirect talks in Oman on Sunday. A deal that would allow Iran to enrich uranium to 3.67 percent would bear similarity to the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers.</p>
