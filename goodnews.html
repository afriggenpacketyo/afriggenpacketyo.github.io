          <p>A growing number of singles are turning to artificial intelligence dating assistants to improve their chances of finding a partner. Apps like Rizz and Keepler use generative AI to suggest replies, craft witty opening lines, and even help users navigate difficult conversations like respectfully ending a connection. According to a Match.com study, 1 in 4 singles now use AI for their dating life, a significant increase from the previous year. While some users see it as a helpful tool to break the ice, experts caution that AI should supplement, not substitute, genuine human connection to avoid misrepresenting oneself.</p>

          <h2>Sex Therapist Identifies Four Common Behaviors That Can Harm Relationship Intimacy</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-12 09:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A sex therapist with over two decades of experience outlines four surprising factors that can quietly damage intimacy in a relationship. These include the constant distraction of phones, unresolved emotional attachments to past partners, a persistent negativity bias that fosters self-doubt, and the physiological impact of stress on desire. The article suggests that intimacy is more than physical and is crucial for a thriving partnership. To combat these issues, the therapist recommends setting screen-time boundaries, processing past relationships, challenging negative thoughts, and openly communicating with partners about stress and connection needs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to negotiation expert Kathryn Valentine, securing a pay raise is rarely accomplished in a single meeting and often requires a process spanning several weeks. She advises initiating compensation discussions during mid-year check-ins rather than annual reviews, as budgets are often set by then. The first meeting's goal should be to open the dialogue and present your case, not to get an immediate agreement. Valentine stresses the importance of patience, documenting conversations, and scheduling follow-up meetings to hold both parties accountable, framing negotiation as an ongoing, collaborative skill rather than a one-time confrontation.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has acquired a 9.01% stake in Tripadvisor, signaling its intent to engage with the company's management and board to unlock shareholder value. Tripadvisor, which operates its core travel guidance platform, the booking site Viator, and the restaurant reservation platform TheFork, is seen as undervalued by Starboard. The activist firm may pursue several strategies, including improving operational efficiency, advocating for the sale of a segment like TheFork to highlight its value, or exploring the potential of Tripadvisor's vast data for AI applications. The move comes after Tripadvisor bought back a controlling stake from Liberty Media. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article posits that the recent policy change ending the requirement for travelers to remove their shoes at airport security checkpoints signifies a broader move away from the era of "security theater" that followed the September 11th attacks. The piece, from Vox's Future Perfect section, frames this development as progress in how the nation approaches homeland security and counter-terrorism measures. The author implies that this shift represents a more rational and less performative approach to safety protocols that have been in place for over two decades. The change is presented as a significant, albeit small, step toward normalcy in air travel.</p>

Winger Duhan van der Merwe was a standout performer, scoring a hat-trick as the Lions ran in a total of eight tries. The dominant performance provided a strong platform for the team heading into the crucial Test match week. However, the win was tempered by an injury to hooker Luke Cowan-Dickie, who was stretchered off, and news that center Garry Ringrose will miss the Brisbane Test due to a head injury.</p>

          <p>According to diplomatic sources, President Trump is contemplating the authorization of new funding for Ukraine, a potential shift in policy since taking office. This move could be a response to Russia's recent escalation of drone and missile attacks on Ukrainian cities. The administration has access to $3.85 billion in leftover presidential drawdown authority and the power to seize $5 billion in Russian assets to aid Ukraine. This consideration follows the president's recent criticism of Vladimir Putin and his comments about sending more defensive weapons, despite his previous critiques of U.S. spending on the war and pushes for a peace agreement.</p>

It highlights that wild, animal-like movement helps develop healthier bodies, superior cognitive skills, and better mental well-being. Injury-prevention expert Marcus Elliott suggests that this type of play builds "movement quality," making children more resilient to injuries later in life.

          <p>German Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has dismissed concerns that a political spat within the ruling coalition over judicial appointments is damaging the country's Federal Constitutional Court. The controversy arose after the conservative CDU/CSU bloc withdrew its support for a Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for the court, causing a planned parliamentary vote to be postponed. Critics, including members of the SPD, accused the conservatives of deliberately undermining democratic institutions. Dobrindt, however, described the postponement as a normal part of the political process and stated he sees no harm done to Germany's highest court.</p>

She describes this as a "hot girl hamster wheel" of recurring expenses for hair, nails, and skincare, which function as depreciating assets requiring ever-increasing investment. Tassin suggests women perform a "hot girl detox" by annualizing these costs to understand their financial impact and experiment with opting out. The money saved can then be used more productively to pay down debt, build savings, or invest for the future.</p>

However, data from the New York Fed suggests that recent graduates in other fields, including many humanities, have lower unemployment rates. For example, the unemployment rate for recent art history and philosophy majors was lower than that for finance and economics graduates. This trend is partly driven by the rise of AI, which has increased demand for creative thinking and soft skills, leading some major firms like BlackRock to actively recruit more liberal arts graduates.</p>

Astrophysicists explain that black holes are concentrations of mass so dense that their gravity warps spacetime, creating a singularity where known laws of physics break down. Recent discoveries with the James Webb Space Telescope have confirmed theories that supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies can form directly from collapsing gas clouds.
