          <p>The UK government has committed ¬£14.2 billion to build the Sizewell C nuclear plant on the Suffolk coastline, with the aim of creating 10,000 direct jobs and powering six million homes. Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed the decision as a landmark that will kickstart economic growth, while Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the investment is necessary for a golden age of clean energy. The government emphasizes that nuclear power is a crucial part of plans to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030. However, the project has faced opposition due to concerns about costs and environmental impact.</p>

          <h2>Drug Overdose Deaths Among Young Americans See Significant Decline</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fatal drug overdoses among young Americans have plummeted, with a 47% reduction in risk for those aged 20 to 29, according to data from the CDC. The number of deaths under 35 dropped from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less potent fentanyl being sold, increased addiction healthcare access, and more cautious drug use among young people. While this trend is promising, challenges remain in reaching those with severe addiction and concerns exist about potential funding cuts to addiction services.</p>
