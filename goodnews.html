          <p>Apple, alongside former President Trump, announced an additional $100 billion investment in U.S. manufacturing, bringing its total four-year commitment to $600 billion. The plan is expected to create 20,000 new jobs and includes new facilities in Kentucky and Houston, along with a manufacturing academy in Detroit. This announcement follows previous commitments and pressure from the Trump administration to reshore production of key components, including a threat of tariffs on iPhones made outside the U.S. The move is framed as a significant step toward ensuring Apple products sold in America are also made in America.</p>

          <p>This article examines the potential interest earnings for a $20,000 deposit in a high-yield savings account, highlighting the benefits of such accounts in the current economic climate. While traditional savings accounts offer low returns, high-yield options provide significantly higher rates, allowing savers to better counteract inflation. The article notes that because these accounts have variable rates, precise long-term earnings are difficult to predict, especially with potential Federal Reserve rate changes. However, it calculates potential short-term returns to illustrate the benefits of opening an account sooner rather than later. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>England cricketer Chris Woakes demonstrated remarkable determination by batting in the final Test against India despite suffering a suspected dislocated shoulder earlier in the match. With England needing 17 runs to win and only one wicket remaining, Woakes emerged with his arm in a sling, batting left-handed to protect his injury. Although he did not face a ball, he managed to run four crucial runs before his partner was dismissed, resulting in a narrow six-run loss for England.

          <p>This article provides a comparative analysis for savers deciding between a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) and a money market account for a $10,000 deposit. It explains that while both currently offer similar high interest rates, a CD provides a fixed rate, guaranteeing the return over the term. In contrast, a money market account's rate is variable and likely to decrease if the Federal Reserve cuts rates as anticipated. The analysis concludes that for those prioritizing guaranteed maximum earnings in the current climate, a CD is the preferable, more predictable option. (not investment advice)</p>
