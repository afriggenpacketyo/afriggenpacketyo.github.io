          <p>Alex Matisse, the great-grandson of artist Henri Matisse, initially avoided his famous last name when founding East Fork Pottery in Asheville, North Carolina, in 2009. He wanted to make his own way, building a wood kiln with his wife and growing the business organically. Despite initial setbacks when he tried to mechanize and introduce new colors, his pottery gained a dedicated following known as "Potheads." Eventually, Alex decided to embrace his heritage, incorporating his great-grandfather's works into his ceramics, finding a way to celebrate his family history while maintaining his unique artistic identity.</p>

          <p>Emma Beddington reflects on the benefits of intergenerational friendships, prompted by an Atlantic podcast discussing the age-segregation of society. Having friends in their 70s and 80s provides a broader sense of community and fresh perspectives, helping to cure the compulsion to compare herself to others. Beddington notes that people of all ages face anxieties and uncertainties, challenging the notion of siloed generations with distinct preoccupations, fostering a sense of connection and shared human experience. The author emphasizes that life is a continuous journey of stumbling, struggling, and finding joy, regardless of age.</p>

          <p>During the Klondike Gold Rush at the end of the 19th century, gold seekers discovered rich copper deposits in Alaska's Copper River Valley. The U.S. Army started work on the Valdez Trail, which became the main route between the mining fields and Valdez. In 1902, the Miles Brothers, a team of photographers, documented the town, the growing trail, the landscape, and Alaska Natives. These photographs, recently digitized at the U.S. National Archives, provide a remarkable glimpse into daily life along the Alaskan interior nearly 125 years ago.</p>
