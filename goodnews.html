          <p>NPR's international team describes the Dubai International Airport (DXB) as more than just a transit hub, highlighting how a long layover can transform into a unique travel experience. The article recounts personal experiences of exploring the colossal airport's diverse offerings, which include bustling gold shops, familiar global eateries like McDonald's and Starbucks, a tranquil Zen Garden, and extensive duty-free shopping. The author emphasizes the unique mix of cultural familiarity and disorienting global flow, creating a 'perfect limbo' that provides a space for personal reflection on one's journey. This travel piece frames the airport not just as a point of passage, but as a vibrant microcosm of global transit, offering unexpected moments of discovery and introspection.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Lowe's reported stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by increased demand for smaller home projects, despite a continued weakness in larger home improvement endeavors. The retailer announced a significant $8.8 billion acquisition of Foundation Building Materials, a major distributor for large residential and commercial professionals, as part of its strategy to bolster the steadier and more lucrative pro-customer segment. CEO Marvin Ellison expressed anticipation for a 'healthy pipeline of demand' ahead, citing the country's aging housing stock, homeowner equity gains, and pent-up project demand, which he believes will position Lowe's for accelerated sales growth when the market improves. Shares rose following the announcement, contrasting with rival Home Depot's recent earnings miss. (not investment advice)</p>

CEO Ernie Herrman expressed high confidence in the company's position heading into the second half of the year, noting a robust start to the third quarter. Despite anticipating higher costs from tariffs, TJX expects to offset these impacts, positioning itself to gain market share from traditional department stores.

          <p>Chinese toymaker Pop Mart saw its shares climb over 12% after announcing a nearly 400% surge in net profit for the first half of 2025, driven by booming global demand for its 'ugly-cute' Labubu dolls, popular with celebrities like Rihanna and Blackpink's Lisa. Revenue also jumped over 200%, significantly exceeding earlier forecasts. The company's CEO, Wang Ning, expressed strong confidence in hitting and potentially exceeding its 2025 revenue target of 20 billion yuan, even suggesting 30 billion yuan could be 'quite easy.' Despite concerns from some analysts about the long-term longevity of IP popularity and recent Chinese state media scrutiny over 'blind box' sales, the company's robust international growth, particularly in Asia-Pacific and the Americas, underscores its expanding global footprint.

          <p>Microsoft and the NFL have extended their multiyear partnership, aiming to enhance real-time game data and analysis for coaches and players through Microsoft Copilot and Azure artificial intelligence. The expanded deal involves equipping all 32 teams with over 2,500 custom-built Microsoft Surface Copilot tablets, significantly upgrading the existing sideline viewing system. AI will enable players and coaches to quickly filter vast amounts of data, improving decision-making during critical game moments without making the decisions themselves. Beyond game day, the partnership will integrate AI for broader club operations, including player scouting and salary cap management, and even for fan engagement through tools like the OnePass app. This collaboration seeks to elevate the gameday experience and deliver a more compelling product to fans and teams alike.</p>

          <p>The article provides an overview of current average mortgage and mortgage refinance interest rates as of August 20, 2025, noting that while rates are higher than a few years ago, favorable options are still accessible, particularly for individuals with strong credit scores.

The article offers practical advice for potential borrowers, emphasizing the importance of strengthening one's credit profile, diligently shopping around to compare different lenders, and carefully evaluating loan terms and associated fees. It also suggests that a potential pause in Federal Reserve rate hikes could lead to stabilization in mortgage rates, offering some relief to borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article details current average interest rates for Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) and home equity loans as of August 20, 2025, positioning them as relatively affordable borrowing options for homeowners with substantial equity, which currently averages over $300,000. Average rates are around 8.12% for HELOCs and 8.23% for 5-year home equity loans, significantly lower than alternatives like personal loans or credit cards. It explains the operational differences: home equity loans offer a lump sum with fixed rates, while HELOCs provide a revolving credit line with variable rates. Both products offer potential tax benefits if used for IRS-eligible home repairs and renovations. However, homeowners must carefully consider the risks, as their home serves as collateral, making it critical to choose the right product for their needs and budget. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The article outlines current Certificate of Deposit (CD) interest rates as of August 20, 2025, highlighting their value as a safe investment for saving money amidst persistent inflation, as they offer returns higher than the current inflation rate. While national average CD yields are low, top high-yield CDs offer significantly better returns, with some 6-month and 1-year CDs yielding over 4% APY. The article advises potential savers to look at online banks for the most competitive rates, attributing this to their lower overhead costs. It also suggests considering short-term CDs, which currently offer higher rates due to an inverted yield curve, and explains the strategy of 'laddering' CDs to effectively maximize long-term savings while taking advantage of these higher short-term yields.

To secure the best rates, the article advises choosing high-yield accounts, which are frequently offered by online banks due to their lower overhead costs, allowing them to pass savings onto consumers.

          <p>President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act' has expanded the eligible uses for 529 college savings plans, offering more flexibility for education-related expenses beyond traditional tuition. Now, funds can be used for vocational programs, professional licensing, continuing education, and K-12 expenses like tutoring and standardized test prep. Despite these expanded benefits, a Vanguard survey indicates only 10% of parents utilize 529 plans, with most still using traditional checking or savings accounts that offer significantly lower returns. The article also mentions 'Trump accounts' starting in 2026, a new investment option for children, but advises considering 529 plans first due to their immediate tax-free withdrawal benefits for education.

          <p>The article states the price of gold as $3,357.88 per ounce as of August 14, 2025, and delves into the numerous factors that influence its market value. Gold is highlighted as a traditional safe-haven asset and an effective hedge against inflation, historically retaining its value during periods of economic or market uncertainty. Key influencers on its spot price include the fundamental principles of supply and demand, prevailing global economic conditions, inflation rates, and interest rates, which have an inversely proportional relationship with gold prices. Geopolitical instability, currency movements, broader market sentiment, and the policies of central banks also play significant roles. The article underscores that while gold remains an attractive commodity, its price is subject to constant short-term fluctuations, making timing a crucial consideration for investors.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts are recommending that foods like pine nuts and goat's milk be added to mandatory food allergy warning labels in the UK and EU, citing frequently occurring and severe allergic reactions. An article in the journal Clinical & Experimental Allergy, based on a review of nearly 3,000 anaphylaxis cases reported in Europe, identified these and other emerging allergens such as buckwheat, peas, and lentils. The Food Standards Agency acknowledges the significant number of foods that can cause allergies and supports providing clear information to consumers. This proactive move aims to enhance consumer safety and provide clearer labeling, especially as new ingredients like pea protein become increasingly prevalent and sometimes unexpectedly found in various food products.</p>
