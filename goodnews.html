          <p>Eighty years after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the number of living survivors, or "hibakusha," is rapidly declining, with their average age now over 86. In response, a new generation is stepping up to ensure the first-person accounts of the nuclear attacks are not lost. Individuals like 12-year-old Shun Sasaki in Hiroshima are acting as "successors," sharing the detailed, harrowing stories of survivors with tourists and visitors. These efforts aim to convey the human reality of nuclear weapons and spread a message of peace to prevent future atrocities.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation has announced the planned closure of the state prison in Norco by fall 2026, citing a significant decline in the statewide inmate population and projected annual savings of $150 million. The facility, which currently houses nearly 2,800 inmates and employs 1,200 staff, will see its prisoners transferred to other institutions. The closure reflects a broader trend of falling crime rates and criminal justice reforms in California, raising questions about the future of the historic property, which was once a luxury resort.</p>

          <p>As China prepares its next five-year plan, economists are debating whether to include official, measurable targets for consumer spending to bolster the domestic economy. Proponents, like economist Chang Xiuze, argue that setting a benchmark for the "household consumption rate" could be a key national indicator to address what they see as a low 39.6% share of consumer spending in GDP. However, other influential thinkers express skepticism, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible or effective as formal policy goals for the world's second-largest economy.

          <p>After a challenging start to his MLB career and a subsequent shoulder injury, Dodgers rookie pitcher Roki Sasaki is showing promising signs of a turnaround. The highly anticipated Japanese phenom has been progressing in his throwing program, with improved velocity and the addition of a new two-seam fastball. While his initial performance was underwhelming, the Dodgers are hopeful that his time on the injured list has allowed for a mechanical reset and that he could become a valuable contributor, either as a starter or reliever, for their postseason push.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked the Trump administration from reallocating over $4 billion in FEMA disaster mitigation funds, siding with 20 states that sued to protect the program. The judge ruled that transferring the money from the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program could cause "irreparable harm" to communities vulnerable to natural disasters. The administration had sought to end the program, calling it "wasteful," but the court found it was not convinced that Congress intended for the congressionally-allocated funds to be repurposed.</p>

          <p>After 17 years of delays, a major copper mining project in Afghanistan, backed by China's state-owned MCC, is reportedly making significant progress towards beginning extraction this year. The Mes Aynak mine, which sits on one of the world's largest copper deposits, has been stalled since 2008 due to security issues, archaeological concerns, and a lack of infrastructure. The Taliban's recent decision to switch to more costly underground mining is seen as a move to protect ancient Buddhist relics at the site, potentially clearing a major hurdle for the long-awaited project.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category in 2024, including a notable 14.9% drop in murder and a 4.5% overall reduction in violent crime. Property crime also fell, with motor vehicle thefts experiencing a record 18.6% one-year decline, though the rate remains higher than pre-pandemic levels. While experts note the positive trend, they also point out that aggravated assaults are still stubbornly high and that hate crimes remain a significant issue, with many incidents going unreported.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The court ruled that while the president could pause access to the asylum system, the government could not ignore other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they face persecution or torture. This move effectively reopens pathways for humanitarian claims at the border, halting a key administration policy credited with a dramatic drop in illegal crossings.</p>
