          <p>English cricket legend James Anderson is expected to sign a contract extension with Lancashire, continuing his professional career beyond his 44th birthday into the 2026 season. After retiring from international cricket in 2024, Anderson agreed to a one-year deal for 2025 and demonstrated impressive form, particularly in T20 cricket. His performance, which included taking 20 wickets for Lancashire and earning a deal in The Hundred franchise competition, has prompted the new extension. This agreement will stretch his professional career to a remarkable 25 years since his debut for the club in 2001.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) announced a record-breaking third-quarter profit, with net income surging 39.1% from the previous year to beat analyst expectations. The impressive results were largely fueled by sustained high demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. Citing the strength of the AI market, TSMC's CEO raised the company's 2025 revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range and increased its planned capital expenditure. The company's most advanced 3nm and 5nm chip technologies were significant drivers of the revenue gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Melissa Tran, a Maryland mother of five and business owner, has been released from federal custody after being detained by ICE for over five months. Her detention stemmed from a non-violent theft conviction that occurred two decades ago when she was a teenager. Tran, who came to the U.S. legally as a refugee from Vietnam, had been checking in with immigration authorities annually for over 20 years before she was unexpectedly detained this year. A federal judge ordered her release, finding her continued detention unnecessary, but she still faces the possibility of deportation as her immigration case continues.</p>

          <p>United Airlines reported third-quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street expectations and issued an optimistic profit forecast for the fourth quarter. The carrier anticipates earning between $3.00 and $3.50 per share, well above analysts' projections. This positive outlook comes despite third-quarter revenue falling slightly short of estimates, influenced by a glut of flight capacity that has weighed on fares this year. CEO Scott Kirby attributed the company's resilience to long-term investments in its network, technology, and premium services, which have helped attract and retain loyal, higher-paying customers.

          <h2>Study Finds Most Heirs Do Not Retain Their Parents' Financial Advisors</h2>

          <p>A recent report from Cerulli Associates reveals that only a small fraction of beneficiaries plan to continue using their parents' wealth advisors after receiving an inheritance. The survey found that just 27% of future heirs intend to keep the same advisor, with the primary reason for switching being that they already have an established relationship with their own financial planner. The study, which surveyed investors with at least $250,000 in assets, also noted that most benefactors are ambivalent about whether their heirs retain their advisor. This trend highlights a challenge for advisors in building relationships with the next generation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge in San Francisco has issued a temporary halt to the Trump administration's plans for a new wave of layoffs affecting the federal workforce amid the ongoing government shutdown. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from federal worker unions, who argue the administration is illegally using the shutdown to implement politically motivated staff reductions. The judge expressed a belief that the layoffs are likely illegal. This legal intervention provides a temporary reprieve for federal employees as the shutdown extends beyond the two-week mark, causing disruption and uncertainty across government agencies.</p>
