          <p>A psychologist specializing in couples identifies the top five recurring conflict areas in relationships: tone of voice/attitude, family relations, household chores, communication styles, and money. Contempt, signaled through tone, is a key predictor of divorce, requiring partners to resist striking back and name the effect instead. Family relation arguments often reflect misalignments and unmet needs, necessitating reassurance and discussions about limits. Uneven distribution of household chores reveals an unacknowledged "invisible load," requiring open acknowledgment and redistribution of tasks. Ineffective communication styles lead to spiraling arguments, which can be avoided using the "five-second rule."</p>
