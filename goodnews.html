        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A four-year-old wedding mystery in South Ayrshire has been solved, revealing the identity of a man who appeared in Michelle and John Wylie's wedding photos as a complete stranger. Andrew Hillhouse, the unexpected guest, mistakenly arrived at their venue, believing it was another wedding two miles away. He realized his error only when the bride walked down the aisle but felt unable to discreetly leave, even posing for group pictures while trying to "hunch down." This amusing mix-up, caused by his partner providing the wrong location, became a persistent puzzle for the couple until an internet sleuth finally identified Hillhouse, who recounted his mortifying experience of trying to blend in despite his towering height. He eventually made it to the correct wedding, where his mishap became a humorous tale.</p>

          <p>Football legend Wayne Rooney discussed his most memorable Manchester derby moments on his BBC podcast, including Manchester City's dominant 6-1 victory over United in 2011, which he described as a "horrible" and statement-making defeat. Rooney revealed the awkward situation of having to host his birthday party that same night, attended by several Manchester City players, admitting he should have cancelled it. He also reminisced about his iconic overhead kick goal in 2011, surprisingly stating he played "so bad" in that game despite the spectacular finish. Additionally, the article touches upon the unique pressures faced by children of famous footballers, like Rooney's son Kai, highlighting the intense public scrutiny they endure.</p>

          <p>The BBC has launched an interactive tool titled "Cooler Than Me?" that allows users to compare their current local weather forecast with conditions in various cities across the world. This engaging feature taps into Britain's long-standing national pastime of discussing and complaining about the weather, offering a playful yet informative way to determine if the sun truly shines brighter in other locations. The tool aims to provide a unique and personalized perspective on global climate patterns and forecasts, inviting users to engage with meteorological data in a fun and accessible format. It leverages the comprehensive data available on the BBC Weather website to deliver these comparisons, potentially inspiring users to become "star meteorologists."</p>

          <p>New UK Housing Secretary Steve Reed has reaffirmed the government's "absolute commitment" to building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2029, a central Labour manifesto pledge for the next Parliament. Reed, who took over the housing brief following Angela Rayner's resignation, stressed a "build baby build" philosophy and warned of potential sanctions for developers delaying construction, though specific penalties were not detailed. Industry leaders, however, caution that this target presents a "huge challenge" amidst mounting pressures like rising material costs and processing delays for planning applications. The article also notes Reed's exploration of various options to house asylum seekers without exacerbating existing housing market pressures, and his personal connection to Rayner's "painful" resignation.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Sparks concluded their WNBA season with a significant 103-75 blowout loss to the Las Vegas Aces, failing to achieve a winning record or derail the Aces' impressive 15-game winning streak. The Aces, spearheaded by A’ja Wilson's dominant performance of 23 points and 19 rebounds, also set a WNBA regular-season record with 22 three-pointers, showcasing their offensive prowess. The Sparks, already short-handed, struggled to contain the Aces' scoring, a challenge further exacerbated by an injury to Cameron Brink, who left the game with a nose injury. Despite valiant efforts from former Aces players Dearica Hamby and Kelsey Plum, the talent disparity was stark, marking a disappointing end to the season for the Los Angeles team.</p>

          <p>China has emerged as the leading foreign investor in Thailand's state-fostered Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC), committing a substantial US$8.4 billion between 2019 and 2024. This significant investment accounts for 16% of all projects within the three-province cluster, encompassing participation in a 220km high-speed railway line, plans for an "aerotropolis," and potential property development. Notably, only Thailand itself has invested more in the corridor, with Japan ranking third. This substantial Chinese involvement underscores Beijing's strategic interest in Southeast Asian infrastructure and economic integration, particularly as part of its broader Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to enhance regional connectivity and economic ties, even as the railway project, initiated seven years ago, faced suspensions during the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

          <p>California's Assembly has passed Senate Bill 79, a controversial housing bill designed to override local zoning laws and expand high-density housing near public transit hubs. Introduced by Sen. Scott Wiener, the legislation permits buildings up to nine stories adjacent to certain transit stops, and up to six stories within a half-mile, directly impacting single-family neighborhoods. Supporters argue these drastic measures are essential to address the state's severe housing affordability crisis, while critics, including the Los Angeles City Council, condemn it as an overreach that diminishes local authorities' ability to manage growth. The bill gained crucial momentum after amendments secured support from a powerful labor group, and it now awaits a final Senate concurrence vote and Governor Gavin Newsom's signature to become law.</p>

It argues that the multilateral system, including the United Nations, is faltering due to a rise in unilateral actions, escalating trade wars, and the increasing marginalization of the Global South in decision-making processes. The article suggests that the SCO, by embodying principles of cooperation among countries with diverse cultures, ideologies, and political systems, provides a vital platform for negotiation and reform. It contends that the SCO can effectively counteract the dangerous trend of fragmentation, where tariffs and sanctions frequently replace diplomatic dialogue, thereby playing a critical role in safeguarding international law and fostering global stability and cooperation.</p>

          <p>Child and baby nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed offers five expert tips to help parents manage fussy eating, a common developmental phase affecting over half of children, emphasizing that parents should not blame themselves. She advises prioritizing enjoyment at mealtimes to shift negative associations. Key strategies include allowing children autonomy in choosing what they want to eat and when to leave the table, avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad" to foster a healthy relationship with food, and being mindful of their naturally fluctuating appetites. Additionally, involving children in food preparation and exposing them to a wide range of quick, nutrient-dense foods can build familiarity and encourage more adventurous eating habits. Consulting a GP is recommended for persistent concerns or suspected sensory issues.</p>

While the article praises Sheeran's genuine efforts to immerse himself in new cultures, even traveling to India to learn Punjabi lyrics, it critiques the album for largely assimilating these diverse influences into his signature "frictionless pop," rather than boldly transforming his sound. Despite some adventurous tracks like "Don't Look Down," much of the album retreats to safer, familiar ground, yet it is still expected to appeal to his vast global fanbase.</p>

UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting confirms that policymakers are incorporating aspects of this Danish model into a new long-term cancer plan for England.
