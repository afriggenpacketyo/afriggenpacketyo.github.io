          <p>Medication abortion, involving pills like misoprostol and mifepristone, has become increasingly common, comprising 63% of all abortions in the U.S. Despite stringent regulations, self-managed medication abortion, where individuals obtain and use abortion pills without direct doctor supervision, is gaining acceptance. Research suggests that many traditional safety measures may not be necessary for all patients, and telehealth prescriptions have increased access. However, legal challenges persist, with some states attempting to restrict access to mifepristone and providers facing lawsuits.</p>

          <p>The second China-Central Asia Summit in Kazakhstan showcased Beijing's efforts to strengthen economic and political ties with the region. Agreements worth nearly $25 billion were signed between China and regional partners.

While the EU and Russia also have interests in the region, these developments suggest that China's influence in Central Asia is set to grow.</p>

          <p>Voting is currently taking place in the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, viewed as an indicator for the upcoming House of Councillors race.

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the murder of her husband, Bob, was overturned after she spent nearly two decades in prison. New evidence, including DNA testing, revealed that some blood evidence used against her at trial was either not blood or did not belong to her husband. Loyola Project for the Innocent helped uncover these inconsistencies, leading to the overturning of her conviction. Although she was temporarily released due to COVID-19 concerns, the district attorney initially sought to retry her before eventually dropping the charges, she is now working to rebuild her life.</p>

          <p>Two Chinese studies suggest that the spleen could be transformed into a hub for treating diabetes through cell transplantation. Researchers at Nanjing University found that shielding islet cells could improve their survival after being transplanted into the spleen to treat type 1 diabetes. They also found that nanoparticles could help engineer the spleen into a more promising long-term survival site compared to the liver. The scientists believe that the spleen could be an ideal organ for islet transplantation if systematic clinical studies demonstrate its safety and effectiveness.</p>
