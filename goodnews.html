        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank has set the yuan's daily fixing rate against the US dollar at its strongest level in over two months. This decision comes as the US dollar index has fallen to a three-year low due to expectations of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Concerns over US tariff policies and debt sustainability have also contributed to the dollar's weakness, lending relative strength to the yuan. While a recent agreement "in principle" between China and the US signaled a potential trade truce, some analysts remain cautious. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Economists argue that the recent decline in "white collar" jobs is primarily due to structural issues within the economy, rather than artificial intelligence replacing human workers. While professional and business services have experienced a slowdown in hiring, industries like health care and construction are seeing job growth. Experts emphasize that AI technology is still in its early stages and cannot yet execute key skills without human intervention. Despite the current limited impact, economists acknowledge that AI could transform jobs in the future, noting the rise in consulting roles focused on implementing generative AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite rising tensions and Israeli strikes on Iran, analysts believe that Tehran is unlikely to retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a vital oil artery. Blocking the strait would disrupt global oil flows, but experts argue it would be counterproductive for Iran, potentially triggering further retaliation and alienating its largest oil customer, China. The Strait of Hormuz, partly controlled by Oman, is wide enough that Iran cannot close it entirely, and any attempt to do so would be a "last resort" contingent on a direct military engagement with the US.</p>

          <p>George Monbiot discusses David Attenborough's new film, "Ocean," which bluntly reveals the plunder of our seas, primarily caused by the fishing industry. He welcomes the government's announcement of a ban on trawling and scallop dredging in half of England's Marine Protected Areas but argues that this should be the bare minimum. He suggests that the default position should be protection, allowing only limited fishing activities in specific areas managed by local communities. Monbiot emphasizes that fish are wildlife, not merely "seafood," and calls for an end to government subsidies for the destructive fishing industry.</p>
