          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has seen the value of its holdings in five major Japanese trading houses—Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Sumitomo—surpass $30 billion. This represents a nearly 400% increase from the initial investment of approximately $6.3 billion revealed in August 2020. Berkshire has been actively increasing its stakes, with recent disclosures showing its ownership in Mitsui and Mitsubishi has risen above 10%. Buffett has expressed long-term commitment to these investments, citing their attractive valuation when he first purchased them and signaling continued confidence in their performance.

          <p>The Seattle Mariners have advanced to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 24 years after defeating the Detroit Tigers 3-2 in a grueling 15-inning contest. The game, which lasted over five hours, now stands as the longest winner-take-all game in Major League Baseball history. The decisive moment came when Jorge Polanco hit a bases-loaded single in the top of the 15th inning, breaking a lengthy scoreless stalemate. The Mariners will now face the Toronto Blue Jays for the American League pennant, a matchup that guarantees a team will reach the World Series for the first time in decades.</p>

          <p>Plaid Cymru, a political party in Wales, has announced a plan to offer trainee teachers up to £30,000 in incentive payments if they commit to working in the country for five years. The proposal, revealed at the party's annual conference, aims to address a teacher recruitment crisis by matching financial incentives offered in England by 2030. The policy would prioritize teachers in high-demand subjects like math and science, as well as those who can teach in the Welsh medium. The party estimates the plan would cost between £6-£7 million, funded from money already allocated for curriculum support.</p>

          <h2>Julia Roberts Reflects on Building Resilience Against Harsh Career Criticism</h2>

          <p>Academy Award-winning actress Julia Roberts recently shared that she struggled with a lack of confidence early in her career due to harsh and cruel criticism. In an interview, Roberts explained that instead of letting insecurity cripple her, she viewed navigating the harshness of the industry as a challenge to define the person she wanted to become. She now sees those early hurdles as valuable lessons that proved her endurance and for which she is grateful. Career coaches note that building resilience is crucial, advising individuals to create distance from criticism and focus on their own value, while also reflecting on any useful feedback that may be present.</p>

          <p>Humanity is on track to produce more grain than ever before, marking a significant achievement in the long-term fight against hunger. Advances in agriculture, including the Green Revolution, synthetic fertilizers, and improved irrigation, have tripled cereal yields since 1961, making catastrophic, crop-failure-driven famines far rarer than in the past. However, challenges remain, as billions still cannot afford a healthy diet, and modern famines are now primarily caused by political failures, such as conflict and restricted access to aid. While climate change and trade restrictions pose future threats, the overall trend reflects remarkable progress in global food security.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Choate, a 27-year-old woman, experienced a rare and life-threatening childbirth complication known as an amniotic fluid embolism, which caused her heart to stop during labor. The condition, which occurs in about 1 in 40,000 U.S. births, happens when amniotic fluid enters the mother's bloodstream, leading to catastrophic organ failure. Thanks to the quick actions of her medical team at the University of Maryland Baltimore Washington Medical Center, Choate was resuscitated, and her daughter was delivered safely via C-section. Despite the high mortality rate associated with the condition, both mother and baby survived without long-term medical complications.</p>

          <p>OpenAI is demonstrating a level of market dominance and vertical integration that is unprecedented even for Silicon Valley, causing both excitement and anxiety among entrepreneurs and venture capitalists. The company is investing aggressively across the entire tech stack, from data center infrastructure to consumer apps and hardware, leaving startups to question where they can compete. Unlike previous tech giants, OpenAI is privately held, allowing it to spend vast sums of capital without public scrutiny. While this rapid growth is creating a "gold rush mentality," it is also making the startup ecosystem more opaque and challenging to navigate.</p>
