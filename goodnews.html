          <h2>Disney CEO Bob Iger Highlights Growth Potential Following Full Hulu Acquisition</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Disney CEO Bob Iger believes that taking full control of Hulu will unlock significant growth opportunities for the company, particularly in its streaming business. Disney finalized the acquisition of NBCUniversal's stake in Hulu for an additional $438.7 million, resolving a long-standing dispute over valuation. Iger emphasizes the importance of bundling Hulu with Disney+ and ESPN+ to enhance user experience, reduce churn, and increase advertising opportunities. The integration of Hulu's content library with Disney's existing offerings is expected to strengthen Disney's direct-to-consumer strategy and drive long-term revenue and profits, while the theme park business is also a resilient category even in an uncertain economy.

          <p>Starbucks is set to pilot a generative AI assistant, "Green Dot Assist," powered by Microsoft Azure's OpenAI platform, in 35 locations to streamline barista tasks and enhance service speed. The aim is to simplify operations and make jobs easier for baristas, potentially reducing order times to four minutes. The AI assistant will provide quick answers to barista questions, ranging from drink recipes to equipment troubleshooting, accessible via tablet. Future iterations may include automated IT ticketing and shift coverage suggestions, though accuracy is a key consideration, and the company's partnership with Microsoft includes a grounding engine to ensure information reliability. This initiative is part of Starbucks' broader strategy to improve efficiency and customer experience.</p>

          <p>The movie *Ballerina*, a spin-off from the *John Wick* series, initially struggles to capture the essence of the original films, but eventually finds its footing by expanding the *John Wick* universe. The story follows Eve Macarro (Ana de Armas) as she seeks revenge for her father's murder, training to become an assassin. The film initially suffers from generic plot elements, but it succeeds when it delves into the bizarre and darkly cartoonish world that made the *John Wick* series so popular. The movie features inventive stunts and a sense of humor that pays homage to the action filmmaking of Buster Keaton and Looney Tunes.</p>
