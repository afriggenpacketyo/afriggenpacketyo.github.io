          <p>Jing Xudong, a former head of technology and research at Shell and a fellow of Britain’s Royal Academy of Engineering, has left the UK to join Nanjing University in China. He will lead a new team focused on developing carbon capture, storage, and monitoring technologies, aiming to create "cleaner" oil solutions. Jing, who also served as an adjunct professor at Imperial College London, has had a distinguished international career with Shell, working in various countries. His move signifies a notable shift of high-level engineering talent to China to work on environmental technology.</p>

          <p>Adelita Grijalva has won the Democratic primary for Arizona's 7th Congressional District, a seat previously held for over two decades by her late father, Rep. Raúl Grijalva. She will face Republican nominee Daniel Butierez in a special general election in September for the deep-blue district. Grijalva, a progressive, ran on a platform of protecting democracy, immigrant rights, and social safety nets, securing high-profile endorsements from figures like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders. The outcome of this election will not shift control of the House but will fill one of three vacancies in heavily Democratic districts.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced over $90 billion in new private-sector investments for Pennsylvania during a summit at Carnegie Mellon University, aimed at developing a new artificial intelligence economy. The plan involves 20 leading companies and includes building energy-intensive data centers for AI and an energy innovation training center in Pittsburgh. The initiative, championed by Sen. Dave McCormick, seeks to leverage the state's natural gas and nuclear resources to power technological growth and create tens of thousands of jobs. The announcement was met with protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and corporate interests.</p>

          <p>During a supply chain expo in Beijing, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that artificial intelligence and robotics will replace human labor in factories within the next ten years, particularly for repetitive and hazardous tasks. He described AI as a fundamental infrastructure, comparable to electricity or the internet, that is revolutionizing supply chains. Huang also noted that hundreds of projects in China are already using Nvidia's Omniverse platform to create "digital twins" for designing and optimizing factories and warehouses. His visit coincides with Nvidia preparing to resume shipments of its specialized H20 chips to China.</p>

          <p>President Trump is expected to sign an executive order to create national standards for the Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) program, which allows college athletes to earn money. This move follows the rapid and often chaotic transformation of college athletics since the NCAA relaxed its compensation rules in 2021. The executive action would address the patchwork of state laws currently governing NIL and comes as a House subcommittee advanced a related bill, the "SCORE Act." The White House aims to bring federal oversight to an issue that has significantly commercialized college sports and generated debate over athlete protection and competitive balance.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced a preliminary trade agreement with Indonesia, stating it includes a 19% tariff on Indonesian goods imported into the U.S. and a commitment from Indonesia to purchase billions in American products. According to Trump, the deal involves Indonesia buying $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in agricultural goods, and 50 Boeing jets, while the U.S. would gain tariff-free access to Indonesian markets. However, officials in Jakarta have not yet confirmed these terms, echoing a similar situation with a recent trade deal announcement concerning Vietnam that faced pushback. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of 13 House Republicans who initially voted to block several cryptocurrency regulation bills reversed their position after a meeting with President Trump. The legislation, including the GENIUS Act for stablecoins, had failed a key procedural vote earlier in the day, marking a rare but temporary defiance of the president's wishes. Following the Oval Office discussion, Trump announced that the holdouts had agreed to support the bills, allowing them to advance. The event, occurring during a "Crypto Week" promoted by the White House, highlights the administration's push to establish the U.S. as a leader in digital assets. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Pentagon has announced that 2,000 California National Guard members will be released from federal duty in Los Angeles, a month after they were deployed to respond to protests against ICE. The administration stated the move was possible because "the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding." The initial deployment, which was made over the objections of Governor Gavin Newsom, led to a legal battle over presidential authority. Newsom has called for the remaining 2,000 troops to also be returned to state control, stating they have been used as "political pawns."</p>

          <p>As the House considers the GENIUS Act, this article explains the function and significance of stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to a stable asset like the U.S. dollar. The bill aims to create a regulatory framework for the $250 billion market, establishing consumer protections and clear rules for issuers like banks and fintech companies. Proponents argue that regulated stablecoins could facilitate faster, cheaper financial transactions, while critics note risks such as the potential for the currency to "depeg" from its asset.

Xi spoke out against rising unilateralism and protectionism, stating that China opposes "building walls and barriers" and rejects "unilateral sanctions and maximum pressure."

This encouragement follows a 2015 change that expanded law-drafting authority to hundreds of Chinese cities.

          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from domestic mines instead of on the international market. According to the World Gold Council, this strategy allows them to purchase the metal in local currency, preserving foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. It is also often cheaper and supports the local mining industry. This trend is driven by soaring gold prices and a desire among nations to bolster their reserves as a hedge against geopolitical and financial risks. (not investment advice)</p>

His conviction was vacated in 2021 after efforts from the California Innocence Project and the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit, and he was declared factually innocent in 2022.

          <p>The world-famous Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for an ambitious five-year, £50 million renovation. The project is necessary to repair the 175-year-old iron-and-glass structure, which has been damaged by the hot, humid conditions required for its indoor tropical rainforest. The renovation will involve replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the ironwork, and moving 1,300 plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. A key goal of the project is to make the building net-zero by replacing its gas boilers with modern heat pumps.</p>
