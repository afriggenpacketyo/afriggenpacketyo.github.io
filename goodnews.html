          <p>Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to South Korea is viewed by experts as a carefully orchestrated step towards mending strained ties, despite limited expectations for immediate breakthroughs. His last visit in 2014 led to a free-trade agreement, but subsequent events, including Beijing's omission of "denuclearisation" from a joint statement, raised doubts about arms reduction. This current trip aims to symbolically restart dialogue and rebuild trust between the two nations. The article suggests a cautious optimism for diplomatic progress.</p>

          <p>A mysterious sea otter in Santa Cruz has resumed its behavior of harassing surfers and stealing their boards, two years after a similar otter, known as 841, gained international attention for the same antics. The identity of the current otter is unclear, as it lacks the flipper tag that identified 841, though experts suggest it could be the same animal or a relative. The article describes the otter actively pursuing surfers daily, with one recent incident involving a bite and a stolen board. Federal wildlife officials previously attempted to capture 841 without success.</p>

          <p>The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose at an annual rate of 3% in September, slightly below economists' forecasts, indicating inflation continued to climb but at a cooler pace. This article highlights that the Trump administration's tariffs are contributing to upward price pressure, with businesses passing on some costs to consumers. The Labor Department released this data despite the government shutdown, as it's crucial for Social Security adjustments. The report complicates the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions, balancing rising inflation with a slowing job market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As clocks go back and winter nights lengthen, particularly in northern Scotland, over a million people in the UK experience symptoms of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD). This article explains SAD as recurring seasonal depression linked to reduced daylight, causing low mood, irritability, and lack of energy.

          <p>A group of UK MPs on the Treasury Select Committee has strongly advised Chancellor Rachel Reeves against cutting the cash ISA tax-free allowance in the upcoming Budget. They argue such cuts are unlikely to foster an investment culture and would face opposition from banks and consumers. The article notes Reeves is considering tax rises or spending cuts to address a £22bn budget shortfall, with previous plans to reduce the cash ISA limit to £10,000 having been put on hold. The committee emphasized that while promoting investment is good, this is not the right time for such a measure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A quiet shift is occurring in driving preferences, with one in three UK cars now automatic, driven by the impending 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars. This article explores the dilemma for new drivers choosing between learning in a manual or automatic, noting that an automatic-only license restricts future driving options. Challenges include a scarcity of automatic instructors and higher lesson costs, despite a common misconception that automatic tests are easier. The evolving market suggests a future where automatic, particularly electric, vehicles will dominate.</p>
