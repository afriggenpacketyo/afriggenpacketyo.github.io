          <p>In a 4-4 deadlock, the Supreme Court upheld a lower court's decision, preventing Oklahoma from establishing the nation's first taxpayer-funded religious charter school. Justice Amy Coney Barrett recused herself from the case, resulting in the split decision. The proposed St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School, intended to integrate Catholic teachings into its curriculum, faced opposition from public school advocates who feared disruptions to education systems nationwide. This ruling leaves the broader issue of state-sponsored religious charter schools unresolved at the federal level, paving the way for future legal challenges. </p>
