          <p>High-end jewellery houses such as G√ºbelin, Annoushka, and Kia Schwan are crafting pieces with hidden details that transform them into symbols of meaning and memory. G√ºbelin integrates rubies into concealed areas of their designs, while Annoushka's Touch Wood collection subtly embeds ebony for protection and hope. Designers are also incorporating personal elements like hair into lockets and pendants, creating intimate connections between the wearer and the jewellery. These subtle details offer wearers a private connection to their jewellery, turning each piece into a tangible extension of a memory or moment from the past.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's industrial profits grew for the second consecutive month in April, climbing 3% year-on-year, despite U.S. tariffs and deflationary pressures. The growth was bolstered by stronger earnings in equipment and high-tech manufacturing sectors, with profits in the high-tech manufacturing industry climbing 9% from January to April. A government scheme subsidizing consumers who trade in old electronics also boosted household appliance manufacturers' profits by over 15%. While some sectors faced headwinds, such as the automobile and apparel industries, statisticians attributed the overall improved profitability to the industrial sectors' resilience and ability to withstand shocks.

          <p>Gold prices have surged this year as investors seek safe investments amid economic uncertainty caused by U.S. tariff policies, but economists say central banks' purchases are also a significant factor. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, central banks have increased their gold purchases fivefold, signaling a turning point in how they view gold. Countries are also experimenting with gold-backed digital assets to bypass the dollar-denominated financial system, which some nations are using to evade sanctions or counter U.S. national security interests.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has decided to allocate 388.1 billion yen ($2.7 billion) from reserve funds to subsidize energy bills for households and businesses during the summer, aiming to counter the economic impact of hefty U.S. tariffs. The subsidies are projected to cut household energy bills by 1,040 yen in July and September, and by 1,260 yen in August. Critics claim the measures are intended to build support for the government ahead of the House of Councillors election, as approval ratings for Prime Minister Ishiba's Cabinet have declined.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer expressed optimism for the upcoming trading week, citing positive developments such as the extension of the tariff deadline with the European Union. He also noted the potential for fast-tracked trade agreements with the EU and Japan. Cramer pointed to low expectations for Nvidia's upcoming report, a low-risk S&P Oscillator, and signs that President Trump is reevaluating his relationship with Russia. He recommended buying Capital One and TJX, expressing conviction that they are undervalued, and suggested Disney as a worthwhile investment.</p>
