          <p>After 74 years of planning and scientific expeditions, China has officially launched the Yarlung Tsangpo River hydropower project in Tibet. The groundbreaking ceremony marked the start of the world's most ambitious dam project, which is designed to have a power capacity three times that of the Three Gorges Dam. The project's announcement by Premier Li Qiang represents the culmination of decades of research that began with the first comprehensive scientific survey of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1951. The dam is a monumental engineering feat with significant geopolitical and environmental implications.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: US-EU Tariff Agreement Represents a Major Win for Trump but Not a Complete Loss for Brussels</h2>

          <p>The new framework trade deal between the U.S. and the European Union is being framed as a significant victory for President Donald Trump, yet it also contains consolations for the EU. While the agreed-upon 15% U.S. tariff is a major concession from Brussels, it is lower than the 30% that was threatened and provides stability for key European exports like cars and pharmaceuticals. The EU's decision to accept the terms reflects the economic pressures of sluggish growth and the strategic importance of its security relationship with the U.S. The deal removes immediate uncertainty, a price the EU was ultimately willing to pay.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully shut down four dark web sites dedicated to child sexual abuse material, convicting at least 18 individuals in what is being called a highly successful operation. Dubbed "Operation Grayskull," the investigation targeted a network with over 120,000 members that shared millions of illicit files. Among those convicted was William Spearman, a lead administrator described as one of the world's most significant purveyors of such material, who received a life sentence. The takedown marks a major victory for law enforcement in combating sophisticated online child exploitation rings.</p>

          <p>The Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen has introduced new rules mandating leniency for researchers and companies whose state-funded innovation projects fail to meet their goals. The policy states that innovators should not be punished or held accountable for failures if there was no misconduct and reasonable efforts were made to correct errors. This applies to projects stalled by technical hurdles or made unviable by market shifts. The move is designed to encourage bold exploration and risk-taking, fostering an environment where researchers can pursue significant scientific breakthroughs without fear of failure.</p>

          <p>Emo icons My Chemical Romance are performing their seminal 2006 album, "The Black Parade," in its entirety on their first-ever stadium tour, which recently stopped at Dodger Stadium. The tour's success reflects a broader resurgence in rock music and the band's enduring influence on a generation of artists with their blend of theatricality, emotional honesty, and gender-fluid expression. The concert featured the full concept album, presented as a satirical take on political authoritarianism, before the band played a set of other fan favorites. The performance solidified their status as a band that has reached a new career peak deep into their reunion.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen have announced a major trade deal, averting a potential trade war just before a U.S. deadline. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the U.S., which is half the threatened rate but higher than previous levels. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to investing hundreds of billions of dollars in the U.S., including significant purchases of American energy and military equipment. The agreement brings a measure of stability to the massive transatlantic trade relationship, though some key sectors like steel still face high tariffs.</p>
