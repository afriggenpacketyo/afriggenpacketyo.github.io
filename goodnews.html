          <p>A 19-year-old in Chino Hills, California, successfully defended herself against an attempted robbery by throwing her freshly purchased tea at an attacker. The suspect, a 29-year-old man, allegedly brandished a knife and demanded the teenager's beverage before she reacted by flinging the drink at him, creating an opportunity to escape and call for help. San Bernardino County sheriff’s deputies arrived at the shopping center and arrested the man shortly after the incident. Authorities reported that no one was injured during the unusual confrontation.</p>

          <p>Eric Trump has announced the launch of American Bitcoin Corp. (ABTC), a new hybrid crypto mining and treasury firm, while promoting Bitcoin as a secure, global hedge comparable to "modern-day gold." Speaking about the new venture, he highlighted growing institutional adoption and framed the cryptocurrency as a generational asset. The move into the crypto space was partly motivated by the Trump family's experiences with being debanked by traditional financial institutions, which he said exposed the system's vulnerabilities. The article notes that Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr. collectively hold nearly 20% of ABTC shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to announce its first interest rate cut of 2025 this week, a decision being closely watched amid conflicting economic signals and political pressure. While slowing job growth suggests a need for a rate cut to stimulate the economy, inflation has been gradually rising, partly due to the Trump administration's tariffs, which argues for keeping rates steady. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has emphasized that the decision will be based on economic data rather than political influence, as the committee weighs its dual mandate of maintaining low inflation and ensuring full employment.

          <p>This appreciation piece reflects on the career of actor and director Robert Redford, who passed away at 89, highlighting his deliberate choice to pursue complex roles over simpler, conventional leading man parts. Despite his classic Hollywood good looks, Redford consistently rejected easy, feel-good characters in favor of portraying flawed, selfish, or tragic figures in films like "Downhill Racer" and "The Candidate." The article argues that he used his all-American appeal as a Trojan horse to explore and critique the nation's self-image, leaving a legacy defined by both the iconic roles he played and the simplistic ones he turned down.</p>

          <p>Five partially built, abandoned homes in Los Angeles's Laurel Canyon neighborhood are set to be demolished after a legal battle spanning over two decades. The Los Angeles City Attorney's office announced a plea agreement with the property's developers, who had faced criminal charges for failing to comply with a demolition order first issued in 2003. The structures, originally part of a larger development halted in 2002, have been described by officials as dangerous and dilapidated. The owners must demolish the homes by August 2026 to avoid further penalties.</p>

Cramer noted that the entire banking sector has been performing well, with financial stocks seeing both their earnings and their price-to-earnings multiples expand, a trend he believes is a positive sign for the broader market.

          <p>New data from the UK's Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency reveals a significant shift in driving habits, with one in four driving tests now being conducted in automatic cars. This represents a substantial increase from just over 6% a decade ago. The trend is largely attributed to the growing popularity of electric vehicles, which do not have manual gearboxes, and the upcoming 2030 ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars. Driving instructors note that automatics can be easier for learners, allowing them to focus more on the road.</p>

          <p>Under manager Thomas Frank, Tottenham Hotspur has shifted from an attack-focused strategy to a more pragmatic, defensive approach, resulting in four clean sheets in their first five games this season. This new "clean sheet mentality" was evident in their 1-0 Champions League victory against Villarreal, where Spurs successfully prevented the opposition from registering a single shot on target. While the cautious style is a stark contrast to the more free-flowing football of the previous season, players and the manager have highlighted the effectiveness of their solid defensive structure.</p>

Speaking at a conference, Bettman acknowledged past issues with Olympic participation, including a lack of control and promotional rights for the league. However, a new agreement with the IOC and the strong desire of the players to compete for their countries on the world's biggest stage ultimately convinced the league that the benefits of returning outweighed the difficulties of a mid-season shutdown.</p>

Harris noted that new rules allowing private equity firms to take minority stakes offer a better way for teams to raise capital while maintaining the long-term perspective necessary for success.
