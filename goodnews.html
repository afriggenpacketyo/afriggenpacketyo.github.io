        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a notable achievement driven by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and demands from the United States. However, a new NATO report indicates that only three members—Poland, Lithuania, and Latvia—are currently fulfilling the more ambitious new goal of 3.5% of GDP. The United States itself is set to spend 3.22%. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but stressed the critical need to translate these financial commitments into genuine military capabilities for effective deterrence. This marks a shift for previously lagging countries like Spain, Italy, and Belgium.</p>

          <p>Members of Congress, including Representatives Hillary Scholten and Tim Burchett, are vocal about their persistent safety concerns, as threats against the legislative body soared to nearly 9,500 in 2024. In a direct response to this alarming trend, Capitol Hill has initiated a new pilot program, providing lawmakers with up to $20,000 for home security upgrades and a monthly allowance of $5,000 for personal security personnel. This crucial measure follows recent high-profile incidents of political violence, such as an assassination attempt on former President Trump and tragic shootings involving Minnesota lawmakers. The program underscores a bipartisan recognition of the escalating dangers faced by elected officials.</p>

          <p>Nvidia reported stronger-than-expected earnings and revenue for Q2 2026, with adjusted EPS of $1.05 and revenue of $46.74 billion, signaling sustained demand for AI infrastructure. The company anticipates over 50% sales growth this quarter, projecting $3-4 trillion in AI infrastructure spending by the decade's end. Despite the overall positive results, the stock experienced a slight dip in extended trading as data center revenue narrowly missed analyst estimates for the second consecutive period. Geopolitical factors, particularly concerning H20 chip shipments to China, continued to influence sales, while the board approved an additional $60 billion in share repurchases (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has, after a significant delay of over two and a half years, fulfilled a key campaign promise by appointing Steve Kang as the city's chief film liaison. Kang, who will be assisted by Dan Halden and producer Amy Goldberg, is tasked with streamlining interactions between city bureaucracy and the film industry. Industry advocates had expressed considerable frustration over the vacancy, especially given Los Angeles's ongoing struggle to retain production jobs against states and countries offering generous tax incentives and lower operating costs. This move is intended to bolster the city's vital entertainment sector amid persistent challenges.</p>

          <h2>UK Expands Free Childcare Hours Amid Concerns Over Capacity and Costs</h2>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its free childcare scheme, with Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson encouraging eligible working parents in England to apply for 30 hours per week for children aged nine months to three years, starting in September. This expansion aims to reduce childcare costs, which averaged £12,425 annually for under-twos in 2025, a 22% decrease from the previous year. However, concerns persist regarding a shortage of childcare staff and places, with an estimated need for 35,000 additional staff and 70,000 places by September 2025. Many providers also charge for "extras," making the "free" hours inaccessible for some families.</p>

          <p>The charity Greater Change is demonstrating success by providing direct cash grants to individuals facing or experiencing homelessness, asserting that this approach empowers recipients and prevents long-term costs. One beneficiary, Laura Burns, received £600 to secure a new flat and avoid eviction, transforming her life. This year, the charity has distributed nearly £700,000 to 403 people, reporting that 86% transitioned into stable housing and almost half found employment. International studies, like Vancouver's New Leaf project, support the efficacy of direct cash transfers, showing that recipients generally make responsible choices and do not misuse funds on addictions.</p>

Wilson emphasizes her commitment to portraying the messy realities of family life, mental illness, and resilience, themes consistently present in her work. She also discusses the distinction between her children's and adult fiction, noting the freedom to explore darker realities more explicitly in the latter.</p>

          <p>China's electric vehicle industry is rapidly asserting global dominance, exemplified by BYD surpassing Tesla as the world's largest EV manufacturer by revenue in 2024. This ascendancy, initially underestimated by figures like Elon Musk, is fueled by substantial government subsidies, tax incentives, lower labor costs, and a robust battery supply chain. China became the world's largest vehicle exporter in 2023, with projections indicating it will produce 36 million vehicles annually and export 9 million by 2030. Western markets are responding with duties, while Europe seeks to level the policy playing field to compete with this formidable economic force (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Following Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings report, CNBC's Jim Cramer dismissed fears of an impending artificial intelligence bubble, asserting that the substantial AI investments by major tech companies are justified. Cramer drew parallels to the dot-com era, noting that while many companies collapsed, a few "obvious winners" like Amazon ultimately thrived. He emphasized that today's hyperscalers—including Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Meta, and Tesla—possess strong leadership, solid balance sheets, and robust revenue growth, making their AI spending a worthwhile long-term bet. Nvidia's slight stock dip was attributed to excessively high market expectations rather than underlying weakness (not investment advice).</p>

Over 600 players from ten countries participated, with 98-year-old AAGPBL veteran Maybelle Blair throwing the ceremonial first pitch. The league, set to launch in spring 2026 with four to six teams, aims to offer full-time professional opportunities, complete with longer seasons and competitive salaries.
