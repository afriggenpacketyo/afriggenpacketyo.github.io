        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tottenham Hotspur is reportedly investigating a potential transfer for Crystal Palace and England forward Eberechi Eze. The move is seen as an effort to strengthen their attacking options, particularly after key midfielder James Maddison was sidelined with a long-term anterior cruciate ligament injury. Eze, who scored 14 goals for Palace last season and was part of England's Euro 2024 squad, has emerged as a player of serious interest for Spurs. The club is also in separate talks with Manchester City for winger Savinho, and it remains unclear if they will pursue deals for both players.</p>

          <p>An American teen pilot and influencer, Ethan Guo, who was stranded on a remote Antarctic island since June, has had all charges against him dropped. The 19-year-old was detained by Chilean authorities and accused of providing false flight plan information after illegally landing his plane on King George island. The landing was part of his attempt to become the youngest person to fly solo to all seven continents to raise money for cancer research. A judge ordered him to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer foundation and banned him from re-entering Chilean territory for three years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A Reddit user in Connecticut shared an image of their electricity bill showing a credit balance of over $190 after installing solar panels, illustrating the financial benefits of residential solar energy. The homeowner's system generated surplus energy that was sold back to their supplier, Eversource, resulting in a negative charge for the month. While this doesn't necessarily 'hurt' the utility company, which can resell the surplus power, it demonstrates how solar installations can significantly reduce or even eliminate electricity costs for consumers. The post also serves as a reminder that federal tax credits for solar installations are set to expire at the end of 2025.</p>

          <p>A Chinese man has pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to illegally exporting approximately 850 protected turtles to Hong Kong by concealing them in socks inside boxes mislabeled as toys. The man, Wei Qiang Lin, shipped over 200 such parcels between August 2023 and November 2024. The smuggled animals were primarily eastern box and three-toed box turtles, which are protected species and considered status symbols in China, with an estimated market value of $1.4 million. Lin faces a potential sentence of up to five years in prison for his role in the international wildlife trafficking scheme.</p>

          <p>The CEO of Resorts World Sentosa (RWS) in Singapore has affirmed the company's commitment to its S$6.8 billion expansion plan, despite receiving a shortened two-year casino license renewal instead of the usual three. Singapore's gambling authority cited "unsatisfactory" tourism performance from 2021 to 2023 for the decision. CEO Lee Shi Ruh stated the integrated resort is transforming into a premium lifestyle destination focused on experiences, not just shopping. Upcoming attractions include Minion Land, the Singapore Oceanarium, and a Super Nintendo World, as RWS aims to be ready for its next license review in 2026.</p>

          <h2>United States and China Agree to Extend Trade Truce for an Additional 90 Days</h2>

          <p>The United States and China have extended their ongoing trade truce by 90 days, temporarily averting a significant escalation in tariffs between the world's two largest economies. This extension holds the U.S. levy on Chinese imports at 30% and China's tariff on American goods at 10%. The White House stated the additional time will be used for further negotiations aimed at addressing trade imbalances and what it terms unfair trade practices. While the move avoids immediate economic disruption, some business owners express concern that it only prolongs uncertainty, making future planning difficult. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-12 01:55:52 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has cut its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.6%, the lowest level since April 2023, while also downgrading the country's annual economic growth forecast. The RBA now projects 1.7% growth for the year, down from 2.1%, citing weaker-than-expected public demand. The rate cut was prompted by a substantial drop in inflation, which at 2.1% in the second quarter is now near the bottom of the bank's target range. The central bank noted that while risks of a damaging trade war have diminished, a material disruption to global trade cannot be ruled out. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a wide-ranging interview, Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski revealed that he agreed to join Manchester United in 2012, but his then-club, Borussia Dortmund, refused to sell him. While he expressed some regret over never playing in the Premier League, the 37-year-old is happy with his storied career. He also discussed his role as a veteran player, praising young talents like Lamine Yamal and crediting former manager Jürgen Klopp as having a father-like influence that changed his life. Lewandowski confirmed he has no immediate plans to retire and feels he can still perform at the highest level.</p>

          <p>Two anglers in Delaware have set new state records by catching large specimens of invasive fish species, as confirmed by the state's Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control. One angler reeled in a record-breaking 33-pound flathead catfish from Lums Pond, while another landed a 15-pound northern snakehead. Both species are non-native and pose a significant threat to local aquatic ecosystems by outcompeting native wildlife like largemouth bass. State officials are actively encouraging anglers to catch and kill these harmful fish to help protect Delaware's native species and maintain ecological balance.</p>
