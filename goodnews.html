          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating closing two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its ongoing restructuring efforts. This decision follows the automaker's announcement of shutting down seven vehicle plants and cutting 20,000 jobs globally after reporting a significant net loss for fiscal year 2024. The potential closures involve Nissan's main Oppama plant and the Shonan plant of its unit Nissan Shatai Co., collectively accounting for about 30% of Nissan's domestic production capacity. The company has yet to engage in discussions with labor unions, parts makers, or local municipalities regarding these potential closures.</p>

          <p>Former German Finance Minister Christian Lindner criticized Chancellor Friedrich Merz's new government as he stepped down as chairman of the Free Democratic Party (FDP). Lindner stated that voters wanted less state intervention and more freedom, but the new government is delivering the opposite with increased state control and debt. He warned that the government's fiscal policy, which includes a ‚Ç¨500 billion fund for infrastructure and eased borrowing rules for defense spending, would backfire economically if not accompanied by reforms.

          <p>Audio recordings from Joe Biden's 2023 interview with a special counsel have surfaced, revealing instances of memory lapses and confusion. The recordings, obtained by Axios, show Biden struggling to recall the year he left office as vice president and the date of his son Beau's death. Special Counsel Robert Hur had previously described Biden as a "well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory" in a report that sparked controversy.

          <p>The latest installment of the Doom franchise, Doom: The Dark Ages, faces the challenge of attracting new players in a competitive gaming market dominated by free-to-play titles and annually updated series. Project leaders discuss navigating these challenges by offering a shorter, more accessible experience, incorporating customization options, and leveraging the series' well-known brand. They also address concerns about the cost of entry and the debate over game pricing, arguing that a premium, highly polished single-player game still holds value for players.</p>

          <h2>Tesla Limits Investors' Ability to Sue Over Breach of Fiduciary Duties</h2>

          <p>Tesla announced a change to its corporate bylaws that will limit shareholders' ability to sue the company for breach of fiduciary duties. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's issued and outstanding shares to institute or maintain a derivative proceeding. This change takes advantage of a Texas state law that allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits against insiders. The move follows Tesla's relocation of its site of incorporation to Texas after a court decision in Delaware.</p>
