          <p>President Trump has directed his administration to declassify all federal records concerning Amelia Earhart, the pioneering aviator whose 1937 disappearance over the Pacific Ocean has fueled decades of public fascination and speculation. While the prevailing theory suggests Earhart's plane crashed due to running out of fuel, various alternative theories, including a spy mission or capture by the Japanese, have long circulated. A lawmaker representing the Northern Mariana Islands had previously urged declassification, citing "credible, firsthand accounts" of Earhart being spotted on Saipan. However, experts largely dismiss these alternative narratives, maintaining the high probability of a fuel-related crash.</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace delivered a truly commanding performance to defeat Liverpool 2-1, impressively extending their unbeaten streak to 18 games across all competitions and decisively exposing Liverpool's persistent defensive vulnerabilities. Ismaila Sarr netted an early goal, and substitute Eddie Nketiah secured a deserved winner in the 97th minute, dramatically responding to Liverpool's late equalizer. This historic victory, marking their first at home against Liverpool since 2014, propelled Palace to an impressive second place in the Premier League, just three points behind the reigning champions. Manager Oliver Glasner's transformative leadership has clearly instilled both confidence and class throughout the team, making them the only unbeaten side in the league.</p>

          <p>England's Red Roses delivered a dominant and assured performance to defeat Canada 33-13 at Twickenham, thereby securing their third Women's Rugby World Cup title. This momentous victory occurred in front of a record-breaking crowd of 81,885, laying to rest the ghost of previous final losses to New Zealand. Key tries from Ellie Kildunne, Amy Cokayne, Alex Matthews, and Abbie Ward firmly cemented England's control throughout the match. The triumph caps an already memorable year for women's sport in England, following the Lionesses' successful retention of their European football title earlier in July.</p>

          <p>Pakistan's recently launched nationwide HPV vaccination campaign, designed to protect girls aged 9-14 and combat cervical cancer, is facing substantial challenges from widespread misinformation. AI-generated videos and statements from local politicians are actively spreading false claims regarding the vaccine's safety and its alleged link to infertility, echoing a historical pattern of vaccine mistrust in the country. DW Fact check thoroughly debunked these claims, citing extensive scientific research that unequivocally confirms the vaccine's safety and effectiveness in significantly reducing HPV infections and precancerous lesions. Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal publicly vaccinated his own daughter to counter skepticism, as officials fear misinformation could derail critical public health efforts.</p>

          <h2>Study Reveals Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-27 14:10:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A groundbreaking new study published in Science reveals that chimpanzees regularly consume significant amounts of alcohol from naturally fermented fruit in the wild, ingesting a daily dose equivalent to approximately one small bottle of beer for humans. Researchers observed chimps consuming fruits with an average alcohol content of 0.3%, suggesting that regular alcohol consumption may possess deeper evolutionary roots than previously understood. This compelling finding supports the idea that human alcohol use is not solely a cultural phenomenon but could be rooted in our shared evolutionary history. The study, building on previous research, indicates that alcohol consumption is far more common among wild animals than once believed.</p>

          <p>Finland has remarkably maintained its title as the world's happiest country for the eighth consecutive year, according to the latest World Happiness Report. This sustained achievement is attributed not to overt expressions of joy, but rather to a deep-seated sense of contentment derived from a highly functional society that consistently prioritizes citizen welfare. High taxes are widely accepted as they fund comprehensive and accessible public services, exemplified by Helsinki's Oodi library, which offers a vast array of free resources. Additionally, Finns' close connection to nature and cultural practices like daily saunas significantly contribute to their overall well-being, fostering a life lived according to personal dreams rather than external pressures.</p>

          <p>Belva Davis, the trailblazing journalist and first Black woman hired as a television reporter on the West Coast, has passed away at the age of 92. Davis, known for her unflappable demeanor and fairness, courageously broke significant barriers in an industry predominantly led by white men, ultimately becoming a cherished mentor for a generation of reporters. Despite not holding a college degree, she covered some of the most important events from the 1960s to her retirement in 2012, including the Aids crisis and numerous political elections. Her remarkable career was marked by resilience against pervasive sexism and overt racism, driven by a deep desire to authentically broadcast the reality of her community and provide a missing perspective.</p>
