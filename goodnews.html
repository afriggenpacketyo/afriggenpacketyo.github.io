          <p>Derrick Groves, the final inmate from the Orleans Parish Justice Center's May escape, was apprehended in southwest Atlanta after a brief standoff. His capture concludes a multi-agency manhunt spanning months, initiated after he and nine others fled through a hole behind a toilet. Officials attribute the jailbreak to significant design flaws and staffing shortages at the 2015-built facility. Groves, a convicted violent offender facing life imprisonment for multiple killings, was found in a crawl space and taken into custody without incident. Louisiana authorities plan to prosecute him for the jailbreak in Georgia, bringing a long-awaited sense of calm to victims and the New Orleans community.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a "first phase" peace deal between Israel and Hamas, which involves the release of all remaining hostages by Hamas and a partial withdrawal of Israeli forces to an "agreed upon line" in the Gaza Strip. This significant agreement, confirmed by regional sources, Hamas, and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, is presented as a crucial step toward ending the devastating two-year conflict. The deal requires Israeli cabinet approval, with the potential for hostage releases to commence within days of finalization. This development aims to usher in a "Strong, Durable, and Everlasting Peace" for the Arab and Muslim world, Israel, and the United States.</p>

          <p>SoftBank's shares surged over 10% after the Japanese conglomerate announced its agreement to acquire the robotics division of Swiss engineering firm ABB for $5.4 billion. This strategic acquisition significantly expands SoftBank's footprint in the artificial intelligence sector, aligning with founder Masayoshi Son's vision of "Physical AI," which he defines as AI 10,000 times smarter than humans. The deal, pending global regulatory approval, will integrate ABB Robotics into SoftBank's growing portfolio, which already includes chip designer Arm and a major stake in OpenAI, positioning the company at the forefront of the anticipated AI boom.</p>

          <p>This article outlines President Trump's 20-point plan for peace between Israel and Hamas, which Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has supported. The proposal calls for an immediate ceasefire, Hamas's release of all remaining hostages within 72 hours, and a phased Israeli military withdrawal from parts of Gaza. It envisions a "technocratic" Palestinian committee, not Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, to govern Gaza, overseen by an "International Stabilization Force" and a "Board of Peace" chaired by Trump. The plan also addresses aid, economic development, demilitarization, and a pathway to Palestinian self-determination.</p>

          <p>Principal Benjamin Honoroff dramatically revitalized Middle School 50 in Brooklyn, transforming it from a "persistently dangerous" institution with dwindling enrollment through an innovative debate program. By integrating debate into every class across all grade levels and expanding the debate team, the school witnessed remarkable academic improvements. Proficiency scores in English soared to 60% and in math to 70% within a few years. This transformative approach culminated in two eighth-grade students winning the national championship in policy debate, showcasing the profound positive impact of debate on student achievement and school culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court heard a contentious case challenging an Illinois regulation that permits mail-in ballots to be counted up to 14 days after Election Day, brought by a Republican candidate who ultimately won his election. Both conservative and liberal justices expressed considerable skepticism towards the arguments presented by both sides. The plaintiff claimed harm due to a reduced margin of victory and extended staffing costs, while the state argued against allowing any self-declared candidate to challenge election rules. Justices questioned the plaintiff's standing for such a suit and the practicality of judicial prognostication on candidate success.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump is scheduled for a "routine yearly checkup" at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday, marking his second such exam since returning to the White House in January. This visit follows a previous physical in April and a July diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, a common condition causing leg swelling in older adults. The White House physician had previously declared Trump "fully fit" for presidential duties, attributing his "excellent" health to frequent golf victories. Despite these assurances, recent bruising and a period of public absence have fueled online speculation about his overall wellbeing.</p>

          <p>CoreWeave CEO Michael Intrator strongly rejected concerns about "circular investments" within the artificial intelligence sector, particularly regarding his company's substantial deals with AI giants like OpenAI and Meta. Intrator asserted that these transactions represent a "fundamental infrastructure buildout" driven by genuine, escalating demand from major technology companies acquiring necessary computing infrastructure for their clients. CoreWeave, which went public in March and has seen its stock soar over 200%, has secured billions in contracts, including a $6.3 billion order with Nvidia, which is also a key backer.
