          <p>The article draws parallels between President Trump's attempts to leverage the IRS for political gain and former President Nixon's similar efforts decades ago. Trump's actions, such as threatening Harvard University's tax-exempt status, mirror Nixon's attempts to use the IRS to punish his enemies. The article notes that Congress enacted laws after Watergate to prevent such political interference, but the Trump administration is testing these protections. The article also discusses the administration's efforts to gut tax enforcement at the IRS, limiting the agency's ability to pursue wealthy tax cheats.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the growing concern about microplastics and their potential health effects, particularly through food preparation using plastic kitchen tools. Studies have found microplastics in various parts of the human body, and while the FDA states there is no demonstrated risk to human health, some research suggests possible links between microplastic accumulation and health problems. The article suggests practical ways to reduce plastic use in the kitchen, such as using wooden cutting boards, storing food in glass or metal containers, and opting for cellulose sponges. The article also details how one restaurant eliminated plastic use to promote more sustainable practices.</p>

          <p>Congressional Republicans are working on a significant overhaul of the federal student loan program, aiming to simplify repayment options for future borrowers. The proposed changes include a standard plan with fixed monthly payments and a Repayment Assistance Plan based on income. The Repayment Assistance Plan would offer lower monthly payments for many borrowers and waive any interest left after a borrower makes their payment, preventing loans from growing. The article also notes that the plan would eliminate President Biden's SAVE Plan and could disproportionately affect borrowers with large amounts of graduate school debt.</p>

          <p>This article explores how to transform refined carbohydrates like white rice and pasta into healthier options by increasing their resistant starch content. Resistant starch offers various health benefits, including improved gut health, reduced inflammation, and enhanced insulin sensitivity. The article explains that cooking and then chilling rice or pasta causes some of the digestible starch to transform into resistant starch, which the body digests more slowly. The article also provides tips on how to incorporate more resistant starch into your diet, such as reheating chilled grains gently and soaking oats overnight.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish group PKK, which has waged a 40-year insurgency against Turkey, has announced it is laying down its arms and disbanding. The move follows a call from the group's jailed leader, Abdullah Ocalan, for the organization to dissolve itself. The PKK insurgency initially aimed to create an independent homeland for Kurds but has since focused on greater autonomy and Kurdish rights. The article also notes that President Erdogan needs the support of pro-Kurdish political parties if he is to be able to run again in Turkey's next presidential election, due in 2028.</p>
