          <p>A small plane carrying skydivers crashed shortly after takeoff from Cross Keys Airport in Williamstown, New Jersey, with all 15 people on board surviving the incident. The pilot reported engine trouble and attempted to return to the airport but was unsuccessful, crashing in a wooded area. Injuries ranged from minor to critical, but officials praised the emergency response, noting a recent mass casualty training exercise at the same airport contributed to the successful outcome. The same aircraft was involved in a previous non-fatal incident in 2023.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's civil aviation authority has enacted a new safety regulation, effective June 28, that bans "substandard" power banks from being carried on flights. A power bank is considered substandard if it lacks the mandatory China Compulsory Certification (CCC) safety and quality mark on its surface. This new rule has raised concerns for travelers to and within China, who must now ensure their portable chargers are compliant. Airports are setting up areas for passengers to discard, store, or mail non-compliant devices that are intercepted during security checks.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The cost for the UK government to borrow money has fallen after a recent surge, with the yield on 10-year bonds decreasing. The initial spike in borrowing costs was triggered by concerns over the political future of Chancellor Rachel Reeves, who became emotional in Parliament following a major U-turn on welfare reforms. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's subsequent expression of support for the chancellor has helped calm market nerves. Analysts believe investors are backing Reeves out of fear that her departure would lead to weaker fiscal discipline and larger government deficits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Colombian navy has intercepted an unmanned semi-submersible vessel, the first of its kind found equipped with a Starlink satellite antenna. The drone vessel, believed to be owned by the powerful Gulf Clan cartel, was not carrying drugs and was likely on a test run. This discovery highlights a technological escalation by drug traffickers, who are moving towards sophisticated, unmanned systems that are difficult to detect and reduce the risk of crew capture. Manned narco subs have long been used to transport cocaine, but this autonomous version represents a new challenge for authorities.</p>

          <p>The Wisconsin State Supreme Court has issued a significant ruling, determining that a pre-Civil War law from 1849 does not constitute a ban on abortion. This decision ensures that access to abortion services will remain legal in the state. The ruling resolves a key legal question that arose after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The 19th-century statute had created uncertainty about the legality of abortion in Wisconsin for the past several years.</p>

          <p>Arsenal is actively seeking to bolster its attacking options this summer, with a new center-forward being the top priority. The club is reportedly pursuing targets like RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko and Sporting Lisbon's Viktor Gyokeres, with either signing likely to cost over ¬£70 million. Additionally, the Gunners are exploring options for creative wingers, with interest in players such as Real Madrid's Rodrygo and Crystal Palace's Eberechi Eze. How much the club spends on a striker will likely impact its ability to secure other high-profile attacking players during the transfer window.</p>

          <p>A coalition of tribal leaders, activists, and environmentalists is proposing a plan to partially restore the historic Tulare Lake in California's San Joaquin Valley. The concept involves acquiring nearly 24,000 acres of farmland to create a reservoir and wetland area, which would provide flood protection, water storage, and vital wildlife habitat. For the Santa Rosa Rancheria Tachi Yokut Tribe, reviving the lake, which they call Pa‚Äôashi, holds deep cultural and spiritual significance. The ambitious project faces challenges, including securing nearly $1 billion in funding and acquiring the necessary land from current owners.</p>

          <p>In this personal essay, the author reflects on his waning enthusiasm for the American road trip, an experience he felt had become homogenized by technology and soured by political division. His faith was unexpectedly restored during a stop in Shamrock, Texas, on the Fourth of July. The genuine hospitality of the South Asian family running his motel, combined with the simple, shared experience of watching fireworks with other diverse travelers, reminded him of the road's potential for connection. The evening served as a powerful reminder that the journey's meaning is found in its people, not just its places.</p>

          <p>John Fogerty, the frontman of Creedence Clearwater Revival, recently shared the stories behind some of his most iconic hits, including "Proud Mary" and "Fortunate Son." He revealed that "Proud Mary" was inspired by his euphoria after being discharged from the Army, while "Fortunate Son" was a protest against the class inequities of the Vietnam War draft. Fogerty also discussed his decades-long legal battle over his song rights, which prevented him from performing his hits for many years. Now, having regained control of his publishing, he is rerecording the classic tracks for a new album.</p>

However, an analysis of his key policies, such as a rent freeze, city-owned grocery stores, and fare-free buses, reveals they are not entirely new ideas. These proposals have been implemented or piloted in other jurisdictions, often with promising results, and are part of a broader strategy to make city life more affordable.
