          <h2>Welsh First Minister Eluned Morgan Vows to Challenge Starmer's Government When Necessary</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wales' First Minister Eluned Morgan has declared her intention to challenge Labour in Westminster when its policies negatively impact Wales. In a recent speech, Morgan asserted she would "call out" the UK government and "not stay silent" if decisions harm Welsh communities. She specifically called for a reconsideration of cuts to winter fuel payments and disability benefits, arguing that the latter is unlikely to improve employment rates. Her statements come after Chancellor Rachel Reeves introduced changes to personal independence payments (PIP) and reductions in health-related universal credit during the Spring Statement.</p>

          <p>Jack Clark, a co-founder of Anthropic, has stated that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek is approximately "six to eight months behind where US frontier companies are," despite recent hype. Speaking at the Hill and Valley Forum, Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's "clever algorithmic ideas" but suggested it lacked the necessary computing power to be a major competitor. He also noted that, according to internal Anthropic tests, DeepSeek's models do not currently pose a national security risk. Clark's comments come amid speculation about DeepSeek's next generation models, following the open-sourcing of its Prover-V2 model designed for handling maths proofs.</p>

          <h2>Experts Doubt Trump's Proposed 'Baby Bonus' Will Reverse Declining Birthrates</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Donald Trump's plan to offer a $5,000 "baby bonus" to encourage Americans to have more children is unlikely to be effective, according to experts. While the US is experiencing declining birthrates, experts argue that a one-time payment would not address the underlying financial challenges that disincentivize families from having more children. Unaffordable healthcare, soaring housing costs, inaccessible childcare, and a lack of federal parental leave mandates create significant hurdles for families. Experts suggest that more substantial policy changes, such as childcare subsidies and affordable healthcare, are needed to make a meaningful impact on birthrates.</p>

          <p>A new nationwide poll reveals that over 90% of Americans use federal science information, such as weather forecasts and job market reports, on a weekly basis, yet only 10% are concerned about potential impacts from cuts to federal science support. The poll, conducted by the Association of Science and Technology Centers, highlights a disconnect between people's reliance on federally provided data and their awareness of its source. Americans depend on federal data for weather, economic insights, and food safety, but this connection is often unacknowledged. The poll also indicates bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>DEI initiatives have become a battleground, with Republicans often viewing them as a threat to free speech and meritocracy, while Democrats can sometimes engage in virtue-signaling that stifles open discussion. While some conservatives argue that DEI suppresses free speech, thoughtful DEI training can provide insights into how language affects people from different backgrounds, improving communication. Concerns about DEI limiting meritocracy are also debated, with proponents arguing that DEI is necessary to address historical discrimination. Both sides need to foster tolerance for different perspectives to move beyond endless cultural conflict, the article argues.</p>

          <p>A program releasing sterile male mosquitoes in Southern California is showing promising results in reducing the population of disease-spreading pests. Two vector control districts have released thousands of sterile male Aedes mosquitoes, leading to significant reductions in the invasive mosquito population. The Aedes aegypti mosquito is known for transmitting diseases such as dengue, yellow fever, Zika, and chikungunya. One district reported an 82% reduction in the mosquito population in the release area, while another logged a 44% average decrease. The challenge remains scaling the intervention to make a significant impact across the vast region served by the L.A. County district.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The growing political divide between young men and women is rooted in economic shifts and traditional gender norms, rather than purely cultural issues. The decline of manufacturing jobs, traditionally held by men, has led to lower social trust and more regressive gender norms. Men are struggling to adapt to the cognitive economy, while women have found empowerment in both employment and traditional caretaking roles. Addressing the crisis of masculinity and redefining men's role in an inclusive way is crucial. Studies show that many young men are not inherently misogynistic, but are influenced by perceived societal expectations.</p>

          <p>In this installment of Ask a Book Critic, a reader requests contemporary fiction that evokes the character-driven, beautifully sculpted sentences of Dickens and Dostoevsky, without the tropes of romantasy. The critic suggests Sarah Parry's *The Essex Serpent*, praising its rich, textured writing and its blend of Victorian fantasia with contemporary psychoanalysis. The critic also recommends Elif Batuman's *The Idiot*, which nods to Dostoevsky, and Tara Isabella Burton's *Social Creature*, describing it as *Crime and Punishment* in couture. These recommendations cater to readers seeking contemporary novels with classic literary sensibilities.</p>

Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainties, the high-end German retailer reiterated its full-year guidance. Revenues decreased by 2% on a currency adjusted basis, amounting to 999 million euros ($1.13 billion), slightly exceeding analysts' forecasts. The weaker sales were attributed to soft demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China.
