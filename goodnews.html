          <p>International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach expressed that Japan is welcome to bid for a future Summer or Winter Games after addressing corruption issues related to past events. Sapporo withdrew its bid for the 2030 Winter Games following scandals linked to the 2020 Tokyo Games, which were postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bach emphasized the importance of ensuring such corruption is over and Japanese business practices are clarified and adapted. He also voiced support for his successor, Kirstie Coventry, and highlighted the success of the Paris Games in fulfilling the Olympic Agenda of sustainability and youth engagement.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that the United States has reached a 'full and comprehensive' trade agreement with the United Kingdom, calling it an honor due to their long history and allegiance. The New York Times initially reported the impending U.K.-U.S. announcement.

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to make an uncontrolled reentry into Earth's atmosphere. Experts predict the spacecraft, which was intended to land on Venus but failed to leave Earth's orbit, could crash anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south. While the risk of it hitting someone is small, it cannot be completely excluded, as the 1,000-pound object was built to withstand a descent through a planet's atmosphere. Space debris crashing back to Earth could become a growing problem for aircraft, according to researchers.</p>
