          <p>Australian stocks experienced a decline following Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's return to power, while most Asian markets were closed for holidays. The S&P/ASX 200 reversed earlier gains, reflecting investor sentiment amid global macroeconomic uncertainty. Meanwhile, several Asian currencies, including the Australian dollar and the New Taiwanese dollar, saw gains against the U.S. dollar. In India, Adani Group shares surged following reports of discussions between representatives and the Trump administration regarding the dismissal of bribery charges. Oil prices fell sharply after OPEC+ agreed to increase production.</p>

          <p>A new evolutionary genetic analysis by Chinese and Dutch researchers indicates that the first roses were likely yellow, despite the common association of roses with the color red. The study, published in Nature Plants, analyzed domesticated and wild rose samples, revealing that the common ancestor of Rosa likely had single-petal flowers with yellow color and seven leaflets. Roses are one of the most extensively cultivated ornamental flowers in the world and have been regarded as a symbol of love and beauty from antiquity to modern times.</p>

          <p>China is rapidly catching up to the United States in technology, particularly in artificial intelligence, challenging the long-held belief that America is always ahead. While the U.S. has largely developed proprietary AI models and charged for access, Chinese firms have expanded their influence by freely distributing their models for public use, making them more accessible to researchers and developers worldwide. With Chinese apps like TikTok and Temu gaining global popularity, the article suggests that the world may soon be relying on Chinese AI technology, unless the United States takes steps to openly share more of its AI technologies and research and innovate faster.</p>

          <p>Eighty years after the Battle of Berlin, the city still carries visible scars from World War II, including bullet-riddled facades and gaps in rows of houses. The battle in late April and early May 1945 reduced much of the city to rubble, but infrastructure was quickly repaired, and life gradually returned. While parts of the city were ruined, schools and essential services resumed, marking the end of Hitler's reign and the beginning of a divided Berlin, later reunited in 1990.</p>

          <p>Japan's official development assistance (ODA) ranking slipped to fourth among OECD members in 2024, with Britain reclaiming third place. The United States remained the top ODA donor, followed by Germany, with Japan's aid estimated at $16.8 billion, a 10.3% decrease attributed to the yen's depreciation and a contrast to sharp increases in previous years. Overall ODA by Development Assistance Committee members also fell, due to reduced contributions to international organizations and decreased aid for Ukraine. Japan views ODA as a crucial diplomatic tool for pursuing a "free and open" Indo-Pacific amid China's growing influence.</p>
