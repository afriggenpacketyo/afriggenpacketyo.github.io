          <p>At an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) gathering in South Korea, nations are actively seeking engagement with the United States Trade Representative to address concerns over impending U.S. tariffs. With a 90-day pause on tariffs set to expire in July, countries throughout the region are eager to negotiate and mitigate potential economic impacts. The meeting provided a critical opportunity for Asian economies and the U.S. to convene following President Trump's initial announcement and subsequent suspension of reciprocal tariffs, which had disproportionately affected imports from Asian trading partners. South Korea's trade minister noted the increased urgency among participating countries, reflecting the significant economic implications of the looming tariff deadline.</p>

          <p>During President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the UAE, the Gulf states showcased extravagant displays of wealth and hospitality, signaling their eagerness to strengthen ties with the U.S. and advance their economic interests. Agreements totaling trillions of dollars were pledged, including a $1.2 trillion economic exchange with Qatar and a $600 billion investment promise from Saudi Arabia. While some question the feasibility of these large figures, the visit underscored the Gulf states' desire to be at the forefront of partnerships with the U.S. in business, military, and technology, with some viewing the announcements as competition between the Gulf states for closer ties with the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump, on his first major foreign trip of his second term, has signaled a willingness to overlook past conflicts in the Middle East to foster peace and economic partnerships. This approach contrasts sharply with his domestic policies, where he has initiated investigations into political rivals and utilized executive powers to target critics. Trump's shift towards reconciliation extends to Iran and Syria, with the lifting of sanctions and a meeting with Syria's new president, despite past ties to Al Qaeda. However, Trump remains less forgiving towards domestic opponents, pursuing legal and political action against those he perceives as disloyal or critical.</p>

However, sales declined in the specialist watchmakers segment, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, and the company acknowledges ongoing global uncertainties will require agility and discipline, despite the bank's analysts adding that the company's pricing power could provide a tailwind.</p>
