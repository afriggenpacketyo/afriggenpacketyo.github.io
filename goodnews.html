          <p>Debt settlement programs can offer relief by negotiating unsecured debts like credit card balances for less than the full amount owed, but many types of debt do not qualify. Generally, debts backed by government authority or secured by collateral are excluded from these programs. This includes secured loans like mortgages and auto loans, where lenders can repossess the asset, as well as federal student loans, which have their own specific relief options. Tax debts, court-ordered payments like child support and alimony, and legal judgments are also typically ineligible for negotiation through standard debt settlement companies.</p>

          <p>President Trump has revealed plans for a large, classically styled arch to be built in Washington, D.C., to commemorate the United States' 250th anniversary in 2026. Renderings show a monument similar to Paris's Arc de Triomphe, which would be located in a traffic circle near the Lincoln Memorial. When asked who the arch would be for, the president reportedly replied, "Me." The proposal was showcased with models at a fundraising dinner, but the design and approval process, which typically involves the U.S. Commission of Fine Arts, is currently stalled due to the ongoing government shutdown.</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates for a 30-year loan have fallen to 6.27%, their lowest point in about a month, creating a more favorable environment for potential homebuyers. Experts advise that buyers should secure a mortgage pre-approval to strengthen their offers and understand their budget, rather than waiting in the hope that rates will fall further, as market volatility could cause them to rise again. The article also cautions against assuming traditional seasonal buying patterns will hold, as pent-up demand from sidelined buyers is likely to increase competition for homes, even during the typically slower fall season.

          <p>Illinois Governor JB Pritzker, a billionaire heir to the Hyatt hotels fortune, reported winning over $1.4 million from gambling in Las Vegas last year, according to his tax filings. A campaign spokesperson stated the winnings came from playing blackjack during a single vacation trip, and the governor plans to donate the full amount to charity. At a press conference, Pritzker described himself as "incredibly lucky" and noted that he enjoys playing cards. The disclosure was part of his annual release of tax summaries, which showed he had an adjusted gross income of more than $10 million last year.</p>

          <h2>NOAA Winter Forecast Predicts Warmer, Drier South and Cooler, Wetter North Due to La Niña</h2>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has released its winter outlook for 2025-2026, forecasting warmer-than-average temperatures for most of the contiguous U.S. This weather pattern is attributed to the ongoing La Niña phenomenon, which typically brings warmer and drier conditions to the southern states while making the northern states cooler and wetter. The forecast predicts above-normal precipitation for the Pacific Northwest, northern Rockies, and western Great Lakes. Conversely, the Southwest, southern Texas, and the Southeast are expected to experience drier-than-normal conditions through February 2026, when La Niña is expected to subside.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest, Hungary, to negotiate an end to the war in Ukraine. The announcement followed what Trump described as a "very productive" two-hour phone call with Putin. This diplomatic effort comes as Trump aims to leverage his recent success in brokering a ceasefire in Gaza to resolve the conflict in Europe. The summit will be preceded by a meeting of high-level advisors from both nations. The move represents a significant shift in Trump's approach, as he increasingly directs his frustration at Putin for prolonging the war.</p>

          <p>Colorado Governor Jared Polis has emerged as a rare Democratic politician engaging with the "Make America Healthy Again" (MAHA) movement led by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. Polis has supported MAHA-aligned policies, such as banning soda purchases with food stamps, framing it as an issue of freedom and fiscal responsibility. However, he has also created distance from Kennedy's more controversial anti-vaccine stances, recently signing an order to ensure vaccine access in Colorado and joining a public-health alliance to counter the HHS secretary. This positions Polis as a unique political figure, selectively aligning with a populist health agenda while rejecting its most extreme elements.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Guillermo del Toro's new film "Frankenstein" is being praised as a career-best work that reinterprets the classic horror story as a modern allegory for the arrogance of today's tech industry. The review highlights Oscar Isaac's portrayal of Victor Frankenstein as a short-sighted egomaniac, enabled by a venture capitalist-like character played by Christoph Waltz. Jacob Elordi's Creature is depicted not as a monster, but as a tragic figure whose creation reflects the inventor's vanity. The film faithfully adapts the novel's 19th-century setting but infuses it with a contemporary warning about the dangers of unchecked innovation and the creators who are more dangerous than their creations.</p>

          <p>Scottish football club Rangers are reportedly close to finalizing a deal to hire former player Kevin Muscat as their new head coach. The 52-year-old Australian is currently managing Shanghai Port, who are leading the Chinese league with four games remaining. The announcement is being delayed until after Shanghai's next match to avoid disruption. Muscat has previously won league titles in both Australia with Melbourne Victory and Japan with Yokohama F. Marinos. Rangers are seeking a new manager after a poor start to the season left them eighth in the Scottish Premiership and without a win in the Europa League.</p>
