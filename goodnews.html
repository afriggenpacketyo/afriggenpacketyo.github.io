          <p>In Los Angeles, fifteen workers were successfully rescued after a tunnel they were working in collapsed. The incident occurred in a large industrial complex, with the collapse happening approximately six miles from the tunnel's sole access point. A significant emergency response involving over 100 personnel, including the LAFD's Urban Search and Rescue team, was mobilized for the confined space rescue. The workers were extracted using a crane and cage system, and thankfully, no injuries were reported among the rescued individuals.</p>

          <p>In an effort to address persistent labor market challenges and sluggish economic growth, China has announced a new subsidy program. The government will provide a one-time payment of up to 1,500 yuan for each young person, aged 16 to 24, hired by companies and social organizations. This measure, effective until the end of the year, is designed to stabilize employment and boost household incomes amid fierce domestic competition. Additionally, the state is expanding its "work-for-relief" public works program to create more jobs for vulnerable populations.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has announced the opening of a new office in New York's Trump Tower, signaling a deepening relationship with the U.S. administration ahead of the 2026 World Cup. The announcement was made at the Trump Organization's headquarters, where Infantino praised the support received from the White House. This move is the latest in a series of friendly interactions between the two leaders, which has drawn some criticism from European soccer confederations. The U.S., along with Canada and Mexico, is preparing to co-host the expanded 48-nation tournament next year.</p>

          <p>In Israel's Negev desert, Bedouin communities are partnering with solar energy companies to build large-scale solar fields on their land. These projects not only provide clean energy to the national grid and create local jobs but also serve as a crucial tool for securing land rights. By registering the land for these developments, Bedouin families can strengthen their legal claims in a region where they have long faced threats of eviction and home demolitions. This innovative approach is seen as a way to resolve long-standing land disputes while advancing a green economy.</p>

          <p>Shares of WK Kellogg, the company behind cereals like Corn Flakes and Fruit Loops, skyrocketed over 50% following reports of advanced acquisition talks with Italian confectionery giant Ferrero. A deal, potentially valued around $3 billion, could be announced as soon as this week. This acquisition would significantly expand Ferrero's footprint in the U.S. breakfast market and comes as WK Kellogg has been facing financial struggles. The potential sale follows the 2024 acquisition of Kellogg's former parent company, Kellanova, by Mars. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Bank of Korea has decided to maintain its key policy rate at 2.5%, opting to observe the effects of recent government measures aimed at cooling Seoul's overheated housing market. Housing prices in the capital surged over 19% year-over-year in June, prompting authorities to intervene to control rapidly growing household debt. While the broader economy has shown signs of slowing, the central bank is prioritizing financial stability over immediate growth stimulus. Analysts anticipate potential rate cuts later in the year once the housing market shows signs of stabilizing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A group of thirteen brown pelicans, successfully rehabilitated after being poisoned by a toxic algal bloom, were released back into the wild in Huntington Beach. The birds were among nearly 200 seabirds rescued by the Wetlands and Wildlife Care Center during Southern California's deadliest algal bloom in nearly a decade. The bloom, caused by a toxin called domoic acid, also sickened numerous other marine animals, including sea lions. The public release of the recovered pelicans serves as a hopeful moment and a powerful reminder of the importance of wildlife conservation efforts.</p>
