          <p>President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy held talks at the White House, joined by European leaders, to discuss ending the war with Russia. Key topics included potential US security guarantees for Ukraine and Trump's push for a trilateral summit with Putin, though he notably backed away from demanding an immediate ceasefire. While the meeting was more cordial than their previous encounter, European leaders stressed that a ceasefire is a necessary next step, highlighting a key point of divergence in the diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A source within Hamas has indicated the group's agreement to the most recent ceasefire proposal mediated by Egypt and Qatar. The deal is said to involve an initial 60-day truce during which Hamas would release about half of the remaining Israeli hostages in exchange for negotiations on a permanent ceasefire. Israel's response remains uncertain, as Prime Minister Netanyahu has previously demanded the release of all hostages at once, while military operations in Gaza City continue to intensify.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines whether debts from 'Buy Now, Pay Later' (BNPL) services like Klarna and Afterpay can be included in debt forgiveness programs. As unsecured debts, they are technically eligible, similar to credit card debt, but practical inclusion varies as BNPL is a newer financial product and providers may not negotiate settlements. With defaults on these popular payment plans rising, consumers are advised to explore other options like direct negotiation with providers, debt consolidation, or credit counseling.

While potential upside from renewed sales to China is noted, the report also acknowledges that geopolitical risks and potential US export taxes could temper some of the optimistic forecasts for the chipmaker.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores whether age limits exist for buying annuities as a retirement planning tool. While there are no federal laws setting a maximum age, most insurance companies impose their own limits, typically around 80 to 85 years old, due to risk assessment. The best age to purchase depends on individual retirement strategy; buying in one's late 50s or 60s allows for growth, while purchasing later in life can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy calculations.
