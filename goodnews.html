          <h2>American Shopping Malls Find New Life with Unconventional Tenants</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Facing decline and high vacancy rates, traditional American shopping malls are experiencing a resurgence by replacing former anchor stores with non-traditional tenants. For example, the Dayton Mall in Ohio sold a former Sears space to a large church, which now draws thousands of visitors weekly and drives business to remaining retailers. Other malls are incorporating entertainment options like bowling, yoga studios, and large bookstores like Barnes & Noble to create community hubs and increase "cross-shopping." This strategy of diversifying tenants is helping to increase foot traffic and revitalize properties that were once considered obsolete in the age of e-commerce.</p>

          <p>After suffering a concussion during a high school football game, a New Jersey teenager experienced persistent debilitating symptoms for months, including severe headaches and dizziness. When physical therapy and medication failed, a specialist ordered an MRI, which revealed a rare and dangerous condition: an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), an abnormal tangle of blood vessels in his brain. The AVM was likely the true cause of his long-term symptoms. The teen underwent successful brain surgery to remove the malformation and has since made a full recovery, highlighting the importance of thorough diagnostic imaging after head injuries.</p>

          <p>As extreme heat increases demand for cooling, New York-based technology company Runwise is helping large buildings reduce energy waste and costs. The company has developed a platform that uses a network of wireless sensors and weather algorithms to intelligently control a building's heating and cooling systems, preventing overheating and overcooling. This technology provides a more efficient alternative to centralized systems that often run blindly. Now installed in over 10,000 buildings, Runwise claims to have saved clients over $100 million in energy costs and recently secured a $55 million funding round to expand nationwide.</p>

          <p>Sandra Grimes, a veteran CIA officer instrumental in unmasking notorious Soviet mole Aldrich Ames, passed away on July 25 at the age of 79. In the early 1990s, Grimes postponed her plans to scale back her career to help investigate why numerous CIA informants in the Soviet Union were being compromised and executed. Her meticulous analysis of financial records and activity logs revealed a pattern linking Ames's meetings with a Soviet official to large cash deposits. This crucial work led to the 1994 arrest of Ames, whose espionage caused catastrophic damage to U.S. national security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A San Francisco-based startup, Marathon Fusion, has proposed a modern form of alchemy: creating gold by repurposing neutrons generated during nuclear fusion. The theory suggests that these neutrons could transmute common metals like mercury into gold, creating a valuable byproduct that could help subsidize the high cost of developing fusion energy. While scientists have created minuscule amounts of gold in labs before at exorbitant costs, Marathon's idea is to integrate this process into future commercial fusion reactors. The concept remains speculative, as commercial fusion power is not yet a reality, but it represents an innovative approach to making the clean energy source economically viable.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Carronade Capital Management is urging satellite communications company Viasat to separate its Defense and Advanced Technologies (DAT) business. Carronade argues that Viasat is undervalued because the market incorrectly views it as a legacy satellite company threatened by competitors like Starlink. The firm believes the DAT division, a fast-growing and high-margin business focused on defense tech, is a "hidden gem" that would be valued much higher as a standalone entity. By spinning off or conducting an IPO for the DAT business, Carronade projects Viasat's total valuation could increase by anywhere from 76% to 304%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The suspect accused of killing four people at The Owl Bar in Anaconda, Montana, has been apprehended following a weeklong manhunt. Authorities arrested 45-year-old Michael Brown near the search area, bringing a major law enforcement operation involving about 130 officers to a close. Brown, an Army veteran who reportedly struggled with mental illness, allegedly opened fire in the bar on August 1, killing four patrons before fleeing into the nearby mountains. The capture provides a resolution for the community, though the motive for the seemingly random and tragic attack remains unclear.</p>

          <p>In a significant diplomatic achievement, the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan signed a historic peace agreement at the White House, officially ending decades of conflict. The U.S.-brokered deal will reopen key transportation routes and establish a major transit corridor, to be named the "Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity," linking Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhchivan. The agreement marks a major step toward normalizing relations between the two former Soviet republics, which have fought for control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region for nearly 40 years. The deal also signifies a geopolitical shift, diminishing Russia's long-standing influence in the Caucasus region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Travelers can avoid unexpectedly high cell phone bills abroad by taking proactive steps before their trip. Experts suggest several strategies instead of relying on expensive daily international roaming packages from major carriers. Options include switching to a provider like T-Mobile that includes basic international data in some plans, or purchasing a local or international eSIM for cheaper data rates. For budget-conscious travelers, simply using free Wi-Fi whenever possible and pre-downloading maps and guides for offline use can significantly reduce or eliminate extra charges. Planning ahead is key to staying connected without breaking the bank.</p>

          <p>The annual Perseids meteor shower, one of the year's most popular celestial events, is expected to be less spectacular at its peak this year. According to NASA, a full moon will coincide with the peak viewing nights of August 12 and 13, and its bright light will likely wash out many of the fainter meteors. While a few bright fireballs may still be visible, viewing conditions are considered not ideal. For those still hoping to catch the show, astronomers recommend finding a dark location away from city lights, facing north, and looking up during the predawn hours.</p>

          <p>Gobekli Tepe, a nearly 12,000-year-old archaeological site in Turkey, has become the focus of widespread conspiracy theories, popularized by figures on platforms like Joe Rogan's podcast. Theorists, such as Graham Hancock, speculate that the site was built by a lost advanced civilization, accusing archaeologists of deliberately hiding key discoveries. Lead archaeologist Lee Clare refutes these claims, explaining that the slow pace of excavation is necessary to protect the fragile site and preserve its layers for future scientific study. He expresses frustration that such misinformation risks drowning out the real, complex story that scientists are carefully working to uncover.</p>

          <p>In a potential sign of easing tensions, South Korea's military has observed North Korean troops dismantling some of their propaganda loudspeakers along the shared border. This action follows South Korea's decision in June to halt its own loudspeaker broadcasts, which played K-pop music and news reports into the North. The move is seen as one of the first reciprocal de-escalation steps from Pyongyang under the new South Korean administration of President Lee Jae Myung. Cross-border loudspeaker campaigns have been a recurring feature during periods of high tension between the two nations, which technically remain at war.</p>
