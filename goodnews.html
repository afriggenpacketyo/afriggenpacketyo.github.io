          <p>A review of a new biography celebrates the enduring influence of American fashion designer Claire McCardell, who revolutionized women's clothing in the mid-20th century. McCardell championed a new vision of comfortable, practical, and elegant apparel, freeing women from restrictive styles. Her innovations, including the popularization of ballet flats, the introduction of functional pockets and side-fasteners, and the development of versatile separates, fundamentally shaped the 'American Look' and what women wear today, yet her name is not widely remembered.</p>

          <p>The CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer announced it is selling a portion of its shares in the semiconductor company Broadcom, booking a substantial 220% profit on the position.

The club stated the sale is a disciplined move to avoid greed and to raise cash while their market momentum indicator suggests the market is in overbought territory and could be due for a pullback.

          <p>This article serves as a public health warning about how certain common prescription drugs can make it more difficult for the body to cope with high temperatures. Medications such as some antidepressants, beta-blockers for heart conditions, diuretics, and stimulants can interfere with the body's natural cooling mechanisms like sweating and fluid balance. This interference increases the risk of dehydration, overheating, and heatstroke. The article advises patients taking these drugs to stay hydrated, avoid peak heat, and consult their doctor if they have concerns.</p>

          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare has announced it will begin blocking AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a significant move that could reshape how AI models are trained. Under the new policy, website owners on Cloudflare's network will have to explicitly grant permission for AI bots to access their content. The company stated the goal is to return control to creators, who have seen their content used to train large language models without compensation or traffic, potentially depriving them of revenue.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread criticism over its impact on the national deficit, some major financial institutions are supporting President Trump's 'big, beautiful bill.' The American Bankers Association and economists from firms like Citi and Nomura argue the legislation could provide a necessary boost to the U.S. economy. They contend that by extending expiring tax provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the bill would prevent a sharp fiscal contraction and stimulate business investment, viewing it as a net positive for near-term growth sentiment.
