        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese AI firm DeepSeek has launched an experimental model, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp, designed to enhance processing efficiency and lower operational costs. The model utilizes a feature called DeepSeek Sparse Attention (DSA), which allows it to handle large amounts of information by focusing only on relevant data, effectively halving the cost compared to its predecessor. While this innovation could make powerful AI more accessible for smaller companies, experts raise concerns about its reliability and safety. The sparse attention method might inadvertently exclude crucial data, potentially leading to less relevant or biased outcomes, a key challenge for the open-source technology.</p>

          <p>US President Donald Trump has announced that former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair will be part of an international body, the 'Board of Peace,' tasked with overseeing Gaza's transitional governance. This board is a central element of a new 20-point American plan aimed at ending the prolonged conflict between Israel and Hamas. The proposal calls for an immediate end to the war, the return of all Israeli hostages, and the release of Palestinian prisoners, followed by a phased Israeli withdrawal. Sir Tony Blair endorsed the plan as the "best chance" for peace, though his involvement has drawn mixed reactions due to his role in the Iraq War.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after the legendary 'Thrilla in Manila,' the brutal boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier is remembered as a contest that left permanent scars on both fighters. An authorized biographer recalls watching the fight with Ali years later, noting Ali's visible discomfort and admission that he was on the verge of quitting just before Frazier's corner stopped the fight. The article explores the intense personal animosity between the two, fueled by Ali's taunts, which unfairly branded Frazier in the public eye. Ultimately, the fight is framed as a Pyrrhic victory where both men showcased immense courage but suffered irreparable physical and psychological damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK Health Secretary Wes Streeting has definitively ruled out applying a Value Added Tax (VAT) on private healthcare services in the forthcoming autumn budget. Responding to speculation about potential tax increases, Streeting stated unequivocally that the policy "is not happening." The confirmation comes as Chancellor Rachel Reeves faces pressure to find ways to fund public services while adhering to fiscal rules, leading to questions about whether the Labour government would break its manifesto promise not to raise VAT. Proponents of the tax, including a former Labour leader, argued it could raise over £2 billion for the NHS.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer is set to announce plans for a new NHS Online hospital service in England, intended to be operational within two years to help reduce patient waiting times. The digital service will feature its own dedicated doctors to conduct online assessments, consultant check-ups, and follow-up appointments through the NHS app. Officials hope this virtual hospital can handle up to 8.5 million appointments in its first three years, focusing initially on specialties like ophthalmology and gynaecology. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the initiative will modernize the NHS and free up capacity for essential face-to-face consultations.</p>

          <p>Shares of Zijin Gold, the overseas mining unit of China's Zijin Mining, surged more than 60% during their first day of trading in Hong Kong. The company's market debut followed the world's second-largest Initial Public Offering (IPO) this year, raising approximately $3.2 billion. The successful listing comes as gold prices have reached record highs, driven by strong safe-haven demand and expectations of interest rate cuts. This IPO contributes to a significant resurgence in Hong Kong's capital markets, which have seen a nearly 700% year-on-year increase in funds raised in the first half of the year.

          <p>Donald Trump's 20-point peace plan for Gaza has drawn reactions from global leaders, with many welcoming the initiative as a potential breakthrough. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz called it the "best chance" for peace, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan commended Trump's leadership. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen also urged all parties to seize the opportunity, reiterating the EU's support for a two-state solution. The plan, which awaits a response from Hamas, proposes an immediate ceasefire, hostage release, and a transitional governing body for Gaza, though significant obstacles to its implementation remain.</p>

          <p>Heather Knight, former captain of the England women's cricket team, is preparing for the World Cup in a new capacity after being replaced as skipper. Knight discusses the challenge of stepping back from a leadership role that heavily defined her identity and embracing a freer, more rebellious side she jokingly calls "Shitbag Shelley." After recovering from a hamstring injury that sidelined her for the summer, she reflects proudly on her nine-year tenure as captain, which included a 2017 World Cup victory. Now focused on her performance as a player, Knight aims to make a significant impact at what will likely be her final 50-over World Cup.</p>

          <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has decided to maintain its benchmark policy rate at 3.6%, a move anticipated by economists. The decision comes as the country's inflation rate remains at its highest point in over a year, driven by rising costs for housing, food, and alcohol. In its statement, the RBA acknowledged that inflation might be more persistent than previously expected and noted that the economic outlook remains uncertain due to both domestic and global factors. An analyst from Oxford Economics suggested the RBA has largely succeeded in its inflation fight, forecasting a potential rate cut in November. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The English Premier League is emerging as a critical battleground for players vying to become the lead striker for the Brazilian national team ahead of the next World Cup. With Brazil's legendary history of goalscorers, the competition for the coveted number nine shirt is intense and open. Several contenders are currently playing in England, including Brentford's Igor Thiago and Tottenham's Richarlison, whose performances are being closely monitored by Brazil's management. As the national team seeks to end its long wait for a World Cup trophy, the form of these Premier League-based forwards will likely be a decisive factor in squad selection.</p>

          <p>China's official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for September was 49.8, marking the sixth consecutive month of contraction but showing a slight improvement over expectations. The data suggests that Beijing's efforts to address industrial overcapacity and stimulate a sluggish economy are having some effect, with the production sub-index rising to a six-month high. However, the sector still struggles with weak domestic demand and the impact of U.S. tariffs on exports. A separate private survey, which focuses more on export-oriented firms, painted a more positive picture, registering a PMI of 51.2, its highest level since May. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has unveiled a 20-point plan to end the Israel-Hamas war, which has received backing from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The proposal's key components include an immediate ceasefire, the return of all Israeli hostages within 72 hours, and a phased withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. Governance of the territory would be temporarily transferred to a technocratic Palestinian committee overseen by an international board chaired by President Trump. The plan also outlines a process for demilitarizing Gaza, delivering extensive humanitarian aid, and creating an economic development strategy to rebuild the devastated region.</p>
