          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles to combat elevated prices of the staple food. Farm Minister Shinjiro Koizumi announced the release, which includes 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, and expects the 2020 rice to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, and the released rice will be directed to smaller supermarket operators and specialty shops as well as major retailers. The government hopes this measure will alleviate distribution shortages and lower overall prices for consumers.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the San Diego Padres 8-7 in a 10-inning game that lived up to the hype of their growing rivalry. Both teams scored twice in the first inning, and the lead changed hands multiple times throughout the game, with the Dodgers ultimately surging ahead in the 10th with RBIs from Andy Pages and Tommy Edman. The game was intense, reflecting the high stakes as the Dodgers lead the Padres by just one game in the National League West standings. This victory marks the first renewal of the season between the two clubs, with more heavyweight fights expected to follow.</p>

          <p>Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have filed a lawsuit in bankruptcy court to prevent the sale of personal genetic data by 23andMe without customer consent. The lawsuit arises as a biotechnology company seeks court approval to acquire the financially struggling 23andMe. The states argue that biological samples, DNA data, health-related traits, and medical records are too sensitive to be sold without explicit, informed consent from each individual. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has expressed interest in buying the company for $256 million and has stated that it would comply with 23andMe's privacy policies and applicable law.</p>

The government insists that nuclear power is a crucial part of its plans to eliminate fossil fuels from the UK's energy grid by 2030, though the project will take at least a decade to complete.</p>

          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have plummeted, with a significant reduction in fatal overdoses among Gen Z, according to data from the CDC and other federal agencies. The number of drug-related deaths for those under 35 decreased from over 31,000 in 2021 to roughly 16,690 in 2024. Researchers attribute this decline to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, less deadly fentanyl being sold, more available addiction healthcare, and behavioral shifts among teens and young adults. Despite this progress, experts caution that sustaining this recovery may be difficult, particularly for those struggling with severe addiction.</p>

The announcement suggests that all personnel decisions will be made by Bunch, not Trump.
