          <h2>China's Exports Rebound in June Amid U.S. Trade Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 23:09:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports saw a significant 5.8% year-over-year increase in June, surpassing market expectations and reversing a previous slowdown. This acceleration is attributed to exporters capitalizing on a 90-day tariff truce with the United States to expedite shipments. The growth, which reached US$325.2 billion, provides a temporary boost to the world's top merchandise exporter. The data indicates a potential easing of immediate trade pressures, though long-term uncertainty remains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Gisele Pelicot, who became a symbol of women's rights in France, has been awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Legion of Honor. She gained international recognition for her courageous public testimony against her ex-husband, who drugged her and invited dozens of men to sexually assault her over a decade. Her case led to the conviction of her ex-husband and 50 co-defendants, shocking the nation and sparking legal reforms. Pelicot's advocacy was instrumental in the French Senate passing a bill to include lack of consent in the legal definition of sexual assault.</p>

          <p>Singapore's economy grew 1.4% in the second quarter of 2025, narrowly avoiding a technical recession by reversing the previous quarter's 0.5% contraction. On a year-over-year basis, the economy expanded 4.3%, driven by a strong performance in the manufacturing sector. Despite the positive figures beating forecasts, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the rest of the year, citing unclear U.S. tariff policies. The government has announced grants to help businesses manage the impact of global trade tensions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that the central bank is prepared to implement larger interest rate cuts if the UK job market shows signs of slowing. In an interview, Bailey stated that he believes the path for rates is "downward," citing signs that businesses are adjusting employment and offering smaller pay raises. This follows two previous rate cuts and a recent hold at 4.25%, with the next review scheduled for August. The comments come as the UK economy shows signs of contraction, increasing pressure on the government to stimulate growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Angels selected UC Santa Barbara pitcher Tyler Bremner as the second overall pick in the MLB draft, addressing their immediate need for pitching talent. Bremner, a right-hander with a strong fastball and changeup, has had an emotional year, losing his mother to cancer in June. He spoke of his mother's support and how he channeled his grief into his performance on the field, which included a dominant end to his college season. The Angels hope Bremner can develop into a key starter and contribute to the major league roster quickly.</p>

          <p>A significant shift is occurring in the academic priorities of Chinese students, with a strong preference for technology-focused engineering disciplines. Driven by China's national push for technological self-sufficiency and intensified competition with the U.S., fields like information technology and vehicle engineering have become top choices. This trend marks a departure from two decades ago when international trade and urban planning were popular. The state-driven system is now actively funneling students into these strategic fields to support the country's future industrial and technological development goals.</p>

Ho also highlights the rise of "rainbow tourism," where travelers come from a diverse range of developing nations, not just Western countries.

Unlike most second-term presidents who receive a more informal invitation, Trump will be afforded a full ceremonial welcome and state banquet. The trip is expected to be a tool of soft diplomacy, although it will likely draw protests, similar to his 2019 visit.</p>
