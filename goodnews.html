          <p>A federal judge has issued a preliminary injunction, preventing the Trump administration from proceeding with large-scale reorganizations and workforce reductions across numerous federal agencies. Judge Susan Illston emphasized that while presidents can set policy priorities, Congress holds the authority to create, fund, and assign duties to federal agencies through statutes. The judge ruled that the administration's actions disregarded congressional mandates and that a president cannot initiate executive branch reorganizations without congressional partnership, protecting thousands of jobs at agencies like the Department of Health and Human Services. The order halts further reductions in force for the duration of the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Facing pressure from President Trump to increase defense spending, NATO allies are considering redefining what qualifies as security to meet his demands. Some countries have tentatively agreed to a plan that would broaden NATO spending beyond traditional military items to include infrastructure and technology. The proposal involves a target of 3.5% of GDP for military spending, plus 1.5% for defense-related spending like strengthening cybersecurity and improving infrastructure to support military operations. This approach aims to satisfy Trump's demands while addressing logistical preparedness highlighted by the war in Ukraine, where weak infrastructure has impeded troop and equipment deployment, according to NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte.</p>

          <p>Nuclear power stocks experienced a significant rally following reports that President Trump plans to sign executive orders aimed at bolstering the nuclear industry. The orders are expected to expedite the construction of nuclear reactors and secure vital materials for the sector. Trump is reportedly invoking the Defense Production Act to address U.S. dependence on Russia and China for enriched uranium and nuclear fuel processing. The president is also expected to direct federal agencies to streamline the permitting and siting of new nuclear facilities, potentially opening federal land for nuclear deployment.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Navy has largely reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries, following a Pentagon review that used standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The initial removal was based on the Navy's own search terms, which identified a broader range of titles, including works by Maya Angelou and Ibram X. Kendi. However, the Pentagon's standardized search terms led to the identification of only about 20 books that required further review by a Department of Defense panel. As a result, nearly all of the originally pulled books have been returned to circulation, according to a defense official.</p>

          <p>Homeowners insurance costs are rapidly increasing in states within Tornado Alley, primarily due to the escalating damage caused by hailstorms. Despite the life-threatening nature of tornadoes, hail is the more significant concern for insurers due to its broader impact area. States like Kentucky, Nebraska, and Arkansas have seen premium increases of over 30% in recent years. Insurance companies are raising rates in response to the growing costs of extreme weather disasters, with hailstorms accounting for a substantial portion of homeowner insurance claims annually from severe convective storms.</p>

          <p>Skeletal remains discovered on New Jersey beaches decades ago have been identified as Captain Henry Goodsell of the ship Oriental, which sank in 1844, thanks to the work of college students. The ship was carrying marble for Girard College when it likely sprung a leak and sank, killing all five crew members. The remains, known as "Scattered Man John Doe," were unidentified until Ramapo College's Investigative Genetic Genealogy Center partnered with the New Jersey State Police. Students used genetic genealogy to trace the remains back to Goodsell, confirming the identification through a family reference sample.</p>

          <p>Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) can be a useful tool for homeowners this summer if used wisely, offering flexibility in accessing funds for various needs. Experts recommend using HELOCs to take advantage of falling interest rates, consolidate credit card debt, and fund home repairs or renovations, as these can increase home value. However, they advise against using HELOCs for non-essential expenses like vacations or building a pool, as these carry risk and may not generate financial returns. While HELOCs can be considered for college costs or buying a new home, it's essential to weigh the risks and benefits carefully. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>During a severe ocean heat wave in 2023, scientists discovered that clownfish off the coast of Papua New Guinea exhibited a unique adaptation: they shrank in size. Researchers measuring the fish monthly found that most got shorter, likely as a survival mechanism in response to the hotter temperatures. The study suggests that being smaller may help clownfish survive in a warming climate, with those that shrank having a higher chance of survival. This finding adds complexity to the understanding of how marine life responds to climate change, particularly in the face of devastating coral reef damage from heat waves.</p>

He emphasizes the importance of remembering the Holocaust, especially in Romania, which long denied its complicity in the genocide. With the rise of far-right parties in Romania, Simsensohn sees his work as a crucial effort to combat antisemitism and preserve historical awareness.</p>

          <p>The latest Mission: Impossible film, The Final Reckoning, marks a shift in the franchise by focusing on Ethan Hunt's character development and backstory, a departure from his previous portrayal as a cipher. While the film includes the series' signature elements like globe-trotting and action stunts, it struggles to balance these with the need to explain the importance of Hunt's actions. The Hunt-heaviness stems from the decision to create lasting consequences for the protagonist's actions, which has saved the series but also leaves the film feeling encumbered. The film's triumphalism about Hunt's character ultimately leaves the viewer a little cold, as the most entertaining aspects of Mission: Impossible were never the overarching plot.</p>
