          <p>In an interview, Republican Congressman Michael McCaul explained his support for a significant legislative package, emphasizing its funding for border security, the Department of Defense, and the extension of tax cuts. He dismissed concerns about the bill's impact on Medicaid and the federal deficit, arguing that the tax cuts would stimulate revenue through dynamic scoring. McCaul also addressed national security, stating that recent military action against Iran has enhanced deterrence and that the FBI is actively monitoring potential threats from sleeper cells within the United States.

          <p>A new biography by Sam Tanenhaus, "Buckley: The Life and the Revolution That Changed America," explores the profound influence of William F. Buckley Jr. on the modern conservative movement. The article details how Buckley, through his magazine National Review and TV show "Firing Line," catalyzed a political shift that elevated figures like Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan. The book argues that Buckley invented a form of cultural politics that reshaped the Republican Party. It also suggests that Buckley's intellectual and populist groundwork ultimately paved the way for the rise of Donald Trump.</p>

The plan, part of a broader 10-year NHS strategy, aims to relieve pressure on the health service, as obesity currently costs it ¬£11 billion a year.

These questions probe whether partners feel they are on the same team during conflicts, can be their authentic selves, are genuinely curious about each other's inner worlds, and take accountability for their mistakes. The article explains that negative answers to these questions can indicate a lack of emotional intimacy, trust, and mutual support.
