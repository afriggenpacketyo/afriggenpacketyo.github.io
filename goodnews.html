          <p>Bill Simon, Walmart's former U.S. CEO, suggests the company can absorb tariff costs without raising prices, criticizing its "doom and gloom" commentary. He points to Walmart's increased gross profit margin and price deflation in general merchandise categories as evidence of its financial strength. Simon believes consumers can handle potential price increases due to a strong job market and lower fuel prices, but he warns that negative commentary from corporate executives could erode consumer confidence. Simon is now on the Darden Restaurants board and is the chairman at Hanesbrands.</p>

          <p>Doctors at Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia successfully treated a 9¬Ω-month-old boy, KJ Muldoon, with a rare genetic disorder called CPS1 deficiency using a custom gene-editing treatment, making him the first patient of any age to receive such therapy. The treatment, presented at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy, involves correcting a single mutation in KJ's DNA using CRISPR technology to enable his body to rid itself of ammonia. This breakthrough offers a new path for developing personalized treatments for thousands of other rare genetic diseases, potentially transforming healthcare by making these therapies more accessible and affordable. The experimental treatment was the result of decades of federally funded research.</p>

          <p>World No. 1 golfer Scottie Scheffler voiced his disagreement with the PGA of America's decision not to implement "lift, clean, place" for the first round of the PGA Championship at Quail Hollow Club, citing the impact of mud on the ball. Scheffler argued that hitting the ball in the middle of the fairway should not result in punishment due to mud, suggesting the rule decision unfairly altered the conditions for competitors. Despite the setback on the 16th hole, Scheffler finished the day 2-under par, while Ryan Gerard led the leaderboard. Scheffler acknowledged the position "a golf purist" would likely take.</p>

A key element is a proposed UK-EU security pact, aiming to complement NATO and extend cooperation beyond defense to areas like economic security and migration. However, contentious issues remain, including a 'veterinary' deal to ease border checks on food and drink, which could require aligning with EU regulations. A youth mobility deal is also under consideration, allowing under-30s to live and work in each other's countries, though with potential limitations.</p>
