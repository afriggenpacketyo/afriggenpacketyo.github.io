          <p>Lifeguards in Newport Beach, California, performed 350 rescues on July 4th as swimmers were caught in unexpectedly dangerous surf and strong rip currents. One notable incident involved a "monster rip current" that pulled over a dozen people far from shore, requiring a significant rescue effort captured on video. The National Weather Service had issued warnings for elevated surf and hazardous swimming conditions for much of Southern California's coastline through the holiday weekend. Officials cautioned that the powerful currents can easily pull people out to sea and capsize small boats near the shore.</p>

          <p>The third named storm of the hurricane season, Tropical Storm Chantal, has formed in the Atlantic and is forecast to make landfall in the Carolinas on Sunday. A tropical storm warning has been issued for a stretch of the coast from South Carolina to North Carolina, which are already experiencing dangerous surf conditions. While forecasters expect it to be a relatively minor storm, Chantal is projected to bring heavy rainfall of up to six inches in some areas, posing a risk of flash flooding. Officials are urging caution, particularly for beachgoers and boaters, due to the hazardous conditions.</p>

          <p>This article examines two distinct exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for dividend-focused investors: the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation ETF (VIG) and the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). VIG is tailored for growth investors, focusing on companies with a long history of increasing dividends, offering a lower current yield but strong capital appreciation potential. In contrast, SCHD targets investors seeking higher immediate income, using a quality-based screening process to select stocks, resulting in a more generous yield. The analysis suggests both are strong options depending on an investor's time horizon and income needs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Wales suffered a 3-0 loss to the Netherlands in their first-ever match at a major tournament, Euro 2025. Despite containing the former champions for most of the first half, Wales conceded a goal just before halftime and two more early in the second. Veteran player Jess Fishlock expressed disappointment but remained confident the team would learn and improve for their upcoming challenging matches against France and England. Coach Rhian Wilkinson acknowledged the difficulty but emphasized that reaching the world stage is a major achievement for Welsh women's football.</p>

          <p>Facing a seemingly impossible target of 536 runs on the final day of the second Test, England's cricket team may be forced to abandon its aggressive "Bazball" strategy of only playing for a win. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick hinted for the first time that the team would be open to playing for a draw to preserve their 1-0 series lead against India. This potential shift in tactics represents a significant test for the philosophy championed by coach Brendon McCullum. The challenging pitch conditions and India's strong bowling attack make salvaging a draw a difficult task for England's remaining seven wickets.</p>

          <p>An excerpt from Ron Chernow's biography "Mark Twain" recounts the author's 1882 journey back to the Mississippi River, the setting that defined his youth and literary career. Traveling incognito to gather material for "Life on the Mississippi," Twain found a river landscape dramatically altered by time and the rise of railroads, which were eclipsing the steamboat era he cherished. Despite the changes and the squalor of the boats, being back in a pilot house evoked a powerful sense of nostalgia and freedom. The experience highlighted the paradox of Twain's life: the more famous he became, the more he longed for his past.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, Mark Twain's full, unexpurgated autobiography is being published a century after his death in 1910. The work, dictated by Twain over several years, was intentionally delayed to allow him to speak freely about his contemporaries without causing immediate personal offense. The unconventional, non-linear narrative contains candid and often harsh opinions on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt, as well as raw reflections on his family and personal heartbreak. Editors at UC Berkeley have spent years compiling the massive text, which reveals Twain's pioneering, blog-like approach to storytelling and his brilliant marketing foresight.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris predicts a highly competitive British Grand Prix, suggesting a six-car fight for the win between McLaren, Red Bull, Mercedes, and Ferrari. Qualifying was extremely close, with the top six drivers separated by just 0.23 seconds, and teams have opted for different car setups, creating strategic variability. Red Bull's Max Verstappen, who took pole position, has a car configured for high straight-line speed, while Ferrari and McLaren have focused more on cornering performance. This diversity in approach, combined with the potential for rain, sets the stage for a thrilling and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, as it introduced the new concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the nation's founding was a messy, violent civil war, and understanding this complexity makes the emergence of its ideals even more inspiring. Burns argued that patriotism requires engaging with the nation's flaws, like slavery, to have a fuller, more powerful understanding of its story. He believes history is the best teacher for navigating current divisions, reminding us that the U.S. has always been a work in progress.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry to ChatGPT about tax fairness revealed that while the wealthiest Americans pay a similar or higher federal income tax rate than the middle class, the system fundamentally favors wealth over work. Billionaires benefit from lower tax rates on capital gains and can use strategies like "buy-borrow-die," where they live off tax-free loans secured against their appreciating assets. This allows wealth to grow largely untaxed, a privilege not available to wage earners whose income is taxed immediately. The AI concluded the core issue is not the tax rates themselves, but how different forms of income are treated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently explained her decision to raise her two children as a single parent, citing her personal history and self-awareness. Growing up in a home with alcoholism and a tumultuous parental relationship made her want to avoid repeating those cycles for her own family. Theron also recognized her tendency to "lose herself" in relationships, often placating narcissistic partners rather than engaging in healthy conflict. Relationship experts praise her choice as a sign of strength and alignment, reflecting a modern reality where partnership is a preference, not a necessity for women.</p>
