          <p>The White House is reportedly in discussions with Qatar to receive a luxury Boeing 747-8 jet, potentially for use as Air Force One. The plane, estimated to be worth $400 million, would be donated to Trump's presidential library after his term. This proposal has raised legal and ethical questions, with critics accusing Trump of potential ethics violations. The White House defends the negotiations, stating that any gift from a foreign government would be accepted in compliance with applicable laws and that the offer was for his use at no cost.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated that he expects to meet with Chinese officials again in the coming weeks to continue trade negotiations following a 90-day pause on tariffs. This decision resulted from a meeting in Switzerland between Bessent, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, and Chinese officials. The 90-day pause involves both countries lowering their baseline tariff rate by 115 percentage points to 10%, while the 20% fentanyl-related tariff from the U.S. remains. Bessent also noted a "very long and in-depth sidebar" regarding fentanyl, expressing optimism that China is serious about assisting the U.S. in stopping the flow of precursor drugs.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement to temporarily reduce tariffs on each other's goods for 90 days, as both countries continue negotiations to resolve their trade differences. Under the agreement, the U.S. will reduce tariffs on Chinese imports to 30% from 145%, while China will lower import duties on American goods to 10% from 125%. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent emphasized that neither side wants a decoupling of their economies, and ongoing negotiations will involve key officials from both countries. While this agreement provides a temporary reprieve for businesses, economists warn that repercussions will linger, potentially leading to transport price increases as companies rush to schedule shipments during the negotiating window.</p>

          <p>An article explores the parallels between the 1926 disappearance and alleged kidnapping of evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson and modern influencer scandals, such as that of Katie Sorensen, who falsely accused a Latino couple of attempted kidnapping. McPherson, like Sorensen, built a career on openness and accessibility, and her story, including blaming a Latino couple for her abduction, highlights themes of ambition, technology, and authenticity. The article draws on Claire Hoffman's biography of McPherson, "Sister, Sinner," to examine McPherson's life as a proto-influencer, noting her savvy use of media and her creation of a feminine brand of proselytizing.</p>
