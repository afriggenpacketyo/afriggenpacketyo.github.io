A recent study confirmed that Ronan can still keep a beat, even better than when she was younger, and outperformed human participants in some tests. Researchers tested Ronan's ability to synchronize with percussion beats, showcasing her flexibility in recognizing new rhythms. This research challenges the long-held belief that only vocal learners can learn to find a beat, highlighting Ronan's unique rhythmic talents. </p>
