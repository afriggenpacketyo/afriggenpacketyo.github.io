          <p>President Donald Trump delivered the commencement speech at West Point, praising graduates and highlighting his administration's agenda, including building in America and strengthening national security. He criticized past administrations for involving the military in nation-building missions and praised his administration's rollback of diversity, equity, and inclusion programs. Trump emphasized that critical race theory and transgender policies would no longer be imposed on the military, also stating that the military is in a 'golden age' of America. The speech sparked protests and criticism from former West Point teachers, who argued that DEI programs did not inhibit the values of the academies.</p>

          <p>The Pentagon briefly lost contact with an Army Black Hawk helicopter on May 1, causing two commercial jets to abort their landings at a Washington airport. The 20-second loss of contact occurred due to a temporary antenna's location, which hindered communication as the helicopter approached the Pentagon. Despite the incident, the Army stated that there were no deviations from approved flight paths and no risk of intersecting air traffic. The FAA also announced that helicopters would be permanently restricted from flying on the same route where the collision occurred. </p>

          <p>California has begun filling a complex of shallow ponds near the Salton Sea to create wetlands, aiming to suppress dust and provide habitat for wildlife. The project, costing $200 million, is intended to cover 2,000 acres initially, with plans to expand to over 9,000 acres using additional federal funds. The Salton Sea has been shrinking, leading to increased dust pollution in nearby communities and declining fish and bird populations. This project is part of a larger effort to address environmental problems resulting from water diversion agreements.</p>
