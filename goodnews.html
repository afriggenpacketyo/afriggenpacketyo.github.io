          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-12 20:38:02 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a plan to lower prescription drug prices in the U.S. to match those of other high-income countries, threatening price caps on Medicare reimbursements if pharmaceutical companies don't comply. He claims this "most favored nation" approach could reduce prices by 50% to 90% almost immediately. The pharmaceutical industry opposes this, arguing it would stifle innovation and give foreign governments control over U.S. drug pricing. Pharmacy benefit managers praised Trump's recognition of the price issue, though the plan also aims to cut out these 'middlemen' by allowing direct purchases from manufacturers.

          <p>An Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) report, obtained and published by the Environmental Defense Fund after the EPA failed to release it, shows that the U.S. is not reducing greenhouse gas emissions quickly enough to meet its climate goals. The report, analyzing data from 1990-2023, indicates that gross emissions dropped 17% since 2005, but a 61-66% reduction is needed by 2035. Concerns are rising that the Trump administration's policies, which prioritize fossil fuels and weaken clean energy investments, could reverse the progress made in reducing emissions from the transportation and electric power sectors. The transportation sector currently produces the most carbon dioxide emissions, followed by the electric power sector.</p>

Alexander, who grew up in New Jersey before serving in the Israeli military, was abducted during the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023. The release occurred as President Trump departed for a trip to the Middle East, and Hamas stated it was a goodwill gesture towards a lasting ceasefire and humanitarian aid to Gaza.

The legislation faces opposition from some House Republicans over the proposed state and local tax deduction limit.

Simultaneously, Japanese scientists are building Hyper K, an advanced version of their existing neutrino detector. Both projects aim to determine if neutrinos and anti-neutrinos change differently as they travel, potentially revealing why matter prevailed over antimatter after the Big Bang.</p>
