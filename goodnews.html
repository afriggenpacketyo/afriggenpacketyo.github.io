          <p>China is strategically focusing on "future industries" to create a new economic model based on technological innovation. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this initiative targets sectors with nascent but high-potential technologies. In 2024, the government expanded its focus to include areas like humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft. This push aims to secure a leading position for China in the global technology race by fostering breakthroughs in key emerging fields.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Start-ups like London-based Better Dairy are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation to produce casein, the key protein in milk, without involving animals. While the current market for plant-based alternatives is declining due to concerns over taste, price, and processing, these companies believe their products can bridge the quality gap. They aim to first target commercial uses, like on frozen pizzas, before making their products available to consumers in the coming years. The ultimate success of this new food technology will depend on overcoming regulatory hurdles and winning over consumer perception.</p>

          <p>A woman from Norfolk, Jess Basey-Fisher, successfully found her long-lost older brother after learning of his existence following their mother's death. Her mother had given him up for adoption as a baby, a secret she kept for her entire life. After a search using Ancestry.com and social workers, Jess connected with her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, who now lives in Australia. Shortly after they connected, Alistair was diagnosed with stage four lung cancer, prompting Jess to travel to Australia to spend time with him and his family.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, prohibiting immigration officials from conducting "indiscriminate" arrests of individuals suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The ruling states that arrests cannot be based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or speaking Spanish. The order stems from a lawsuit filed by immigrants and U.S. citizens who were detained at a bus stop. This judicial action represents a significant check on the administration's intensified immigration enforcement efforts, particularly in California.</p>

          <p>While artificial intelligence is often cited as a factor exacerbating China's declining birth rate by reducing the need for human companionship and care, some experts are reframing the narrative. The article highlights individuals who feel more confident choosing a single, child-free life, believing AI will eventually provide emotional support and affordable elderly care. A leading demography expert argues that this technological revolution could redefine traditional family structures and concepts of life and death. This perspective suggests that concerns about population decline might become obsolete in an AI-driven future.</p>

          <p>A campaign is growing in the UK to require cosmetic and skincare companies to list ingredients in English rather than the standard Latin-based nomenclature. Advocates, including an MP with a severe nut allergy, argue that the current system puts consumers at risk because many people cannot recognize potential allergens in their Latin forms. Families shared experiences of allergic reactions caused by misinterpreting labels. While the industry association defends the Latin system for providing global consistency, campaigners are pushing for clearer, more accessible labeling similar to that used for food products.</p>
