          <p>AppLovin experienced a significant increase in share value after exceeding earnings and revenue projections and declaring the sale of its mobile gaming division to Tripledot Studios for $400 million in cash, acquiring a 20% stake in Tripledot. The advertising tech company's first-quarter net income rose to $576 million, a substantial increase from the previous year, driven by strong advertising sales. However, AppLovin anticipates lower second-quarter advertising sales compared to analyst expectations, influencing investor sentiment. The company's total costs and expenses also saw a 14% increase compared to the same quarter last year, reflecting ongoing investments in its core advertising technology business.</p>

          <p>President Trump has withdrawn the nomination of Ed Martin for U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., following unified opposition from Senate Democrats and pushback from some Republicans. Martin, who had been serving as the interim U.S. Attorney, faced criticism for his views on the January 6th Capitol attack and past associations. Senator Thom Tillis cited Martin's stance on January 6th as the reason he could not support the nomination, emphasizing the importance of condemning the events of that day. The U.S. Attorney's office in D.C. is considered one of the most important federal law enforcement roles in the country.</p>

Biden mentioned that he and Harris have a close relationship and speak frequently, but avoided discussing her future political ambitions.

The negotiations could involve sensitive issues such as UK restrictions on US agricultural exports and Trump's tariffs on foreign film shoots. British ambassador Lord Mandelson characterized the deal as "the end of the beginning," indicating further work is needed to reduce tariffs and trade barriers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners considering a HELOC this May should be aware of minimum draw requirements, which can significantly impact the cost-effectiveness of this borrowing option. Lenders may require an upfront draw, even if the borrower doesn't immediately need the funds, potentially leading to unnecessary interest charges. Ongoing minimum usage requirements during the draw period can also force borrowers to maintain a certain balance or make periodic withdrawals. Understanding these rules is crucial to avoid additional fees, interest costs, and complications with repayment plans, ensuring that a HELOC aligns with the borrower's financial needs and goals.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a trade agreement with the United Kingdom, marking the first deal since pausing "reciprocal" tariffs. The agreement includes keeping a 10% tariff on UK imports, adjusting tariffs on UK autos, and creating a $5 billion opportunity for new exports for U.S. farmers. It also commits both countries to enhancing market access, streamlining customs procedures, and establishing commitments on intellectual property and labor. Despite the announcement, some experts downplayed the deal's impact, and negotiations are ongoing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recent UK-US tariff agreement, while economically small, is seen as strategically significant as it leaves the UK open to pursue a more comprehensive deal with the European Union. The agreement addresses some trade damages caused by Trump's tariffs, particularly for the car industry, and reduces overall tariffs on UK goods. By maintaining UK food standards, the agreement paves the way for a full food and farm export deal with the EU, which could significantly reduce post-Brexit red tape. The UK government hopes to project an image of trade and political stability, fostering economic growth and improved trade relations.</p>

Trump declared on social media this announcement would be a "major trade deal" - it's not. What was announced today is only the bare bones of a narrow agreement.

          <p>An underwater volcano off the coast of Oregon, known as Axial Seamount, shows signs of an impending eruption, according to scientists monitoring its activity. A recent increase in earthquakes and swelling of the volcano suggest it could erupt anytime between now and the end of the year. While the eruption poses no danger to humans due to its remote location and depth, it could be a spectacular event, with significant lava flows. Scientists are using Axial Seamount as a natural laboratory to refine eruption forecasting tools.</p>
