          <p>Ben Stokes helped England's cause after Harry Brook scored 99 runs on the third day of the first Test at Headingley. Stokes dismissed Sai Sudharsan, leaving India at 90-2 with a lead of 96 runs at the close of play. Brook's innings, marked by aggressive strokes and two dropped catches, ended when he top-edged a hook to long leg. Jasprit Bumrah's bowling performance helped bowl England out for 465, giving India a first-innings lead of six runs.</p>

          <p>Middle Eastern markets mostly closed higher on Sunday following the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Stocks in Tel Aviv reached an all-time high, driven by optimism that Washington's intervention would help resolve the conflict. Saudi Arabia's Tadawul experienced initial gains before closing slightly lower, while Qatar and Bahrain saw modest increases. Egypt's EGX30 index was a major regional gainer, closing significantly higher. An expert suggested the Gulf region's call for appeasement and condemnation of Israeli aggression has helped it isolate itself from the conflict, minimizing short-term market impact.

          <p>A parenting expert, after studying over 200 parent-child relationships, suggests avoiding phrases that trigger defiance in children and using language that promotes cooperation. The expert recommends replacing phrases like "Because I said so" with explanations, and threats with opportunities for choice. Dismissing emotions should be replaced with empathy, and frustrated questions with problem-solving. The expert emphasizes creating conditions where cooperation feels natural by fostering respect, emotional safety, and involvement.</p>

The Rockets would be Durant‚Äôs fifth team, and he can sign a two-year extension worth up to $122m when the new league year starts in July.

          <p>Spain has reached an agreement with NATO to be excluded from the alliance's 5% of GDP defense spending target, according to Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. Sanchez stated that a 5% spending would be disproportionate and unnecessary for Spain, which can meet its NATO commitments with 2.1% of its GDP. The agreement comes after Spain initially opposed the increased spending target, raising concerns about derailing the upcoming NATO summit. Spain had the lowest proportion of expenditure on defense in the alliance last year, estimated at 1.28% of GDP.</p>

          <p>Tesla's robotaxi service is set to debut today, with a select group of people given the chance to ride in its Model Y Robotaxis in Austin, Texas. The pilot will likely involve a small number of cars and rides will take place in a "geofenced area" in Austin. The robotaxi event comes just weeks after Musk stepped back from the Department of Government Efficiency, the Trump administration's cost-cutting effort. The robotaxi rollout could help Tesla reach a $2 trillion market cap by the end of 2026, or double its current valuation, according to one analyst.</p>

          <h2>NATO Members Agree to Increase Defense Spending to 5% with Spanish Exemption</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-22 12:40:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO members have agreed to increase defense spending to 5% of their countries' GDP, a benchmark long sought by the US. The deal was reached after Spain secured an exemption, claiming the rise to 5% was "disproportionate and unnecessary." The agreement calls for at least 3.5% of national GDP to be spent on core military needs, while an additional 1.5% can be allocated for related expenditures. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez had faced political pressure at home, where a corruption scandal threatens his government.</p>
