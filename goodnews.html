          <p>Following the launch of the new GPT-5 model, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman stated the company will prioritize growth and investment in training and compute power, even if it means operating at a loss for the foreseeable future. Altman believes that as long as the AI models continue to improve significantly, it is rational to delay profitability. Despite expecting substantial losses, the company's annual recurring revenue is projected to exceed $20 billion this year, and it is reportedly in talks for a new stock sale at a valuation around $500 billion.</p>

          <p>Arsenal's 18-year-old attacking midfielder, Ethan Nwaneri, has signed a new five-year contract with the Premier League club, extending his commitment beyond his previous deal which was set to expire in 2026. Nwaneri famously became the youngest player in Premier League history in 2022 at the age of 15. During a breakout campaign last season, he made 37 appearances and scored nine goals across all competitions for the Gunners. He also contributed to England Under-21s' successful European Championship title defense.</p>

          <p>Shares for rare earth miner MP Materials surged after the company reported narrower second-quarter losses, driven by record production of neodymium-praseodymium (NdPr) oxide. This key material is essential for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles and electronics. The company's sales jumped 84% to $57.4 million, and it is ramping up magnet production at its Texas facility to supply General Motors. The positive results follow a major investment from the U.S. Defense Department, which is now the company's largest shareholder and has set a price floor for its products. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article provides an overview of current interest rates for Certificates of Deposit (CDs), highlighting them as a tool for savers to combat inflation. While national average yields for one-to-five-year terms are relatively low, top online banks are offering significantly higher rates, with some short-term CDs exceeding 4.40% APY. The piece notes the current "inverted yield curve" phenomenon, where short-term CDs often have higher rates than long-term ones. It suggests strategies like shopping at online banks and laddering CDs to maximize returns in the current economic environment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The common summer herb basil offers significant health benefits beyond its culinary uses, according to registered dietitians and scientific research. Rich in antioxidants and vitamin K, basil can help strengthen bones, support blood clotting, and may help prevent chronic diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Studies have shown that compounds in basil can reduce high blood pressure, improve cholesterol, and even inhibit the growth of colon cancer cells. While more human research is needed, incorporating basil into one's diet is presented as a simple way to boost overall health.</p>

          <p>The James Webb Space Telescope has detected strong evidence of a giant gas planet in the Alpha Centauri system, the nearest star system to our own at just four-and-a-half light years away. Although the planet itself, similar to Jupiter or Saturn, would be uninhabitable, it could potentially have moons capable of sustaining life. The potential planet was briefly detected last year before disappearing from view, likely due to the brightness of its host star. Astronomers are excited by the discovery and will conduct follow-up observations to confirm its existence and study its composition.</p>

          <p>A recent Emerson College poll reveals that a large portion of California's electorate remains undecided about the 2026 governor's race and a potential ballot measure to redraw congressional districts. In the gubernatorial field, former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter leads with 18%, but 38% of voters are undecided. Regarding the controversial proposal to redraw congressional maps mid-decade, which Democrats are considering to counter GOP efforts in other states, voters are split, with 42% unsure. The poll indicates that with the primary still ten months away, voter opinions are far from settled on these key state issues.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook appeared with President Donald Trump to announce a plan to spend $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as an effort to appease the administration's push for American manufacturing. While Cook did not commit to the final assembly of iPhones in the U.S., he highlighted that key components like glass and sensors are already made by American suppliers. The announcement, which included an exemption for Apple from new chip tariffs, was viewed by experts as a savvy maneuver to avoid political pressure while symbolically supporting U.S. jobs and production.</p>
