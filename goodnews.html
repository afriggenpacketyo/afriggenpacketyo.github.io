        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing expectations despite concerns over President Donald Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and the labor force participation rate ticked higher. Health care led job creation, followed by transportation, warehousing, and financial activities, while the federal government saw a decline in employment. Average hourly earnings rose 0.2% for the month, below forecasts, suggesting a stable but not overheating labor market. The strong job numbers have led traders to push back expectations for an interest rate cut.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil reported first-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street estimates, although profits declined compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting measures, helped offset the impact of weaker oil prices. CEO Darren Woods noted that demand was strong, but higher supply depressed prices, and Trump's tariffs have raised uncertainty about future demand. The company's global production increased by 20%, and it returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.</p>

          <p>Temu, the online marketplace, will cease selling goods imported directly from China to U.S. customers, transitioning to a model where sales are handled by locally based sellers and orders are fulfilled within the country. This change comes as the U.S. closes a duty-free rule for low-value packages, which Temu and Shein previously utilized to avoid duties and import taxes. Temu has been actively recruiting U.S. firms to join its platform to facilitate this shift, aiming to support local merchants and expand their reach. The move aligns with efforts to address concerns about illegal goods and potential damage to American businesses.</p>

          <p>Employers in the U.S. added 177,000 jobs in April, surpassing analyst forecasts and indicating a healthy labor market despite economic uncertainty stemming from the Trump administration's trade policies. The unemployment rate remained steady at 4.2%, and the health care and transportation/warehousing sectors saw significant gains. However, federal employment declined due to cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Concerns remain about the impact of trade wars and tight immigration policies on future job growth, with some data suggesting rising jobless claims.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry lost his latest legal battle to have his official security detail reinstated when visiting the United Kingdom, following a court ruling that upheld the British government's decision to scale back his taxpayer-funded protection. Harry's security was downgraded after he stepped down as a working member of the royal family and moved to the United States. He argued that private bodyguards are insufficient, as they cannot carry guns or access government security networks, but the court concluded that his concerns did not constitute a legal argument for challenging the prior decision.</p>

          <p>Hiring in the US slowed in April, with 177,000 jobs added, as the Trump administration's aggressive trade strategy clouded the economic outlook. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at 4.2%, but job gains for February and March were revised down. The report comes amid concerns about the impact of tariffs on the US economy and sweeping cuts to the federal workforce. The health of the job market will be an important factor in whether the economy continues to shrink or begins to rebound.</p>

          <p>British oil giant Shell reported stronger-than-expected first-quarter profit and announced another $3.5 billion share buyback program, despite earnings falling compared to the same period last year. Shell's adjusted earnings were $5.58 billion for the first three months of the year, beating analyst expectations. The company reaffirmed its reduced annual investment budget of $20 billion to $22 billion for 2025, and Shell CEO Wael Sawan described the earnings as "another solid set of results."</p>

          <p>Roche struck a $5.3 billion deal to co-develop Zealand Pharma's "next generation" weight loss candidate, petrelintide. The drug is an amylin analog that could potentially offer superior tolerability and lean muscle preservation compared to current GLP-1 obesity drugs. The Roche-Zealand deal will see the two companies co-develop and co-commercialize petrelintide as both a standalone treatment and as a combo-therapy with Roche's lead incretin asset CT-388.
