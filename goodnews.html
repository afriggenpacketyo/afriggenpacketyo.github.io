          <p>China is intensifying its efforts to secure copper supplies from Africa, a mineral crucial for the global green energy transition. Recognizing copper's importance for electric vehicles and solar power, Chinese companies are heavily investing in mining and processing facilities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Zambia, and now Botswana. This strategic push is partly a response to Western restrictions on critical mineral acquisitions, particularly from Canada. The investments aim to ensure China maintains a stable supply chain for its expanding new energy sector.</p>

The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, finding that the administration lacks the authority to vacate a TPS designation before its official expiration in February 2026. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, while advocates argue that Haiti remains unsafe for return due to persistent gang violence and instability.</p>
