          <p>A chief economist at a major Chinese investment bank has identified the country's mature third-party payment platforms, like WeChat Pay and Alipay, as a significant competitive edge in the developing global stablecoin landscape. The economist, Peng Wensheng, noted that these platforms already function similarly to stablecoins, being extensions of legal tender pegged 1:1 with fiat currency. He argued that their established regulatory frameworks and safeguards, which back customer funds with central bank base money, provide a more stable foundation for digital currency innovation. This perspective emerges as Chinese state media encourages policymakers to be proactive in the global digital currency debate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Harvard University's Kennedy School and the University of Toronto's Munk School have created a partnership to support international graduate students who may be barred from re-entering the United States. This move responds to potential visa restrictions and a legal dispute between Harvard and the Department of Homeland Security over student records. Under the plan, affected Harvard students could continue their studies as visiting students in Toronto, taking courses from faculty at both institutions. The program aims to provide stability and educational continuity for students amid uncertainty over US immigration policies and enforcement actions.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced plans to eliminate 201 organizations responsible for overseeing and running parts of the National Health Service (NHS) in England. The move, part of Labour's new ten-year health strategy, aims to simplify a system that Health Secretary Wes Streeting described as overly complex, shifting focus from "checkers" to "doers." Among the bodies to be scrapped are Healthwatch England, a patient advocacy group, and the National Guardian's Office, which supports whistleblowers. The strategy also includes bringing NHS England under closer government control and trialing a system that links hospital funding directly to patient satisfaction ratings.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery, reportedly reduces risks and recovery time. The procedure involved guiding a stent electrode through a neck vein into the brain's vasculature, successfully helping a 67-year-old patient, paralyzed by a stroke, regain some limb movement. This advancement represents a significant step forward in neurotechnology, offering a potentially safer alternative for connecting the human brain to computers and treating neurological conditions.</p>

          <p>A Shandong Airlines flight traveling from Qingdao to Shanghai was forced to make an emergency landing in Nanjing due to an aircraft malfunction. Passengers reported hearing loud bangs and smelling a burning odor before the plane began to shake, prompting the crew to divert the flight. The airline confirmed the incident, stating the crew handled the situation according to safety procedures and that all passengers were safely accommodated. A passenger praised the pilots for their smooth handling of the emergency, which was allegedly caused by an object being sucked into the aircraft's left engine during cruising altitude.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, securing a victory despite what their manager described as an incomplete performance. The game featured early home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy, but was also marked by defensive errors and a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May. The Dodgers' bullpen managed to hold off the Royals, culminating in a game-ending double play with the bases loaded in the ninth inning. The win moved the Dodgers into sole possession of the best record in Major League Baseball, highlighting their ability to win games even when not playing at their peak.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people who regularly consume a Japanese-style diet. The research, conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security, assessed diets including rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables. While further research is needed, the findings suggest a potential link between these dietary patterns and improved mental well-being. Researchers theorize that nutrients like the omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables may contribute to this effect by assisting in the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine.</p>

          <p>Police have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey, 33, was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence and will be transferred to a secure state facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has led to heavy criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. Only one inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest. At least 16 other individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates after their escape.</p>

Built in 1908 by the Russian Empire, the structure is the only surviving consulate of its kind in Japan from that era and was featured in the popular manga "Golden Kamuy." Now named Hotel Biaclyn Hakodate, the six-suite wellness retreat blends the building's original Western architecture with new Japanese design elements, including private saunas in each suite.
