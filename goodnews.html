          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of USD Coin (USDC), priced its initial public offering at $31 per share, exceeding the expected range of $27 to $28, valuing the company at $6.8 billion. The IPO will raise $1.05 billion through the sale of 34 million shares by Circle, its founder, and original shareholders. Demand was high, leading to an increase in the number of shares offered from the initial 32 million. Circle stock will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "CRCL." Cathie Wood's ARK Investment Management has expressed interest in purchasing up to $150 million of the shares. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Guatemalan man, identified as OCG, who was deported to Mexico despite fearing persecution there, has been flown back to the US following a judge's order. The US Department of Justice admitted that its claim that the man had stated he was not afraid of being sent to Mexico was based on erroneous information. OCG, who is gay, had applied for asylum in the US after facing homophobic acts of violence in Guatemala. The Trump administration said federal immigration officials were working to bring OCG back to the United States. Another federal judge ruled that the Trump administration must give more than 100 migrants sent to a prison in El Salvador a chance to challenge their deportations.</p>

          <p>Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally whose nomination for NASA was withdrawn by President Trump, stated that his "brief stint in politics was a thrilling experience." Isaacman is resigning as CEO of Shift4 Payments to become executive chairman. Trump cited a "thorough review of prior associations" as the reason for withdrawing the nomination, possibly referring to Isaacman's past donations to Democrats. Isaacman suggested the timing of the withdrawal was related to Musk's criticism of Trump's tax-cut bill. He has led two private spaceflights through SpaceX and Shift4 invested in SpaceX. The article provides insight into the political dynamics between Musk, Trump, and Isaacman.</p>

          <p>Egypt's foreign minister assured Greece that Egypt will preserve the spiritual and religious value of Saint Catherine's Monastery, a Greek Orthodox church landmark, amidst a land dispute. The statement came after an Egyptian court ruling raised concerns among Orthodox Christian leaders that the monastery's land could be confiscated. The court affirmed the monks' right to use the monastery and religious sites, but ruled that the land is public. Both Egypt and Greece agreed to work together to protect the monastery's rights and legal status. The monastery, established in the sixth century, is religiously and historically significant, housing a large collection of rare manuscripts and said to contain the biblical burning bush.</p>

McMahon said that the administration has been actively communicating with Harvard and that the school has complied with some orders to end discrimination. The conflict stems from the administration's joint task force on antisemitism, which froze federal funding to the institution. Harvard's lawsuit against the administration has stalled negotiations. The administration claims that antisemitism is a civil rights violation and is working to provide Jewish students a "safe environment."</p>

Scientists believe F. graminearum originated in North America and is distributed worldwide due to grain distribution. Farmers rely on fungicides to mitigate the risk of the disease.
