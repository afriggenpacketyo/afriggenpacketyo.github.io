          <p>Leonardo "Flaco" Jimenez, the renowned master of the Tex-Mex accordion, has passed away at the age of 86. Over a career spanning more than seven decades, Jimenez became a global ambassador for conjunto music, a sound rooted in the German polka influences of South Texas. He learned the instrument from his father, a pioneer of the genre, and went on to collaborate with a diverse range of international stars, including Ry Cooder, Bob Dylan, and the Rolling Stones. Despite his global fame and multiple Grammy awards, he remained a beloved figure in his hometown of San Antonio, celebrated for his ecstatic, roots-driven musical style.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The competition for executive talent among family offices is intensifying, leading to more structured and generous compensation packages. A new report from Morgan Stanley reveals that a majority of these private wealth management firms now use long-term incentive plans, such as co-investment opportunities and carried interest, to attract and retain top professionals. This trend has significantly boosted pay, with CEOs at larger investment-focused family offices now earning a median of over $1.2 million annually. The shift reflects a move away from informal agreements towards more formalized, performance-based compensation structures. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chevron reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, despite a 44% decline in net income compared to the previous year due to lower crude oil prices. The company's strong performance was bolstered by record production, particularly in the Permian Basin, which helped offset the impact of weaker prices. Chevron recently completed its $53 billion acquisition of Hess Corporation after a favorable arbitration ruling, and it expects the deal to start contributing to earnings by the fourth quarter. The energy giant also highlighted its shareholder returns, paying out $5.5 billion through dividends and buybacks. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in China have significantly improved the durability of modern artillery by refining a 2,000-year-old anti-corrosion technology. The technique, originally observed on well-preserved bronze swords from the Terracotta Army, involves applying a thin layer of chromium salts. By adapting this ancient method, scientists have created a modern chromium plating process that combats the extreme heat and pressure inside cannon barrels. According to a defense journal, this innovation has successfully doubled the service life of high-pressure artillery, addressing a persistent challenge of barrel erosion and microcracking in advanced weaponry.</p>

          <p>In an unusual move within the rock music world, Foo Fighters and Nine Inch Nails have effectively swapped drummers. Foo Fighters have hired Ilan Rubin, who recently played with Nine Inch Nails, to replace Josh Freese, who had taken over after the death of Taylor Hawkins. Shortly after, Nine Inch Nails announced they had re-hired Freese, who previously drummed for them from 2005 to 2008, just in time for their upcoming North American tour. Both Freese and the bands have released statements expressing excitement about the new arrangements, marking a notable and amicable lineup change for two of rock's biggest acts.</p>

          <p>Founded in 1903, the same year as Ford Motor Company, Pewabic Pottery in Detroit has survived over a century by focusing on handcrafted quality rather than mass production. Adhering to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles, the pottery is renowned for its unique, iridescent glazes and architectural tiles found in buildings across the U.S. Despite Detroit's economic turmoil, Pewabic has remained in its original location, continuing to use historic equipment to hand-press tiles and throw vessels. Now operating as a nonprofit, the studio had its best year ever in 2024, demonstrating a renewed public appreciation for artisanal goods.</p>

          <p>Political commentator and Twitch streamer Hasan Piker is examined as a significant voice for progressivism online, particularly among young men. The article discusses whether Piker, sometimes called a "himbo gateway drug to leftist thought," serves as a left-wing counterpart to right-leaning figures like Joe Rogan. Piker himself argues that masculinity is not inherently tied to right-wing politics and criticizes the idea that hobbies like gaming are apolitical. He contends that Democrats need to focus on substantive policy changes to win over voters rather than searching for a charismatic media figure to solve their problems.</p>

          <p>The United States and Pakistan have announced a new agreement to jointly develop Pakistan's oil reserves, a move that signals a shift toward a more economically focused partnership. The deal was unveiled alongside a broader trade agreement and a new, lower 19% U.S. tariff rate for Pakistani imports. While the extent of Pakistan's "massive" oil reserves is unclear, the partnership is seen as a way to attract investment and advanced technology. The deal also has geopolitical implications, potentially serving as a U.S. counterweight to China's significant economic influence in the region through the CPEC project.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is planning a pilot program to cover popular weight loss drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy under Medicare and Medicaid. This five-year experimental plan would allow government health insurance programs for low-income and elderly Americans to cover the cost of these GLP-1 medications for weight management. The move aims to address the nation's high obesity rates but faces challenges due to the drugs' high costs, which can exceed $5,000 per year. The initiative, slated to begin in 2026, marks a potential shift in federal policy, as coverage for these drugs for weight loss alone is currently restricted.</p>
