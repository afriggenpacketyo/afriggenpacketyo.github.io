          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-16 18:27:33 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Insurance has launched a formal investigation into State Farm's handling of wildfire claims following the Los Angeles fires, prompted by concerns about inconsistent claims management and inadequate communication. Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara highlighted troubling patterns, including frequent adjuster reassignments and inconsistent handling of similar claims. State Farm says it is cooperating with the investigation and believes a fair review will show customer satisfaction. The investigation comes after the approval of a 17% increase in home insurance premiums for State Farm customers, with the potential outcome of requiring State Farm to pay out previously denied claims and compensate for delayed payments.</p>

          <p>This article prompts readers to reflect on the significance of Juneteenth, now a national holiday, especially in light of recent rollbacks of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives under President Trump. NPR seeks to understand how people perceive the holiday's celebration within the current historical context. The holiday, also known as Jubilee Day, Freedom Day, Liberation Day, and Emancipation Day, gained prominence after the Black Lives Matter movement and became a part of nationwide efforts to promote diversity and inclusion across various sectors.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's termination of over $1 billion in NIH research grants was unlawful, citing racial discrimination and discrimination against the LGBTQ community. Judge William Young ordered the reinstatement of grants previously awarded to organizations and states that filed the lawsuit. The cuts, led by Elon Musk, targeted research with connections to diversity, equity, and inclusion, marking a departure from science-based review processes. The ruling only applies to some grants, with further claims to be ruled on after additional evidence is presented.</p>

The current law limits the SALT deduction to $10,000, a point of contention amid slim House Republican majority negotiations.
