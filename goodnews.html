          <p>The Milwaukee Brewers and Los Angeles Dodgers completed a trade while simultaneously facing each other on the field, an unusual occurrence in professional sports. The Dodgers sent outfielder Steward Berroa to the Brewers in exchange for cash considerations, an announcement made during the Brewers' extra-innings victory that sealed a series sweep. Berroa, who recently made his major league debut, had been designated for assignment by the Dodgers and will now join the Brewers organization. The trade adds an interesting footnote to a competitive series between the two National League teams.</p>

          <p>First responders successfully rescued 31 construction workers who were trapped underground following a tunnel collapse in the Wilmington area of Los Angeles. The incident occurred at the site of the Los Angeles Effluent Outfall Tunnel, a major infrastructure project, when a section of the tunnel caved in. Four workers bravely entered the tunnel after the collapse to assist their colleagues before rescue teams arrived. The Los Angeles Fire Department deployed its Urban Search and Rescue teams, and thankfully, all workers were brought to safety without any visible injuries.</p>

          <p>The famous red windmill sails of the Moulin Rouge in Paris have begun turning again for the first time in 14 months, delighting locals and tourists. The iconic blades collapsed in April 2024 due to a mechanical failure, but no one was injured. While new sails were installed in time for the Paris Olympics, a delayed motor replacement kept them stationary until now. The restart was celebrated with a street performance of the can-can by 60 dancers and a fireworks display, restoring a beloved feature of the Parisian skyline.</p>

          <h2>Political Strategist Claims to Identify Eight Key Words for Winning Campaign Slogans</h2>

          <p>A new book by political strategist Chris Bruni-Lowe claims to have identified a formula for effective political slogans by analyzing 20,000 global campaigns. He argues that eight specific words—people, better, democracy, new, time, strong, change, and together—serve as "emotional shortcuts" that resonate universally with voters. While not a guarantee of success, these words act as powerful building blocks for campaign messaging, as seen in past successful slogans. The article explores this concept, contrasting it with more bespoke slogans and noting the future impact of AI on political messaging.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have announced they will give away a new bobblehead featuring late Lakers superstar Kobe Bryant at their game on August 8. The design appears to be inspired by a 2009 promotional event where a beaming Bryant, in his full Lakers uniform, posed with a baseball bat. This tribute continues the Dodgers' tradition of honoring the basketball legend, who, along with his daughter Gianna and seven others, died in a 2020 helicopter crash. The team has previously held special jersey nights to celebrate Bryant's enduring legacy in Los Angeles sports.</p>

The expansion into Phoenix represents a direct challenge to Waymo and a critical step in Elon Musk's ambitious plans for a widespread autonomous ride-hailing network. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an interesting paradox, South Korea is experiencing a surge in demand for fertility treatments even as it grapples with the world's lowest birth rate. The number of fertility procedures has risen nearly 50% in recent years, with experts attributing the trend to a generational shift where people desire more control over family planning. Many couples are delaying childbirth due to economic pressures, leading them to seek medical assistance like IVF later in life. This boom highlights a desire for children that persists despite societal and financial barriers.</p>

          <p>Levi Strauss & Co. has raised its full-year revenue and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand for its products. The denim maker announced it will absorb some of the financial impact from new U.S. tariffs to protect consumers from price increases, a strategy aided by strong international sales and a shift towards more full-price selling. While the company's forecast accounts for some tariffs, executives acknowledge that the evolving trade landscape under President Trump creates uncertainty. The positive results and outlook caused the company's stock to rise in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>
