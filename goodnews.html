          <p>According to law professor Angela Zhang, U.S. tariffs are pushing China to innovate in technology by cutting costs and scaling up, as seen with open-sourcing AI models in response to chip embargos. Zhang anticipates similar strategies in electric vehicles, batteries, and renewable energy. Chinese companies are also expected to aggressively target markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, and deepen trade with Europe, potentially offering technology transfers for market access. Despite uncertainties, Zhang asserts that Chinese firms will face significant challenges under the current U.S. administration.</p>
