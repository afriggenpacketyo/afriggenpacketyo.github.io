          <h2>Mortgage Interest Rate Forecast for Fall 2025 Remains Uncertain Despite Potential Fed Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 11:37:56 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage interest rates, currently at 6.58% for a 30-year fixed rate, are expected to see minimal change even if the Federal Reserve implements a rate cut in September. Experts suggest that while a 0.25% Fed rate cut is likely "baked into the market," mortgage rates primarily follow the bond market, not directly the federal funds rate. Fannie Mae projects rates around 6.5% by year-end, with a slight decrease to 6.1% in 2026, while other forecasts anticipate rates closer to 6% by the end of 2025. A significant drop below 6% could trigger a surge in homebuyer demand, potentially pushing home prices higher. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners catcher Cal Raleigh made baseball history by becoming only the second switch-hitter ever, alongside legendary Mickey Mantle, to hit 50 home runs in a single season. Raleigh achieved this remarkable milestone with a powerful 419-foot blast during the Mariners' 9-6 victory over the San Diego Padres. The 28-year-old All-Star is now among an elite group, being the eighth player in MLB history to reach 50 homers before the end of August and the second Mariner, following Hall of Famer Ken Griffey Jr. His impressive season, featuring 30 home runs as a left-handed hitter and 20 as a right-handed hitter, underscores his significant impact and versatility on the field.</p>

          <h2>Trump's Tax Bill May Expand 0% Capital Gains Eligibility for 2025</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's "big beautiful bill" for 2025, while maintaining existing capital gains rates, is expected to broaden eligibility for the 0% capital gains bracket due to new deductions. Investors holding assets for over a year typically face rates of 0%, 15%, or 20% based on their taxable income, with an additional 3.8% surcharge for higher earners. Financial planners highlight a temporary $6,000 tax break for older Americans, which doubles to $12,000 for married couples, as a significant factor. This provision can substantially reduce taxable income, presenting a "golden opportunity" for qualifying individuals to realize profits from asset sales without triggering a tax liability.

          <p>A federal judge has dismissed the Trump administration's unprecedented lawsuit against all 15 federal judges of the Maryland district court, which challenged a standing order preventing the immediate deportation of migrants contesting their detentions. U.S. District Judge Thomas Cullen, appointed by President Trump, ruled that the Justice Department's challenge was improper, violating legal precedent and constitutional tradition by suing a co-equal branch of government. Cullen criticized the administration's "concerted effort to smear and impugn individual judges," suggesting the proper recourse would be to appeal specific decisions or petition the judicial council, rather than a broad lawsuit. The Maryland court's order was implemented to manage a surge in emergency lawsuits and ensure due process for detainees.</p>

          <p>Energy experts generally recommend adjusting your air conditioning thermostat a few degrees higher than normal when leaving home for several hours, rather than completely turning it off. While turning off the AC can save energy and money for extended periods, it carries risks such as mold growth in humid environments and increased wear on the system when it strains to rapidly recool the house. Adjusting the thermostat by 7-10 degrees Fahrenheit for eight hours daily can potentially yield up to 10% savings annually on heating and cooling costs. The most effective strategy depends on various factors, including local climate, home insulation quality, and the type of AC unit, with smart thermostats offering convenient optimization.</p>

This oral treatment offers a needle-free alternative to existing GLP-1 injections, potentially expanding access and supply in the lucrative weight loss market.

          <p>The student housing market is experiencing a significant shift, with rent growth slowing and luxury amenities losing their appeal as students and parents become more economy-conscious. According to Robert Bronstein, CEO of Scion, one of the largest student housing operators, both lower and higher-end markets are opting for more affordable and functional options. Students now prioritize co-working spaces and remote interview rooms over lavish features like golf simulators. This trend is coupled with accelerating investment in large, flagship public universities, which continue to see record enrollment growth and unmet housing needs, while new development has slowed due to higher costs.</p>

          <p>For individuals seeking to increase their calcium intake, experts highlight various non-dairy and less obvious food sources crucial for bone health, muscle function, and nerve signaling. Beyond traditional dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese, calcium can be found in fortified non-dairy milks, fruit juices, and cereals. Registered dietitians also recommend tofu made with calcium, as well as canned fish with bones like salmon and sardines. Certain vegetables such as kale, broccoli, and bok choy also contribute to calcium levels. Consulting a doctor about supplements is advised if dietary intake remains insufficient, emphasizing natural food sources as the primary method for nutrient absorption.</p>

French political influence has waned, with troops largely withdrawn, yet close economic ties and the controversial CFA franc currency system endure.

Langer, who boasts a strong Ashes record as both a player and coach, highlighted England's recent 2-2 draws against India and Australia, implying they failed to capitalize on opportunities to clinch those series. He firmly believes that England must adopt an aggressive approach, often dubbed "Bazball," to effectively challenge Australia's formidable bowling attack on their home grounds. Langer underscored that immense courage will be paramount for England to succeed against world-class bowlers such as Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, and Pat Cummins in the highly anticipated series.</p>

While critics have called it "saccharine," its success is undeniable, with over 424 million sold worldwide. The backlash, often directed at "basic" feminine tastes, reflects broader societal anxieties rather than just the drink's flavor, which many still find delicious.</p>
