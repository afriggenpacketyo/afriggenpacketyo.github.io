        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Actress Julie Bowen recently revealed that she has had a pacemaker since she was 29 years old due to a heart rhythm disorder called sick sinus syndrome. The "Modern Family" star explained on a podcast that her resting heart rate was dangerously low, often in the 30s, before the device was implanted. Her sister, who was in medical school at the time, first noticed the abnormality and urged her to see a cardiologist. Bowen realized the pacemaker was necessary to prevent her from passing out, potentially while driving.</p>

          <p>Representative Mark Green of Tennessee has announced his official resignation from Congress, effective July 20. This move further reduces the already slim Republican majority in the House of Representatives to 219-212, potentially complicating Speaker Mike Johnson's legislative agenda. Green, who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, stated he is leaving public service to start a private business focused on helping America compete against the Chinese Communist Party. His departure presents another challenge for the House GOP leadership in managing their narrow control of the chamber.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-05 18:00:16 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent executive order from President Donald Trump aims to curb the influence of Chinese drone manufacturers in the global market, continuing Washington's efforts to challenge Beijing's industry leadership. However, analysts and industry insiders note that China's dominant position makes its products difficult to remove from global supply chains. American firms that rely on drones for commercial purposes express concern that a ban could significantly raise costs, as there are few non-Chinese alternatives available. The move is seen by some as a negotiation tactic in the broader US-China economic competition.</p>

          <p>Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, appeared in public for the first time since the recent 12-day conflict with Israel, according to state media reports. He was shown on television greeting worshippers at a mosque in Tehran ahead of the Shia festival of Ashura. During the war, which involved Israeli strikes on Iranian nuclear sites and retaliatory Iranian attacks, Khamenei had only appeared in pre-recorded video messages, fueling speculation about his whereabouts. His public return is being heavily featured in Iranian media as a sign of stability and leadership.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced the creation of a new political party, the "America Party," aiming to provide an alternative for American voters. Following a poll on his social media platform, X, Musk stated the party could gain significant influence by targeting a small number of key congressional seats, thereby acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation. The move follows a public falling out between Musk and President Trump, particularly over a major spending bill. Musk envisions the party caucusing independently and engaging with both Democrats and Republicans to represent the "true will of the people."</p>

          <p>On July Fourth, lifeguards at Newport Beach, California, performed a massive rescue operation, saving 350 people from dangerous surf conditions. One particularly hazardous "monster rip current" pulled more than ten swimmers far from shore, requiring a significant response from rescuers. The incident prompted the National Weather Service to issue warnings for strong rip currents and high surf along the Southern California coast through the holiday weekend. Authorities are urging beachgoers to exercise extreme caution as the hazardous conditions are expected to persist.</p>

          <p>Facing a nearly impossible target of 536 runs on the final day, England's cricket team may be forced to abandon its aggressive, win-at-all-costs "Bazball" approach in the second Test against India. To preserve their 1-0 series lead, England's most realistic option is to bat for a draw, a strategy they have staunchly rejected under the current leadership. Assistant coach Marcus Trescothick hinted at a potential shift, acknowledging that if a draw is possible, the team is not "stupid enough" to throw away the result. This situation presents the first major philosophical test for the team's defiant mantra.</p>

          <p>As per his own instructions, the autobiography of celebrated American author Mark Twain has been published 100 years after his death in 1910. The work, which Twain dictated over several years, was intentionally embargoed to allow him to speak freely without fear of hurting those he knew. The unconventional memoir is not a linear narrative but rather a collection of his thoughts on various subjects, including candid and often critical opinions on figures like President Theodore Roosevelt. This long-awaited publication offers an unfiltered look into the mind of one of America's most iconic literary figures.</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris anticipates a highly competitive British Grand Prix, suggesting that six cars from three different teams have a realistic chance of winning.

The teams have opted for different car setups, with Red Bull prioritizing straight-line speed while Ferrari and McLaren focus more on cornering performance. This strategic variation, combined with the potential for rain, sets the stage for an exciting and unpredictable race at Silverstone.</p>
