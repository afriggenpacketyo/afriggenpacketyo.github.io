          <p>Nine Democratic candidates for New York City mayor participated in their first debate, addressing key issues such as housing, affordability, and crime. Frontrunners Andrew Cuomo and Zohran Mamdani clashed over their records and campaign funding. Cuomo defended his handling of nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic and refuted sexual harassment allegations, while other candidates criticized current Mayor Eric Adams. The debate precedes the Democratic primary election later this month, where voters will use ranked-choice ballots.</p>

Kimmich acknowledged that Germany was not at 100 percent and deserved to lose. Ronaldo, playing his 220th game for Portugal, continues to thrive under pressure, leading his team to another Nations League final.</p>

          <p>A Chinese study of feather fossils trapped in Burmese amber has provided new insights into the evolution of flight feathers. The study, dating back 99 million years, shows how birds surpassed dinosaurs in conquering the skies. Researchers found that the development of feathers that generated thrust and lift was essential for bird evolution. While many dinosaurs had feathers, they lacked the same ability to fly as modern birds.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth can protect against dangerous infections. The study showed that specific bacteria, Bifidobacterium longum, halved the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute analyzed stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were more common in babies born via vaginal delivery.</p>

          <p>Women using weight-loss jabs like Wegovy and Mounjaro are being advised to stop if they are trying for a baby, are pregnant, or are breastfeeding. Drug safety experts in the UK cite unknown risks to unborn babies as the reason for the warning. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) advises using contraception while taking GLP-1 medicines and for a period afterward. Concerns exist about the drugs being used unsafely due to their growing popularity.</p>
