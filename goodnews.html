        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike CEO Elliott Hill stated that the company's turnaround strategy is showing early signs of success but will take time to restore profitable growth. In an interview, Hill acknowledged the process is not linear and involves revitalizing multiple brands and sports categories across different global markets. Since taking over, he has shifted focus back towards wholesale partners, reversing his predecessor's direct-to-consumer strategy, and restructured the company to focus on individual sports to spur innovation. Despite these efforts, Nike faces macroeconomic headwinds, including tariffs, which complicate its path back to consistent high-single-digit revenue growth.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Argentina's government has implemented stricter quality standards for sorghum exports, a strategic move designed to secure and expand its market share in China. The new regulations, which define grading rules based on weight and impurity limits, align Argentine standards with the demands of key international buyers. This policy shift comes after China became Argentina's primary sorghum destination, a role previously held by the United States before tariffs disrupted global trade patterns. The measure aims to prevent cargo rejections and enhance Argentina's reputation as a reliable supplier, potentially creating new trade tensions with the U.S.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite a widespread corporate push for returning to the office, many employees are resisting mandates through passive strategies like 'coffee badging,' where they appear at the office for just a few hours. Research from Stanford professor Nick Bloom indicates that work-from-home rates have remained stable since spring 2023, suggesting a growing gap between official policies and actual employee compliance. Workers are maintaining flexibility by making brief office appearances or adopting 'micro-shifting' schedules to fit personal needs. This trend highlights a persistent desire for autonomy, even as employers try to reassert control over the workplace.</p>

          <p>Instagram has launched a new awards program called 'Rings' to recognize 25 top creators with a physical gold ring and a special profile badge, but no cash prize. The winners will be selected by a panel including Instagram head Adam Mosseri and filmmaker Spike Lee. This initiative arrives as Meta has discontinued its Reels Play bonus program, a key income source for many creators, and as the broader creator economy faces a slowdown in brand deals. The move to offer symbolic recognition instead of direct financial support has raised questions about how the platform values its top talent.</p>

          <h2>New Tax Law Changes Could Affect Year-End Charitable Giving Strategies</h2>

          <p>Recent tax legislation signed by President Trump is set to alter the landscape for charitable donations, potentially impacting how taxpayers approach their year-end giving. A key change, effective in 2026, will introduce a new charitable tax break of up to $2,000 for non-itemizers, which may incentivize delaying smaller donations until then. Conversely, higher earners could see their charitable deduction benefits reduced in 2026 due to a new deduction floor and a cap on the benefit for top income brackets. Financial experts suggest that these changes warrant a multi-year approach to giving, with some recommending strategies like donor-advised funds to accelerate donations.</p>

Presiding judges found that Abd-Al-Rahman, also known as Ali Kushayb, encouraged and personally participated in the brutal attacks carried out by the militia.

One butcher also highlighted the porterhouse steak as a value proposition, as it provides both a New York strip and a large tenderloin section in a single cut.

The 2019 law, which imposed heavy fines on officers who enforced federal regulations without a state equivalent, had been blocked by lower courts for violating the Constitution's Supremacy Clause. The law was motivated by concerns over potential new federal gun restrictions and had disrupted a federal-state law enforcement partnership aimed at combating violent crime.
