        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karen Read was acquitted of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, after a highly publicized retrial in Massachusetts. The jury reached the verdict on their fourth day of deliberations; however, Read was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol. The case involved accusations that Read hit O'Keefe with her SUV in 2022 and left him to die, while the defense argued she was framed as part of an elaborate coverup involving law enforcement. The initial trial ended in a mistrial due to a hung jury, and the second trial included scrutiny of evidence and testimony, including text messages and Google searches.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tensions escalate between Iran and Israel, questions arise about the UK's potential role, given its close alliance with the US. While calling for de-escalation, the UK's influence is limited, especially after recent strains in relations with Israel due to sanctions. The UK maintains a diplomatic role, participating in talks with Iran alongside European allies and possessing military assets in the Middle East, including the Diego Garcia base and RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus. The use of Diego Garcia as a staging base for USAF B2 Spirit bombers, which can carry bunker-buster bombs, would require UK permission, while the UK's Royal Navy presence in the Gulf remains vital for keeping the Strait of Hormuz free from sea mines.</p>

          <p>Downtown Los Angeles restaurants are facing significant challenges due to recent curfews and demonstrations related to immigration policies, leading to a drop in reservations and boarded-up storefronts. Despite the curfew being lifted, many restaurants are still struggling to attract customers, with some experiencing substantial losses in bookings. The media's portrayal of downtown as unsafe has further impacted businesses, causing closures and canceled trips. Efforts are underway to encourage residents and visitors to support downtown businesses and revitalize the community, with some signs of recovery emerging as people begin to venture out again.</p>

          <p>Fox Corp. has acquired Caliente TV, a Mexican sports broadcasting platform, to expand its sports programming and attract more customers to its streaming services. Carlos Martinez, a former executive at Turner, Discovery, and Fox, has been appointed as executive vice president and managing director of Latin America for Fox Corp. The acquisition reflects Fox's commitment to building a leading sports streaming business in Mexico, enhancing its portfolio of original sports content as streaming becomes the top way for viewers to watch TV. Fox plans to launch its own direct-to-consumer streaming service, Fox One, later this year, complementing its existing free ad-supported streaming service, Tubi.</p>

          <p>Millions more households in Britain will receive ¬£150 off their energy bills this winter as the government expands eligibility for the Warm Home Discount. Anyone on means-tested benefits will automatically qualify, regardless of property size, with the cost potentially covered by raising fees on all customer bills. While debt charities and energy groups welcome the move, some argue the scheme still excludes vulnerable individuals on non-means-tested benefits. The government also aims to expand automatic compensation schemes for energy customers, addressing issues such as lengthy call wait times and incorrect direct debit adjustments.</p>

          <p>In an era of heightened polarization and offense, it's crucial to cultivate self-control rather than attempting to eliminate offense from the environment. Studies suggest that people are simultaneously too offensive and too easily offended, but focusing on personal reactions can improve quality of life. By understanding the neurological and psychological mechanisms that trigger offense, individuals can learn to manage their responses, using strategies such as humor, mindfulness, and limiting exposure to controversial media. Recognizing that being offended may not always reflect genuine offensiveness is also essential for navigating today's contentious social landscape.</p>

Inspired by her ancestors' experiences and the book "Hidden in Plain View," Edmunds creates quilts with patterns like the "monkey wrench" and "north star" to remember the bravery of those seeking liberation. While some academics question the lack of written evidence, Edmunds and her daughter emphasize the importance of oral history and the secrecy required for such a practice. She hopes to educate younger generations about the history of the Underground Railroad and the fight for freedom, especially during a time of increasing restrictions on diversity and historical education.</p>

This guidance, prompted by a Supreme Court ruling, will influence decisions on controversial projects like Rosebank and Jackdaw, but it remains unclear whether ministers will grant approval. While climate campaigners welcome the move, they argue that new developments will have minimal impact on the UK's reliance on imported fossil fuels.

          <p>Los Angeles teachers are providing support to students and families affected by recent ICE raids, offering resources and creating safe spaces for discussion.

          <p>Honda is recalling 259,033 vehicles in the U.S. due to a potential defect in the brake pedal pivot pin, which may not have been properly staked during production. The recall affects a range of models, including the 2021-2025 Acura TLX, 2023-2025 Acura MDX, and 2023-2025 Honda Pilot. Affected vehicles will generate a warning, and owners will be contacted to have their brake pedals replaced at authorized dealers, with reimbursement available for prior repairs. The issue was traced to a plant transition where insufficient training led to improperly staked pivot pins.</p>
