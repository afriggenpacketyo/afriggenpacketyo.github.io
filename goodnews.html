          <h2>New Exhibition Highlights the Hawaiian Royal Origins of Surfing in America</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 08:00:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new exhibit at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History explores the forgotten origins of surfing in the mainland United States. In 1885, three teenage Hawaiian princes, studying at a military school in California, introduced the sport by crafting boards from local redwood and riding the waves at the mouth of the San Lorenzo River. This historical event, documented in local newspapers at the time, predates the more widely known popularization of the sport by Duke Kahanamoku. The story showcases a significant moment of cultural exchange and the evolution of a now-globally popular sport.</p>

          <p>The price of the U.S. Open's signature Honey Deuce cocktail, now at $23, has increased at a rate faster than general inflation over the past decade. Since 2015, the cost of the popular vodka-based beverage has risen by 53%, compared to a 36% increase in the broader Consumer Price Index during the same period. Despite its high price, the event sold over 550,000 Honey Deuces last year, generating nearly $13 million in revenue. This analysis highlights how the pricing of specialty items at major sporting events can significantly exceed standard economic trends, reflecting strong consumer demand and event-specific marketing power.</p>

          <p>A new exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum showcases 40 portraits of Ada Katz, the wife and muse of acclaimed painter Alex Katz, from their 50-year marriage. Alex Katz, now in his 90s, has painted his wife over 300 times, capturing her style and appearance rather than attempting to convey deep emotion. He came of age as an artist when abstract expressionism was dominant but remained committed to his unique form of realism, facing criticism for years. The collection highlights his focus on form, light, and fashion, with Katz likening his detached portraits to a mirror that allows viewers to see themselves.</p>

          <p>Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy is set to release her first memoir, "Mother Mary Comes to Me," which delves into her complex and tumultuous relationship with her mother. An excerpt from the book reflects on her mother's recent death and the profound impact she had on Roy's life and perception of her home state of Kerala, India. The passage touches on her mother's fiercely independent character, her legal battles for women's inheritance rights, and the deep, often difficult, bond they shared. The memoir promises an intimate look at the forces that shaped one of contemporary literature's most distinctive voices.</p>

          <h2>Philosophical Essay Explores the Morality of Personal Happiness Amidst Global Suffering</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-31 07:00:28 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An essay by Avram Alpert examines the ethical dilemma of feeling personal happiness while being aware of widespread global crises, from humanitarian disasters to political turmoil. Drawing on religious and philosophical traditions that view humanity as a single interconnected body, the author argues that it is moral to feel the pain of others. However, he posits that this empathy should also extend to sharing in the world's joys, a concept known as "sympathetic joy" or mudita in Buddhism. The piece suggests that allowing oneself to experience both happiness and sorrow is a form of resistance against cynicism and despair, and a necessary part of a balanced, connected human experience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has provided crucial clarification for consumers hoping to claim the up to $7,500 federal tax credit for electric vehicles, which is set to be eliminated after September 30. According to the IRS, a "written binding contract" and a payment made on or before the deadline are sufficient to qualify, even if the vehicle is delivered later. This guidance provides a valuable loophole for buyers facing inventory shortages or delivery delays, allowing them to lock in the credit by ordering a vehicle and making a deposit. The clarification applies to new, used, and leased EVs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the transfer deadline approaching, Manchester United is reportedly considering a late move for Aston Villa's World Cup-winning goalkeeper, Emiliano Martinez. The club has been actively seeking to strengthen its goalkeeping position and has also been in negotiations for Royal Antwerp's younger, less experienced Senne Lammens. Martinez, a two-time FIFA goalkeeper of the year with extensive Premier League experience, would represent a more established and high-profile solution to the team's needs. The potential move highlights United's urgency to resolve their goalkeeping issues before the window closes, as acknowledged by head coach Ruben Amorim.</p>

          <p>UK Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is urging parents to ensure their children attend school from the very first week of the new term, citing new data linking early absences to chronic truancy. The data reveals that over half of pupils who missed school in the first week of 2024 later became "persistently absent," compared to only 14% of those with full attendance. While overall attendance has improved since the pandemic, persistent absenteeism remains higher than pre-COVID levels. Phillipson emphasized that missing even a few days early on can negatively impact a child's future, calling for a concerted effort from parents and schools to prioritize attendance.</p>

          <p>In a notable achievement for China's commercial space industry, Beijing-based CAS Space successfully launched two tiny satellites for ThumbSat, a Mexican startup. The launch of the femtosatellites, each weighing under 100 grams, represents Mexico's first commercial mission to low Earth orbit and a rare entry for a Chinese company into the North American launch market. CAS Space hailed the mission as a milestone demonstrating the cost-effectiveness and reliability of its Kinetica-1 rocket. The collaboration highlights China's growing efforts to expand its role in the global commercial space sector, traditionally dominated by American and European companies.</p>

          <p>While the Democratic Party is currently facing historically low approval ratings and internal criticism of being "weak," some strategists see reasons for optimism. They point to a growing lead in generic congressional ballot polls, an emerging bench of energetic potential presidential candidates, and President Trump's own declining popularity as key factors. Political analysts suggest a recovery plan focused on rallying public opposition to Trump, addressing economic concerns like affordability, and organizing for midterm victories. The party remains divided on policy and strategy, but vigorous internal debate is seen by some as a necessary step toward redefining its message and reconnecting with voters.</p>
