          <p>A middle school in Brooklyn, once listed as persistently dangerous with declining enrollment, has seen a dramatic turnaround after implementing a unique educational strategy. Principal Benjamin Honoroff, a former debate coach, introduced debate into every class, from math to English, and expanded the school's competitive team. This approach has significantly improved students' academic performance, with proficiency scores in English and math rising to 60% and 70% respectively. The school's debate team recently won a national championship, highlighting the success of this innovative educational initiative in a struggling community.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that Israel and Hamas have agreed to the first phase of a peace deal, which includes the release of all remaining hostages and a partial withdrawal of Israeli troops. The agreement, brokered with the help of Qatar, Egypt, and Turkey, is described as a significant step toward ending the two-year conflict. According to a White House official, the deal requires approval from Israel's cabinet, after which a phased release and withdrawal process would begin. Both Israeli and Hamas officials have released statements confirming an agreement has been reached, raising hopes for de-escalation.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region are expected to open higher, following a positive session on Wall Street where the S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached new records. The rally was driven by technology stocks, particularly in the artificial intelligence sector, as investors seemed to disregard warnings from institutions like the Bank of England about a potential AI bubble. Statements from Nvidia's CEO about strong demand for AI computing helped boost investor confidence. Futures for markets in Japan and Hong Kong indicated a higher open, reflecting the optimistic sentiment carrying over from the U.S. trading session. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in a case concerning whether a political candidate has the legal right to challenge election rules even if they win the election. The case was brought by an Illinois congressman who contested a state regulation allowing mail-in ballots to be counted for up to 14 days after Election Day, arguing it reduced his margin of victory. Justices from both conservative and liberal wings appeared skeptical of the arguments presented by both the congressman's lawyer and the state of Illinois. The court's questions focused on defining what constitutes sufficient harm to grant a candidate standing to sue.</p>

          <p>The White House has announced that President Donald Trump will visit Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for a "routine yearly check up," his second such examination since April. The visit follows a recent diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency, a condition causing swelling in his legs, though his physician has described it as benign. The president has faced online speculation about his health, fueled by images of bruising on his hand, which his doctor attributed to frequent handshaking and aspirin use. During his visit, Trump is also scheduled to meet with and deliver remarks to troops at the facility.</p>

          <p>During a White House event, Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed President Trump a handwritten note urging him to approve a social media post to announce the Gaza peace deal before others did. A photograph captured the note, which read, "We need you to approve a Truth Social post soon so you can announce deal first." The interaction highlighted the fast-moving nature of the negotiations taking place in Egypt between Israeli and Hamas representatives. The president had earlier indicated he might travel to the Middle East as negotiators were reportedly closing in on an agreement.</p>

U.S. Marshals, acting on a tip, located Groves hiding in a specially prepared crawl space inside a home.

His arrest concludes the manhunt for all ten escapees, with authorities now investigating how he traveled to Atlanta and if he received any assistance.</p>

          <p>Manchester United defender Maya Le Tissier continues to build a case for a starting position on the England national team with her consistent high-level performances in the Women's Super League. Despite being a key player for her club, which had one of the league's best defenses last season, Le Tissier has seen limited playing time for the Lionesses. England's coach, Sarina Wiegman, has stated she prefers Le Tissier at right-back, though she plays centrally for United. With recent injuries to key national team defenders, there is growing speculation that the 23-year-old may finally get her opportunity to play a more significant role.</p>

The topic was reportedly raised by Carney in the context of broader trade discussions, including U.S. tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. The pipeline project, which would transport oil from Alberta to Nebraska, was previously blocked by the Obama and Biden administrations but has been supported by Trump. The company behind the project had previously stated it had "moved on," but the new discussions suggest a possible reconsideration.</p>

Critics have questioned the nature of massive contracts between companies like CoreWeave, Nvidia, OpenAI, and Meta, where they are simultaneously partners, suppliers, and customers. Intrator argued that these deals represent a necessary and massive infrastructure buildout to meet real client demand, not just money being passed between firms. CoreWeave, which went public in March, has seen its stock soar amid intense investor interest in the AI sector. (not investment advice)</p>

Between 1933 and 1950, to protect them from invasion and civil war, thousands of crates containing priceless imperial artifacts were transported over 10,000 miles across China. This monumental effort ensured the survival of a vast collection of national heritage. However, the collection was ultimately split, with a significant portion moved to Taiwan, leading to the establishment of the National Palace Museum in Taipei. This division continues to reflect the complex political tensions across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
