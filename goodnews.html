          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 22:59:44 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Zillow report suggests that carefully chosen interior paint colors can significantly boost a home's sale price, potentially adding up to $2,600 to the final value. The study, based on a survey of thousands of homebuyers, identifies olive green as the most desirable kitchen color, with buyers willing to pay up to $1,600 more for kitchens featuring this hue. Classic navy walls in bedrooms are also highly sought after, potentially increasing the sale price by an estimated $1,815, while dark gray living rooms are favored over lighter colors, potentially boosting offers by around $2,600; conversely, bright and playful colors may deter buyers and decrease a home's value.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 22:58:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with increasing tariffs, businesses are employing 'tariff engineering,' a legal practice involving altering product materials or dimensions to reclassify items under lower-tariff harmonized system codes. This strategy allows companies to reduce duty liabilities by strategically designing products to fit into more favorable tariff categories. For example, some manufacturers bundle steel and aluminum elements or switch synthetic materials for cotton to qualify for lower duties. However, heavily-regulated industries like automotive and aerospace face greater challenges due to extensive validation and approval requirements for even minor changes; this practice dates back to the 1880s and is still used today.

          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. CEO Eiji Hashimoto stated that United States Steel Corp. is of growing strategic importance, especially with the likelihood of continued high U.S. tariffs on steel products. Hashimoto believes that Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel will benefit the U.S. economy, although he doubts trade levies will revitalize its manufacturing sector. The company finalized a $14.1 billion deal to make U.S. Steel a wholly owned subsidiary, following Trump's reversal of initial opposition. Nippon Steel has agreed to invest around $11 billion by 2028 and maintain U.S. Steel's headquarters in Pittsburgh, with the U.S. government retaining veto power over key management decisions.

          <p>Wildlife experts in Michigan successfully trapped a black bear and removed a large plastic lid that had been stuck around its neck for two years. The bear was first spotted on a trail camera as a cub in 2023, prompting the Department of Natural Resources to search for the animal. The bear was lured into a trap, anesthetized, and the lid was safely cut off, revealing a scarred neck. Despite the uncomfortable accessory, the bear survived and was able to feed itself, demonstrating its resilience.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenacapavir, marketed as Yeztugo by Gilead Sciences, as a twice-yearly injection for HIV prevention. Clinical trials showed that 99.9% of participants receiving the drug remained HIV negative, marking a significant advancement in HIV prevention efforts. The approval is considered a milestone in the fight against HIV, offering a new method to prevent HIV on a large scale. While this drug is a major development, concerns remain about funding cuts for HIV vaccine research, which experts argue is still essential for ultimately eradicating the virus.</p>

          <p>Arif Ahmed, from the Office for Students (OfS), emphasizes that students should be prepared to encounter potentially shocking and offensive views at university, as exposure to diverse perspectives is an integral part of education. This statement comes as the OfS releases guidance for universities in England on implementing a new law designed to protect free speech on campuses. The new law places a stronger responsibility on universities to uphold freedom of speech and academic freedom, with potential sanctions for failures to do so. The guidelines cover various aspects of university life, from protests to debates, and aim to ensure that students can express any view within legal boundaries.</p>
