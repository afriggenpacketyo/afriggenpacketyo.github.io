          <p>A federal judge in Boston has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees. This follows the administration's announcement of a significant reduction in force that would have cut the agency's staff by half. The judge's preliminary injunction emphasizes the necessity for the Department to fulfill its obligations and statutory mandates. The lawsuit against the Trump administration was filed by 21 states after President Trump signed an executive order aimed at dismantling the Education Department.</p>
