          <p>House Republicans are defending Medicaid reforms included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, asserting that the changes eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse while protecting benefits for vulnerable Americans. Democrats, however, are criticizing the bill, claiming it will cause millions to lose healthcare coverage. Republicans argue that the CBO's estimate of 13.7 million Americans losing coverage by 2034 includes 5 million people already slated to lose coverage under existing Democratic legislation. The debate centers on whether the bill strengthens Medicaid or cuts essential benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Global markets experienced a rally following a U.S. court's decision to block President Trump's sweeping tariffs. The ruling, subject to appeal, is seen as potentially slowing down a trade war that could negatively impact economic and corporate growth. Nvidia's strong earnings report also contributed to the market's positive momentum. Investors sold U.S. government bonds, causing the yield on the 30-year Treasury note to rise.</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal court has blocked President Donald Trump's sweeping global trade tariffs, ruling that the president exceeded his authority. The court stated that the U.S. Constitution grants Congress exclusive power to regulate commerce with other nations. The Trump administration plans to appeal the decision. Stock markets in Asia and U.S. stock futures rose following the ruling. The ruling could disrupt trade negotiations and prompt other countries to adopt a wait-and-see approach.</p>

Despite facing headwinds from U.S. export restrictions to China, Nvidia's financial performance boosted investor confidence in the broader semiconductor industry. The restrictions caused Nvidia to write off $4.5 billion of H20 chip inventory, but the company still managed to beat market expectations.</p>
