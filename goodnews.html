          <p>A power failure in south-west London caused significant disruptions across the London Underground network, London Overground, and the Elizabeth line. Several lines were suspended, including the Bakerloo, Weaver, and Waterloo & City lines, while others experienced severe delays. Transport for London (TfL) reported that power has been restored, but delays and line suspensions continue as they work to get everything back up and running. Many commuters were left stranded, expressing frustration over their inability to complete their journeys, highlighting the ripple effect of the outage on daily life in London.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to temporarily reduce tariffs imposed on each other, signaling a de-escalation in their ongoing trade war. This decision comes after President Trump acknowledged the economic strain caused by the tariffs, leading to a 90-day suspension of further increases and continued negotiations. The article notes that the agreement breaks an impasse that had brought much trade between China and the United States to a halt. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent placed blame on the Biden administration for failing to honor its commitments to the trade deal that Mr. Trump reached with China during his first term. </p>

          <p>Many millennials and Gen Zers find financial security out of reach, even with growing net worths. Rising costs in housing, healthcare, and insurance, along with increased responsibility for retirement funding, contribute to this struggle. Experts argue the problem is structural, not behavioral. As a result, young adults are adapting by living with parents longer, sharing childcare, and seeking new ways to build community.</p>

          <p>Anyone who has owned or used a Siri-enabled Apple device since 2014 and experienced an unintended Siri activation during a confidential or private communication may be eligible for up to $100 from Apple thanks to a class action lawsuit. A $95 million class action lawsuit, Lopez v. Apple, was filed in a California federal court in 2021. If you claim Siri has listened to a private conversation after being unintentionally enabled, you can get $20 per device, with a maximum threshold of $100, according to the lawsuit.</p>

          <p>Sir Keir Starmer has unveiled Labour's plans to cut levels of immigration into the UK, making the system "controlled, selective and fair". Key measures include tightening work visas, longer residency waits, scrapping the care visa, stricter student rules, and tougher English tests. The government says firms in sectors deemed to rely too much on overseas workers will be "expected to comply" with strategies to boost workplace skills.</p>

          <p>The US and China have agreed a truce to lower import taxes on goods being traded between the two countries. The agreement marks a major de-escalation of the trade war between the world's two biggest economies. Both the US and China have confirmed a reduction in the tariffs they imposed on each other following the initial escalation by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The result is that US tariffs on Chinese imports will fall to from 145% to 30%, while Chinese tariffs on some US imports will fall from 125% to 10%.</p>
