Singapore Prime Minister Lawrence Wong emphasized that Terminal 5 will connect Changi with 200 cities, up from the current 170, boosting Singapore's GDP. With a $240 billion investment in airport development across the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions projected between 2025 and 2035, the region is poised to accommodate the anticipated growth in air travel.</p>

The committee aims to draft legislation to address concerns that economic security and policy are intertwined with foreign policy.

          <p>A manuscript acquired by Harvard Law School in 1946 for just $27.50, once considered an unofficial copy of the Magna Carta, is now believed to be a genuine version dating from 1300. UK academics determined it to be an extraordinarily rare and lost original Magna Carta from the reign of King Edward I, potentially worth millions. The document, catalogued as HLS MS 172, was previously described as a "copy made in 1327." The Magna Carta, a charter first issued in 1215, is considered a key step in the evolution of human rights and has influenced constitutions worldwide.</p>

The law, effective in December, seeks to prevent the companies from excluding app competitors from accessing their app stores. It also prohibits the firms from using data obtained from their app stores or operating systems in their own products, which would give them an unfair advantage. The commission hopes the changes will benefit consumers by reducing prices and improving access to convenient apps.</p>
