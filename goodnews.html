          <p>Dong Yu, a key figure in drafting China's economic blueprints, explains that increasing national income is the fundamental goal behind the country's five-year plans. As the executive vice-president of the China Institute for Development Planning at Tsinghua University, he has extensive experience from his time at major economic decision-making bodies. In an exclusive interview, Dong discusses the historical success of these plans since the reform period began in 1978 and provides insight into the potential direction of the upcoming 15th five-year plan.

          <p>President Donald Trump has indicated that media executive Lachlan Murdoch and his father, Rupert Murdoch, are expected to be part of an investor group aiming to acquire TikTok's U.S. operations. In a Fox News interview, Trump also named Oracle's Larry Ellison and Dell's Michael Dell as likely participants, describing them as "American patriots." The potential deal is being negotiated to comply with a U.S. law requiring TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its American arm over national security concerns. This development suggests a powerful coalition of media and tech figures could soon control the popular social media platform.</p>

          <p>A baseball fan named Alberto, who caught Mike Trout's 400th career home run ball, returned the milestone souvenir in exchange for a unique experience. After the Angels' game against the Colorado Rockies, Alberto asked Trout if they could play catch on the field, a request the three-time MVP happily granted. In addition to the memorable moment, Trout also gave the fan three signed bats and two signed baseballs. The 400th home run makes Trout the 59th player in MLB history to reach the mark and the 20th to do so with a single franchise.</p>

          <p>Washington Nationals center fielder Jacob Young made two extraordinary catches to seal a 3-2 victory over the New York Mets, impacting the NL wild-card race. In the fifth inning, Young prevented an extra-base hit with a juggling, "hacky-sack" style catch, kicking the ball back into the air with his foot after it was jarred from his glove at the wall. He followed this with a leaping grab in the ninth inning, robbing Francisco Álvarez of a potential game-tying home run. The loss was critical for the Mets, dropping them into a tie with the Cincinnati Reds for the final playoff spot.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Gabrielle has intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the seventh named storm of the 2025 Atlantic season. Located southeast of Bermuda, the storm is tracking north-northwest with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph and is expected to strengthen further. While no watches or warnings are currently in effect for land, the National Hurricane Center warns that swells generated by Gabrielle will likely cause life-threatening surf and rip current conditions along the U.S. East Coast from North Carolina northward into Atlantic Canada early this week.

          <p>South Korean President Lee Jae Myung has indicated he would support an interim deal between Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un that freezes North Korea's nuclear weapons production. In an interview with the BBC, Lee described such an agreement as a "feasible, realistic alternative" to the stalled long-term goal of complete denuclearization, noting that North Korea is producing numerous new weapons annually. President Lee, who aims to reduce tensions on the peninsula, believes the mutual trust between Trump and Kim could facilitate a return to negotiations, benefiting regional and global security.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola's defensive tactical shift nearly secured a victory against Arsenal, but a last-minute equalizer from Gabriel Martinelli resulted in a 1-1 draw. After taking an early lead, Guardiola surprisingly substituted striker Erling Haaland and switched to a deep-defending 5-5-0 formation, ceding the majority of possession to Arsenal. This uncharacteristic strategy frustrated the hosts for most of the match but was ultimately undone by a single lapse in the 93rd minute. The result benefits league leaders Liverpool, who now hold a five-point advantage at the top of the Premier League table.</p>
