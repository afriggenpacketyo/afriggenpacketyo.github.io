          <p>Professional golfer Scottie Scheffler has deleted his Venmo account after receiving unwanted financial requests and payments from strangers betting on his performance. The popular payment app's default public setting allowed users to send requests and payments to Scheffler, leading to a barrage of activity. While he occasionally received small payments after winning, he more often received requests from gamblers hoping to profit from his losses. Venmo encourages users to be cautious and decline payments or requests from unknown sources to avoid online scams.</p>

          <p>A draft trade agreement with China, announced by Donald Trump, addresses concerns from top US military suppliers regarding rare-earth metals crucial for defense production. The agreement aims to ensure a stable supply of these metals and magnets, essential for manufacturing items from smart bombs to fighter jets. China's export restrictions on rare earth elements had previously threatened to disrupt the US defense industrial base. Samarium, a rare-earth metal used in military-grade magnets and entirely controlled by China, is of particular importance.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced plans to build 1.5 million new homes this parliament, committing ¬£39bn over 10 years for social and affordable housing in England. This investment has been described as a game-changer by social landlords and housing charities, given the acute shortage of affordable and social housing in many areas. While the government says this is significantly higher than previous spending, details on where the homes will be built and how much funding will be allocated to socially rented homes are still awaited. For families like Danielle's, who have experienced homelessness, the announcement feels "too late" but offers hope for future generations.</p>

          <p>Chime's upcoming IPO is expected to gauge Wall Street's enthusiasm for fintech companies as several others prepare to enter the public market. The online banking services provider has set a price range of $24 to $26 per share, valuing the company at approximately $9.1 billion. This valuation is significantly lower than the $25 billion valuation from its 2021 fundraising round, reflecting a valuation reset in the industry. The success of Chime's IPO could influence other fintech companies considering going public, while a poor performance could lead them to remain private. (not investment advice)</p>

The jury found Weinstein guilty of sexually assaulting Haley, providing her with a sense of hope and validation.</p>
