          <p>Key European leaders, including those from the EU, France, and Germany, have issued a joint statement emphasizing that peace in Ukraine cannot be decided without Kyiv's involvement. This declaration comes as President Trump prepares for a one-on-one meeting with Vladimir Putin, where territorial swaps have been suggested. The White House has indicated a willingness to include Ukrainian President Zelenskyy, but the summit currently remains bilateral at Putin's request. European nations stressed their commitment to Ukraine's sovereignty and that the current line of contact should be the starting point for any negotiations.</p>

Companies highlighted include energy giant Chevron (CVX), asset manager Rithm Capital (RITM), and telecom leader AT&T (T). These firms are noted for their strong recent performance, consistent dividend payments, and positive future outlooks. Analysts point to factors like strategic acquisitions for Chevron, a pivot to a capital-light model for Rithm, and strong subscriber growth for AT&T as reasons for their buy ratings.

          <p>In 2025, nineteen U.S. states are providing temporary sales tax holidays, allowing shoppers to purchase certain items without paying state and sometimes local taxes. These events are politically popular and often timed for back-to-school shopping or disaster preparedness, offering relief as potential tariffs threaten to raise prices. While tax experts note that wealthier consumers may benefit most, many families plan for these holidays to save on major purchases. For maximum savings, consumers are advised to combine the tax break with store promotions and credit card rewards.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers in Australia have discovered a new species of stick insect, notable for its extraordinary size and the presence of wings. The insect, identified as Acrophylla alta, measures over 15 inches long and may be the heaviest insect in the country, weighing as much as a golf ball. It was found in the mountainous Wet Tropics region of Far North Queensland. Scientists believe its large body mass is an evolutionary adaptation to survive the colder, high-altitude conditions of its habitat. The discovery has generated significant online buzz due to the creature's imposing appearance.</p>

          <p>A schoolboy in Scotland discovered the wreckage of a 275-year-old ship while jogging on a beach on the Orkney Islands. The hull, unearthed by a storm, was later identified by researchers as the Earl of Chatham, a former British Royal Navy vessel named HMS Hind. Built in 1749, the ship was active during the American Revolution before being sold and repurposed as a whaling ship. It ultimately sank in the North Sea in 1788, with all 56 crew members surviving. The local community rallied to preserve the 12-ton wreckage.</p>

          <p>Despite a constant stream of negative news, significant global progress often goes unnoticed due to a psychological phenomenon known as negativity bias. Humans are evolutionarily hardwired to focus on threats, which in the modern world can lead to a skewed, pessimistic view of reality. However, data shows remarkable improvements, such as a potential historic low for the U.S. murder rate and fewer global deaths from extreme weather. Recognizing this bias and actively seeking out stories of progress can foster realistic optimism, which is crucial for inspiring action and building resilience to face future challenges.</p>

Researchers from the University of Georgia identified the rock as a chondrite, the most common type of stony meteorite. The recovered object, now named the McDonough meteorite, is the 27th to be found in Georgia.</p>

          <p>In her new book "SLIP," author Mallary Tenore Tarpley shares her personal journey of living with an eating disorder, moving from a perfectionist pursuit of "full recovery" to accepting a life in the "middle place." She combines memoir with research to discuss how this shift in mindset, which normalizes setbacks, has allowed her to live a full life while still contending with the disorder. Tarpley argues that for many, the all-or-nothing approach can be counterproductive, and embracing imperfection makes recovery feel more attainable and sustainable, especially in a culture where diet trends are resurfacing.</p>

          <p>For individuals who struggle with a strict vegetarian or vegan diet but still want to reduce animal suffering, a "reducetarian" approach offers a pragmatic alternative. This philosophy suggests focusing on minimizing harm rather than complete elimination, which can be more sustainable for many. Practical steps include choosing pasture-raised meat over factory-farmed products, as these animals live under significantly better conditions. Additionally, opting for meat from larger animals like cows over smaller ones like chickens can reduce the total number of animal lives impacted. Setting clear, quantifiable goals, such as "weekday vegetarian," can also help maintain commitment.</p>

The push is also framed as a national security issue, aiming to counter a planned joint Chinese-Russian lunar base that will feature a more powerful reactor.

          <p>Michael Young's 1958 satirical novel, "The Rise of the Meritocracy," is finding a new audience as its themes resonate with contemporary societal concerns. The book, which ironically popularized the term "meritocracy," portrays a dystopian future where society is rigidly stratified by educational achievement rather than traditional class structures. This system ultimately leads to a populist rebellion against the meritocratic elite. The novel serves as a cautionary tale, questioning the fairness and consequences of a system that sorts individuals based solely on intelligence and academic credentials, a critique that feels particularly timely today.</p>

          <p>In response to escalating flood risks from climate change, cities like Bangkok are adopting the "sponge city" model, which uses green infrastructure to absorb and manage stormwater. This approach, pioneered by landscape architect Kongjian Yu, contrasts with traditional "gray" infrastructure that quickly funnels water away. By creating wetlands, porous surfaces, and public parks, cities can capture rainwater, reduce pollution, and replenish groundwater. While Los Angeles has begun similar initiatives through its Safe Clean Water Program, progress is slower due to bureaucratic hurdles and high costs compared to China's nationally-backed sponge city agenda.</p>
