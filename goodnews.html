          <p>Former Green Bay Packers star Clay Matthews delivered a humorous stunt at the NFL Draft, impersonating Donald Trump by reading a fake message declaring that the "Bears still suck!" The stunt, conceived to make his appearance memorable, involved Matthews' wife photoshopping Trump's letterhead onto the message. Matthews kept the plan secret from the NFL, anticipating disapproval due to the current political climate, but NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell found the joke amusing. Despite the success of the stunt, Matthews jokingly suggested he might not be invited back.</p>

          <p>Making meaningful friendships in adulthood can be challenging, requiring effort and refined social skills. Psychologists suggest that checking assumptions, being present, and observing social cues are essential for connecting with others.

Vulnerability is key to deepening friendships, but it should be shared in moderation to avoid overwhelming new connections. Practicing these skills and being open to new experiences can help nurture and maintain fulfilling friendships.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez, convicted of murdering their parents in 1989, are now eligible for parole after being resentenced to life with the possibility of parole. The brothers, who admitted to the killings but claimed they acted out of fear after years of sexual assault by their father, had originally been sentenced to life without parole. Their resentencing comes after new evidence emerged supporting their claims of sexual abuse, prompting a review of their case and a reduction in their sentence, and it remains to be seen if the state parole board recommends them for release to the Governor.</p>

          <p>President Trump met with Syria's interim president, Ahmad al-Sharaa, in Riyadh, marking the first such encounter in 25 years and a major shift for Syria after years of international isolation. The meeting occurred a day after Trump lifted US sanctions on Syria, a decision opposed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. During the meeting, Trump urged the Syrian leader to normalize ties with Israel and deport Palestinian militants, while also requesting that Syria take control of camps holding captured "Islamic State" fighters.</p>

          <p>Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz has created a new government department to modernize the state and appointed Karsten Wildberger, a former business executive, to lead it, drawing comparisons to Elon Musk. Wildberger's ministry aims to streamline state IT infrastructure and reduce regulations, with a focus on efficiency and digitalization. While some see potential for positive disruption, others worry about the influence of business interests on government policy. Wildberger will face challenges in navigating Germany's federal system and building alliances with state governments.</p>

          <p>Germany's new Chancellor Friedrich Merz is set to present his agenda in his first address to the Bundestag, emphasizing greater efficiency and longer working hours. Merz, elected in a historic second-round vote, plans to cut energy costs and bureaucracy while advocating for a 40-hour workweek with flexible arrangements. He also views his cabinet's lack of federal experience as an opportunity for real change, aiming for swift action on growth, migration, and defense, as he warned that work-life balance alone won't sustain national prosperity.</p>
