          <p>A recent article compiles a list of 19 widely-believed historical falsehoods, drawing from a popular online discussion. The debunked myths include the notion that Vikings wore horned helmets, that Napoleon Bonaparte was unusually short, and that George Washington had wooden dentures. Other corrected misconceptions involve the belief that people in the Middle Ages had very short lifespans and that Marie Antoinette actually said, "Let them eat cake." The piece highlights how these inaccuracies persist in popular culture despite historical evidence to the contrary.</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to a deal with the US government to pay 15% of their revenue from specific semiconductor sales in China. This arrangement is part of a broader agreement to secure export licenses for advanced AI chips, such as Nvidia's H20, which were previously restricted from the Chinese market due to national security concerns. Analysts describe the move as unprecedented, highlighting the significant financial and strategic challenges tech companies face amid ongoing US-China trade tensions. This development occurs as the two countries show signs of easing trade frictions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government is expanding its policy to deport more foreign criminals before their appeals can be heard by adding 15 new countries to the program. This "deport now, appeal later" scheme, which now includes nations like Canada, India, and Australia, aims to fast-track removals and prevent offenders from using the legal system to delay deportation. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper stated the measure is intended to stop the manipulation of the immigration system. The expansion is part of a broader government strategy to toughen penalties and restore order.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning a significant overhaul of road safety laws in England and Wales, which could see drivers over 70 banned if they fail compulsory eye tests. Under the proposed changes, elderly motorists would need to pass an eye test every three years to renew their license. The new strategy also aims to lower the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalties for passengers who do not wear seatbelts. These measures follow a coroner's report calling for action to prevent deaths caused by drivers with failing eyesight.</p>

          <h2>The Science of Black Holes: How Newly Formed Singularities Create 'Cosmic Music'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:17 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the concept of the "music" of black holes, describing the phenomenon of gravitational waves emitted as they form and stabilize. When a new black hole is created, for instance from a star's collapse, the resulting distortion in spacetime quickly settles into a mathematically perfect shape defined only by its mass and spin. During this brief stabilization period, the black hole "rings out" with pure gravitational waves, a process likened to a form of cosmic music. This event provides a unique window into the fundamental properties of these enigmatic objects.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests China's New Childcare Subsidies May Disproportionately Benefit Poorer Regions</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-10 22:00:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has introduced a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (about US$501) annually for each child under the age of three. An analysis in the article suggests the policy's impact will vary significantly by region, potentially providing a greater economic boost to poorer, rural areas. In provinces like Gansu, the subsidy represents a substantial portion of the average resident's income, whereas in affluent cities like Shanghai, its effect is minimal. This disparity means the program is more likely to stimulate consumption and modestly influence birth rates in less affluent parts of the country. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SoftBank founder Masayoshi Son is staking the company's future on artificial intelligence, making it his most significant strategic bet to date. Son predicts that artificial superintelligence (ASI), which he defines as AI 10,000 times smarter than humans, will emerge within the next decade. To capitalize on this, SoftBank has made substantial investments in key AI-related firms like chip designers Arm and Ampere, as well as a planned multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI. This aggressive strategy aims to create an integrated AI ecosystem, echoing the conviction behind Son's famously successful early investment in Alibaba. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced new measures aimed at boosting employment for newly qualified nurses and midwives within England's National Health Service (NHS). The plan seeks to cut red tape and simplify regulations, allowing hospital trusts to hire graduates more easily to address a surplus of trained professionals. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a positive step for graduates facing job uncertainty, they also raised concerns. Questions remain about how these new positions will be funded, as NHS trusts are already operating under significant financial pressure.</p>

          <p>In a preseason matchup, the Los Angeles Chargers defeated the New Orleans Saints 27-13, offering key insights into the team's depth. Quarterback Trey Lance delivered a strong performance, using both his arm and legs to lead scoring drives, seemingly closing the gap in the race for the backup position. Another standout was undrafted rookie defensive back Eric Rogers, who made a compelling case for a roster spot by securing two interceptions, one of which he returned 55 yards for a touchdown. The game provided valuable evaluation time for the team's rookies and backups.</p>
