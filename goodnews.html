          <p>A minor, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing brief shaking in the region, including parts of New York City. The U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake, but there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries. An analyst noted that while earthquakes are uncommon on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not considered significant and is not expected to cause damage. This event follows a larger 4.8 magnitude earthquake that rattled the area in April 2024.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers from the Beijing Institute of Technology claim to have developed a new electronic warfare capability using a drone swarm to create an electromagnetic "storm eye." This technology allows for targeted jamming of enemy signals while simultaneously creating a protective bubble around friendly forces where interference is cancelled out. By precisely adjusting signal waveforms, the drones can safeguard allied communications from the disruptive effects of their own jamming activities. This marks a significant advancement over traditional, indiscriminate electronic warfare tactics.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the wife of a Marine Corps veteran and a mother of two young children, has been released after being detained by ICE for two months in Louisiana. She was taken into custody during what she believed was a routine green card application interview, due to an old deportation order she was unaware of. Her release, which requires her to wear an ankle monitor, followed advocacy from her husband, her attorney, and the office of Senator John Kennedy, highlighting the complexities of current immigration enforcement policies.</p>

          <p>Former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is launching a new left-wing political party with fellow MP Zarah Sultana, but it currently has no name. While over 600,000 people have reportedly registered as supporters, the founders want the public to help choose a name that reflects the party's values. The process is complicated by Electoral Commission rules that prevent names from being too similar to existing parties. Experts note that a strong, modern brand name is crucial for resonating with voters in a digital age where traditional party affiliations have weakened.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Lakers have officially committed to Luka Dončić as their franchise centerpiece, signing him to a three-year, $165 million contract extension. The team's public display of support for the 26-year-old star signals a clear shift in focus for the organization. This development intensifies questions about the future of LeBron James, who is 40 and under contract for only one more season. With the franchise now building around Dončić, it remains unclear how James will adapt to a potentially secondary role or if he will retire as a Laker.</p>

          <p>Comedian Harry Hill has revealed that the death of his stepfather at age 54 was the catalyst for him to quit his career as a doctor and pursue comedy. Hill, who had qualified as a physician, felt unsuited for medicine and was deeply affected by his stepfather's inability to enjoy retirement. He recalled feeling out of his depth when breaking bad news to patients and realized he needed a change. The experience set him free to pursue a career in entertainment, leading to his success with shows like "Harry Hill's TV Burp."</p>

          <p>Meta Platforms, a key advocate for open-source artificial intelligence with its Llama models, has signaled it may become more cautious with its open-source approach in the future. This shift contrasts sharply with China's strategy, where a competitive open-source ecosystem is rapidly advancing AI development, with companies like Alibaba and Zhipu AI recently releasing powerful new models. Some experts, like computer scientist Andrew Ng, suggest that China's vibrant, 'Darwinian' open-source environment could be its path to surpassing the U.S. in the field of AI.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have likely solved the 80-year-old mystery of how a platypus gifted to Winston Churchill died during its voyage from Australia to the UK in 1943. The platypus, named Winston, was a secret diplomatic gift during WWII, and his death was rumored to be caused by shell-shock from a Nazi U-boat encounter. However, newly digitized records, including the attendant's logbook, reveal the animal was likely killed by extreme heat as the ship crossed the equator, with water temperatures far exceeding safe levels for the species, alongside dwindling food rations.</p>
