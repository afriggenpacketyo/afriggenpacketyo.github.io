          <p>U.S. stock markets rallied significantly on Tuesday, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq moving toward record highs after the latest inflation data came in better than expected. The July report showed the annual inflation rate held steady at 2.7%, slightly below economists' forecasts. This positive data increased investor hopes that the Federal Reserve will have the justification it needs to cut interest rates at its upcoming September meeting. Lower rates would reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, providing a boost to the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tottenham's new manager, Thomas Frank, is establishing a new team culture focused on inclusivity, hard work, and direct communication. In a notable early move, he invited all club staff, including non-technical employees, to a first-team meeting to emphasize that everyone is part of the journey. Frank is known for his hands-on, detail-oriented coaching style, a contrast to his predecessor, and insists on a "glass half-full" positive mentality. His approach has been tested by injuries to key players during pre-season, but his philosophy is already making a strong impression.</p>

          <p>Based on the latest government inflation data, policy experts are projecting that Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026. This estimated increase would be slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment received in 2025. The official COLA is announced by the Social Security Administration in October and is calculated based on the average inflation rate over July, August, and September.

The poll highlights a generational divide, with Mamdani dominating among younger voters while Cuomo leads with those over 55.

          <p>A 39-year-old man, Andrew Barber, was successfully rescued after being lost for nine days in the remote wilderness of British Columbia, Canada. He survived by building a makeshift shelter, drinking pond water, and eating what he could find. To attract attention, he carved "HELP" on a rock and drew an "SOS" in the mud, which ultimately led to his discovery by a search and rescue helicopter. Barber was found severely dehydrated with a leg injury but is expected to recover, a fortunate outcome in a vast and challenging terrain.</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group, the issuer of the USDC stablecoin, reported a 53% year-over-year revenue increase in its first quarterly earnings report as a public company. The growth was fueled by a 90% increase in the circulation of its dollar-pegged cryptocurrency, which reached $61.3 billion. Despite posting a net loss due to IPO-related charges, the strong revenue performance and positive market sentiment caused the company's stock to rise. The results reflect growing interest in stablecoins from financial institutions, spurred by more supportive crypto legislation. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages, which allow homeowners aged 62 and older to convert home equity into cash, can be a useful tool but come with significant risks. While most are federally insured, which offers some protections, borrowers can still face foreclosure if they fail to pay property taxes and insurance. The loan balance grows over time, which can deplete the home's equity, affecting a senior's ability to fund future housing needs or leave an inheritance. Experts advise seniors to fully understand the long-term obligations and work only with reputable lenders.</p>
