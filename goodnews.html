          <p>Walt Disney is set to expand its global presence with the opening of its first theme park in the Middle East, located in Abu Dhabi on Yas Island. This venture is a collaboration between Walt Disney and Miral, a local leisure and entertainment company. Yas Island is already home to attractions like SeaWorld and Warner Bros World, with a Harry Potter-themed park also under development. The new Disney theme park in Abu Dhabi will be Disney's seventh resort, adding to its existing locations in North America, Europe, and Asia, with the most recent opening in Shanghai in 2016.</p>

          <p>Despite negative economic news, including a decline in first-quarter GDP, weekly mortgage demand has surged by 11% as mortgage interest rates slightly decreased for the second consecutive week. Applications for home purchases also rose 11% year-over-year, driven by demand for conventional loans, which is seen as a surprising move given the current economic climate. However, some potential buyers remain hesitant due to concerns about the potential impact of tariffs and stock market volatility. Applications to refinance a home loan also rose, particularly for Veterans Affairs (VA) loans.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh the Pros and Cons of Credit Card Debt Forgiveness for Seniors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-07 09:37:50 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts say that credit card debt forgiveness can be a smart option for seniors with high medical expenses, low income, or no significant assets, but may not be suitable for everyone. While it can provide financial relief by settling balances for less than owed, it can also damage credit scores and trigger tax consequences. Seniors with assets or those planning to use credit in the future should exercise caution, and be wary of predatory actors in the debt relief industry. Alternative strategies for reducing credit card debt include stopping credit card use, contacting card issuers directly for lower interest rates, and choosing a debt repayment strategy like the snowball method.</p>

          <p>A Soviet-era spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972, is expected to reenter Earth's atmosphere uncontrolled around May 10, raising concerns about potential debris impact. The spacecraft, which was intended to land on Venus, failed to leave Earth's orbit due to a rocket malfunction. Experts predict the half-ton mass of metal could land anywhere between latitude 52 degrees north and 52 degrees south, with a small chance of hitting someone or something. While the risk is low, the potential impact of space debris on aircraft is a growing concern.</p>

          <p>With persistent inflation impacting the economy, saving money has become a challenge, but certificates of deposit (CDs) offer a solution with higher returns than the current inflation rate. CDs allow savers to lock in today's high rates for the term of the CD, providing a safe investment with FDIC or NCUA insurance. Online banks often offer the most competitive rates, and short-term CDs can be a way to maximize returns. Strategies like CD laddering can help savers take advantage of high rates while saving for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

Nearly $8 billion in investments were canceled in the first three months of 2025 due to market uncertainty and debates over clean energy incentives.
