          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a crucial 3-2 victory against the San Diego Padres, moving them back into a tie for first place in the National League West. The win snapped a four-game losing streak and came at a critical time, as the team has been struggling recently and just placed third baseman Max Muncy on the injured list. Pitcher Clayton Kershaw delivered a strong performance over six innings, and the often-unreliable bullpen managed to protect the narrow lead. The victory provided a much-needed boost for the Dodgers in the opening game of a pivotal series against their division rivals.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 22:09:54 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration and Washington D.C. officials have agreed to scale back the federal takeover of the city's police force following a legal challenge from the city. Under the agreement, Metropolitan Police Department Chief Pamela Smith will remain in command, not the federally appointed DEA administrator. The deal was reached after a federal judge expressed skepticism about the legality of the full takeover during an emergency hearing. However, the revised directive still requires D.C. police to assist with federal immigration enforcement, a point of contention with the city's "sanctuary" policies that will be subject to further legal arguments.</p>

          <p>Following an emergency hearing in federal court, the Department of Justice agreed to withdraw its appointment of a new emergency police chief for Washington D.C. and rewrite its directive on immigration enforcement. The decision came after D.C. sued the Trump administration, arguing the takeover was illegal under the Home Rule Act. U.S. District Judge Ana Reyes expressed significant skepticism about the administration's authority to assume full operational control of the police force. As a result of the hearing, D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain her command, marking a significant legal and jurisdictional victory for the city.</p>

          <p>The city of San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it shares a lot with. This development comes a year after the city pioneered a law to allow such sales, a move aimed at creating more affordable homeownership opportunities. Officials hope this new housing model could serve as a template for other cities in the state, potentially providing a new generation of starter homes. Amid a statewide housing shortage, ADUs have become a significant source of new housing growth in California.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago. The agreement stipulated that he would guest conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois on his 100th birthday. Though his declining health prevented him from traveling, Gabriel was determined to fulfill his promise and conducted the band remotely from his home in Virginia. The event celebrated his long-standing commitment and passion for music, as he emphasized that "your word is your bond," successfully leading the musicians one last time.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests Salton Sea Shoreline Is Not the Primary Source of Regional Air Pollution</h2>

          <p>A new report indicates that the dusty, exposed shoreline of the shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in California's Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects at the sea have been the focus of efforts to combat the region's high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. Researchers now suggest that the pollution comes from a wide variety of sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The report's authors recommend a shift in strategy from source control to protecting people where they are exposed, such as by improving indoor air filtration in homes and schools.</p>

          <h2>Indian Clinical Trials Suggest Mangoes May Benefit People with Type 2 Diabetes</h2>

          <p>New research from India challenges the common belief that people with diabetes must avoid mangoes, suggesting the fruit may actually improve metabolic health when consumed in moderation. Two clinical trials found that replacing carbohydrates like white bread with a controlled portion of mango led to better blood sugar control, lower insulin resistance, and improvements in weight and cholesterol for adults with type 2 diabetes. Researchers emphasize that this is not a license for unlimited consumption, but that incorporating the fruit into a calorie-controlled diet can be beneficial. The findings offer a hopeful perspective for managing the condition in regions where mangoes are a beloved staple.</p>

          <p>An iconic image of the late Kobe Bryant celebrating has been reimagined in a new mural in Redondo Beach, showing the Lakers legend wearing a Dodgers jersey instead of his traditional purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship and is located on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while the restaurant chain features a Kobe mural at each location, they wanted this one to fit the Dodgers theme. The alteration has generated mixed reactions and online discussion, which the artist welcomes as a way to spark conversation and keep Bryant's legacy alive.</p>
