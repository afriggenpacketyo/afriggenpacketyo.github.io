          <p>Economists in China are currently debating the merits of establishing official consumption benchmarks in the country's next five-year plan. Proponents, like Chang Xiuze from a national planning commission think tank, argue that setting targets for the household consumption rate could help stimulate domestic demand and improve citizens' lives. They point to China's relatively low household consumption rate of 39.6% in 2023 as an area needing strategic focus. However, other scholars express skepticism, questioning whether such metrics are operationally feasible as effective policy goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary injunction preventing the Trump administration from repurposing over $4 billion in FEMA funds intended for disaster mitigation projects. The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from 20 states, which argued the administration unlawfully terminated the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The judge found that reallocating the funds could cause "irreparable harm" to flood-prone areas and that the government's action was not consistent with congressional intent. The funds will remain blocked while the court considers the case further.</p>

          <p>After a 17-year delay, a state-owned Chinese company is making significant progress on the Mes Aynak copper mine in Afghanistan, one of the world's largest untapped deposits. The China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) stated it is prepared to begin extraction this year, pending smooth procedural follow-up with the Afghan government. The project, first awarded in 2008, was stalled by security issues, the presence of ancient archaeological sites, and lack of infrastructure. To address concerns, the mining plan has been switched to a more costly underground process to better protect historical relics.</p>

          <p>Ten years after their debut appearance, K-pop group Monsta X returned to the KCON festival in Los Angeles as headliners, marking a significant milestone in their career. The group, now in their early 30s, reflected on their journey and performed for the first time in the U.S. after a two-year hiatus for mandatory military service. Their return highlights a trend of endurance among established K-pop acts, proving that strong group dynamics can overcome traditional career breaks. The members are now preparing for a new album, "X," set for release in September.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every measured category during 2024. The data, compiled from over 16,000 law enforcement agencies, shows a 4.5% drop in violent crime and an 8.1% decline in property crime compared to the previous year. Notably, the murder rate fell by 14.9%, and motor vehicle thefts saw a historic 18.6% drop. While experts note this continues a downward trend from post-pandemic highs, they caution that some categories like aggravated assault remain elevated compared to pre-2020 levels.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has passed a new ordinance requiring landlords in unincorporated areas to ensure their rental units do not exceed 82 degrees Fahrenheit. The law, aimed at protecting tenants from the health dangers of extreme heat, will take effect next month but won't be enforced until January 2027 to allow time for compliance. Officials are encouraging landlords to use "passive" cooling methods like reflective roofing and blackout curtains in addition to air conditioning. The measure is a public health response to increasingly frequent and intense heat waves in the region.</p>

          <p>A partnership between the nonprofit Trust for Public Land and Camino Nuevo Charter Academy in Los Angeles is demonstrating the benefits of replacing asphalt schoolyards with green spaces. The project transformed a concrete playground, which could reach 145 degrees, into a park-like area with grass and trees, lowering surface temperatures by 40 degrees. This initiative addresses the "concrete jungle" environment many urban children face, providing safer and more inviting areas for outdoor play. Experts note such spaces not only combat heat but also improve air quality and support children's emotional development.</p>

          <p>Following a federal appeals court order, U.S. border agents have been directed to stop deporting migrants under President Trump's sweeping asylum ban. The policy had effectively closed the asylum system to those entering the country illegally, but the court ruled that the government cannot disregard other laws protecting migrants from being sent to places where they could face torture or persecution. This move reopens pathways for migrants to request humanitarian refuge, though they will likely remain in detention during the process, ending a key policy the administration credited for a sharp drop in border crossings.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers are bringing back one of their franchise's most productive players, agreeing to a one-year, $8.52 million deal with wide receiver Keenan Allen. Allen, who spent 11 seasons with the team before being traded to Chicago last year in a salary-cap move, returns to bolster a receiving corps in need of veteran leadership. The six-time Pro Bowl selection is second in the team's all-time receiving yards list and will provide a familiar target for quarterback Justin Herbert.

          <p>New Jersey has secured a landmark $2 billion settlement with chemical manufacturers DuPont, Chemours, and Corteva to resolve claims related to "forever chemicals" (PFAS) and other pollutants. State officials called it the largest single-state environmental settlement in U.S. history. The agreement requires the companies to pay for natural resource damages and fund the cleanup of contamination at four major industrial sites. It also establishes a substantial reserve fund to protect taxpayers from future costs if the companies fail to meet their obligations, holding them accountable for decades of pollution.</p>

          <p>A new study based on 20 years of data from Rwanda's Volcanoes National Park reveals the crucial importance of relationships between female mountain gorillas. Researchers found that when a female gorilla moves to a new social group, she will actively seek out and join another female she already knows, even if they have been apart for many years. This behavior highlights that these same-sex social bonds provide key benefits, likely helping new arrivals navigate the social hierarchy and mitigate aggression from resident females. The findings reframe the understanding of female-female relationships in gorilla society.</p>

          <p>Despite significant improvements in accuracy, public perception of weather forecasting often includes frustration over perceived errors. This article explores the complexities behind forecasting, noting that the atmosphere is a "chaotic system" where tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes. Communicating vast amounts of data and uncertainty to the public in a concise format also presents a major challenge. While new technologies like AI promise even better long-range predictions, they also introduce new complexities, reinforcing the need for clear communication from human forecasters.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned two advertisements from the fashion retailer Zara, ruling that they featured models who appeared "unhealthily thin" and were therefore "irresponsible." The watchdog noted that styling, shadows, and model poses made the individuals appear "gaunt" with "protruding" collarbones. Zara, which removed the images, stated that both models had medical certificates confirming their good health. This ruling follows similar bans on ads from other major retailers, reflecting ongoing scrutiny of body image representation in the fashion industry.</p>
