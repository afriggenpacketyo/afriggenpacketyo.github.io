          <p>The new Syrian government has agreed to assist the United States in locating and returning Americans missing in Syria, according to U.S. special envoy Thomas Barrack. This development signals improving relations between the two countries since the ousting of former President Bashar al-Assad.

          <p>This article remembers Julie Moore, an Army spouse who revolutionized the military's approach to notifying families of service member deaths. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore led a campaign to ensure that families received in-person notifications with support. Her efforts resulted in a fundamental change in Army culture, with service members now personally delivering the news and providing assistance. Moore's legacy continues to impact countless families, and she was honored in 2023 when Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore.</p>

          <p>Financial planners advise keeping some cash on hand for situations where digital payments are not viable, such as power outages or dead phones. While Americans carry an average of $67 in their wallets, the amount of cash one should keep depends on their routine. Experts recommend having enough to cover typical expenses like gas, food, or transportation, generally suggesting $50 to $100. Some emphasize the importance of cash during tech failures, with one planner recommending at least $50 for outages and emergencies. (not investment advice)</p>
