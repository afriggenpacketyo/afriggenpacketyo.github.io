          <p>Chelsea's new £60 million signing, João Pedro, made a spectacular full debut by scoring two stunning goals against his former club, Fluminense, securing Chelsea's spot in the Club World Cup final. The Brazilian forward, who had joined the team just a week prior from a holiday, respectfully refrained from celebrating his goals. His performance has been widely praised, offering a promising solution to Chelsea's search for a reliable and effective striker as they advance in the tournament.</p>

          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has officially ended its two-decade-old policy that required airline passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes. Citing significant advancements in security technology, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced the change is effective immediately across all U.S. airports. This move aims to streamline the screening process and improve the travel experience for millions. The original rule was implemented nationwide in 2006 following the attempted bombing plot by Richard Reid, the "shoe bomber."</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-08 18:05:59 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Brazil and China have formally agreed to conduct a five-year feasibility study for an ambitious transcontinental railway project. The proposed railway would span approximately 4,500 kilometers, connecting Brazil's Atlantic coast to a port on Peru's Pacific coast. If constructed, the corridor, with cost estimates exceeding $70 billion, could dramatically reshape South American trade by shortening shipping times to Asia by as much as 12 days compared to routes using the Panama Canal. For now, the agreement is limited to technical, environmental, and economic studies.</p>

          <p>A new bill signed by President Trump introduces a temporary tax deduction for seniors, which the administration has promoted as a measure that will eliminate federal income taxes for most Social Security beneficiaries. However, policy experts clarify that the bill does not directly alter the taxation of benefits, but instead creates a new "bonus" deduction of up to $6,000 for seniors with incomes below certain thresholds. The largest benefits will go to higher-income seniors, while many low-income recipients who already pay no federal tax will see no change. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon founder and chairman Jeff Bezos recently sold nearly three million shares of company stock, valued at approximately $665.8 million, according to a regulatory filing. The transaction is part of a pre-arranged trading plan, announced earlier this year, that will see Bezos sell up to 25 million Amazon shares through May 2026. Despite the significant sale, which follows his recent high-profile wedding, Bezos remains Amazon's largest individual shareholder with a stake valued at close to $200 billion.

          <p>Researchers have discovered the severed bow of the famed U.S. heavy cruiser USS New Orleans, found resting deep on the seafloor in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound. The bow was violently torn from the ship by a Japanese torpedo during the 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga, an attack that killed over 180 crew members. In a remarkable story of survival, the remaining crew performed heroic damage control, saving the ship, which was later fitted with a new bow and returned to service in the war.</p>

          <p>As the Federal Reserve's July meeting approaches, financial experts are advising savers to act promptly to lock in high-yield certificates of deposit (CDs), with many rates currently in the 4% range. Since the Fed may signal future interest rate cuts, which would lower CD yields, it is a strategic time to secure current rates. Savers are encouraged to shop at online banks for the highest returns and carefully calculate deposit amounts and term lengths to avoid early withdrawal penalties while maximizing their earnings.

          <p>The new "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn and starring David Corenswet, reboots the iconic hero as an impulsive and somewhat naive figure, a notable departure from more cynical recent portrayals. The movie struggles to find a consistent tone, attempting to balance earnestness with Gunn's signature comedic style. The article's review finds the plot entertaining and the concept of a flawed Superman interesting, but concludes that the execution is uneven, leaving the Man of Steel feeling more like a well-meaning but dazed and superficial character.</p>
