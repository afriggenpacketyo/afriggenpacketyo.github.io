          <p>David Huerta, a prominent Southern California labor union leader, will see a felony charge against him reduced to a misdemeanor. Huerta was arrested during a protest against an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid in Los Angeles, where he was accused of obstructing federal officers. His arrest sparked outrage among immigrant advocates and Democratic leaders, who called it a politically motivated act of retaliation by the Trump administration. Huerta's attorneys stated they will seek a speedy trial to vindicate him, asserting that the charges were an attempt to silence dissent and punish political opposition.</p>

          <p>A 17-mile stretch of Interstate 5 between San Clemente and Oceanside was temporarily shut down for a military event involving live artillery fire over the freeway. The closure, directed by the White House, affects the portion of the highway running alongside Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, a critical transportation corridor between Los Angeles and San Diego. This shutdown forces motorists onto a significant detour via Interstate 15, potentially turning a 23-minute drive into a journey of over two hours. Rail services, including Amtrak and Metrolink, were also disrupted by the unprecedented military exercise over a major civilian highway.</p>

          <p>As Halloween costume prices rise, Christophe Waggoner of Austin, Texas, is helping families in need by creating and donating costumes made from thrifted items. With the average cost of a single costume increasing by 11% this year, many families are forced to cut back, but Waggoner's initiative ensures children can still celebrate. He spends thousands of his own money annually on the project, hosting events where kids can choose a costume for free. Waggoner says his goal is to inspire a cycle of giving, as many families return to donate their old costumes for others to use.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid increasing market volatility, some financial experts are recommending income funds that utilize options-based strategies as a way for risk-averse investors to find stability. John Burrello, a senior portfolio manager at Invesco, suggests these funds offer more structural protection because their performance is not directly correlated with traditional stock and asset classes. This approach can provide a reliable form of downside protection and generate income that is not sensitive to interest rate changes. As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates, having an income source independent of central bank policy is becoming increasingly important for investors. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to the common stereotype that women are more eager to commit, a recent study by DatingNews.com and the Kinsey Institute reveals that men are more likely to rush relationship milestones like moving in together or marriage. The survey of 2,000 U.S. singles found that financial savings was a primary motivator for men. However, experts suggest a deeper reason is that heterosexual men often rely on romantic relationships as their main source of social and emotional support. This dependency can lead to lower psychological well-being when they are single, as they tend to have fewer close, intimate friendships compared to women.</p>

          <p>In a competitive job market, many job seekers are using artificial intelligence tools to create professional headshots at a fraction of the cost of traditional photography. Services like HeadshotPro and Canva's AI feature allow users to upload selfies and receive polished, studio-quality images in minutes for under $50. While users report a significant increase in recruiter engagement after updating their profiles with AI photos, the trend raises questions about authenticity. Career experts warn that poorly done AI headshots can appear inauthentic and hurt a candidate's chances, though distinguishing them from real photos is becoming increasingly difficult.</p>

Greene emphasizes that applying for scholarships is a numbers game and recommends submitting 100 to 200 applications to increase the odds of success. She also stresses the importance of treating the application essay as a marketing tool to convince committees to invest in one's education.</p>

          <p>The term "Das crazy," a hybrid of German and English, has been chosen as Germany's Youth Word of the Year for 2025. The expression, which deliberately breaks grammatical rules, is widely used by young Germans in internet culture and daily conversation to express surprise, speechlessness, or irony. Selected through an online vote organized by the publisher PONS Langenscheidt, the phrase beat out other contenders like "goonen" and "checkst du."
