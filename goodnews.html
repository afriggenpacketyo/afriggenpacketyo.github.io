          <h2>Potential 'China Shock' could bring inflation relief, says report</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Overcapacity in China's manufacturing sector is leading to a surge of cheap exports, raising concerns among Asian economies about squeezed local industries. However, economists suggest this influx of low-cost Chinese goods could alleviate inflation for consumers in other economies. This development could provide central banks with some breathing room as they balance lowering living costs and stimulating growth amidst rising trade tensions. Nomura predicts that emerging growth risks and subdued inflation may lead to rate cuts across Asia, decoupling from the Federal Reserve's policies (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>India's central bank has reduced its benchmark policy rate by 50 basis points to 5.5%, the lowest since August 2022, exceeding market expectations. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra cited softening inflation and slower growth amidst global challenges as reasons for the move. Despite better-than-expected GDP growth in the fiscal fourth quarter, the central bank maintained its full-year GDP estimate at 6.5%, indicating a slowdown. While highlighting growth concerns and tariff threats, the RBI also noted that inflation is trending downward, allowing for rate cuts (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>A new report by PwC suggests that artificial intelligence is creating jobs and increasing worker value, contrary to widespread fears of job losses and wage cuts. The report, analyzing over 800 million job ads, found that wages and job numbers are growing in AI-exposed occupations, including those most automatable. Productivity growth has nearly quadrupled in industries positioned to adopt AI, and wages for workers with AI skills are significantly higher. The report challenges common myths about AI's impact, highlighting its potential to enrich jobs and create new opportunities.</p>

          <p>Some Democrats are questioning whether the party needs new leadership due to an aging old guard in Congress. The losses of three congressional Democrats this year have bolstered the Republicans' majority, allowing them to pass legislation. While veteran politicians like Jim Clyburn dismiss concerns about their age, others emphasize the need for younger community involvement. There are signs of young upstarts challenging established figures, indicating a potential shift in the party's dynamics.</p>

          <p>Japan's farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi suggested initiating emergency rice imports if the government fails to lower prices, emphasizing that there should be no "sacred cows" in agricultural policy. The government is already releasing rice reserves to lower prices, aiming to stabilize prices and address distribution shortages. Koizumi's remarks echo his father's reformist approach, indicating a willingness to consider unconventional measures. The government is aiming to boost production, prevent supply shortages and support producers in response.</p>

Their position in the polls has slipped considerably since last year's general election and they've often found themselves on the defensive when it comes to controversial UK Labour policies, such as cuts to winter fuel payments. Despite all that, they've taken the Holyrood seat from the SNP. Reform UK, who finished third with about 7,000 votes, weren't actually that far behind first place Labour.</p>
