          <p>The Federal Trade Commission, along with seven states, has filed a lawsuit against Ticketmaster and its parent company, Live Nation, alleging monopolistic and illegal ticket resale tactics. The suit claims the companies colluded with scalpers, used "bait and switch" pricing, and violated the Better Online Ticket Sales Act, costing consumers millions. The FTC alleges Ticketmaster "triple dips" by collecting fees from brokers and consumers in both primary and secondary markets. The agency is seeking an injunction to halt these practices which they claim harm both fans and artists. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Intel's stock experienced its best single-day performance since 1987, closing over 22% higher after Nvidia announced a $5 billion investment in the company. The strategic partnership will involve co-developing data center and PC chips, combining Nvidia's AI and accelerated computing technology with Intel's CPU and x86 ecosystem. This investment follows recent financial backing for Intel from the U.S. government and SoftBank, aimed at supporting the chipmaker's turnaround efforts. The collaboration is seen as a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing, though it does not appear to include manufacturing Nvidia chips at Intel's foundries. (not investment advice)</p>

The device allows users to record video and send messages, building on the success of the company's previous audio-only models. As Meta pushes further into this technology, it faces growing competition from companies like Google, Snap, and Apple, who are also developing their own smart eyewear.</p>

          <p>Paul Thomas Anderson's new film, "One Battle After Another," is described as a thrilling and timely blockbuster starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a retired radical forced back into action. The movie, inspired by Thomas Pynchon's novel "Vineland" but set in the present day, tackles themes of political violence and government overreach. The review praises Anderson's shift to a contemporary setting and a fast-paced, action-filled narrative, a departure from his typically slower, period-focused films. DiCaprio's performance as the paranoid but justified protagonist is highlighted, as is the film's ability to blend genre storytelling with profound commentary on modern American tensions.</p>

          <p>A jury has acquitted Brayan Ramos-Brito, a protester charged with assaulting a U.S. border patrol agent during an immigration demonstration in Los Angeles. The verdict is a setback for federal prosecutors, as the defense successfully cast doubt on the credibility of the agents who testified, including a senior official. Witness footage of the incident showed an agent forcefully shoving Ramos-Brito but did not show the alleged assault by the protester. The case was one of many aggressive prosecutions of protesters involved in demonstrations against the administration's immigration raids this summer.</p>

          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a home equity loan has slightly decreased. A $50,000 home equity loan with a 10-year term now has an average rate of 8.43%, resulting in a monthly payment of about $618, a minor reduction from earlier in the year. With U.S. homeowners holding record levels of equity, these loans offer a lower-interest alternative to personal loans or credit cards for borrowing significant sums. While the savings are not dramatic, they can accumulate over the life of the loan. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American higher education has long been torn between three competing functions: providing cultural formation, preparing students for careers, and advancing academic research. This tension dates back to the late 19th century, when figures like Harvard's Charles W. Eliot pushed to make college more practical, moving away from the purely classical curriculum. The subsequent rise of the research university, exemplified by Johns Hopkins, further shifted the focus toward faculty scholarship. This article argues that the debate over what college is for has never been settled, and its contradictions are felt today as students question the value of their degrees.</p>
