        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Rice prices in Japan more than doubled in May, marking the largest increase in over half a century, following similar spikes in previous months. This surge contributes to Japan's core inflation rate, which reached its highest level since January 2023, driven primarily by rising food costs. The government has released emergency stockpiles to moderate rice prices, and analysts suggest that future inflation trends will heavily depend on food prices, especially rice. The Bank of Japan held rates steady but indicated potential future rate hikes contingent on underlying inflation approaching the 2% target, while also forecasting a sluggish economy.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China maintained its benchmark lending rates unchanged after cutting them last month, as a trade agreement with the U.S. has eased some growth concerns. The People's Bank of China kept the one-year loan prime rate at 3.0% and the five-year LPR at 3.5%, aligning with expectations. Trade-war fears have diminished after U.S. and Chinese representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, which allows for rare earth and tech trade and suspends prohibitive tariffs. Chinese authorities may exercise limited urgency in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus, focusing on alternative avenues to stimulate economic growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China and its Central Asian partners convened at a high-level summit to address shared security concerns amidst global turbulence. The strengthening ties between Beijing and the five Central Asian countries have prompted inquiries about Russia's regional dominance, especially as it remains focused on the Ukraine war. While the Kremlin dismisses concerns, diplomatic observers suggest Moscow has limited capacity to counterbalance China's expanding influence. Beijing is avoiding directly challenging Russia as Central Asia's key security guarantor and dominant power, maintaining a delicate balance in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's core consumer prices rose by 3.7% in May, marking the largest increase in over two years, primarily due to surging rice and food costs, according to government data. The increase in the nationwide consumer price index, excluding fresh food, was the sharpest since January 2023, with the inflation rate remaining above the Bank of Japan's 2% target since April 2022. Food prices, excluding fresh items, increased significantly, with rice prices setting a record for the eighth consecutive month. Economists anticipate rice prices to decline with the new harvest in the fall, potentially easing the impact on consumer prices.</p>

          <p>Hunan has become the first province in China to allocate proceeds from special-purpose bonds to guarantee government payments to enterprises, allocating 20 billion yuan for this purpose this year. This adjustment marks the first time these bonds, typically used for revenue-generating construction projects, will be used to cover government arrears. The province's finance department stated that disbursements will prioritize completing ongoing construction, clearing obligations, and reducing fiscal risk. Experts caution that the 20 billion yuan may be insufficient compared to the scale of local government debt and that the repayment picture is complicated by entangled triangular debts.</p>

One player, Timothy Weah, described the experience as "a bit weird" and expressed a desire to focus on playing football rather than engaging in politics. The visit also included awkward moments, such as Trump questioning whether a woman could make the team, highlighting the disconnect between the players' interests and the political agenda.</p>

Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy had warned of potential grant cuts to states not cooperating with federal law enforcement, as part of a broader effort against "sanctuary" jurisdictions. The judge sided with the plaintiff states, ruling that the administration lacked the authority to impose immigration enforcement conditions on federal transportation dollars.

          <h2>Judge Denies Blake Lively's Motion to Keep Texts with Taylor Swift Confidential in Harassment Case</h2>

          <p>A judge has denied Blake Lively's request to keep her text messages with Taylor Swift confidential in her legal battle against "It Ends With Us" co-star Justin Baldoni. The judge stated that since Lively indicated Swift had knowledge of complaints or discussions about the film's working environment, the texts are relevant to her harassment and retaliation claims. Baldoni's team requested the texts to discover information that would either prove or disprove Lively's allegations. Lively's representative expressed concern that Baldoni is using the requests to exploit Swift's popularity and distract from the sexual harassment accusations.</p>

          <p>A former plantation in Harpersville, Alabama, is being reimagined as a space for healing, art, and reparative history. The Wallace Center for Arts and Reconciliation is collaborating with a narrative studio to recenter the stories of Black descendant communities through creative storytelling. The project aims to connect with a new generation around the importance of seeing history as the story of shared humanity. The initiative involves descendants of both enslavers and the enslaved in dialogue, practicing honest conversations and acknowledging the horrors of racial violence while uplifting the Black experience.</p>
