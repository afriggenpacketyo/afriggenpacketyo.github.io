          <p>President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are set to meet at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, a remote and expansive U.S. military installation in Anchorage, Alaska. The location is historically significant, as the U.S. purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire in 1867, and it played a key defensive role during the Cold War. The base, which is home to advanced F-22 Raptor fighter jets, provides a secure and isolated setting for the high-stakes discussions regarding the war in Ukraine.</p>

This two-tonne shipment, transported in just four hours using cold chain logistics, makes durian the fifth fresh fruit from Cambodia approved for direct supply to the Chinese market. The development highlights strengthening agricultural trade ties and improved customs efficiency, tapping into Cambodia's annual durian output of over 120,000 tonnes.</p>

This move is part of a broader U.S. Justice Department effort to dismantle dangerous drug cartels and follows a similar transfer of 29 individuals in February, occurring amid ongoing U.S.-Mexico negotiations.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate hundreds of National Science Foundation research grants for UCLA, which were abruptly frozen late last month. The ruling states that the suspension of the $584 million in funds violated a previous court order blocking such terminations. The administration had cited alleged antisemitism and discrimination at the university as justification for the freeze, which affected studies in fields like cancer, neurobiology, and clean energy, but the judge found the indefinite suspensions were effectively terminations.</p>

          <p>China's government has initiated a year-long program to subsidize interest costs on personal consumer loans in an effort to boost household spending and support the economy. The plan, jointly released by the finance ministry and central bank, will cover one percentage point of interest on loans for various purchases, including cars and education. Officials stated the policy is designed to precisely channel credit into the consumption sector, aiming to make domestic consumption a primary driver of the national economy.

          <p>Tropical Storm Erin has formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean and is expected to strengthen into the first hurricane of the season later this week. The storm developed west of the Cabo Verde islands, where it has already caused deadly flooding, and is currently moving west. While it poses no immediate threat to the United States, early models project Erin could become a major hurricane as it approaches the Caribbean, though its long-term path remains uncertain.</p>

          <p>The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has made a surprise, unsolicited bid of $34.5 billion to acquire Google's Chrome web browser. This move comes after a U.S. Department of Justice antitrust ruling suggested Google should divest Chrome to remedy its illegal monopoly in the search market. While the offer is higher than Perplexity's own valuation, the company claims to have investor backing, positioning the bid as a bold maneuver in the competitive AI landscape and the ongoing scrutiny of big tech.</p>

The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) announced the change, set for early 2026, to better equip the 2.4 million annual test-takers with emergency knowledge, as drivers are often the first to arrive at accident scenes. The initiative aims to prevent avoidable deaths by increasing public awareness and confidence in performing these critical procedures.</p>
