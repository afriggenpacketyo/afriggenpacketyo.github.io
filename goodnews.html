          <p>Colorado Buffaloes head football coach Deion Sanders announced he is now considered cancer-free following a recent surgery to remove his bladder. The procedure was necessary after a diagnosis of high-risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. His medical team confirmed the tumor was removed and a new bladder was constructed using a robotic laparoscopic technique. Sanders, who kept his diagnosis private until now, emotionally shared his journey and stressed the importance of health check-ups, confirming he will continue coaching.</p>

          <p>California's state parks department is introducing a new lottery-style drawing system to improve access to campsites at three of its most popular locations: Malibu Creek, Morro Bay, and McArthur-Burney Falls. This change aims to level the playing field for reservations, which previously sold out within minutes of becoming available. The system, which began at Malibu Creek, allows campers to enter a free drawing for reservations eight months in advance. Unsuccessful applicants will gain points to increase their chances in future drawings, making the process more equitable for all visitors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Amid a prolonged team slump in July, the Los Angeles Dodgers are reportedly exploring options to acquire another position player, with a focus on upgrading their outfield defense before the trade deadline. While the team's star-studded offense has struggled, a key priority is to find a player who can provide more reliable fielding. Minnesota Twins center fielder Harrison Bader has emerged as a potential target, as he is a premium defender also having a strong offensive season. Such a move could bolster the team's run prevention, a critical factor for a potential playoff run.</p>

Judge Beryl Howell ruled that the committee is not a government agency subject to the act, upholding its long-standing practice of meeting privately.

The family, who has a British relative, was granted permission to come to the UK but was denied help leaving Gaza, as the Foreign Office policy only assists in exceptional cases like separated spouses or children.
