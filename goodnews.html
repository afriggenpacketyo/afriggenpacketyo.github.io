          <p>Julian Cash and Lloyd Glasspool have made tennis history by becoming the first all-British pair to win the Wimbledon men's doubles title in 89 years. They defeated Rinky Hijikata and David Pel in straight sets, 6-2 7-6 (7-3), in the final. This victory marks the first time since 1936 that two Britons have been crowned men's doubles champions at any Grand Slam. For Cash and Glasspool, who teamed up less than a year ago, the win is a maiden Grand Slam title and fulfills a major career goal they set for themselves at the beginning of the year.</p>

          <p>Poland's Iga Swiatek has won her first Wimbledon title in a stunningly dominant fashion, defeating American Amanda Anisimova 6-0, 6-0 in just 57 minutes. This "double bagel" victory is the most one-sided women's final at Wimbledon since 1911 and marks Swiatek's sixth Grand Slam championship overall. Swiatek, previously known for her prowess on clay and hard courts, has now won a major on all three surfaces. For Anisimova, who was playing in her first Grand Slam final after returning from a break for mental health, the match was a difficult experience marked by numerous errors.</p>

          <p>A historic Avro Lancaster bomber from the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight (BBMF) made a safe precautionary landing after experiencing an engine problem during an event in Lincolnshire. The crew of the iconic World War Two aircraft diagnosed unusual behavior in one of its four engines and issued a general emergency alert before returning to its base at RAF Coningsby. No one was injured in the incident, and the Royal Air Force has launched an investigation to determine the cause of the issue. The aircraft, PA474, is one of only two airworthy Lancasters remaining in the world.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to address concerns about extreme heat. This decision follows criticism regarding player welfare during the current Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures have been dangerously high. The covered venues in Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver will be prioritized for games played during the hottest parts of the day. Infantino acknowledged heat as a significant issue but expressed confidence that this logistical adjustment will help ensure player safety during the tournament co-hosted by the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.</p>

          <p>Despite President Trump's renewed threats of significant tariffs on major U.S. trading partners, the stock market has remained relatively stable, with major indices near record highs. This contrasts with the market panic seen during earlier tariff announcements, suggesting investors have become more accustomed to the administration's negotiation tactics. Analysts believe the market is focusing more on the positive implications of other administration policies, such as deregulation and a permissive stance on artificial intelligence development. These factors are seen as driving corporate earnings growth, which is currently outweighing the potential negative impact of the trade disputes. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two fathers in England are launching a legal challenge against the government in an effort to get smartphones completely banned from schools. Will Orr-Ewing and Pete Montgomery have formally notified the Education Secretary of their intent to seek a judicial review, arguing that current guidance is unlawful and fails to protect children. They contend that smartphones expose students to harmful content, cyberbullying, and exploitation, citing numerous safeguarding incidents. The fathers believe a full ban is the only safe approach, while the Department for Education maintains that schools already have the power to implement their own bans.</p>
