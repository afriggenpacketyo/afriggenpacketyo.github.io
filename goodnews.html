          <p>The Walt Disney Company has announced that "Jimmy Kimmel Live!" will return to the airwaves on Tuesday, nearly a week after being suspended. The company stated the initial decision was made to avoid escalating a tense national situation following Kimmel's remarks about the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Disney explained that after several days of thoughtful conversations with the host, they mutually agreed to resume the show. The suspension had sparked a significant debate across the nation regarding free speech, corporate responsibility, and political pressure on media outlets.</p>

          <p>Colorado Buffaloes coach Deion Sanders has made a bold prediction that his son, rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders, will get an opportunity to start for the Cleveland Browns at some point during the current NFL season. Speaking on a podcast, Sanders advised his son, who is currently third on the depth chart behind veterans Joe Flacco and Dillon Gabriel, to remain patient and prepared for his chance. He also confirmed that other teams, including the Baltimore Ravens and Philadelphia Eagles, had shown interest in Shedeur during the draft. The comments add a layer of intrigue to the Browns' quarterback situation as the season progresses.</p>

          <p>India is investing approximately $18 billion through its "Semiconductor Mission" to build a comprehensive domestic chip manufacturing ecosystem, aiming to reduce its reliance on imports. The initiative seeks to establish a full supply chain, from design to fabrication and packaging, capitalizing on global efforts to diversify electronics production away from China. So far, ten projects have been approved, including fabrication plants by Tata Electronics and partnerships with Taiwanese firms. However, experts caution that success depends on overcoming significant challenges, including developing a robust local ecosystem, improving infrastructure, and creating sustainable policies beyond initial financial incentives.

          <p>Sir Ed Davey, leader of the UK's Liberal Democrat party, is set to propose a visa discount scheme to attract American cancer scientists to the United Kingdom. The proposal is a direct response to the Trump administration's decision to cut billions of dollars from biomedical research grants in the U.S. Davey argues that the UK should seize the opportunity to become a world leader in cancer research by providing a new home for scientists affected by what he terms the U.S. government's "anti-science agenda." This move is part of a broader political strategy by the Liberal Democrats to position themselves in stark opposition to President Trump's policies.</p>

He identified opportunities across various sectors, including consumer travel with Royal Caribbean and Expedia, and financials with Citigroup and American Express. In the technology sector, he pointed to Dell as a key player in AI infrastructure, and also recommended industrial giants like Caterpillar and Cummins. Cramer suggested that by doing thorough research, investors can still find stocks with above-average growth prospects at below-average prices. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A moderate earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 4.3 struck the San Francisco Bay Area early Monday morning, waking residents across the region. The United States Geological Survey reported the epicenter was located just east-southeast of Berkeley. While thousands of people reported feeling the shaking, there have been no immediate reports of significant damage or injuries. The event prompted Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) to run trains at reduced speeds for safety inspections, causing minor delays for commuters. The quake serves as a reminder of the region's seismic activity and the importance of preparedness.</p>

          <p>Defense technology company Anduril has announced that its YFQ-44A Fury drone, a candidate for the Air Force's Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA) program, will attempt its first flight in a semi-autonomous mode. Instead of being remotely piloted, the drone is designed to take off, fly a pre-planned route, and land with the push of a button. While this software-first approach has delayed the maiden flight, the company believes it will accelerate the overall testing and development timeline. Anduril is currently producing multiple Fury aircraft to support an expansive flight test schedule over the next year, aiming to field the advanced capability quickly.</p>
