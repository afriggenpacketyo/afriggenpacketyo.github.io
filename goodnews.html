          <h2>Federal Reserve Enacts Quarter-Point Interest Rate Cut, Signaling More to Come</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:25:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve has implemented a quarter-percentage-point interest rate cut, the first such move in its current cycle, aiming to support a moderating economy and a slowing labor market. The decision, which faced one dissent in favor of a larger cut, came amid significant political pressure from the White House for more aggressive easing. Policymakers' projections, known as the "dot plot," indicate the potential for two additional cuts before the end of the year. This move reflects the committee's heightened concern over downside risks to employment, even as inflation remains somewhat elevated. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Why Long-Term CDs Could Be a Strategic Move for Savers Amid Interest Rate Cuts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:07:04 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, savers are advised to consider locking in current rates with long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). With further rate reductions anticipated later this year, opening a CD now can protect earnings from the subsequent decline in yields that affects variable-rate savings accounts. The article highlights that even with the cut, current long-term CD rates can still generate significant, guaranteed interest returns. This strategy offers a hedge against an unpredictable economic climate where conventional investment returns may fluctuate. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Reserve's recent quarter-point rate reduction is expected to have a mixed impact on household finances, offering potential relief for consumers with variable-rate debt. Interest rates on credit cards and some loans are likely to decrease, though annual percentage rates will remain historically high. Conversely, savers may see lower returns on high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit. The article notes that while the cut has been priced into mortgage rates, a series of future cuts could exert gradual downward pressure on them over time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Research Finds Wild Chimpanzees Regularly Consume Alcohol from Fermented Fruit</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-17 14:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study has found that wild chimpanzees in Uganda and Côte d'Ivoire consume the equivalent of nearly two human alcoholic beverages per day by eating naturally fermented fruit. Researchers measured the alcohol content in the figs and plum-like fruits that make up the chimps' diet, finding it to be around 0.3% by weight. While this low concentration means the chimps are not getting drunk, they are exposed to a steady, low dose of ethanol. The findings lend support to the "drunken monkey" hypothesis, which suggests human attraction to alcohol may have evolutionary roots in the fruit-eating habits of our primate ancestors.</p>

          <h2>Frontier Airlines CEO Disputes United CEO's Claim That Discount Airline Model Is Dead</h2>

          <p>Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle has publicly pushed back against United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby's recent declaration that the ultra-low-cost carrier model is defunct. Kirby had predicted the failure of Spirit Airlines, prompting Biffle to retort, "That's cute," and point to Frontier's lower unit costs as a key advantage. The dispute highlights the intense competition and differing strategies within the U.S. airline industry. While discount carriers have faced challenges from rising costs and competition from major airlines' basic economy offerings, Biffle remains confident in his airline's value proposition for budget-conscious travelers.</p>

          <p>Despite their success in the regular season, the primary objective for Lionel Messi and Inter Miami is to win the MLS Cup, the league's championship trophy. The article argues that while other titles like the Supporters' Shield are significant, the MLS Cup holds the most cultural importance for fans and the club's legacy. With Messi, now 38, nearing the end of his career, the pressure is on the club to secure the championship. To achieve this, the team will need to improve its consistency and discipline as it heads into the playoffs, where the regular season record matters little.</p>

          <p>A recent drop in mortgage rates to their lowest levels since 2022 has triggered a significant surge in refinancing applications from homeowners. The increased interest is largely driven by expectations of continued easing by the Federal Reserve. The article outlines which homeowners are best positioned to benefit, including those who bought homes in 2023 or 2024 at higher rates, borrowers with large outstanding balances, and those with strong credit profiles. For these groups, refinancing now could lead to substantial monthly savings and provide financial stability against future market shifts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's experimental oral diabetes pill, orforglipron, demonstrated superior performance in lowering blood sugar levels and promoting weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's approved oral drug, Rybelsus. The late-stage study showed that the highest dose of orforglipron reduced hemoglobin A1c by 2.2% and led to an average weight loss of 9.2%, outperforming the results from Novo Nordisk's pill. This development positions Eli Lilly's drug as a potentially strong, needle-free competitor in the massive market for GLP-1 treatments. The company expects to apply for regulatory approval for Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026.</p>

          <p>The European Union has proposed a new strategic agenda aimed at elevating its relationship with India, partly as a way to lure the country from Russia's sphere of influence. This diplomatic approach contrasts with calls from the U.S. for punitive tariffs against India for its purchase of Russian oil. The EU's strategy focuses on deepening cooperation through a potential trade deal and enhanced defense-industrial ties, viewing India as a key partner and a counterweight to China. Despite disagreements over India's relationship with Russia, EU leaders see the partnership as crucial for diversifying supply chains and promoting shared interests.</p>

          <p>Chrysler is recalling 163,735 Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer SUVs from model years 2022 through 2025 due to a potential safety hazard. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the trim on the driver and passenger doors can detach while the vehicle is in motion. This could create a road hazard for other drivers and increase the risk of a crash. The issue is reportedly related to vehicle assembly rather than a defective part. Chrysler has not reported any accidents or injuries related to the flaw, and dealers will replace the trim for free.</p>

          <p>England defeated Ireland by four wickets in the first match of their three-game T20 series in Dublin, largely thanks to a powerful performance by opener Phil Salt. Salt scored 89 runs off just 46 balls, setting up England to successfully chase Ireland's total of 196-3 with more than two overs remaining. The match marked the first time Jacob Bethell captained the English side, which was playing without its all-format stars. Despite half-centuries from Ireland's Harry Tector and Lorcan Tucker, England's aggressive start to their reply proved decisive in securing their first-ever T20 win against Ireland.</p>
