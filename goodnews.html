          <p>An idle Southern California Edison transmission tower, Tower 208, was dismantled and removed via helicopter for testing to determine its role in the Eaton fire that occurred on January 7. Investigators are exploring the possibility that the tower, which had been unused for over 50 years, became reenergized and sparked the fire. The tower will undergo close examination and testing in a laboratory setting by fire investigators, Southern California Edison officials, and experts hired by plaintiffs suing the utility company.</p>

          <p>Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. defended the independence of the judiciary and denounced attempts to impeach judges due to disagreements with their rulings during public remarks in Buffalo. He emphasized that impeachment is not the appropriate response to judicial decisions, highlighting the role of the judiciary in checking the excesses of Congress or the executive branch. His comments followed similar remarks by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who criticized attacks on judges and the risk of undermining the Constitution and the rule of law. This comes amid intense pressure on the justices as they navigate emergency applications arising from court challenges to Trump administration policies.</p>

          <p>In response to Utah and Idaho's Republican-controlled legislatures passing bans on flying unofficial flags on government property, Salt Lake City and Boise have adopted official pride flags. Salt Lake City's mayor proposed and the city council approved three new city flags featuring the city's traditional design imposed over a pride flag, a trans flag, and a Juneteenth flag. Boise's mayor issued a proclamation retroactively making the pride flag an official city flag. These actions directly challenge the Trump administration's efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights.</p>
