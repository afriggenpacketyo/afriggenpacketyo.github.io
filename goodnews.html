          <p>State health officials in Texas have officially declared an end to a measles outbreak that infected 762 people, the largest in the state in over three decades. The outbreak, which began in January, resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children and led to nearly 100 hospitalizations. The declaration came after 42 days passed without a new case, though officials remain vigilant due to declining vaccination rates and ongoing outbreaks elsewhere. Experts emphasize the continued risk posed by low immunization coverage in many communities across the U.S.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The musical '& Juliet' offers a modern, feminist reimagining of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, centered on the premise that Juliet chooses not to die. The production, reviewed at the Ahmanson Theatre, transforms the story into an energetic dance party powered by the pop hits of producer Max Martin. The show's clever book is praised for integrating famous songs from artists like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys in a way that feels emotionally coherent with the updated narrative. This results in a feel-good, empowering theatrical experience that celebrates second chances and personal emancipation.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Age Considerations and Optimal Timing for Purchasing Annuities</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article examines the age-related factors involved in purchasing annuities as a retirement planning tool, noting that while there are no federal age limits, individual insurers often set their own caps, typically around 80-85 years old. It discusses how the timing of an annuity purchase can significantly impact costs and returns, with different age ranges offering distinct advantages. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s to mid-60s, but purchasing later in life can result in higher monthly payments due to life expectancy calculations. The article concludes that the decision should align with an individual's broader retirement strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

The event, which attracted 280 teams from 16 countries, is part of China's broader strategy to establish itself as a global leader in the humanoid robot industry by 2027. Chinese companies like Unitree, a competitor to Tesla's Optimus, performed well, highlighting the nation's progress in the field. The games also tested robots on practical job skills, such as factory work and hotel housekeeping, demonstrating their potential for real-world applications.</p>

          <p>Former WKYC TV meteorologist Hollie Strano has started a new position delivering weather forecasts for Mix 94.1, a radio station in Canton, Ohio. Strano's departure from the television station after 22 years followed a charge for driving under the influence and her subsequent public discussion of her recovery from alcoholism. She has since filed a lawsuit against her former employer, alleging her termination was related to her public advocacy for mental health and addiction recovery. In addition to her new role in Ohio, Strano also provides forecasts for radio stations in Georgia and Alabama.</p>

          <h2>Human Remains Found Under Ohio Porch Identified as Historical Burial</h2>

          <p>Human remains discovered under a porch during renovations in Greene County, Ohio, have been identified as belonging to a middle-aged adult from a "disturbed historical burial" dating back over a century. The Greene County Coroner's Office announced that a forensic anthropologist's analysis placed the burial sometime between the late 1600s and early 1900s. The investigation began in April after a renovator found what appeared to be a jawbone while removing an old deck. The finding resolves the initial mystery, confirming the remains are of historical rather than contemporary criminal significance.</p>

          <p>Shares of pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly remained stable despite competitor Novo Nordisk announcing a price cut for its popular diabetes drug, Ozempic, to $499 per month for cash-paying patients. The move is not expected to significantly impact Lilly, as the cash-pay market for diabetes treatments is smaller than for weight-loss drugs due to better insurance coverage. In contrast, Meta Platforms saw its shares decline following a report of another restructuring of its AI division, raising questions about the stability and direction of its significant investments in artificial intelligence talent.

          <p>In a recent interview, "Saturday Night Live" cast member Bowen Yang reflected on his journey to the show, which fulfilled a high school prophecy he once dismissed as a joke. He shared how pop culture, particularly shows like SNL and "Grey's Anatomy," helped him assimilate after moving from Canada and ultimately inspired his career shift from pre-med to comedy. Yang also discussed co-hosting the popular podcast "Las Culturistas" and hiding his interest in books like "The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants" as a teenager, which he considered "cultural contraband" at the time.</p>

          <p>An analysis of financial aid to Ukraine reveals that while the United States is the largest single-nation donor, Europe as a collective has contributed more since Russia's 2022 invasion. According to the Kiel Institute, the U.S. has provided $130.6 billion, whereas European nations and EU institutions combined have committed $165.7 billion. The report clarifies that aid from both sides has been a mix of grants and loans, contrary to some claims that European aid consists only of repayable loans. The data provides context to the ongoing debate about equitable burden-sharing in supporting Ukraine's defense.</p>

          <p>AFC Bournemouth has signed 19-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak from Liverpool in a deal worth an initial £20 million, with an additional £5 million in potential add-ons. Doak, who has signed a five-year contract, sought the move to secure more regular first-team football after making only 10 appearances for Liverpool since 2022. The sale is part of a profitable summer for Liverpool, which has generated significant income from selling academy and development players. Bournemouth has also been active in the transfer market, looking to rebuild its squad after several high-profile departures.</p>

In one, two medical students discovered they had been treated for the same type of leukemia together as 4-year-olds, reuniting 17 years later as they begin their journey to become doctors. The second story features an Arkansas hairstylist who noticed a suspicious spot on a client's scalp during a routine appointment, urging her to see a dermatologist. The spot was confirmed to be skin cancer, and the early detection, credited to the stylist's attentiveness, likely saved her client's life.</p>

          <p>A new study published in JAMA reveals that the CDC's vaccine advisory committee, whose members were all fired by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in June, had the lowest rate of reported financial conflicts of interest since 2000. The conflict rate for the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) had declined from over 42% to just 5% between 2000 and 2024. Kennedy had justified the dismissals by citing a 2007 report on conflicts, but the new data suggests substantial progress had been made in mitigating such issues long before the panel was disbanded.</p>
