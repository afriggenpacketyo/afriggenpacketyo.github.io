        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) reported better-than-expected first fiscal-quarter earnings and provided a strong forecast for the current quarter's revenue. However, the company is anticipating a $1.5 billion hit to revenue due to new U.S. regulations restricting the export of AI chips to China. AMD CEO Lisa Su stated that strong demand for its leadership product portfolio would offset these headwinds. The company's data center segment saw a 57% increase in sales, driven by demand for both Epyc processors and Instinct GPUs, though gaming sales declined due to reduced console chip revenue.

          <p>Starting May 7, travelers will need a Real ID or another approved form of identification, such as a passport, to pass through airport security checkpoints for domestic flights. The Real ID Act, passed in 2005, sets minimum security standards for state-issued identification cards. While Real IDs are sufficient for domestic travel, passports are still required for international travel. Enhanced driver's licenses, offered by a few states, comply with Real ID requirements and allow land and sea border crossings to certain countries. Optimism score: 70</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Delta Air Lines must face a proposed class action lawsuit from passengers who claim the airline refused to offer full refunds after a massive computer outage in July 2024. A federal judge ruled that some plaintiffs can pursue breach of contract claims based on Delta's failure to refund, while others can pursue claims related to delayed and canceled flights under the Montreal Convention. The outage, caused by a flawed software update, resulted in the cancellation of approximately 7,000 Delta flights. Passengers accuse Delta of failing to provide automatic refunds and offering partial refunds only if they waived further legal claims. Optimism score: 60</p>
