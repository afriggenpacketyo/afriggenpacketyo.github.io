          <p>Following a lawsuit from the District of Columbia, the Justice Department has rescinded an order that appointed the head of the Drug Enforcement Administration as the emergency police chief of Washington, D.C. The agreement, reached after an emergency court hearing, confirms that D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith will retain command of the force. The initial takeover was part of President Trump's effort to use federal authority to address crime in the city. A judge indicated that while the mayor must follow White House directives for federal purposes, the administration does not have the authority to assume full operational control of the department.</p>

          <p>San José has announced the completion of the first Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) in California that can be legally sold as a condominium, separate from the main property it shares a lot with. This development comes a year after the city enacted laws to permit such sales, aiming to create more accessible homeownership opportunities. ADUs, often called granny flats or in-law units, are seen as a key strategy to address the state's housing crisis by providing more affordable starter homes. While ADU construction has boomed, accounting for a fifth of statewide housing growth in 2024, experts are still debating their overall impact on the housing shortage.</p>

          <p>Arnald Gabriel, a 100-year-old U.S. Air Force veteran and former conductor of the U.S. Air Force Band, has honored a contract he signed over two decades ago to conduct the Wheaton Municipal Band in Illinois on his 100th birthday. The agreement was made with the band's current conductor, Bruce Moss, who playfully drafted the contract after Gabriel expressed his intention to still be conducting at that age. Although declining health prevented him from traveling from his Virginia home, Gabriel fulfilled his commitment remotely, leading the band via video link. The event celebrated his dedication and the principle that one's word is their bond.</p>

          <p>A new report finds that dust from the exposed shoreline of California's shrinking Salton Sea is responsible for less than 1% of the small particle air pollution in the surrounding Coachella and Imperial valleys. For years, dust control projects have been a primary focus for addressing the region's high rates of asthma and respiratory illness. However, researchers now suggest that the pollution originates from a wide variety of sources, including agriculture, diesel exhaust, and unpaved roads. The study's lead author recommends a shift in focus from source control to protecting people where they are most exposed, such as improving indoor air quality in homes and schools.</p>

          <p>New research from India is challenging the conventional wisdom that people with diabetes should avoid mangoes due to their sweetness. Two recent clinical trials suggest that consuming mangoes in moderation may actually improve blood sugar control and metabolic health. One study found that popular Indian mango varieties produced a lower glycemic response than white bread, while another showed that replacing bread with mango at breakfast led to improvements in key health markers like fasting glucose and insulin resistance. Researchers emphasize that the key is moderation and consuming the fruit as a replacement for other carbohydrates, not as an addition.</p>

          <p>A new mural in Redondo Beach, California, is generating discussion by depicting the late Lakers legend Kobe Bryant in a Dodgers jersey instead of his iconic purple and gold. The artwork is part of a larger piece celebrating the Dodgers' 2024 World Series championship and is located on the side of a future restaurant. The artist, Gustavo Zermeño Jr., explained that while other locations feature Bryant in his Lakers uniform, this version was altered to fit the Dodgers theme. The choice to use an iconic, intense image of Bryant but change the jersey has drawn mixed reactions, which the artist welcomes as a way to spark conversation about Bryant's legacy.</p>

          <p>Following Taylor Swift's announcement of her new album, "The Life of a Showgirl," and her discussion of her love for the color orange, numerous major brands have launched orange-themed social media campaigns. Companies from United Airlines to Shake Shack quickly posted orange-hued memes to align themselves with the immense economic and cultural influence of the pop star. The marketing frenzy was triggered by Swift's appearance on the "New Heights" podcast, where she discussed the color's energetic connection to her life. This phenomenon highlights the significant power of Swift's brand, which has previously been shown to generate substantial economic boosts for cities on her tour stops.</p>

          <p>A report by UK Members of Parliament is recommending that England implement free bus travel for everyone under the age of 22, similar to a policy already in place in Scotland. The proposal aims to help young people access work and education more affordably. Young people interviewed by the BBC described current bus fares as "extortionate," stating that the costs, sometimes exceeding £120 a month, force them to socialize less and cut into their budgets for food and rent. While the Department for Transport says it is already investing £1 billion to improve bus services, supporters argue that free travel is essential for youth mobility and financial stability.</p>

          <p>Topshop, the iconic British fashion brand that closed its physical stores after its parent company collapsed in 2020, is planning a major comeback to the High Street.

While nostalgia for the brand is strong among millennials and Gen Z, industry experts caution that its success will depend on attracting a new generation of shoppers and re-establishing its reputation for trend-setting fashion.

However, the victory also highlighted Liverpool's defensive vulnerabilities, which were exploited by Bournemouth and remain a concern for the team's new season.</p>

          <p>China's bubble tea industry has grown into a multi-billion dollar market, with three major chains raising over $700 million in Hong Kong IPOs this year as investors bet on the country's consumer sector. The industry's rapid expansion is fueled by a franchise-heavy model, which allows for fast growth but poses challenges in maintaining quality control and avoiding market saturation. While brands like Mixue have expanded to tens of thousands of stores globally, they now face intense price wars and rising costs at home. The key test for these companies will be to prove they can build a sustainable business rather than just a passing fad. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Slate Automotive, an electric vehicle startup backed by Jeff Bezos, is promoting a strategy to make EVs more affordable by selling a simple, barebones pickup truck that owners can customize. The company's two-seat Slate Truck is designed to be endlessly customizable with over 100 planned accessories and an "open source" approach that allows third parties to create add-ons. Slate initially advertised a starting price below $20,000 with federal tax credits, but has since adjusted its marketing as those incentives are rolled back. The key challenge will be whether the vehicle remains competitive at a higher price point against other budget-friendly models.</p>
