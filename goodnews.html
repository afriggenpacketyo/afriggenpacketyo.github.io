          <p>Amazon is significantly expanding its same-day delivery service to include fresh groceries like meat, eggs, and produce in over 1,000 U.S. cities, with plans to reach 2,300 locations by year-end. This move intensifies competition with rivals like Instacart, Walmart, and Kroger, whose stock prices fell following the announcement. The service is free for Prime members on orders over $25 and is part of Amazon's broader strategy to integrate its grocery operations, including Whole Foods, more deeply into its ecosystem. This expansion aims to capture a larger share of the grocery market by making it more convenient for customers to bundle perishable items with other purchases.</p>

          <p>Walmart announced it is expanding its 10% employee discount to cover nearly all grocery items, including meat and milk, for its 1.6 million U.S. workers. The move, which makes the popular holiday-season food discount a year-round benefit, comes as rising tariffs are expected to increase consumer prices. In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expanded discount was one of its most requested benefits and would help employees and their families. The policy could also benefit Walmart by encouraging its workforce to shop in-store and helping with employee retention during a period of economic uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

This move is part of a larger, playful campaign by The Habit, which also jabs at In-N-Out's recent decision to establish an eastern headquarters in Tennessee.

          <p>With U.S. home equity reaching a record $17.8 trillion, nearly 48 million mortgage holders now have tappable funds, averaging $213,000 per homeowner. To calculate available equity, homeowners subtract their current mortgage balance from their home's market value, though lenders typically cap borrowing at around 80% of the total equity. Homeowners can access these funds through financial products like home equity loans or HELOCs, which currently have more favorable interest rates than credit cards or personal loans. However, it's crucial to borrow responsibly, as the home serves as collateral and failure to repay could lead to foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For savers with a large sum like $50,000, high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts offer competitive, flexible alternatives to CDs or volatile market investments. Based on current top rates, a $50,000 deposit in a money market account at 4.40% APY would earn slightly more over a year ($2,200) than a high-yield savings account at 4.35% APY ($2,175). While the difference is minimal, both options provide substantial returns and liquidity. Savers should note that these rates are variable and could change with market conditions, and the best rates are typically found at online banks. (not investment advice)</p>

He advises that as AI tools become more integrated into the workplace, employers will prioritize soft skills, and he has encouraged his own teenage child to focus on developing this ability. Garman emphasizes that creativity, adaptability, and the capacity to learn new things will be paramount for future workers. This perspective is shared by other tech leaders, like OpenAI's Sam Altman, who believe human intellect is irreplaceable for generating new ideas and making nuanced judgments.</p>

          <p>Small-cap stocks experienced a significant rally, with the Russell 2000 index gaining over 1%, bucking a broader market trend where large tech stocks faltered. This rotation is driven by growing investor confidence that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September. Lower rates are particularly beneficial for smaller companies, which often rely more heavily on borrowed capital for operations and expansion. Traders are now pricing in a near-100% probability of a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting, a sentiment fueled by recent weaker-than-expected labor market data and a cooling inflation report.

          <p>The Port of Los Angeles processed a record-breaking volume of cargo in July, handling over one million container units for the first time in its 117-year history. This surge was largely driven by shippers front-loading imports of Chinese goods to get ahead of tariff deadlines imposed by the Trump administration. While the port operated without delays, logistics experts note that this early peak season has been unusual and that the high tariff levels have prevented many companies from importing their full orders. As a result, spot freight rates have dropped significantly, indicating a potential slowdown now that the pre-tariff rush has passed. (not investment advice)</p>

This projection, based on the latest inflation data, is slightly higher than the 2.5% increase retirees received for 2025. The annual adjustment is designed to ensure that benefits keep pace with inflation. The official COLA will be announced by the Social Security Administration in October after reviewing inflation data from the third quarter. While inflation has been relatively stable, some economists worry a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>While Tropical Storm Erin is expected to strengthen into a major hurricane over the open Atlantic, it poses a very low threat to the United States. Forecast models show a strong consensus that a dip in the jet stream will steer the storm northward, keeping its center well east of the U.S. coastline as it passes near Bermuda next week. The primary impact on the U.S. East Coast is expected to be heavy surf and dangerous rip currents. The article uses Erin as a case study to caution against sensationalized weather reporting, emphasizing that reliable sources are crucial during hurricane season.</p>

          <p>A new analysis of an ancient Incan khipu, a record-keeping device made of knotted cords, suggests its use may have been more widespread than previously thought. Researchers discovered that a khipu from around 1498 was made primarily of human hair, and a dietary analysis of the hair indicated its owner was likely a commoner, not a member of the ruling elite. This finding challenges the long-held assumption that khipu production was restricted to high-status individuals. The discovery could help bridge the gap between ancient Incan khipus and more modern versions made by lower-status people, rewriting our understanding of literacy in the Inca Empire.</p>
