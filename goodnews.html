          <p>The Transportation Security Administration is no longer requiring passengers in standard screening lines to remove their shoes at some U.S. airports, according to sources familiar with the change. The policy shift appears to be rolling out in phases, with several airports, including those in Baltimore and Philadelphia, being among the first to see the rule expire. Previously, only travelers enrolled in the TSA PreCheck program were exempt from removing footwear. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining security.</p>

          <p>During a White House meeting, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced he was nominating President Donald Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in the Middle East. The meeting was expected to focus on securing a ceasefire in the ongoing Gaza war, with Trump expressing optimism about a potential deal. When asked about the potential forced removal of Palestinians from Gaza, Netanyahu stated that people should have "free choice" to leave if they wish. Trump also indicated the U.S. would resume sending weapons to Ukraine to help it defend against Russia.</p>

          <p>Caltech has announced it will sever ties with online course provider Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit that alleged the partnership was misleading. The lawsuit claimed a cybersecurity "boot camp" was marketed with the prestigious Caltech name despite having minimal connection to the university's faculty or oversight. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to students and implement more transparent practices. The decision is a notable development in the growing scrutiny of partnerships between universities and third-party online program managers.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to lay off tens of thousands of employees, stating that a large-scale reduction-in-force is no longer necessary. The VA is on track to reduce its staff by about 30,000 by the end of the fiscal year through attrition, retirements, and a federal hiring freeze, which it says has eliminated the need for the planned cuts. The initial proposal aimed to reduce staff to pre-Biden administration levels, which could have meant over 80,000 job cuts. A Democratic senator criticized the situation, attributing the high attrition rate to a "toxic work environment."</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw has been selected for his 11th career All-Star Game, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the MLB Commissioner. The 37-year-old, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery, expressed surprise and gratitude for the honor, calling it "weird but cool." The selection recognizes his extensive career accomplishments, including recently becoming the 20th pitcher to record 3,000 strikeouts. Kershaw said he is enjoying the season without a decision on retirement and is focused on staying healthy.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled its plan to purchase 36 additional AH-64E Apache Guardian attack helicopters, a deal valued at approximately $2.2 billion. The decision was reportedly influenced by the demonstrated vulnerability of helicopters to modern air defenses and drones in the war in Ukraine, as well as a significant increase in the aircraft's cost. Officials suggest that the funds will be redirected toward investing in more modern capabilities like drones and smart systems that reflect the future of warfare. This move signals a potential strategic shift away from legacy platforms.</p>

          <p>Budapest police have announced they will not pursue legal action against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government. Organizers, including Budapest's mayor, had argued the march was a legal municipal event, creating public uncertainty about its status. This decision comes amid a broader anti-LGBTQ+ agenda from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government, which passed a law enabling the ban. Despite the prohibition, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing the Trump administration from cutting off Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood. The order freezes a provision in the recently signed "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" that targets organizations primarily engaged in family planning and abortion services. Planned Parenthood argued in its lawsuit that the law unconstitutionally singles them out and would have devastating effects on patients who rely on them for non-abortion services like cancer screenings. The ruling temporarily preserves federal funding for the group while the legal challenge proceeds.</p>

The King is expected to deliver a speech emphasizing the two nations' shared history and the need to work together against modern threats.

In his "Feminine Shuttle," Dr. Baksheiev performs examinations and minor surgeries, often finding a higher-than-average incidence of malignant tumors. Despite his own cancer diagnosis, he continues his humanitarian mission, providing both medical care and a listening ear to women affected by the conflict.</p>

Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. While this initial report will address redress for victims, the second part, which will assign blame for the miscarriage of justice, is not expected until at least 2025. Victims are hopeful the findings will lead to faster and fairer compensation after years of battling for justice.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's announcement of new tariffs on 14 countries, suggesting the figures are likely a starting point for negotiations rather than a final policy. He argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal is likely to increase U.S. exports, not just build domestic plants. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer believes the tariffs may not be as meaningful as they appear and that other economic factors are also important. (not investment advice)</p>
