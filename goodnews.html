          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves announced the government's Spending Review, outlining budgets for key public services over the next three years. The review includes a ¬£2bn real-terms increase for schools by 2029, with funds allocated for training and infrastructure, while the NHS will see a 3% annual real-terms increase in spending. Long-term investment in transport infrastructure is central to Labour's plan, including a new Liverpool to Manchester rail line and a freeze on bus fares. The announcement has been met with mixed reactions, with some questioning whether the funding will be sufficient to address the needs of each sector. </p>

A regular 12-ounce can of Dr. Pepper contains 39 grams of sugar, which could adversely affect those needing to limit their sugar intake. The product code for the recalled cans is XXXXRS05165 with a "best by" date of Feb. 16, 2026. </p>
