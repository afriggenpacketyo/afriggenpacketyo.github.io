          <p>California has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Justice Department over its demand that school districts ban transgender athletes from competing in sports, alleging that the federal agency has overstepped its authority. Attorney General Rob Bonta argues that the Trump administration is demanding that schools violate state law and discriminate against students. The lawsuit seeks to uphold the constitutionality of California's anti-discrimination laws protecting transgender athletes and prevent the federal government from retaliating against schools that do not comply with the administration's directive. The legal battle highlights the growing conflict over transgender rights and equal protection under the Constitution.</p>

          <p>A New York judge has dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million defamation lawsuit against Blake Lively, stemming from Lively's allegations of sexual harassment on the set of the film *It Ends with Us*. Lively filed a suit against Baldoni's Wayfarer Studios in December 2024, alleging she was sexually harassed on set and that Baldoni retaliated against her for bringing those complaints, among other allegations. The judge determined that Baldoni and his company had not adequately alleged that Lively's threats were wrongful extortion and had not proved defamation. Lively's lawyers hailed the decision as a complete vindication for Lively.</p>

The strategy involves investing more in soldiers and equipment, expanding military capabilities, strengthening the domestic defence industry, and diversifying Canada's defence partnerships, and the announcement comes ahead of Canada hosting the G7 Summit.</p>
