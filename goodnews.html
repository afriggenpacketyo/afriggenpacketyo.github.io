          <p>Europe established a dominant 11½-4½ lead over the USA after the second day of the Ryder Cup, requiring only 2.5 more points from 12 singles matches for retention. The article highlights the American team's capitulation and poor crowd behavior at Bethpage Black, with personal insults directed at European players. Despite the unsportsmanlike atmosphere, Europe delivered a superb performance, making history with their largest-ever pre-singles lead. Tensions also flared between players on the course, further underscoring the intensity of the competition.</p>

          <p>Retired Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy's new book, "Life, Law, & Liberty," offers rare insights into his 30-year tenure, during which he was often the swing justice. Kennedy discusses his pivotal votes on same-sex marriage and abortion, revealing how his views evolved, particularly on the struggles faced by children of gay parents. He also shares a poignant reconciliation with Justice Antonin Scalia before Scalia's death. Kennedy expresses deep concern over the current Supreme Court's increasing partisanship and the decline of respectful discourse in American society, advocating for a more moderate tone in judicial opinions.</p>

          <p>The article explores the effectiveness of collagen supplements for reducing signs of skin aging, a popular but debated topic. While some users report positive changes in skin, hair, and nails, dermatologists remain skeptical about oral collagen's ability to reach the skin in significant amounts. Collagen peptides, smaller molecules, are designed for better absorption but still face a challenging journey through the body. Experts suggest that sunblock, a healthy diet, and lifestyle choices offer far greater benefits for skin health than expensive collagen supplements, with some industry-funded studies showing conflicting results compared to independent research.</p>

          <p>St Helens clinched a sensational 16-14 Super League play-off eliminator victory over Leeds Rhinos with a last-gasp try from Shane Wright after the final hooter. The dramatic win came at the end of an energy-sapping match, which saw St Helens play without forward Matty Lees for the second half due to a family emergency. Despite Leeds holding a 12-6 lead at halftime and dominating parts of the second half, their wasteful chances allowed Saints to stage a stunning comeback. This thrilling finish sets up a semi-final trip to Hull KR for St Helens.</p>

          <p>Modular homebuilder Fading West is presenting a potential solution to the U.S. housing affordability crisis by constructing homes in factories, reducing costs by up to 20% and halving construction time. These factory-built homes address the nationwide shortage of nearly four million units, providing a more sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional construction. The company successfully deployed 82 modular homes in Maui after wildfires and is expanding projects across several states. Experts believe modular housing can overcome labor shortages and increase productivity, making homeownership more attainable for a wider range of aspiring homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government will guarantee a £1.5 billion loan to Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) to support its supply chain and protect jobs after a cyberattack halted production for weeks. The cyberattack, claimed by "Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters," has cost JLR an estimated £50 million per week and threatened the solvency of many small suppliers. This Export Development Guarantee aims to boost JLR's cash reserves, allowing it to clear a backlog of payments to its 700 suppliers. While welcomed, opposition parties criticized the government's slow response and called for broader cyber reinsurance schemes. (not investment advice)</p>
