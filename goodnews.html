          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey pleaded not guilty to charges of making false statements and obstructing a congressional proceeding during his 2020 Senate testimony. The charges stem from allegations that Comey lied about authorizing an FBI staffer to be an anonymous source and made misleading statements. His defense team plans to file motions to dismiss the case, alleging vindictive prosecution and unlawful appointment of the prosecutor. The trial is scheduled to begin in early January, and Comey maintains his innocence. </p>

          <p>Recent social media claims suggest that Generation Z is leading a religious revival in the United States, with young people attending church more frequently. However, this article examines the data and finds that these claims misrepresent the findings of a Barna Group study. While the study notes a slight increase in church attendance among Gen Z churchgoers, it does not suggest an overall increase in religious affiliation. Pew Research Center data indicates that older Americans are still more likely to participate in religious services, and there is no sign of a religious revival among Gen Z. </p>

          <p>Dutch authorities discovered two hand grenades, dating back to 1925, hidden in a shipment of French onions destined for a factory in the Netherlands. The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) identified the projectiles as consistent with pre-1925 French and German manufactured chemical weapons. The type of chemical fill could not be determined. The grenades will be destroyed at a specialized facility in Belgium, as the Netherlands lacks the capability to handle such objects. </p>

          <p>A recent report reveals that attending a wedding, including bachelor or bachelorette weekends, can cost as much as a typical month's rent. Many young adults are making housing sacrifices to afford these celebrations, such as living with roommates or saving less for a down payment. With housing unaffordability keeping many priced out of the market, renters are renting for longer. Financial experts advise planning ahead and reallocating discretionary spending to avoid financial stress. </p>

          <h2>NHS May Increase Medicine Payments to Resolve Dispute with Drugmakers</h2>

          <p>The UK government is considering raising the amount the NHS pays pharmaceutical firms for medicines by up to 25% to resolve a dispute over drug pricing. This proposal aims to address concerns from drugmakers who have paused investments in the UK due to the pricing standoff. The plan includes raising the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) cost-effectiveness threshold, which has remained unchanged since 1999. The Liberal Democrats have criticized the move, questioning its cost and potential impact on other NHS services. </p>

          <p>The German government has increased its economic growth forecasts, projecting a narrow avoidance of stagnation in 2025 with 0.2% growth, and a rise to 1.3% in 2026. This revision comes after a previous projection of zero growth for 2025. The government anticipates that growth will be driven by increased state financing, particularly in infrastructural investments and defense. However, the projections have faced criticism for relying on public debt. Economy Minister Katherina Reiche emphasized the need to lower energy prices and taxes to further stimulate growth. </p>

          <p>Changes in President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) could make C corp status more attractive for startups, particularly regarding the Qualified Small Business Stock (QSBS) exemption. The bill expands the QSBS exemption cap to $15 million for stock acquired after July 4, 2025, and introduces tiered exclusion system with a minimum holding period of three years. These changes could save shareholders nearly $1.2 million in taxes and create greater access to capital for new, fast-growing startups. Despite the new incentives for C corp status, pass-through entities like S corporations or LLCs may still be preferable for many small businesses. (not investment advice) </p>
