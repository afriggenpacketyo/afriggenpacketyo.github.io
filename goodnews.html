          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lens combines conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles made of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light, but the resulting images are somewhat blurred. While not as powerful as night vision goggles, the lenses could be used in surgical procedures, cryptography, or counterfeit protection, and tests showed humans could recognize patterns and letters in the dark.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul defeated Alexei Popyrin in straight sets at the French Open, ending Popyrin's run in the tournament. Paul dominated the match, preventing Popyrin from gaining a foothold after an initial break in the first game. Popyrin struggled with unforced errors, while Paul's resilience helped him secure the win and advance to the quarter-finals. Paul will face either Ben Shelton or Carlos Alcaraz in the next round, marking the first time an American man has reached the quarter-finals since 2003.</p>

          <p>NPR and three Colorado-based public radio stations have filed a lawsuit challenging an executive order that cut federal funding to what Donald Trump deemed "biased media." The lawsuit argues that the order violates the First Amendment right to free speech. Experts suggest NPR has a strong case, as Trump's administration openly admitted to targeting NPR and PBS due to disagreements with their news coverage. The legal action follows a pattern of Trump targeting media organizations he believes have reported negatively on him.</p>

          <p>Chinese scientists have traced the origins of the "ghost ancestors" of modern Tibetans to the southwestern province of Yunnan through ancient DNA analysis. The study verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. The findings fill a gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia. The research sheds light on the migration, adaptation, and settlement of ancestors in the cold, oxygen-poor land of the Tibetan Plateau.</p>

          <p>The French series "Reformed," streaming on Max, follows Rabbi L√©a Schmoll as she navigates the challenges of making ancient rituals relevant in the modern world. L√©a, portrayed as endearingly clumsy, grapples with the nihilism of contemporary society and the rigidity of Orthodox Judaism. The show delves into the practical work of a rabbi as L√©a interprets religious texts and traditions for her congregants. The series is based on Delphine Horvilleur's book, "Living With Our Dead," and explores the evolution and interpretation of Judaism.</p>

          <p>Top Wall Street analysts are recommending dividend-paying stocks as a strategy for investors seeking consistent returns amid market volatility. Three stocks highlighted include Home Depot (HD), which reaffirmed its full-year guidance and offers a dividend yield of 2.5% (not investment advice); Diamondback Energy (FANG), which returned $864 million to shareholders and offers a dividend yield of nearly 3.9% (not investment advice); and ConocoPhillips (COP).

          <p>National police chief Dieter Romann has given a favorable initial assessment of tightened border controls in Germany.

Since the reintroduction of temporary checks at all nine land borders, personnel have been reinforced by almost 1,200 colleagues. Romann rejected the assumption that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas, such as train stations, for border controls.</p>

          <p>As the Trump administration proposes legislative cuts affecting millions, anti-poverty organizers advocate for a new social contract. Lessons from past poor people's movements, like the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), offer insights into building popular power. The NWRO, led by Black women, fought for welfare rights and challenged societal norms. Their model of grassroots organizing emphasizes uniting across differences, building visionary projects of survival, and operating as an independent political force, principles that remain relevant today.</p>
