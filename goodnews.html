          <p>Journalism secured a victory at the 150th Preakness Stakes, triumphing over Gosger and Sandman, marking a significant achievement for jockey Umberto Rispoli, the first Italian jockey to win a Triple Crown race, and trainer Michael McCarthy. The absence of Kentucky Derby winner Sovereignty set the stage for a Journalism-Sovereignty rematch at the Belmont Stakes. The race was held on a warm day, which suited Journalism, drying the track after heavy rains. This event marks the last Preakness at the historic Pimlico Race Course before its scheduled demolition and reconstruction, with plans to relocate the race to Laurel Park temporarily before returning to the rebuilt Pimlico in 2027.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, turning day into night and prompting the National Weather Service to issue warnings. The storm, originating near Bloomington, Illinois, was caused by thunderstorms generating winds up to 70 mph, lifting dust from dry farmland. Visibility dropped dramatically, affecting major highways and Chicago Midway International Airport. This is the first time the Weather Service office in Romeoville has issued a dust storm warning for Chicago, recalling a similar event during the Dust Bowl era in 1934. The dry soil conditions in central Illinois contributed to the severity of the storm, classified as a haboob.</p>

These rulings highlight the tension between the administration's efforts to expedite deportations and the constitutional rights of immigrants.

This creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," had a pencil sharpener-like mouth and intimidating claws, providing new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. The Mosura's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods, indicating a more complex structure than previously known in radiodonts.
