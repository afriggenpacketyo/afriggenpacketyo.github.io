          <p>A growing number of American students are applying to universities in Europe, the U.K., and Asia, driven by escalating tuition costs and political unrest in the United States. Data indicates a significant jump in interest, with some college consultancies reporting skyrocketing inquiries since the 2024 election. While the primary motivation for many is affordability, with European tuition often being lower than in the U.S., students also cite concerns over political turmoil and campus safety. The article profiles students who have made the move, weighing the benefits of cultural immersion against challenges like visa bureaucracy and entering the U.S. job market later.</p>

          <p>An elderly British couple, Peter and Barbie Reynolds, have returned to the UK after being detained by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly eight months. The couple, who had lived in the country for decades running a charitable training program, were released following negotiations brokered by Qatar. The Taliban stated the couple had broken Afghan laws but never specified the charges, while their family reported the pair suffered from poor health in detention. Despite their ordeal, the couple, who are also Afghan citizens, have expressed a desire to return to Afghanistan to continue their work if possible.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Elliott Management has acquired a substantial position in the enterprise software company Workday, valued at over $2 billion. The investment was disclosed shortly after Workday announced a new multiyear plan aimed at boosting shareholder value, which includes a $5 billion share repurchase program and initiatives to expand profit margins. Elliott expressed support for Workday's management, including its new CEO Carl Eschenbach, with whom the firm has a prior relationship from his time at VMware. This amicable engagement is expected to help Workday transition from a growth-focused strategy to one emphasizing profitability and operational efficiency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The recent Terence Crawford victory over Canelo Álvarez was a cornerstone event for a new venture, Zuffa Boxing, aiming to dominate the sport. Backed by Saudi Arabia's Turki al-Sheikh and UFC's Dana White, the initiative seeks to centralize boxing promotion, similar to the UFC model, in a sport currently fragmented and reliant on inconsistent funding. This analysis explores the massive financial investment from Saudi Arabia, the strategic acquisition of assets like The Ring magazine, and the goal of creating a league structure. However, the plan faces challenges, including resistance from top fighters and concerns over proposed legislative changes that could diminish fighter protections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tampa, Florida, experienced the fastest growth in median household income among the 50 largest U.S. cities, with a jump of over 15% between 2023 and 2024. A new analysis of Census Bureau data reveals that four of the top ten cities for income growth are in California, including Long Beach, San Jose, and San Francisco, which already boast some of the nation's highest median incomes. Much of Tampa's increase is attributed to rising incomes among its senior population. In contrast, some cities like Baltimore saw significant percentage growth but still have median incomes below the national average of $83,730. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South African authorities have dismantled a large-scale methamphetamine lab on a farm near Johannesburg, seizing drugs worth an estimated $20 million. Following a tip about a strange chemical smell, police raided the premises and discovered precursor chemicals, manufacturing equipment, and crystal meth packed in buckets and lunchboxes. Five North American citizens, who were in the country illegally, were arrested after attempting to flee and now face drug and immigration charges. A South African farm caretaker was also arrested, while two other suspects, believed to be from West African nations, remain at large.</p>

          <p>The UK's Liberal Democrat party has called for the creation of emergency "Nightingale processing centres" to address the country's asylum backlog and reduce reliance on costly hotels for housing applicants. The proposal, modeled after the temporary hospitals set up during the COVID-19 pandemic, would be paired with a doubling of asylum caseworkers. The party is focusing on law and order at its annual conference, also suggesting the opening of police counters in accessible public venues like supermarkets and libraries. The Labour government previously floated a similar idea for "Nightingale courts" but has not yet implemented the plan.</p>

          <p>A 1,000-pound American-made bomb from World War II was discovered at a construction site in Hong Kong's Quarry Bay district, prompting the evacuation of thousands of residents from the area. Police confirmed the ordnance dated back to the war, when Allied forces conducted air raids on the then-Japanese-occupied city. An extensive operation was launched to defuse the nearly five-foot-long bomb, which was completed successfully without any injuries. The discovery is one of several recent instances across the globe where unexploded WWII munitions have been found, necessitating large-scale public safety measures.</p>

          <p>The private technology market is experiencing an unprecedented boom, largely driven by the artificial intelligence sector, with seven top startups now commanding a combined valuation of $1.3 trillion. Companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI have seen their valuations skyrocket, reflecting immense investor appetite for AI exposure. According to Forge Global, this surge is based on substantial revenue growth, not just speculation, with some firms growing at rates of over 100% annually. With vast amounts of private capital available, these companies have little incentive to go public, reshaping traditional capital flows and market dynamics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Meta has introduced its next-generation smart glasses, the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display, which for the first time includes a built-in translucent display for consumers. The device allows users to read messages, see photo previews, and view live captions directly in their field of view. A key feature is the accompanying wristband, which uses EMG sensors to detect electrical signals from the body, enabling control of the glasses through subtle hand gestures like pinching fingers or rotating a thumb. While the technology marks a step toward Meta's vision of augmented reality, the initial hands-on experience suggests the display is more for utility than immersive entertainment.</p>

          <p>Financial planners recommend using the "20-4-10" rule as a guideline to maintain control over car-buying costs and avoid becoming "underwater" on a loan. The rule advises making a down payment of at least 20% of the vehicle's price to build equity and reduce interest payments. It also suggests financing the car for no more than four years to pay it off quickly. Finally, it recommends that total monthly vehicle-related expenses—including the loan payment, insurance, fuel, and maintenance—should not exceed 10% of your monthly income, ensuring transportation costs don't overwhelm your budget.

          <p>In his new book "Breakneck," analyst Dan Wang presents a framework for understanding U.S.-China dynamics by contrasting America's "lawyerly society" with China's "engineering state." He argues that while China's system, dominated by engineers, has led to rapid infrastructure development and manufacturing prowess, it often prioritizes national power over individual happiness. Conversely, he suggests America's lawyer-led society has become physically stagnant. Wang provocatively proposes that despite their differences and the current political climate, the U.S. should study China's successes in areas like mass transit and clean technology to address its own domestic challenges.</p>
