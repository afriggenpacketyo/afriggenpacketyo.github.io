          <p>Veteran U.S. diplomat Julie Eadeh is reportedly the leading candidate to become the next American consul general for Hong Kong and Macau. Eadeh, who previously served as the political section chief at the consulate during the 2019 pro-democracy protests, has had her name submitted to Beijing for approval. Her potential appointment comes at a sensitive time for U.S.-China relations, with the role being a key diplomatic post for observing political and economic developments in the region. The final decision now rests with the Chinese government, which must grant its consent for the appointment to proceed.</p>

          <p>Canadian pop star Justin Bieber has unexpectedly released a new 20-track album titled "Swag," his first full-length project in four years. The album features collaborations with several rappers and seems to address recent personal themes, including his marriage, fatherhood, and Christian faith. The release follows a period of public concern for the singer's mental well-being after he shared posts about paparazzi intrusion and a video of a confrontation with a photographer. That confrontation is sampled on the new album, directly incorporating his recent personal struggles into his artistic work.</p>

          <p>A coalition of European countries has agreed to establish a headquarters in Paris for a future stabilization force to be deployed in Ukraine following a ceasefire. For the first time, a U.S. delegation, including President Trump's special envoy Keith Kellogg and bipartisan senators, attended the group's meeting in Rome. The multinational force is intended to provide training and logistical support to rebuild Ukraine's military and secure its territory, though no U.S. troops would be deployed on the ground. The move signals strengthening Western unity in planning for Ukraine's long-term security and deterrence against future Russian aggression.</p>

          <p>Three Merseyside Police officers have been recognized with bravery awards for their actions during the fatal knife attack in Southport last year. Sergeant Gregory Gillespie, PC Luke Holden, and PCSO Timothy Parry were the first to arrive at the scene where an attacker murdered three young girls and injured ten others. Despite the chaos, the unarmed officers entered the building and confronted the armed assailant, successfully disarming and arresting him. The Police Federation of England and Wales praised the officers for their exceptional courage and selflessness in a life-threatening situation, preventing further harm to the public.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla's electric vehicle sales in Norway saw a significant 54% year-on-year increase in June, a stark contrast to the company's declining sales across much of Europe. The surge is largely driven by the popularity of the revamped Model Y, which meets Norwegian demand for space, all-wheel drive, and value. This success persists despite a backlash against CEO Elon Musk's political activities, which a survey found would deter 43% of Norwegian EV drivers from buying a Tesla. Norway's robust EV market, supported by strong government incentives and charging infrastructure, continues to make it a key stronghold for the American automaker.</p>

          <p>In a significant environmental restoration effort, China has demolished approximately 300 dams and closed hydropower stations along the Red River, a major tributary of the Yangtze. The project aims to save the habitat of rare and endemic fish species, which have been severely impacted by the dense network of dams constructed over decades. These structures blocked fish migration routes and drastically altered water flows, reducing spawning grounds and even causing sections of the river to dry up. This large-scale removal is intended to rejuvenate the river's ecosystem, considered the last refuge for many unique aquatic species in the region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is experiencing a boom in electric heavy truck sales, which are rapidly gaining market share and curbing the nation's demand for diesel fuel. Driven by government subsidies and an expanding charging infrastructure, sales of new energy trucks are estimated to have risen 175% in the first half of the year. This shift, combined with the rise of LNG-powered trucks and slowing economic growth, has led analysts to revise down diesel demand forecasts. The trend is accelerating predictions for when China's overall oil consumption will peak, with some now suggesting it could happen this year.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Los Angeles has issued a tentative ruling that would order the Trump administration to stop unlawful immigration stops and arrests in the area. The ruling addresses a lawsuit filed by civil rights groups alleging that federal agents have been targeting brown-skinned people without probable cause, creating fear and harming the local economy. The judge appeared to question the government's lack of specific evidence justifying its operations, noting the high volume of evidence provided by plaintiffs. A final order is expected soon in the case, which has become a key battleground over the administration's mass deportation strategy.</p>

The meteorite, named NWA 16788, weighs over 54 pounds and represents about 6.5% of all known Martian material on our planet. It was discovered in the Sahara Desert in 2023 after likely being dislodged from Mars by an asteroid strike and traveling 140 million miles through space. Such meteorites are exceedingly rare, offering scientists a massive dataset to help unlock the secrets of our planetary neighbor.</p>
