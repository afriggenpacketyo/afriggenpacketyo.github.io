          <p>Campaigning has officially started for the Tokyo metropolitan assembly election, drawing significant attention as a precursor to this summer's House of Councillors race. With no single party holding a majority in the 127-member assembly, the focus is on whether Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) can maintain its seats amidst approval ratings that have dipped below what is considered the "danger level." Parties are actively utilizing social media to connect with voters, particularly those who are unaffiliated. Key issues include support for households facing rising living costs, political funding scandals involving the LDP, and regional concerns such as child-rearing and measures against heat. The high number of candidates running in the assembly race reflects the intense competition and importance of this election. </p>

          <p>India is taking steps to tap into its rare earth element (REE) reserves to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global supply. Experts suggest India could become an important alternative in the REE sector with increased public and private investment. The move follows recent restrictions from China that have caused shortages affecting auto manufacturers in various countries. India possesses substantial REE reserves, holding the world's third-largest share, but it currently lacks advanced separation and refining technology compared to China, the U.S., and Japan.

          <p>An independent Chinese think tank suggests that the US and China should establish a "security dialogue mechanism" to prevent conflict in the South China Sea. The Grandview Institution notes that aerial and maritime interactions in the region are confrontational and unpredictable. The report, prepared in collaboration with the Pacific Forum, emphasizes the need for institutionalized dialogue on regional security, maritime legal order, and crisis response protocols. The goal is to manage competition and reduce the risk of inadvertent escalation in the strategic waterway. </p>

          <p>Coffee's global consumption is deeply rooted in culture, colonialism, and even rebellion, extending beyond mere trends to become an intrinsic part of world culture. Originating from Ethiopia, coffee ceremonies mark moments of hospitality and community, while in Senegal, 'cafe Touba' blends Islamic Sufi traditions with a beverage. Turkish coffee culture includes reading leftover grounds, and Brazil welcomes with 'cafezinho.' Rising global temperatures are affecting coffee farmers, yet coffee remains a cherished ritual, as seen in South Korea's Dalgona coffee trend during the COVID-19 lockdown. The beverage has taken inventive forms, from Nordic 'coffee cheese' to Vietnam's egg coffee and Indonesia's 'kopi luwak.'</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has announced a 100 billion yen policy package to attract foreign researchers, aiming to create an elite research environment amid global competition in fields like AI and semiconductors. The measures include funding existing programs and using profits from a 10 trillion yen investment fund to support internationally competitive research at universities. This initiative aims to capitalize on potential talent migration from the United States due to research funding cuts and prioritization of American students. The government plans to raise salaries for researchers, reduce administrative burdens, and acquire advanced technology for institutions. </p>

          <p>Following the imposition of reciprocal tariffs on imports from China, Beijing has encouraged the increased use of letters of credit (L/Cs) to help Chinese exporters sell their products domestically. A letter of credit is a financial tool that guarantees payment to the seller. The domestic version serves similar functions, ensuring payment security and enhancing credit for Chinese firms. Domestic L/Cs can be used in transactions involving physical goods and services, with a payment period generally set at one year. (not investment advice)</p>

The focus of the negotiations is on whether Tokyo can secure concessions on auto tariffs. Japan is also seeking the removal of other sector-based and reciprocal tariffs, while Trump aims to reduce the U.S.'s trade deficit with Japan. (not investment advice)</p>
