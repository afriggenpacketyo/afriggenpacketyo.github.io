        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The mayor of Tulsa has unveiled a $105 million reparations package aimed at addressing the lasting impact of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. This plan represents the first large-scale effort to provide reparations for the atrocity, which decimated the Greenwood District, also known as "Black Wall Street." The funds will be raised privately and allocated to housing assistance, scholarships, and economic development initiatives for the descendants of the victims and the Greenwood community. The initiative seeks to acknowledge the historical injustices and promote healing and economic empowerment within the affected community. The proposed reparations package is a significant step toward reconciliation.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karol Nawrocki, a right-wing historian, has won the Polish presidential election with 50.9% of the vote, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski. The election result is a turnaround from initial exit polls that showed Trzaskowski winning. As president, Nawrocki is expected to use his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda. Nawrocki supports traditional Catholic and family values and advocates for Polish sovereignty within the EU. Both candidates support continued assistance for Ukraine, but differ on their approach to the EU, with Nawrocki opposing further cession of powers to Brussels. The election result is likely to re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice opposition party.</p>

          <p>Shares of Australian investment firm Washington H. Soul Pattinson (Soul Patts) and its affiliate Brickworks surged after announcing a A$14 billion ($9 billion) merger. The merged entity, listed in Sydney, will acquire all outstanding shares of both companies, holding A$13.1 billion in assets across real estate, private equity, and credit. The deal simplifies the structure, adds scale, and creates a more investable company, according to Soul Patts CEO Todd Barlow. The merger unwinds a 56-year mutual ownership designed to fend off hostile takeovers, though critics argued it suppressed shareholder value and corporate transparency. Brickworks shareholders will receive an implied value of A$30.28 per share, a 10.1% premium over the stock's closing price.</p>
