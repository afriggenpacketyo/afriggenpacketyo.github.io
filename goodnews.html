          <p>Quarterback Trevor Lawrence led the Jacksonville Jaguars to a dramatic 31-28 win over the Kansas City Chiefs with a one-yard touchdown run in the final 23 seconds of the game. After an initial slip, Lawrence recovered and dove across the goal line, capping a clutch drive and improving the Jaguars' season record to 4-1 for the first time since 2007. The victory snapped an eight-game losing streak for Jacksonville against the Chiefs, a streak that had stretched back to 2009.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has raised its economic growth forecast for China in 2025 from 4% to 4.8%, citing the positive impact of government stimulus measures. This revision comes despite ongoing trade tensions with the United States, which have included significant tariff hikes. However, the report cautions that this growth momentum may slow, projecting a decrease to 4.2% in 2026 as export growth eases and Beijing potentially reduces stimulus to manage public debt.

          <p>In the flood-prone wetlands of Bangladesh, an innovative initiative is using solar-powered boats as mobile schools, libraries, and clinics to ensure children's education is not disrupted. Started in 2002 by architect Mohammed Rezwan, the project now operates over 100 boats, serving thousands of students in remote villages that become inaccessible during seasonal floods. This model, run by the non-profit Shidhulai Swanirvar Sangstha, has gained international recognition for its success in providing continuous access to learning and healthcare.</p>

          <p>Chinese automaker BYD has announced a massive 880% increase in its UK car sales for September compared to the previous year, making Britain its largest market outside of China. The company sold over 11,000 vehicles, with its Seal U plug-in hybrid SUV leading the charge, capturing a 3.6% share of the UK market. This growth is attributed to the UK's lack of tariffs on Chinese EVs, unlike the EU and US, positioning BYD as a major competitor with its more affordable models.</p>

          <p>Manchester City and England defender John Stones has disclosed that he considered retiring from football last season due to persistent injury problems. The 31-year-old struggled with foot and hamstring issues, which limited his appearances and led to a mentally challenging period where he felt his professional efforts were not paying off. Despite these thoughts, Stones affirmed his fighting mentality and commitment to his career, and he has since been recalled to the England squad for upcoming matches.</p>

This initiative is seen as a significant step in restoring the region's woodland ecosystem, as pine martens play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance.</p>

The restaurant, which was fully booked with reservations on its opening day, is making a comeback after the original chain shut down in 2004 following bankruptcy and a hepatitis A outbreak. The revival was made possible through an agreement between the founder's son and Hormel Foods, which has owned the Chi-Chi's trademark for its retail products since 1987.</p>

The ordinance, which surpasses similar efforts in other major U.S. cities, is being hailed as a cost-effective strategy to enhance public health, reduce energy burdens, and promote climate resilience.</p>

          <p>California has enacted a new law requiring streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to ensure that the volume of commercials is not louder than the programs they interrupt. The legislation extends existing federal regulations, which have applied to broadcast and cable television since 2010, to the powerful streaming industry. The bill was inspired by the common annoyance of sudden volume spikes during ad breaks and aims to bring "peace and quiet" to households, potentially setting a new national standard.</p>
