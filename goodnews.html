          <p>Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) have signed an agreement to resume cooperation, a move that could restart inspections of Iran's nuclear facilities. The deal was announced following a meeting in Cairo and was described by IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi as "a step in the right direction." This development comes amid heightened tensions, as European nations recently initiated a process to reimpose UN sanctions on Iran for non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement. Iran has warned the new deal will be terminated if any hostile actions are taken against it.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece argues that China's Greater Bay Area, encompassing cities like Hong Kong, Shenzhen, and Macau, should host the 2036 Olympic Games. The proposal suggests that the region's existing world-class sports facilities and extensive transportation network would minimize the economic burden typically associated with hosting the event. By leveraging current infrastructure, the area could avoid constructing new venues that often fall into disuse. The plan highlights the potential for a cost-effective and sustainable Olympics that meets modern logistical standards for athletes and spectators.</p>

          <p>Pitcher Roki Sasaki delivered an impressive performance in a rehab start for the Dodgers' Triple-A affiliate, reigniting possibilities for his inclusion on the postseason roster. In four shutout innings, Sasaki consistently threw over 100 mph, striking out eight batters and showing signs of returning to form after being sidelined with a shoulder impingement. While a starting role is unlikely, his strong outing suggests he could be a valuable asset in the bullpen. The team's management is now considering how to best integrate him as the playoffs approach.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear a case determining whether President Trump has the authority to impose sweeping global tariffs under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA). Lower courts have previously ruled against the administration, stating that the president exceeded his authority. The case, brought by small businesses and several states, challenges the legality of tariffs on nearly every country, which Trump has used to pressure trading partners into new agreements. This will be the first time the Supreme Court directly rules on one of Trump's second-term policies.</p>

          <p>Democrat James Walkinshaw is projected to win the special election for a Northern Virginia congressional seat, further tightening the Republican majority in the House to 219-213. Walkinshaw, a Fairfax County supervisor, defeated Republican Stewart Whitson to fill the seat previously held by the late Democratic Rep. Gerry Connolly. The reliably Democratic district is home to many federal workers, and job cuts initiated by the Trump administration were a dominant issue in the race. Walkinshaw's victory continues a trend of Democratic overperformance in recent elections.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged 28% in after-hours trading following the release of staggering forward-looking revenue projections that left analysts impressed. Despite missing current earnings estimates, the company forecast its cloud infrastructure revenue will grow from $10 billion to $144 billion over the next five years, driven by major new AI contracts, including one with OpenAI. The company's remaining performance obligations, a measure of contracted future revenue, jumped to $455 billion. This explosive growth trajectory signals a major shift in the competitive cloud computing landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swedish online lender Klarna priced its initial public offering at $40 per share, exceeding its initial range and securing a valuation of approximately $15 billion. The company, a major player in the "buy now, pay later" market, raised $1.37 billion in the offering, with most proceeds going to existing shareholders. The successful pricing reflects a strong market appetite for tech IPOs and serves as a key test for investor confidence in Klarna's business model as it expands its services.

          <p>A new blood test that could dramatically improve the accuracy of Alzheimer's diagnosis is being trialed across the UK's National Health Service. The test detects a key biomarker for the disease, p-tau217, and is expected to increase diagnostic accuracy from the current 70% to over 90%. Scientists at University College London are leading the study, which involves over 1,000 patients at 20 memory clinics. If successful, this relatively inexpensive test could become a standard tool, enabling earlier and more precise diagnoses and facilitating access to new treatments.</p>

          <p>New Mexico has announced it will become the first U.S. state to provide free, universal childcare for all residents, regardless of income, starting November 1. This groundbreaking initiative expands an existing program that offered no-cost care to families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level and was credited with reducing poverty. The expansion is expected to save families an average of $12,000 per child annually, providing significant financial relief and supporting workforce participation. The state's approach is being hailed as a potential model for the rest of the nation.</p>

Buses now run seven days a week and every 15 minutes on the busiest routes, dramatically improving service without a budget increase.

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a memorandum aimed at pressuring pharmaceutical companies to comply with advertising transparency laws, particularly on social media. The action targets misleading promotions, such as those by influencers who do not disclose they are paid spokespeople or ads that fail to adequately list potential side effects. The administration plans to follow up by sending hundreds of cease and desist letters to enforce existing regulations. The goal is to ensure consumers receive accurate and complete information about prescription drugs before making health decisions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed removing the £100 cap on contactless card payments, allowing banks and card providers to set their own limits. If approved, the change could make entering a PIN for larger purchases like a full grocery shop increasingly rare. The move would align the rules for physical cards with those for digital wallets on smartphones, which already have no set limit due to extra security features like biometrics. While the FCA acknowledges fraud concerns, it states that providers would be responsible for low-risk transactions and that consumer protections would remain.</p>
