        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Conservative historian Karol Nawrocki has been elected as Poland's new president, narrowly defeating Warsaw's liberal mayor Rafal Trzaskowski. Nawrocki's victory is a significant turnaround from initial exit polls that predicted a win for Trzaskowski, leading to early victory claims from his camp. As president, Nawrocki is expected to continue using his veto power to block Prime Minister Donald Tusk's pro-EU agenda and re-energize the national conservative Law and Justice opposition party. While both candidates support continued aid to Ukraine, they differ on their approach to the EU, with Nawrocki favoring a strong sovereign Poland and opposing further ceding of powers to Brussels.</p>

          <p>New York City has recorded the fewest shootings and murders in its history for the first five months of the year, according to city officials. From January through May, there were 264 shootings and 112 homicides, marking record lows. Mayor Eric Adams attributes this success to precision policing, strategic resource deployment, and the NYPD's dedication. The police have also removed approximately 22,000 illegal guns from the streets since Adams took office, but Adams stresses the importance of New Yorkers feeling safer, not just being safer.</p>

          <p>Vogue has declared the word 'chic' to be outdated, arguing that it has lost its original meaning and become associated with superficial displays of wealth and influence. The author suggests rehabilitating alternative adjectives such as 'snazzy,' 'trendy,' and 'swish' to describe fashion and style. The article humorously reflects on the overused nature of 'chic' and the potential for more creative and diverse language in describing aesthetics. Despite the call for change, the author anticipates that 'chic' will remain ingrained in our vocabulary.</p>

          <p>Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual is considering expanding its operations in Asia, with a potential new office in Hong Kong.

BTG executives recently toured major Chinese cities with a delegation of Brazilian entrepreneurs and family offices, seeking investment opportunities. The potential revival of BTG's Hong Kong office aligns with the recent pledge by China and Brazil to enhance their bilateral relationship amidst global trade challenges.</p>

          <p>As the Senate debates President Trump's tax and spending package, changes to the child tax credit are being considered. The House-approved bill would make permanent the maximum $2,000 credit passed via Trump's 2017 tax cuts and the highest credit would also rise to $2,500 from 2025 to 2028. The Senate could have different plans, and negotiations will be "really interesting to watch," according to policy experts. Some research suggests that financial incentives, like a bigger child tax credit, could boost U.S. fertility.</p>

          <p>New wildfire protection regulations in California propose prohibiting almost all plants within 5 feet of homes, but experts argue this could be detrimental. Well-maintained plants can protect homes from wind-blown embers and slow fire spread. Research shows that moisture in plants can prevent ignition, and green vegetation can act as a heat sink, absorbing energy and blocking embers. The proposed regulations oversimplify complex conditions and go beyond current scientific research, with experts recommending a focus on plant maintenance and home hardening instead of widespread vegetation removal.</p>

          <p>California is on the verge of mandating phonics-based reading instruction in schools, marking a significant shift in the state's approach to literacy. The proposed law would require districts to adopt instructional materials based on the "science of reading," a systemic approach to literacy instruction supported by decades of research. This move comes after decades of debate and controversy in California on how best to teach reading amid persistently low test scores. The bill has gained support from teachers unions and advocates for English-language learners after compromises were made to provide school districts with more flexibility in selecting instructional materials.</p>

The production team had to cut costs and reassemble original department heads, including costume designer Joanna Eatwell, who had to start from scratch. Despite the challenges, the cast and crew were proud of what they accomplished, and Damian Lewis noted that the show proves that if something's good, people will come and find it.</p>

Ministers say the plans could allow planes to climb quicker during take off and descend more smoothly. The plans are also aiming at helping reduce aviation's climate change impacts and pave the way for new technologies like flying taxis. The changes would allow the largest re-design of UK airspace since it was first formed in the 1950s, when there were only around 200,000 flights a year, compared to 2.7 million last year.</p>
