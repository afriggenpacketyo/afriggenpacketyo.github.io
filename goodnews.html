          <p>The Federal Railroad Administration is consulting with Elon Musk's Boring Company to assess costs and efficiency for Amtrak's Frederick Douglass Tunnel program, which faces potential cost overruns. Transportation officials met with Boring Company employees who suggested ways to reduce costs and improve construction efficiency. The Department of Transportation confirmed the Boring Company is among several firms being considered for a new engineering contract, raising concerns about potential conflicts of interest given Musk's other ventures and advisory role to President Trump. Musk has previously criticized Amtrak and promoted his own transportation ideas. </p>

          <p>A guest essay in the New York Times highlights concerns about the safety and regulation of food additives in the United States, noting that the health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., intends to eliminate petroleum-based synthetic food dyes from the U.S. food supply. The U.S. allows an estimated 10,000 additives, many in ultraprocessed foods, with companies often self-certifying safety under the GRAS system without FDA approval. Research on these chemicals tends to be narrow, focusing on immediate health risks and not long-term effects or interactions with other chemicals, leading to calls for regulatory reform and re-examination of existing additives.</p>

          <p>News of a U.S. agreement with China to temporarily ease tariffs sent stocks soaring on Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average leaping 1,161 points. The agreement, struck in Switzerland, involves both countries substantially lowering tariffs for 90 days, starting May 14. Investors cheered the boom in stocks, but also warned the market rally could falter over the next three months as the U.S. and China approach the end of the tariff pause in August. Tech, retail, and travel companies saw widespread gains as a result of the reduced tariffs.</p>

          <p>Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced that a new software update prevented a third radar outage at Newark Airport after a telecommunications line failed again over the weekend. Duffy criticized the Biden administration for not better equipping the air traffic control facility in Philadelphia, which now manages Newark's air traffic. Despite the system staying online, controllers halted traffic at Newark for about 45 minutes as a precaution. Duffy plans to investigate the move of Newark air traffic controllers to Philadelphia and is advocating for a new radar system for Newark in Philadelphia rather than piping the signal from New York.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's Hollywood ambassadors, including Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone, joined labor unions and major studios in requesting the US president to expand and extend tax incentives for film and television productions. The letter to Trump thanked him for supporting the industry and called for him to back three tax provisions in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill, which they argue would make America more competitive and bring jobs back to the country. The letter makes no mention of Trump's tariff proposal on foreign film production, which sparked controversy in the entertainment industry.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to impose and then reduce tariffs on Chinese products highlights the limitations of his aggressive trade strategy. The tariffs, initially set at 145 percent, disrupted global trade but ultimately proved unsustainable for American businesses. Trade talks in Geneva resulted in a temporary agreement to lower tariffs, with China agreeing to a minimum tax of 30 percent and the U.S. to 10 percent. While the agreement eased immediate pressures, it did not secure significant concessions from China beyond a commitment to further negotiations, raising questions about the effectiveness of Trump's approach.</p>

The agreement will drop U.S. import duties from 145% to 30% on Chinese goods, and Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods from 125% to 10%.

          <p>Receipts from U.S. tariffs hit a record level of $16.3 billion in April, driven by President Trump's trade war policies. This influx of revenue helped reduce the budget deficit for the month, which totaled $258.4 billion, up 23% from the previous year. The increased tariff revenue is attributed to the 10% across-the-board tariffs on U.S. imports instituted on April 2. Despite the record tariff receipts, high interest rates continue to pose a budgetary burden, with net interest on the national debt totaling $89 billion in April.</p>

The rally pushed shares of Hasbro above their trading level from early April, before Trump announced his tariff scheme.
