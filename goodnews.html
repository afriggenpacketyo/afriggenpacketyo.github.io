          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers' offense demonstrated a powerful resurgence in an 8-2 victory over the San Diego Padres, successfully avoiding a series sweep and reclaiming a share of first place. Manager Dave Roberts' call for more competitive at-bats and a disciplined approach was emphatically answered, with key contributions from Dalton Rushing, who hit a crucial three-run home run, and Freddie Freeman, who added two long balls. This nine-hit, eight-run outburst showcased improved plate discipline and strategic slugging, suggesting the team has found its rhythm after a two-month funk. The win provides significant momentum and confidence for the Dodgers moving forward in the season.</p>

          <p>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes in southern France has been associated with 72 recognized medical miracles by the Catholic Church over the past 163 years, attracting millions of pilgrims annually seeking healing. The Lourdes Office of Medical Observations, led by Dr. Alessandro de Franciscis, rigorously investigates thousands of cure claims, identifying cases that defy current medical explanation. Two additional miracles were recognized since 2022, bringing the total to 72, following decades of meticulous scrutiny and extensive medical documentation. While skeptics acknowledge the office's evolving rigor, a 2014 study found its conclusions credible, highlighting the enduring mystery and profound faith surrounding Lourdes.</p>

          <p>Jerry Adler, a prolific figure in entertainment, has passed away at 96, leaving behind a remarkable legacy spanning decades backstage on Broadway before a successful acting career. Known for memorable roles like Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife," Adler transitioned to acting in his 60s after a long and distinguished career as a stage manager, producer, and director for 53 Broadway productions. His work included the original "My Fair Lady" and collaborations with Marlene Dietrich and Julie Andrews. Adler, who once thought himself "too goofy-looking" to act, found unexpected fame and continued working into his nineties, publishing a memoir last year.</p>

          <p>English golfer Tommy Fleetwood finally claimed his maiden PGA Tour title in his 164th start, winning the Tour Championship with a magnificent display of mental strength and composure. Fleetwood's closing 68 secured a three-shot victory at 18 under par, overcoming previous agonizing near-misses and the pressure of a long wait for a US win. The widespread adoration from the crowd, chanting "Tommy, Tommy," and celebrity recognition, including from LeBron James, highlighted his immense popularity. This significant victory not only earned him the FedEx Cup and a $10 million first prize but also provides a substantial boost for European golf ahead of the upcoming Ryder Cup.</p>

          <h2>Expert Da Wei Criticizes Flawed US Policy in Competition with China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 18:00:09 EDT</div>

          <p>Da Wei, director of Tsinghua University’s Centre for International Security and Strategy, expressed cautious optimism regarding the potential for the U.S. and China to reach an agreement over tariffs, ideally by autumn. However, he broadly criticized U.S. policy in its competition with China, characterizing it as marked by "ignorance and neglect." This perspective suggests that fundamental issues beyond trade tensions are hindering the relationship, necessitating a more informed and nuanced approach from the United States to navigate the complex geopolitical landscape. Both sides reportedly desire a deal, but the underlying policy flaws remain a significant challenge.</p>

          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh made history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs against the Athletics on Sunday, establishing a new single-season record for catchers and surpassing Salvador Perez’s 2021 total. Raleigh also achieved his ninth multi-home run game of the season, a major league record for a switch-hitter. His impressive performance, including two long balls in the game, highlights his significant power at the plate, with 40 of his home runs coming while catching this year. The 28-year-old All-Star, who recently signed a six-year extension, is on pace to become the first American League catcher to lead the majors outright in home runs.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand, the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, formed southeast of Bermuda on Saturday and is currently moving north-northeast in the open Atlantic Ocean.

Forecasters predict it will continue on this path for a day or two before turning northeast, remaining over open waters. The storm is expected to strengthen slightly before weakening by Tuesday, posing no immediate threat to land.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new £200m frontline, featuring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is experiencing early goalscoring difficulties in the Premier League season. Despite a significant summer outlay on these attacking talents, the team has managed only one goal from open play in four matches, with their league goals coming from an own goal. Manager Ruben Amorim remains confident in the team's ability to create chances, attributing the struggles to new players adapting to a different style and each other. With upcoming international breaks, United hopes to use the time to integrate the new signings and improve their performance, as they currently sit 16th after two games.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has surged to an estimated $750 million, making it the game's tenth-largest grand prize, after no one claimed the top prize in Saturday's $700 million drawing. The estimated cash value for the upcoming Monday evening drawing is $338.6 million, offering a life-changing sum to a potential winner. Although the grand prize went unclaimed, several tickets won significant smaller prizes, including three matching all five white balls across New York, Maine, and South Dakota. No one has won the Powerball jackpot since May 31, and the odds of winning the top prize remain 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's powerful rally following Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signal for impending interest rate cuts, driven by a dramatic deceleration in hiring. He critiques "bear-side" hedge funds for misjudging the Fed's data-driven approach, which prioritized job market concerns over tariff-induced inflation. Cramer provides sector-specific advice, highlighting bullish narratives for housing, M&A, and IPOs, while cautioning against enterprise software and autos. He also discusses the Intel saga, framing it as a necessary government intervention to prevent bankruptcy, and anticipates a challenging September with increased joblessness despite market gains.

          <p>NBA legend Shaquille O’Neal recounted a memorable incident where his $70,000 Walmart shopping spree, undertaken to furnish an empty apartment after a trade, was abruptly halted by a credit card decline. The massive purchase, which O'Neal claims is the largest in Walmart history, triggered American Express security to suspect fraud, leading to a direct call to him. Despite this momentary financial hiccup, O'Neal has since become renowned for his financial acumen and significant charitable contributions. The anecdote highlights both the extraordinary scale of his spending and the stringent security measures credit card companies employ to prevent fraudulent activities.</p>

          <p>SpaceX is conducting its 10th test launch of the colossal Starship rocket, incorporating significant upgrades following three consecutive in-flight failures. The mission aims to deliberately stress the vehicle and gather crucial data on its capabilities, with the Super Heavy booster executing unique landing burn tests before a planned Gulf of Mexico splashdown. The Starship upper stage will attempt a suborbital flight, deploying simulated satellites and testing an in-space engine restart to verify performance. This development is critical for NASA's Artemis moon landing program and Elon Musk's long-term vision for Mars colonization, despite the challenges and the 2027 moon landing target appearing increasingly unrealistic.</p>
