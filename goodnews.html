        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Over 1,500 police agencies across the U.S. and Canada are now utilizing virtual reality (VR) technology from Axon to improve officer training in high-stress situations. The program immerses recruits in realistic scenarios involving de-escalation, mental health crises, and use-of-force decisions, allowing them to practice responses in a controlled environment. A study by PwC found that VR learners train four times faster and show a 275% increase in confidence in applying their skills compared to traditional classroom methods. This technology helps departments maximize training hours and better prepare officers for the complexities of real-world encounters.</p>

          <p>Despite a persistent slump in its real estate sector, the Chinese government is unlikely to introduce significant new support measures, choosing instead to prioritize technological development. Analysts note that while real estate investment fell nearly 14% in the first three quarters, high-tech manufacturing grew by 9.6%, reflecting Beijing's strategic focus. This divergence highlights the government's view that risks in the property market have been mitigated, a perspective not shared by all market observers. Factors like falling home prices, demographic shifts, and job uncertainty continue to weigh on homebuyer sentiment, suggesting the property market's bottom is not yet in sight.

          <p>Manchester City's £77m defender, Josko Gvardiol, has revealed that he considered quitting football as a teenager to pursue basketball. At age 16, while struggling for playing time in Dinamo Zagreb's youth team, he felt unhappy and contemplated a different career path, influenced by friends who played basketball. However, he persevered, eventually breaking into the senior team and embarking on a successful career that led him to become the second-most expensive defender in history. Now a key player for Manchester City, Gvardiol has become a vital part of Pep Guardiola's system, overcoming past struggles and injuries.</p>

          <p>A by-election is being held in the Welsh constituency of Caerphilly to elect a new Member of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). The vote was called following the sudden death of Labour's Hefin David, who had represented the area since 2016. Eight candidates are contesting the seat, which will be filled until the next Wales-wide election in May 2026. In line with Welsh election rules, residents aged 16 and 17 are eligible to vote, and photo identification is not required at polling stations. The result is expected to be announced early Friday morning.</p>

          <p>China's upcoming Chang'e-7 lunar mission will be the most complex spacecraft the country has ever built, designed to perform the first comprehensive survey for water ice near the moon's south pole. The mission will consist of five components: an orbiter, a lander, a rover, a small hopping probe, and a relay satellite. Finding water ice is a critical goal for future crewed space exploration, as it could be converted into drinking water, oxygen, and rocket fuel. Chinese space program officials stated the lander will target a location with over 100 days of continuous sunlight to support long-term operations on the lunar surface.</p>

          <p>A 24-hour "vibe coding" hackathon in Singapore brought together over 400 participants to build applications from scratch using artificial intelligence tools. The event showcased how AI is lowering the barrier to entry for software development, allowing individuals with non-technical backgrounds to create functional products. Organizers aimed to reinvigorate the local "builder spirit," emphasizing creativity and rapid prototyping over traditional coding expertise. The winning project, an AI-powered whiteboarding tool controlled by hand gestures, illustrates a trend where product vision and design sense are becoming as crucial as engineering skills.</p>

          <p>As the Chinese Communist Party's fourth plenum concludes, an editorial in its official mouthpiece has praised the country's socialist system as a crucial anchor for economic development and global stability. The article highlights the practice of formulating five-year plans as a core strength, contrasting it with what it describes as the short-term and inconsistent policymaking of multiparty systems. It asserts that the party's unified national strategy and decisive leadership ensure that China's "economic ship sails steadily." This messaging reinforces the party's official narrative of strength and reliability as it prepares to unveil its next five-year plan.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research suggests that on Saturn's moon Titan, molecules that are normally incompatible can combine in the extreme cold to form co-crystals never seen before. Scientists found that non-polar molecules like methane and ethane can slip into the crystal lattice of the polar molecule hydrogen cyanide, a key component for prebiotic chemistry. This interaction contradicts the basic chemical rule that "like dissolves like," which typically prevents such substances from mixing. The discovery, made through lab experiments and computer modeling, could reshape our understanding of Titan's geology and the complex chemical processes occurring on its hydrocarbon lakes.</p>
