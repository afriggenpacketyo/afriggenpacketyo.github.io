          <p>Consumer Reports has released new recommendations for the best sunscreens, based on lab tests of 51 products. Lotion sunscreens are preferred over sprays due to better visibility during application, with Coppertone Water Babies lotion SPF 50, La Roche-Posay Anthelios kids SPF 50, and Supergoop! PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 topping the list. The report emphasizes the importance of daily sunscreen use, regardless of the season, to protect against harmful UVA and UVB rays. Proper application involves applying a teaspoon per exposed body part 15-30 minutes before sun exposure and reapplying every two hours, especially after swimming or sweating.</p>

          <p>All 50 states, along with Washington, D.C., and four U.S. territories, have agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and the Sackler family, resolving litigation over the opioid crisis. The settlement ends the Sacklers' ownership of Purdue and prohibits them from making, selling, or marketing opioids in the U.S. The funds will support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery programs over the next 15 years, with a significant amount distributed in the first three years. The agreement is contingent on bankruptcy court approval, with a hearing scheduled in the coming days.</p>

          <p>The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) has issued a warning about ticks due to the current hot weather and advises people to be tick aware when spending time outdoors. Ticks are small, spider-like creatures that feed on blood and can transmit infections such as Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis. If bitten, the UKHSA recommends removing the tick promptly with tweezers or a tick removal device, cleaning the area, and monitoring for symptoms like a spreading bullseye rash or flu-like symptoms. Precautions include using insect repellent, wearing long sleeves and trousers, and checking for ticks after being outdoors.</p>

          <p>Former Real Madrid and Wales star Gareth Bale is reportedly part of a US-based consortium interested in taking over League One club Plymouth Argyle. Talks with the private equity firm are in the early stages, following a previous agreement to sell a stake in the club falling through. Bale would be following the lead of former Real Madrid team-mate Luka Modric, who has become part of the group that acquired control of Swansea. It is not known what role, if any, Bale will have at Plymouth should the planned takeover succeed.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army is undergoing a major restructuring to cut costs and move faster on new technology, as part of the Army Transformation Initiative. The initiative aims to shift defense dollars to products that can be made quickly and cheaply, reflecting the changing nature of battlefields and the vulnerability of expensive weapons systems to drone strikes. The Army is also expanding beyond its rigid acquisition process to more rapidly infuse formations with effective technologies. The 1st Brigade of the 101st Airborne Division is serving as a "transformation in contact" (TIC) brigade, equipped with AI-enabled platforms, SpaceX Starlink internet, autonomous vehicles, and drones.</p>

          <p>Nepal has begun exporting 40MW of electricity to Bangladesh, using India's power grid, marking a significant step in regional energy cooperation. This move is the result of an agreement signed in October 2024 between Nepal, Bangladesh, and India, enabling seamless transnational electricity flow. Nepal's Energy Minister Dipak Khadka stated that the country is also exporting 80MW to Bihar state in India, opening up a 5GW export market for Nepal. India plays a key role in this dynamic, both importing and exporting power within the region and facilitating regional energy integration.</p>

          <p>Despite escalating conflict between Israel and Iran, financial markets have remained relatively stable, with major U.S. stock benchmarks opening higher and oil prices falling. Traders are betting that the attacks will not escalate into a broader regional conflict that disrupts the global economy. Deutsche Bank notes that geopolitical events only significantly impact markets when they affect macro variables like growth and inflation. The biggest risk to oil prices is the potential shutdown of the Strait of Hormuz, which could lead to prices spiking above $100 a barrel, although analysts believe this is unlikely.</p>

          <p>U.S. Steel shares experienced a surge following President Donald Trump's approval of its merger with Japan's Nippon Steel. The agreement includes a national security agreement with the U.S. government, featuring a golden share that grants the U.S. president veto power over key decisions, such as relocating U.S. Steel's headquarters or transferring production outside the U.S. Despite Trump's description of the deal as a "partnership," U.S. Steel will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Steel North America. All regulatory approvals required for the completion of the transaction have been received, and the deal is expected to close promptly. (not investment advice)</p>
