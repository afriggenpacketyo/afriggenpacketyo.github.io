          <p>The UK Supreme Court upheld the right to wild camp on Dartmoor, rejecting landowners' appeals.  The ruling interprets the 1985 Dartmoor Commons Act as including camping under "open-air recreation."  This decision reignites the debate about public access to land in England, with calls to extend similar rights elsewhere.  However, the article emphasizes the responsibility of campers to minimize environmental impact.</p>
