          <h2>Romance Novel Sales Surge Due to BookTok and Changing Attitudes</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-20 19:10:43 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Romance and romantasy novels are experiencing a surge in popularity, driven by BookTok and a shift in attitudes towards the genre. A London bookshop owner highlights the "high-quality writing" in romance, challenging critics who dismiss it as mere smut. UK fiction revenue has surpassed ¬£1bn, fueled by romance and fantasy sales, with women under 35 making up the majority of romantasy purchases. Despite commercial growth, some still hold derisive attitudes, especially towards "spicy" titles, but young people are embracing the genre unapologetically, attending conventions, and discussing it online, while critical appraisal of the genre remains lacking.</p>

          <p>Nicolas Jackson received a red card after a studs-up challenge on a defender, leading to a suspension in both the Premier League and Club World Cup. The dismissal occurred during a match where Chelsea lost 3-1 to Flamengo, intensifying criticism of Jackson. This suspension creates an opportunity for Liam Delap to start in upcoming matches, including a crucial game against ES Tunis and the Premier League opener against Crystal Palace. Chelsea's coach, Enzo Maresca, expressed disappointment and suggested the red card could lead to a longer ban.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the release on bail for Mahmoud Khalil, a Columbia University graduate and activist, after he was detained by ICE. Khalil, a prominent voice in pro-Palestinian protests, was arrested in March, sparking demonstrations. The judge determined that Khalil was not a flight risk or threat to his community, despite the government's claims of foreign policy concerns and failure to disclose information on his residency application. Khalil's attorneys argued that his free speech rights were being violated, and his wife expressed relief at his impending return home.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be displayed in public school classrooms is unconstitutional. The court sided with civil liberties groups, arguing the law violates the separation of church and state and would isolate non-Christian students. The ruling supports a previous order by a U.S. District Judge who deemed the mandate unconstitutional. The Louisiana Attorney General disagrees and plans to appeal the ruling, setting the stage for a potential Supreme Court review.</p>
