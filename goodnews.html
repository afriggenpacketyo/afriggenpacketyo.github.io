          <p>Physicists are studying the sounds of rocket launches, particularly those by SpaceX, to better understand the acoustics of spaceflight and their impact on communities. As rocket launches become more frequent, the noise generated by these events, including sonic booms, is increasingly affecting people living nearby. Researchers are trying to determine what level of noise is acceptable to the public and how to mitigate disruptions. SpaceX is also testing Starship, a larger rocket expected to be even louder, making this research crucial for managing the impact of future spaceflight activities.</p>

          <p>Physicists are recording and studying the sounds of rocket launches, especially those of SpaceX, to understand the acoustics of spaceflight. With the increasing frequency of launches, scientists are investigating how the noise impacts communities and what levels are acceptable. The research aims to address the science gap in understanding rocket noise propagation and its effects. The study includes analyzing sonic booms and the unique sound signatures of different rockets, including the upcoming Starship, to develop strategies for minimizing disruptions.</p>

          <p>British-South African endurance athlete Lewis Pugh completed a 62-mile swim around Martha's Vineyard to raise awareness about the importance of protecting sharks. Pugh, a United Nations patron of the oceans, hopes to change public perception of sharks, often villainized in popular culture, and highlight the threats they face. He described the swim as one of the most challenging of his career due to the cold water, strong winds, and the presence of sharks. Pugh aims to draw attention to the ecocide of sharks, with approximately 274,000 being killed globally each day.</p>
