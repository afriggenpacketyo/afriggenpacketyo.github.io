          <p>The UK government has instructed Sainsbury's and Morrisons to cease advertising heated tobacco products, citing a violation of the 2002 Tobacco Advertising and Promotion Act.  The supermarkets previously claimed the ads were legal, while Philip Morris International, the manufacturer, maintains the law does not apply to heated tobacco. The government contends that the law does apply to these products, emphasizing the health risks of all tobacco products.  Public health concerns drive this action.</p>
