          <h2>New Photos of China's J-20A Stealth Fighter Fuel Speculation of Military Parade Debut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:38:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recently surfaced photos of China's advanced J-20A stealth fighter have sparked speculation that the aircraft may be officially unveiled at an upcoming military parade in Beijing. The images reveal a prototype with modified engine air intakes, known as diverterless supersonic inlets (DSI), which are optimized for the new, more powerful WS-15 engines. These design changes are expected to enhance both the fighter's stealth capabilities and its aerodynamic performance. The parade is scheduled for September 3 to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II, an event where China is anticipated to showcase new military hardware.</p>

          <h2>Rereading Virginia Woolf's 'A Room of One's Own' in the 21st Century</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article reflects on the enduring relevance of Virginia Woolf's 1928 essay, 'A Room of One's Own,' exploring its foundational feminist arguments from a modern, intersectional perspective. The author recounts an initial dismissal of Woolf as a symbol of exclusionary white feminism, but upon reading the work, discovered a powerful and relatable polemic against the suppression of women's voices. The essay argues that while Woolf's work has limitations tied to her era and class, its core ideas about the link between economic independence, personal space, and creative freedom remain profoundly resonant. It also considers how modern challenges, like the scarcity of time, add a new layer to Woolf's thesis.</p>

          <h2>How the Continental Army Forged a Unified American Identity During the Revolutionary War</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-04 07:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This historical analysis argues that the Continental Army, under George Washington's command, was instrumental in creating the foundations of a unified American national identity. Before the war, the thirteen colonies were disparate and competitive, lacking a shared culture. The army fostered unity by establishing national symbols like a new flag, creating shared traditions such as celebrating Washington's birthday instead of the King's, and forging bonds among soldiers from different regions through common hardship and sacrifice. After the war, many veterans became influential Federalists, advocating for a strong central government, their political views shaped by the challenges they faced due to a weak, decentralized Congress.</p>

          <h2>Los Angeles City Council Bans 'Disaster Tourism' Bus Tours in Fire-Ravaged Areas</h2>

          <p>The Los Angeles City Council has unanimously voted to restrict 'disaster tourism' buses from entering the Pacific Palisades fire zone and other future disaster areas. The move comes after reports of commercial tour operators conducting tours through neighborhoods devastated by a recent firestorm, a practice one councilmember called 'gross' and exploitative. The ban will remain in effect for the duration of any declared natural disaster emergency to prevent such tours and to ensure the safety of ongoing debris-clearing operations. The city will also consider making tour bus restrictions permanent on some of the area's narrow and steep streets.</p>

          <p>President Trump held a victory lap rally in Des Moines, Iowa, to celebrate the congressional passage of his 'One Big, Beautiful Bill.' He touted the legislation as a 'phenomenal victory' and the 'best birthday present for America,' highlighting its provisions for tax cuts, border security, and spending reductions. During the rally, Trump also previewed plans for the nation's 250th-anniversary celebration, which he said would include a UFC fight on the White House lawn. He defended the bill's popularity against negative polling and criticized Democrats for their unanimous opposition, which he attributed to personal animosity.</p>

          <p>A rare, handwritten letter by Thomas Jefferson from 1783, discussing the right of citizens to bear arms against autocratic rulers, has been uncovered and is being offered for sale. In the letter to Virginia's governor, Jefferson observes revolutionary fervor in Europe, noting that Dutch citizens were demanding the right to arm themselves, similar to the American colonists. The document, previously considered missing, provides a glimpse into Jefferson's thoughts on democratic movements and the right to revolution shortly after the end of the Revolutionary War. The dealer handling the sale values the historic letter at approximately $90,000.</p>

          <p>A North Korean civilian has been taken into custody by the South Korean military after successfully crossing the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The man was first detected near the Military Demarcation Line, prompting a 20-hour surveillance and guidance operation by South Korean troops to bring him to safety. The crossing is a rare event, as the DMZ is one of the most heavily mined and guarded borders in the world. The man, who followed the troops willingly, will be investigated by relevant authorities, a standard procedure for defectors arriving in the South.</p>

          <p>A major archaeological discovery in southwest China provides the first substantial evidence of a 'Wood Age' in East Asia, suggesting wooden tools were widely used 300,000 years ago. Dozens of well-preserved wooden artifacts were unearthed at the Gantangqing site in Yunnan province, a discovery described as 'world-class' by researchers. Because wood decomposes easily, direct evidence of its use by early hominins has been scarce, particularly in this region. This finding, published in the journal Science, fills a significant gap in the understanding of Palaeolithic technology and suggests that wood, not just stone, was a critical material for ancient human ancestors.</p>

          <p>Experts from the UK Meteor Network (UKMON) believe that fragments of a small meteor have landed on and around Ben Nevis, the UK's highest mountain. The meteor, which originated from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, created a bright orange glow and a loud bang reported by dozens of residents in the Scottish Highlands. Security cameras captured the event, allowing UKMON to calculate a potential landing zone between Loch Treig and Loch Etricht. While finding the meteorites in the vast, mountainous terrain will be difficult, the organization has appealed to hillwalkers to be on the lookout for the rare space rocks.</p>

The new deal reportedly increases his release clause by 50%, a significant blow to Barcelona, whose financial issues complicated their ability to register the player.
