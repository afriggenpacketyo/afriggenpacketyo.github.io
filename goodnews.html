          <p>Jalen Brunson's stellar performance, with 39 points and 12 assists, propelled the New York Knicks to a 121-113 victory over the Boston Celtics in Game 4, putting them one win away from their first Eastern Conference finals appearance in 25 years. The Celtics, defending champions, now face a daunting 3-1 deficit and a potential injury to All-Star Jayson Tatum, who was carried off the court with a leg injury. Despite leading by double digits early in the game, the Celtics faltered in the second half as the Knicks rallied, setting up a decisive Game 5 in Boston. The Knicks' resilience and Brunson's leadership were key to their victory, delighting fans who haven't seen their team in the conference finals since 2000.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump defended the White House's plan to accept a luxury jumbo jet from Qatar for use as Air Force One, stating that the U.S. has helped Qatar significantly over the years and that accepting the jet would be a "very nice gesture." The potential value of the plane, estimated at $400 million, has raised legal and ethical questions, particularly concerning the Emoluments Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which restricts gifts from foreign governments. Critics from both sides of the political spectrum have expressed concerns about the deal, with some calling for investigations into the matter, while the White House maintains that any gift will be accepted in full compliance with applicable laws.</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a model ordinance for local municipalities to address homeless encampments, emphasizing that there are "no more excuses" for inaction. Newsom is also announcing new funding for treatment and housing, urging cities and counties to do their part in addressing the homelessness crisis. The model ordinance stipulates that policies must prioritize shelter and services and not unduly limit local authority to clear encampments, while also adhering to the principle that no person should face criminal prosecution for sleeping outside when they have nowhere else to go. This initiative is supported by $3.3 billion in new Prop 1 funding, as Newsom approaches the end of his final term amid speculation about his political future.</p>

          <p>The auction of the Riggio family art collection at Christie's in New York revealed a cautious art market, with many objects presold and a lack of enthusiastic bidding, reflecting economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump's tariffs. Louise Riggio consigned nearly 40 works from her collection built with her late husband, Barnes & Noble founder Leonard Riggio. While the collection totaled $272 million with fees, it fell short of pre-sale expectations. The top lot, a Mondrian painting, sold for $47.6 million, less than the previous record for a Mondrian. Despite some signs of life with paintings by Richter, Van Gogh, and Frankenthaler selling above estimates, the overall sale indicated a market correction from the peak in 2022.</p>

          <p>Asian shares experienced gains after China and the United States announced a 90-day truce in their trade war, but these gains were tempered by lingering uncertainties. The agreement involves cutting tariffs on Chinese goods to 30% from as high as 145% by the United States, and China reducing its tariffs on U.S. goods to 10% from 125%. While the outcome surpassed expectations, analysts cautioned that President Trump's policies could still quickly change. The S&P 500 in the United States also saw a significant increase, pulling back within 5% of its all-time high, fueled by hopes of further trade deals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a historic election loss, Australia's Liberal Party has elected Sussan Ley as its first female leader, succeeding Peter Dutton. Ley, from the moderate faction of the party, won by a narrow margin against Angus Taylor, who advocated for restoring conservative values. The Liberal-National coalition suffered a significant defeat in the recent election, attributed to polarizing leaders and policies that alienated women and young people. Ley aims to rebuild the party's relationship with Australians, acknowledging that many feel neglected by the Liberal Party. Her appointment marks a significant shift as the party seeks to modernize and better represent contemporary Australia.</p>

As ambassador, he sought accountability for missing Americans and negotiated a key trade agreement between the U.S. and Vietnam.

Central banks have also been net buyers of gold, adding to their official reserves.

GLP-1 drugs are effective at reducing visceral fat, but their use should be considered for people with excess visceral fat who have begun to suffer its consequences. The article emphasizes the importance of considering waist size and blood-lipid patterns over BMI as measures of metabolic health. It calls for the FDA to require pharmaceutical companies to gather data on long-term use and safe discontinuation of GLP-1 drugs, and advocates for a more nuanced approach to treating metabolic disease.</p>

          <p>The United States and China have agreed to slash most of their recent new tariffs on each other's imports and suspend part of the reciprocal duties for 90 days. The agreement was reached during high-level trade talks in Geneva over the weekend, prompting a surge in stock prices. The United States will cut its recent tariffs on China to 30 percent from 145 percent, while China will lower its retaliatory tariffs on the United States to 10 percent from 125 percent. Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed his nation on Monday, stating that India will keep an eye on Pakistan's moves in the cease-fire agreed to by both sides over the weekend.</p>
