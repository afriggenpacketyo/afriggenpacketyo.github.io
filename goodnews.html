          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is visiting the UK to sign a significant free trade agreement with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal, which follows years of negotiations, will see India lower tariffs on British goods like cars and whisky, while the UK will increase imports of Indian textiles and gemstones. The British government projects the agreement will boost its economy by £4.8 billion annually and increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion a year by 2040. The pact has been approved by the Indian cabinet and now awaits ratification by the UK parliament.</p>

          <p>The Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is showcasing "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path," an exhibition featuring the work of Nigerian artist John Madu. Inspired by the Dutch master, Madu created ten large paintings that infuse Vincent van Gogh's 19th-century motifs with a modern West African perspective. Both self-taught artists, Madu and Van Gogh also share an influence from East Asian art. Madu, who considers himself a "global citizen," uses his art to reflect the vibrant culture and energy of his hometown, Lagos.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank's shares rose after the company announced a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations. The German lender confirmed it is on track to meet its full-year targets, with pre-tax profit up 34% year-on-year when excluding certain legal costs. Its core investment banking unit saw a 3% revenue increase, driven by strong performance in fixed income and currencies, although its advisory division saw a decline. The bank's results were moderately affected by the euro's strength against the U.S. dollar. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is seeking to advance its trans-Himalayan infrastructure projects in Nepal as it competes with India for influence in the strategically located nation. During a recent visit, a senior Chinese official emphasized implementing more projects in areas like agriculture, energy, and health to boost Nepal's development. Landlocked between the two regional powers, Nepal has traditionally been allied with India but has grown closer to China in recent years due to significant Chinese investment. Beijing has poured millions into various Nepalese infrastructure projects, from roads to hydropower plants, strengthening economic ties.</p>

          <p>Sean Green, a 36-year-old from Angus, Scotland, has completed the monumental challenge of mountain biking down all 282 of Scotland's Munros. Munros are mountains over 3,000 feet, and Green is believed to be only the second person ever to accomplish this feat. The quest, which involved climbing each summit with his bike before riding down, took him approximately eight and a half years to finish. Green, a semi-professional cyclist, said the challenge combined his passions for mountain biking and the outdoors, with the logistics being the most difficult aspect.</p>

          <p>China is planning to provide monthly subsidies to its senior citizens in the form of electronic coupons to help cover the costs of care services. This rare use of direct fiscal support is aimed at easing the financial burden on its aging population and stimulating consumption in the elderly-care sector. To be eligible, seniors must be assessed as having a moderate to severe physical disability. The policy is part of Beijing's broader effort to strengthen its social safety net and address mounting demographic and economic pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has ruled that President Trump's executive order attempting to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional, upholding a nationwide block on its enforcement. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a lower court's decision, stating that the order's interpretation of the 14th Amendment is incorrect. The amendment grants citizenship to all persons born in the United States and subject to its jurisdiction. This ruling marks the first time an appeals court has weighed in on the matter, bringing the contentious issue a step closer to the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>Faced with a nationwide housing affordability crisis, a growing number of states are enacting laws to compel local municipalities to allow for the construction of more affordable housing. States like Utah are strengthening mandates that require cities to create denser, cheaper housing options, using both incentives and penalties to overcome local "NIMBY" (Not In My Back Yard) opposition. While these top-down measures aim to address a massive housing shortage, they often face pushback from local governments concerned about losing control over planning, infrastructure strain, and changing community character.

          <p>For the first time in five years, China and Russia have launched a joint oceanographic research expedition, signaling renewed scientific cooperation between the two nations. A team of 25 researchers set sail from Vladivostok on a 45-day mission to study the effects of climate change on deep-sea environments in the Bering Sea and the northwestern Pacific. The mission, the ninth of its kind, is seen as a step toward addressing global climate change and exploring cutting-edge marine science. This collaboration also aligns with both countries' strategic ambitions in the Arctic region.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study suggests that walking 7,000 steps per day is a more realistic and evidence-based target for health benefits than the commonly cited 10,000 steps. Published in The Lancet Public Health, the research analyzed data from over 160,000 adults and linked the 7,000-step count to a reduced risk of cancer, dementia, and heart disease. The popular 10,000-step goal originated from a 1960s marketing campaign rather than scientific evidence. Researchers hope these findings will encourage more people to use step tracking as a practical way to improve their health.</p>
