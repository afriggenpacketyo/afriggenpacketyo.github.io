        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Union is set to gradually introduce its new digital border control, the Entry/Exit System (EES), starting this autumn. The system will replace manual passport stamping for non-EU citizens entering the 29-country Schengen Area, requiring them to register biometric data like fingerprints and a facial photo on their first entry. This registration will be valid for three years. While the EES aims to enhance security and streamline travel in the long term, officials have expressed concerns about potential for long queues during the initial rollout, particularly at high-traffic points like the Port of Dover and Eurostar terminals.</p>

          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching $1.8 billion, an Alabama woman has a unique plan for her potential winnings that has nothing to do with luxury goods. Susie Conerly told a local news station that her first priority would be to use $70 million of the prize money to pay the buyout clause for Alabama Crimson Tide head football coach Kalen DeBoer. Her dissatisfaction follows a recent upset loss to Florida State, which has increased pressure on the coach. The humorous and passionate statement highlights the intense fan culture surrounding college football in the American South.</p>

The comedy-drama, starring Cate Blanchett and Adam Driver, explores complex family relationships. The festival's second-highest honor, the Silver Lion Grand Jury Prize, was awarded to "The Voice of Hind Rajab," a powerful film about a young Palestinian girl killed by Israeli forces, which received a 23-minute standing ovation at its premiere.

          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka defeated American Amanda Anisimova 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to win the US Open women's singles final for the second year in a row. The victory marks Sabalenka's fourth Grand Slam title and her first of the 2025 season, answering critics who questioned her composure after losses in two other major finals this year. While Sabalenka demonstrated a steadier performance, Anisimova struggled with consistency in her second Grand Slam final appearance. The 24-year-old American was emotional after the loss but showed significant improvement from a previous major final defeat.</p>

          <p>Sean Dickson delivered a stunning late-game performance to lead Somerset to a dramatic victory over the Bears in the T20 Blast cricket quarter-final. Needing 19 runs from the final over, Dickson hit two sixes and a four to clinch the win with just one ball to spare, finishing with an unbeaten 71 from only 26 balls. The victory, which seemed unlikely for much of Somerset's innings, secures the team a record-equalling 11th appearance at the T20 Blast finals day. The Bears were left disappointed after posting a strong total of 190-6, only to be denied by Dickson's last-minute fireworks.</p>

          <p>Despite a decisive 47-7 victory against Australia that secured their place in the quarter-finals, England's performance revealed notable weaknesses that could be exploited by stronger opponents. The Red Roses appeared unsettled by Australia's intensity in the first 30 minutes, struggling with their usually dominant set-piece and allowing the Wallaroos to control the game's early stages. While England's superior depth and defense ultimately led to a scoreless second half for their opponents, the initial untidiness and fumbled opportunities were uncharacteristic. Coach John Mitchell acknowledged the team's defensive strength but will need to address attacking inconsistencies as they head into the knockout rounds.</p>

          <p>The recent NFL game between the Chargers and the Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil, is part of a broader, long-term strategy by the league to establish a year-round international presence. This season features a record seven international games, with plans for a game in Australia next year. League executives emphasize that the goal is sustained engagement rather than one-off events, with teams now having marketing rights in various global markets to build a fan base. Despite American football's niche status in soccer-dominated Brazil, the game drew a near-capacity crowd of 50,000, indicating a growing interest.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured pole position at the Italian Grand Prix by setting a new all-time Formula 1 speed record, surpassing the previous benchmark set in 2020. His lap at the Monza circuit achieved an average speed of 164.466 mph, making it the fastest in the sport's history. The record was made possible by a combination of factors, including the current cars' lower drag, a newly resurfaced track with better grip, and Monza's long straights. The achievement is significant as it breaks a record held by a previous generation of cars often considered to be the fastest ever produced.</p>

          <p>The 2025 Reform UK conference showcases the party's dramatic growth and increasing professionalism, signaling its ambition to become a major force in British politics. The event, held at a large venue typically used by established parties, feels like a major conference while retaining an insurgent energy, attracting many first-time attendees and disaffected voters. The party is rapidly building a national volunteer network, and leader Nigel Farage's closing speech emphasized the need for discipline and focus. According to this analysis, the party's momentum represents the most significant political development of the past year in the UK.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has signed a new executive order authorizing the U.S. State Department to impose sanctions and other penalties on countries that wrongfully detain American citizens. The order creates a "state sponsor of wrongful detention" designation, similar to the existing classification for state sponsors of terrorism, which could trigger economic sanctions and visa restrictions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated that the measure sends a clear message that any nation using an American as a bargaining chip will face consequences. The move aims to provide the administration with more tools to secure the release of Americans detained abroad.</p>
