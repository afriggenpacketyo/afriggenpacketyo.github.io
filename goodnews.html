          <p>Authorities in Oregon have successfully apprehended a murder suspect who was mistakenly released from a Multnomah County jail, triggering a multi-day manhunt. The suspect, Ty Anthony Sage, was facing charges of second-degree murder and was denied bail, but was accidentally released due to a clerical error regarding a $5,000 bail amount. The local sheriff acknowledged the severe mistake, stating the victim's family deserved better and that a full review is underway to prevent future incidents. The recapture occurred at a gas station without incident, bringing a resolution to the search that had put the community and the victim's family on high alert.</p>

          <p>As China formulates its 15th five-year plan, analysts anticipate a major focus on strengthening its supply chain resilience and addressing vulnerabilities in high-technology sectors. Despite its dominant manufacturing ecosystem, exemplified by its crucial role in producing components for products like Apple's iPhone, China faces chokepoints in key tech areas. The new development blueprint is expected to prioritize moving up the value chain and securing greater self-sufficiency. This strategy aims to solidify its global manufacturing leadership amidst ongoing domestic economic shifts and external pressures like trade tensions with the U.S.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has given preliminary approval to a landmark $1.5 billion settlement offered by AI company Anthropic to a group of authors in a class action lawsuit. The authors alleged that Anthropic illegally used their books, downloaded from pirated databases, to train its AI models, including its assistant Claude. This settlement represents the largest publicly reported copyright recovery in history and is being closely watched as a precedent for copyright infringement in the age of artificial intelligence. Under the agreement, Anthropic will pay authors and destroy the datasets containing the allegedly pirated materials, while admitting no wrongdoing.</p>

The agreement, valued at around $14 billion, satisfies a 2024 law requiring parent company ByteDance to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban. Under the deal, ByteDance will own less than 20% of the new venture, and the content algorithm will be controlled by U.S. investors, including Oracle. The arrangement aims to resolve national security concerns over data privacy and potential foreign influence while allowing the popular app to continue serving its 170 million American users.</p>

          <p>Golfer Bryson DeChambeau has transformed from a divisive figure into a key talisman for the U.S. Ryder Cup team. Previously viewed as an individualist and snubbed for the 2023 team after his move to LIV Golf, DeChambeau has since made a concerted effort to bond with his teammates. His strong performances in major championships secured him an automatic spot on the 2025 team. U.S. captain Keegan Bradley and teammates now praise his "fiery" energy and commitment, positioning him as a central, unifying force as the team prepares to face Europe in New York.</p>

The settlement includes a $1 billion civil penalty and $1.5 billion in refunds to an estimated 35 million affected customers. As part of the agreement, Amazon, which admitted no wrongdoing, must make its subscription terms clearer and provide an easy cancellation method.

          <p>The White House has released new architectural renderings providing a more detailed look at the 90,000-square-foot ballroom currently under construction in the East Wing. The project, announced by the Trump administration in July, will have a seated capacity for 650 guests, making it significantly larger than the main White House building. The administration has stated that the construction will be funded by private donors and the president himself, with nearly $200 million already pledged by various corporate and individual donors. Construction on the South Lawn began earlier this month, with the new images revealing more about the final design.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, the average rate for a home equity line of credit (HELOC) has fallen to 7.88%, a significant drop in just one week. With U.S. homeowners holding a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, this makes HELOCs an increasingly affordable borrowing option compared to personal loans or credit cards. Because HELOCs have variable rates, they are positioned to become even cheaper if the Fed continues to cut rates as expected later this year. This provides homeowners with a flexible and cost-effective way to access funds. (not investment advice)</p>

Following a recent meeting between Trump and Arab leaders, the minister expressed optimism that a peace deal could be reached soon to end the prolonged suffering and bring home hostages. His comments came shortly before Trump told reporters he would not allow Israel to annex the West Bank, a stance that aligns with the position of Arab nations. This signals a potential shift in U.S. policy aimed at de-escalating the conflict.</p>

His appeal comes amid a tense trade environment following President Trump's second term, which has seen high tariffs on Chinese imports and new restrictions on Chinese investment and student visas. Li's outreach suggests a desire from Beijing to leverage non-governmental channels to de-escalate economic tensions.</p>
