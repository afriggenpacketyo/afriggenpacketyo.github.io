          <p>London Mayor Sir Sadiq Khan has endorsed a report by the London Drugs Commission recommending the decriminalization of possessing small amounts of cannabis for personal use. The report suggests removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act, citing racial disparities in stop and search practices. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Mark Rowley stated that drug laws are for Parliament to decide, but the police will enforce current laws. The report also recommends improved public health services, enhanced cannabis education, and fair access to medical cannabis.</p>

          <p>Thames Water has been fined ¬£122.7m, the largest penalty ever issued by Ofwat, for breaches related to sewage operations and shareholder payouts. The regulator said the fines, which include ¬£104.5m for sewage breaches and ¬£18.2m for "undeserved" shareholder payouts, will be paid by the company and its investors, not customers. Thames Water faces ongoing criticism for sewage discharges and a ¬£20bn debt, recently securing a ¬£3bn emergency loan. Ofwat has placed Thames Water in "cash lock up," requiring approval for future dividend payments.</p>

          <p>As Poland approaches its presidential election runoff, candidates Rafal Trzaskowski and Karol Nawrocki are in a close race, vying for undecided voters. Recent polls show a tight margin between the liberal-conservative Trzaskowski and the national-conservative Nawrocki. Trzaskowski held a "March of Patriots" in Warsaw, receiving support from leaders of the ruling coalition, while Nawrocki led a "March for Poland" with the motto "Poland first." Ultra-right politician Slawomir Mentzen, who was eliminated in the first round, is attempting to leverage his support for the 2027 parliamentary election.</p>

          <p>Chinese customs authorities are intercepting suspected smugglers of Pop Mart toys, including the Labubu and Molly series, as prices surge amid the retailer's global expansion. Customs agents have seized undeclared toys from passengers allegedly seeking to profit from resales, with hundreds of toys confiscated in multiple incidents at airports. Travelers are reportedly purchasing the toys overseas and bringing them back into China, where they sometimes sell at higher prices due to currency fluctuations or local discounts. Pop Mart, founded in 2010, has expanded to over 500 stores in more than 30 countries and regions.</p>

          <p>Southern California Edison (SCE) has agreed to pay the federal government $82.5 million for damages caused by the 2020 Bobcat Fire, which burned extensively in the Angeles National Forest.

The funds will help rehabilitate burned areas, restore wildlife habitats, and strengthen forest resilience.
