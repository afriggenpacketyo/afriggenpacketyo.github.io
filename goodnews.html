          <p>Actor Dean Cain, known for his role in "Superman," is set to be sworn in as an honorary ICE officer to show support for what he calls "vilified" agents enforcing U.S. immigration laws. Cain stated his motivation is to stand with officers who are upholding laws passed by Congress, arguing that their work is essential for maintaining social services for American citizens. He expressed support for the Trump administration's immigration policies and advocated for a more merit-based, streamlined legal immigration process, while criticizing the emotional, rather than legal, perspective often applied to the issue. This action is part of his broader involvement with law enforcement, as he is also a reserve police officer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This cultural commentary reflects on the peculiar musical phenomenon of the 1960s when numerous popular singers were named Bobby. The author humorously recalls songs like "Bobby's Girl" and "Wait 'til My Bobby Gets Home," before listing the many chart-topping artists of the era, including Bobby Darin, Bobby Vee, Bobby Vinton, and Bobby Rydell. This trend is contextualized by the fact that Robert was one of the most popular baby names in the preceding decades, making a surge of singers named Bobby a statistical likelihood. The piece concludes by noting the evolution of these artists and the author's own transition to appreciating musicians like Bob Dylan.</p>

          <p>Australian rock band King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard recently pulled their music from Spotify in protest of CEO Daniel Ek's investments in an AI defense technology firm. Frontman Stu Mackenzie explained the decision as staying true to the band's values, despite the potential impact on accessibility for fans. The band, known for its prolific and genre-spanning output, is also preparing for a performance at the Hollywood Bowl with a full orchestra to play their new album, "Phantom Island." The new record was inspired by conversations with the L.A. Philharmonic and involved rewriting songs to integrate symphonic arrangements, a process Mackenzie described as serendipitous and challenging.</p>

          <p>Emma Sloley's new novel, "The Island of Last Things," is set in a near-future where mass extinctions have left Alcatraz Island as the world's last operational zoo. The story is narrated by Camille, a reserved zookeeper whose life is upended by the arrival of a charismatic new colleague, Sailor. As their bond deepens, Sailor reveals a plan to smuggle animals to a rumored sanctuary in China, forcing Camille to confront her own passivity and the bleak reality of their work. The review praises the novel for its portrayal of a world grappling with despair while highlighting the small moments of care and the power of imagining a better future, even when hope seems futile.</p>

          <h2>George Friedman and Garry Kasparov Discuss Geopolitical Realism and Trump's Foreign Policy</h2>

          <p>In a podcast discussion, Geopolitical Futures founder George Friedman argues that U.S. foreign policy, including under Donald Trump, is driven by pragmatic national interests rather than ideology. Friedman, drawing on his family's history fleeing the Holocaust and communism, advocates for an analytical, passionless view of geopolitics. He posits that Trump's seemingly chaotic actions represent a rational deconstruction of the post-WWII global system, which he sees as obsolete now that Russia is no longer a major threat to Europe. Friedman predicts that the current turmoil is a necessary "storm before the calm," part of a recurring 50-year cycle in which America reinvents its institutions and global relationships.</p>

          <p>The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) has arrested a 22-year-old Iranian man in Birmingham on suspicion of facilitating illegal immigration as part of an organized crime group. The arrest followed a months-long undercover investigation by the BBC, which created fake identities to expose a violent smuggling gang's operations in France and the UK. The BBC's probe began after witnessing a chaotic boat launch where five people, including a seven-year-old girl, were trampled to death. The NCA stated the investigation is ongoing, and the government has pledged an additional £100 million to combat criminal networks involved in the dangerous small boat crossings.</p>

          <p>Universities across Europe, Australia, and East Asia are increasingly targeting students from Southeast Asia to boost enrollment and address demographic challenges. Countries like Australia, Japan, and South Korea have set ambitious goals to attract tens of thousands of students from nations like Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia. European universities, facing financial pressures and underfunding, see this as a key source of income and talent, launching initiatives to promote study opportunities. However, they face growing competition from East Asian institutions, which are improving in quality and are geographically closer, causing a shift in where many Southeast Asian students choose to pursue higher education.</p>

          <p>Actress Gina Carano has settled her lawsuit against Disney and Lucasfilm, in which she claimed she was wrongfully fired from the series "The Mandalorian" over her political social media posts. Carano, who played Cara Dune, was dismissed in 2021 after a post that compared political differences in the U.S. to the treatment of Jewish people in Nazi Germany. In her announcement, Carano thanked Elon Musk for funding her legal battle through his commitment to free speech. While the financial terms were not disclosed, Lucasfilm released a statement expressing respect for Carano and indicating a potential for future collaboration, a notable shift from its previous condemnation.</p>

          <p>Independent MP Rupert Lowe issued an apology and a £1,000 charity donation after he mistook a team of charity rowers for "illegal migrants" off the coast of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. Lowe posted a picture of the boat on social media, announcing he had alerted authorities to what he believed was a migrant dinghy. However, it was soon confirmed that the vessel was crewed by a team rowing from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise money for Motor Neurone Disease research. One of the rowers, a former Royal Marine, found the situation "hilarious," noting the vigilante-style response from onlookers on the shore.</p>

          <p>Shares of SoftBank Group surged over 10% to a record high following the announcement of its fiscal first-quarter profits, which significantly surpassed analyst expectations. The Japanese investment giant reported a profit of 421.8 billion yen, a stark turnaround from a loss in the previous year, largely driven by a $4.8 billion gain in its Vision Funds. This performance was bolstered by strong returns from listed companies like Grab and private investments such as Swiggy. The positive results and strategic moves, including collaborations with Arm Holdings, have fueled investor confidence in the company's AI-focused portfolio. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite integrating its Paralympic and Olympic national championships for the first time, the U.S. faces significant hurdles in preparing for the 2028 Los Angeles Paralympics. Athletes and advocates argue that while the move provides much-needed visibility, it's a largely symbolic and overdue step. Achieving global dominance requires far greater investment in resources, training, and development pipelines for para-athletes, who have historically competed in subpar venues and received less compensation. While the U.S. has a strong record, countries like China and Brazil are investing heavily and catching up, highlighting an urgent need for the U.S. to build a more robust system to find and develop talent.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has directed NASA to accelerate its plan to deploy a nuclear reactor on the moon by 2030 to power a future human base. Officials state that nuclear energy is essential for a sustained lunar presence, as solar power is insufficient during the two-week lunar night. The proposed reactor would provide a continuous power source critical for claiming a strategic location on the moon before competitors like China and Russia. However, the ambitious timeline and estimated $3 billion cost have raised concerns among some scientists about feasibility, safety risks during launch and reentry, and the strain on NASA's budget, which has recently faced proposed cuts.</p>

          <p>South Korea has launched a national initiative to develop its own foundational artificial intelligence model, aiming to compete with tech giants in the U.S. and China. The project involves consortia led by major Korean companies like SK Telecom, LG, and Naver, leveraging the country's strengths across the AI stack, from semiconductors to software. This push for "sovereign AI" reflects a growing global trend where nations seek to build and control their own strategic AI infrastructure to reduce reliance on foreign entities. The first open-source model from the SK Telecom-led consortium is expected by the end of the year, intended to be competitive with leading global models.</p>
