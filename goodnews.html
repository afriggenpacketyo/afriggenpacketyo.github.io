          <p>England's Women's Rugby World Cup squad has announced 13 changes to its starting XV for the upcoming match against Samoa in Northampton, with veteran Marlie Packer stepping in as captain, replacing Zoe Aldcroft. This strategic decision by coach John Mitchell aims to provide rest for regular starters while maintaining momentum, following England's impressive 69-7 victory over the United States in their opening game. The article notes the return of Helena Rowland and Claudia Moloney-MacDonald from injury, alongside World Cup debuts for Lilli Ives Campion and Abi Burton. With a 28-game winning streak, the Red Roses are expected to secure another significant score, solidifying their path to the knockout stages despite the squad rotation.</p>

          <p>Best Buy announced second-quarter fiscal 2026 results that surpassed Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, indicating a modest sales recovery driven by strong performance in mobile phones, video gaming, and computing categories. However, the consumer electronics giant maintained its cautious full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty surrounding potential tariff impacts on both consumer spending and its operational costs. CEO Corie Barry noted that while the company is "trending toward the higher end of our sales range," the unpredictable tariff environment necessitates prudence in its outlook. The article also details Best Buy's recent initiatives, such as launching a third-party marketplace, to spur growth amidst a challenging retail landscape where customers remain deal-focused on big-ticket purchases.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. economy expanded at a faster pace in the second quarter than initially estimated, with gross domestic product (GDP) growing at a 3.3% annual rate, up from the initial 3% estimate. This growth marks a rebound from a 0.5% contraction in the first quarter of 2025, which was primarily due to a surge in imports. The upward revision is attributed to increased business investment in structures, equipment, and intellectual property, as well as stronger consumer spending. Analysts note that investment related to AI is significantly contributing to this economic strength, with little sign of it fading soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. banking industry is experiencing significant consolidation, with the number of FDIC-insured banks nearly halved since 2005 due to large banks acquiring regional and community institutions. In contrast, Canada's highly concentrated banking system, with only 79 banks, was lauded as the soundest in the G7 during the 2008 financial crisis. While some argue that market domination can stifle competition and innovation, proponents suggest the sheer size of Canadian banks contributes to their economic stability. The article raises concerns about proposed U.S. Federal Reserve policies to lower capital requirements, which could further accelerate consolidation. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new book, "The Origin of Language" by Madeleine Beekman, proposes a novel theory that human language may have evolved primarily out of the urgent needs of early human child-rearing. Challenging traditional theories focused on male-dominated activities, Beekman argues that the necessity for cooperation and communication among caregivers, especially mothers, to support vulnerable offspring, drove the development of complex vocalizations into structured language. This article highlights how biological changes, such as elongated vocal cords and larger brains, created the conditions for language, and how the survival advantage of verbal expression for both children and parents fostered its development. The theory offers a fresh perspective on human evolution, emphasizing interdependence and collective care.</p>

          <p>New York City is marking its 400th anniversary this year, yet the milestone is largely going uncelebrated, with little public acknowledgment or planned events despite earlier promises from Mayor Eric Adams.

The article suggests this oversight is both "sad" and "inspiring," hinting at the city's perpetual forward momentum where past achievements are often overshadowed by present challenges and future aspirations.
