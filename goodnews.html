          <p>Defending champion Carlos Alcaraz has secured his place in the Wimbledon final for the third consecutive year by overcoming Taylor Fritz in a tense four-set match. Alcaraz demonstrated his top-tier skills, winning 6-4 5-7 6-3 7-6 (8-6) after saving two set points in a dramatic fourth-set tie-break. This victory extends his winning streak to 24 matches on the grass court. He will now face either Novak Djokovic or Jannik Sinner as he aims for a third straight title at the prestigious tournament.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:11:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new law signed by President Trump, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," significantly reforms the federal student loan system. The legislation reduces the number of repayment plans from seven to two, consisting of a standard 10-25 year plan and a new income-driven option called the Repayment Assistance Plan. It also introduces borrowing caps for Parent PLUS and Grad PLUS loans and tightens eligibility for Pell Grants. While the White House promotes the changes as a simplification of a broken system, some critics express concern that borrowers may face longer repayment periods and reduced access to aid.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 12:02:15 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following their celebrated reunion, the band Oasis has seen a massive resurgence in popularity, capturing the top two spots on the UK album chart. Their greatest hits compilation, "Time Flies," returned to number one, while their classic 1995 album "(What's the Story) Morning Glory?" secured the second position. This chart dominance coincides with the start of their sold-out comeback tour, which began last week after a 16-year hiatus. The renewed fan enthusiasm demonstrates the enduring legacy of the Britpop icons, with several of their songs also re-entering the top 20 singles chart.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs is testing an autonomous AI software engineer named Devin, developed by the startup Cognition, marking a significant AI milestone for Wall Street. The bank's tech chief, Marco Argenti, stated that Devin will augment the firm's 12,000 human developers by handling tedious tasks like code updates. This move into "agentic AI" represents a major shift, with the potential to execute complex, multi-step jobs and boost worker productivity significantly. While the bank envisions a "hybrid workforce" of humans and AI, the development also fuels concerns about future job displacement in the financial sector.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the current economic climate, savers with a significant sum like $10,000 are weighing the benefits of short-term versus long-term certificates of deposit (CDs). Although short-term CDs currently offer slightly higher annual percentage rates, the extended compounding period of long-term CDs results in substantially greater interest earnings over time. For instance, a five-year CD could generate over $2,200 in interest, whereas a one-year CD would yield around $440 on the same principal. The choice depends on an individual's financial goals and their need for liquidity versus maximizing long-term returns. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that despite intense public and political outrage, the Jeffrey Epstein case is not a significant issue that will determine future elections. The author notes that the Trump Justice Department's conclusion that Epstein's death was a suicide and that no "client list" exists has been met with cross-partisan skepticism. However, the piece contends that voters will ultimately focus on core issues like the economy and immigration, not on this "tawdry soap opera drama." The author suggests that while the administration's handling of the case has been flawed, the public should redirect its energy toward more pressing matters.</p>

          <p>Amid the national debate over IVF and declining birth rates, a significant factor is often overlooked: male infertility. This article argues that if the Trump administration is serious about boosting fertility, expanding access to treatments for men could be a meaningful and politically viable path forward. Currently, women disproportionately bear the physical and emotional burden of fertility treatments, even when infertility stems from male factors. By increasing insurance coverage for male-specific care and addressing the shortage of specialists, policymakers could provide more comprehensive options for families and reduce the reliance on more invasive procedures like IVF.</p>

Researchers concluded that these rapid rollouts reduced deaths from five major diseases, including Ebola, cholera, and measles, by approximately 60 percent. The vaccinations also prevented a similar percentage of infections and generated an estimated $32 billion in economic benefits by averting deaths and disability. The study, backed by the vaccine alliance Gavi, underscores the critical importance of swift, well-funded vaccination campaigns as a counter-measure to the growing global risk of infectious disease outbreaks.</p>

He argued that using plastic, credit or debit, encourages overspending by 12-18% compared to cash because it doesn't trigger the same psychological "pain" of payment.
