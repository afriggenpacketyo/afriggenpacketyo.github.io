          <p>Contrary to stereotypes, many Gen Z professionals are leading the return-to-office movement, driven by a desire to learn, network, and advance their careers. A recent study indicates that young workers are coming to the office more frequently than other age groups and crave in-person interaction for professional growth. These young professionals view the office as a place to develop corporate skills, build relationships with mentors, and demonstrate their ambition to higher-ups. They are willing to endure long commutes and significant expenses to gain the benefits of in-person work.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom and the European Union are reportedly close to reaching an agreement to reset relations after Britain's exit from the EU in 2020. Prime Minister Keir Starmer is hosting European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for a summit in London, with talks focusing on defense, trade, and cooperation on geopolitical issues. A new defense and security partnership is expected to be unveiled, potentially paving the way for the UK's participation in EU security and defense policy. However, the UK remains wary of increasing support for Reform UK, a party led by Brexit architect Nigel Farage.</p>
