          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-16 03:09:17 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK state pension is anticipated to increase by 4.7% in the upcoming fiscal year, based on the latest wage growth figures, which would add over £500 annually for recipients of the new flat-rate pension. This increase is mandated by the "triple lock" policy, which pegs the annual rise to the highest of wage growth, inflation, or 2.5%. However, experts highlight a growing concern as the rising pension payments are nearing the frozen personal tax allowance threshold. This convergence means a greater number of pensioners will likely be required to pay income tax in the near future. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the U.K. prepares to host U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit, the event is seen as a potential distraction from Prime Minister Keir Starmer's mounting domestic challenges. Starmer's government is facing low approval ratings, internal party dissent, and recent high-profile resignations and firings. The visit, complete with royal pageantry and bilateral trade meetings, offers an opportunity for the British government to project stability and leverage the "special relationship." Despite political differences, Trump has expressed a fondness for the UK, which London hopes to translate into favorable trade agreements, particularly on tech, energy, and metal tariffs.</p>

          <p>Quarterback Baker Mayfield orchestrated a game-winning 80-yard drive in the final moments, culminating in a two-yard touchdown run by Rachaad White with just six seconds remaining to give the Tampa Bay Buccaneers a 20-19 victory over the Houston Texans. This marks the second consecutive week Mayfield has led a game-winning drive in the final minute, making him the first Buccaneers quarterback to achieve this feat to start a season since 1980. Despite a late touchdown run by Houston's Nick Chubb that gave the Texans a lead with two minutes left, their offense struggled to maintain momentum in the second half.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to introduce the "Hillsborough Law," a significant piece of legislation designed to prevent institutional cover-ups following major disasters. The bill will impose a legal "duty of candour" on public officials, forcing them to cooperate truthfully with investigations or face potential criminal sanctions. The law, long championed by the families of the 97 victims of the 1989 Hillsborough football disaster, will also provide legal funding for those affected by state-related tragedies. Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated the legislation aims to change the balance of power and ensure the state can no longer hide from the people it serves.</p>

          <p>Professional women's rugby teams are increasingly using technology and personalized health strategies to manage and track players' menstrual cycles, viewing it as a "fifth vital sign" of health. By monitoring cycles through apps and daily wellness forms, teams can make informed adjustments to training intensity, nutrition, and recovery protocols. This data-driven approach helps mitigate symptoms like cramps and fatigue, aiming to optimize performance throughout all phases of the cycle. The article highlights that while the cycle informs decisions, it does not dictate participation, as athletes adapt their preparation to compete at the highest level regardless of their period.</p>

          <p>The Scottish Parliament is set to vote on a major justice reform bill that includes the controversial proposal to eliminate the "not proven" verdict from criminal trials. This uniquely Scottish verdict currently functions as an acquittal, identical to "not guilty," but critics argue it is confusing and fails to provide closure for victims. To balance this change, the bill also proposes raising the requirement for a guilty verdict to a two-thirds jury majority, up from the current simple majority. The legislation, which is expected to pass, also includes plans for a specialized sexual offenses court and a new victims and witnesses commissioner.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers are contemplating the strategic use of two-way superstar Shohei Ohtani as both a starting pitcher and a potential relief pitcher during the upcoming playoffs. While the team's primary plan is to use him as a starter, management has acknowledged that unforeseen circumstances in October could create scenarios where he is deployed from the bullpen. This would be similar to how other star pitchers have been used in crucial late-game situations in past postseasons. However, MLB's two-way player rules would add complexity, as using Ohtani in relief would mean the Dodgers would lose his bat as the designated hitter once he leaves the game.</p>
