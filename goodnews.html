          <p>Italian cyclist Jonathan Milan won his second stage of the 2025 Tour de France, emerging victorious in a sprint finish during the 17th stage. The 160.4km route concluded in a bunch finish after the peloton caught the last breakaway rider with just 4km remaining. The final kilometers were marked by heavy rain and a crash that involved some of Milan's key rivals. This victory strengthens Milan's hold on the green jersey for the points classification, while Tadej Pogacar safely retains the overall leader's yellow jersey with no changes in the top general classification standings.</p>

          <p>New York Congressman Mike Lawler has announced he will run for reelection to his House seat in 2026, ending speculation about a potential run for governor against incumbent Kathy Hochul. Lawler stated that after deliberation, he concluded that focusing on his district and helping maintain the Republican House majority was the right decision for his family and constituents. His Hudson Valley district is considered a key battleground seat, and his decision impacts the field of potential Republican challengers to Governor Hochul. The announcement drew a sharp response from Hochul, who criticized Lawler's political alignment with former President Trump.</p>

          <p>Alphabet is scheduled to report its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street closely watching its performance in key areas like advertising and cloud computing. Analysts expect significant growth in revenue and earnings, but investors remain concerned about the competitive threat posed by AI chatbots to Google's core search business. During the quarter, Google launched several new AI products, including a premium subscription tier and a venture fund for AI startups. The report will also provide updates on YouTube's ad revenue, Google Cloud's growth, and the progress of its self-driving car unit, Waymo. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued a landmark advisory opinion stating that countries have a legal obligation to protect people from climate change, effectively establishing a healthy environment as a human right. This non-binding ruling empowers nations, especially those most vulnerable to climate impacts, to potentially sue other countries over their contributions to global warming, including historical emissions. The case was initiated by a group of law students from Pacific island nations. The court's decision clarifies that existing international laws require all states to protect the climate system for present and future generations.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Real estate experts are skeptical that eliminating the capital gains tax on home sales, a proposal floated by President Trump, would significantly resolve the nation's housing market issues. While the National Association of Realtors argues the tax discourages some homeowners, particularly retirees, from selling, analysts believe the primary problem is a lack of confidence and stability. The current tax exemption is $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for couples, meaning it primarily affects those in high-cost areas or who have owned their homes for decades. Critics suggest that addressing broader economic uncertainty is more crucial to unlocking the housing market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German cabinet has approved a new law designed to accelerate the procurement of weapons and equipment for its military, the Bundeswehr. Defense Minister Boris Pistorius described the measure as a "quantum leap" for national security, aimed at cutting bureaucratic red tape in response to the perceived threat from Russia. The legislation will raise value limits for direct contract awards, allowing for faster purchases without lengthy tender processes. The move is part of Germany's broader effort to bolster its defense capabilities and meet NATO spending targets, though it has drawn criticism from opposition parties over concerns about potential waste and corruption.</p>

The pilot program, launching next month in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Detroit, aims to provide more choice and comfort on the platform. Women riders can set a preference in the app, and women drivers can opt to only accept rides from women.

          <p>Ozzy Osbourne, the iconic frontman of Black Sabbath who helped define the sound of heavy metal, has died at the age of 76. Known as the "Prince of Darkness," Osbourne's powerful vocals and on-stage antics were legendary, but he later revealed a softer, more human side as the bumbling patriarch in the reality show "The Osbournes." His music often explored themes of war, confusion, and addiction, reflecting his own public struggles with substance abuse. Despite his chaotic persona, he became a beloved rock elder statesman, leaving behind a monumental legacy that influenced generations of musicians.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned a Marks & Spencer (M&S) advertisement after ruling that the model featured in it appeared "unhealthily thin." The watchdog determined that the model's pose, combined with clothing choices like large, pointed shoes, irresponsibly emphasized her slenderness. The ASA ordered that the ad must not appear again in its current form. M&S has stopped using the image but defended its practices, stating it responsibly promotes its inclusive clothing range and ensures all models are in good health and comply with industry standards.</p>

          <p>Tom Hayes and Carlo Palombo, two former traders jailed in the Libor interest rate-rigging scandal, have had their convictions overturned by the UK Supreme Court. The court ruled that their original trials were unfair due to flawed jury directions, making the convictions unsafe. The two men, who spent years in prison, have long maintained they were wrongly prosecuted for what were normal commercial practices to appease public anger after the 2008 financial crisis. The ruling is a major vindication for the traders and could lead to other convictions in the scandal being quashed.</p>

          <p>Toymaker Hasbro reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, largely due to the strength of its digital gaming division. Revenue from its Wizards of the Coast and digital gaming segment, which includes popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!, grew 16% year-over-year. This performance helped offset a 16% decline in its traditional consumer products segment, which has been negatively impacted by tariffs and retailer order timing. Despite the positive results, the company reported a significant net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment charge. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence system, named Aeneas, designed to help historians analyze ancient Roman inscriptions. The tool can fill in missing words from degraded texts, as well as estimate their date and geographical origin, by drawing on a vast database of 176,000 known inscriptions. While AI is not intended to replace human experts, it can accelerate the painstaking process of piecing together historical texts by rapidly identifying relevant parallels. Historians who tested the system found it not only improved accuracy and speed but also uncovered connections they had not previously considered.</p>
