          <p>Australia has raised concerns with the United States government after an Australian journalist was seemingly targeted and shot with a rubber bullet while covering protests against immigration raids in Los Angeles. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese stated that such incidents are unacceptable and confirmed he spoke with the reporter, Lauren Tomasi. Tomasi, who works for Australia's Nine News, reported that she was "a bit sore" but otherwise well and emphasized the importance of continuing to report on significant stories. The incident occurred amidst ongoing demonstrations and heightened tensions in Los Angeles following immigration enforcement operations.</p>

Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced rates due to the U.S.'s consistent refusal to eliminate them.

          <p>The Japanese government plans to release another 200,000 tons of rice from its stockpiles through direct contracts with retailers in an effort to lower the elevated prices of rice. This release includes 100,000 tons each from the 2020 and 2021 harvests, expected to be sold at 1,700 yen per 5 kilograms. The move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from 910,000 tons before the government started releasing stocks earlier this year. Farm minister Shinjiro Koizumi aims to quickly deliver the stockpiled rice to consumers at lower prices, targeting smaller supermarkets and specialty shops as well as major retailers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Drug overdose deaths among young Americans have significantly decreased, particularly due to the reduction in fentanyl-related fatalities. Data from the CDC shows a massive reduction in fatal overdose risk among Gen Z, with ages 20 to 29 experiencing a 47% decrease in overdose deaths. Experts attribute this trend to factors such as wider distribution of Narcan, weaker fentanyl potency, increased access to addiction healthcare, and a shift towards less risky drug and alcohol use among teens. However, some clusters of young people, particularly those born between 2005 and 2011, have seen a slight increase in deaths, indicating the need for further research and targeted interventions.
