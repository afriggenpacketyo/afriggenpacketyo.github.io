          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first win as the head coach of the University of North Carolina's football team, defeating Charlotte 20-3. The victory comes after an embarrassing debut loss to TCU the previous week. Following the game, Belichick also confirmed reports that he had banned a scout from his former team, the New England Patriots, from attending UNC practices. He stated bluntly that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, their personnel are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship with his former employer of nearly 25 years.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, the creator of the online marketplace Vinted, developed the idea for the company out of a personal problem: having too many clothes to fit into her new apartment. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, created a simple website for her to sell her unwanted items, which quickly gained popularity through word of mouth. The platform expanded from Lithuania to Germany and eventually grew into the global app known as Vinted, which now has over 16 million users in the UK alone. In 2019, the company became Lithuania's first "unicorn," a startup valued at over a billion dollars.</p>

          <h2>Analysis of Powerball Data Reveals Best and Worst States for Winners Based on Taxes</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Powerball jackpot reaching historic highs, an analysis of lottery data highlights how a winner's location can significantly impact their take-home prize due to state taxes. While federal taxes claim about 37% of winnings, some states impose their own income tax, which can exceed 10%, while others have no tax on lottery prizes. States like California, Florida, and Texas are among the most favorable for winners, as they do not tax lottery income. In contrast, a winner in New York would receive the lowest payout after all taxes are deducted, demonstrating a vast difference in after-tax prize money across the country.

          <p>The South Korean government has announced a deal with the United States to release and repatriate more than 300 of its citizens who were detained during a major immigration raid at a Hyundai plant in Georgia. U.S. immigration authorities detained 475 people in the operation, which targeted a battery manufacturing facility still under construction. The raid is part of the Trump administration's broader crackdown on immigration, but this instance is notable for targeting a major economic development project involving a key U.S. ally. South Korea had expressed "concern and regret" over the raid and plans to send a charter plane to bring the workers home.</p>

          <p>Two winning tickets, sold in Missouri and Texas, have split the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest prize in the game's history. The winning numbers drawn on Saturday night were 11, 23, 44, 61, 62, with a Powerball of 17. The massive prize had accumulated over 42 consecutive drawings since the last jackpot was won in May, setting a new record for the longest run without a winner. The winners will have the option to receive their share of the prize as an annuity paid over 29 years or as a lump-sum cash payment of approximately $413.2 million each before taxes.</p>

          <p>Known as the "silent killer," hypertension affects over half of Americans by age 40, often without symptoms, significantly increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, and dementia. New recommendations from the American Heart Association advocate for earlier intervention, including lifestyle changes and medication, once blood pressure exceeds 130/80 mm Hg. Experts stress that early treatment can add years of healthy life by protecting small blood vessels in the brain and reducing cardiovascular strain. Lifestyle strategies like a low-sodium diet, exercise, and stress reduction are the first line of defense, with medication recommended for those with persistently high readings.</p>

          <h2>The Proliferation of Surveillance Technology Raises Ethical Questions About Animal Privacy</h2>

          <p>As surveillance technology like drones, camera traps, and environmental DNA sensors becomes ubiquitous, humans are gaining an unprecedented, real-time view of the animal kingdom, raising new ethical questions. While this monitoring aids conservation, it also intrudes upon animals' lives, potentially causing stress, altering behavior, or even leading to harm. Philosophers are now debating whether animals have a right to privacy, pointing to behaviors that suggest a preference for seclusion, such as avoiding cameras or seeking private spaces for mating. The constant observation of animals, particularly pets and those in zoos, forces a reconsideration of the boundaries and respect owed to non-human creatures.</p>

          <h2>Utah Judge Strikes Down Partisan Congressional Map, Citing Violation of Voter-Approved Commission</h2>

          <p>A Utah judge has invalidated the state's Republican-drawn congressional map, ruling that the GOP-controlled legislature unconstitutionally overrode the will of the voters. In 2018, Utah citizens approved a proposition to create an independent redistricting commission, but lawmakers ignored its work and passed their own heavily gerrymandered map in 2021. This map effectively diluted the votes of the Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County by splitting it among four different districts. The ruling is a significant victory for anti-gerrymandering advocates and a rare pushback against the trend of state legislatures ignoring voter-led initiatives to pursue partisan advantages in redistricting.</p>
