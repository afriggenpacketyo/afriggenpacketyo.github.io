          <p>Shares of generator maker Generac are experiencing their best week since last November, driven by increased demand due to a major heat wave across the U.S. and forecasts for an active Atlantic hurricane season. These extreme weather events are placing significant strain on the nation's aging power grid, leading to power outages and boosting investor confidence in companies providing backup power solutions.

This flexibility suggests that countries engaged in good-faith trade negotiations with the U.S. might avoid the tariffs snapping back.

Potential rate drops could be influenced by the June inflation report on July 15 and the outcomes of Federal Reserve meetings on July 29 and September 17. While a July rate cut is now less certain, economists widely anticipate a reduction at the September meeting. Because HELOC rates are variable, any cut to the federal funds rate would likely lead to lower monthly payments for borrowers. (not investment advice)</p>

Mamdani, 33, defeated former Governor Andrew Cuomo, 67, on a platform of affordability, including free child care and rent freezes. His win is seen by some as a victory for the party's progressive wing and a call for a new generation of leadership. However, it has also drawn concern from moderate Democrats and attacks from Republicans, highlighting the party's ongoing struggle to unify its diverse factions.</p>
