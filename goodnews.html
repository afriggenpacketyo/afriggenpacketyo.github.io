          <p>Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers is already establishing a standard of leadership and team protection during training camp. Following an incident where a fellow quarterback was knocked down, Rodgers admonished the offensive line, instructing them to act as "policemen" on the field and protect their teammates at all costs. He stressed that this protective mentality applies to everyone, from star players to backups, in any practice or game situation. Rodgers noted a positive change in the line's response to a subsequent incident, seeing it as a sign that his message about unity and mutual support was successfully received by the team.</p>

          <p>Roborock, a leading Chinese robot vacuum manufacturer, plans to significantly reduce the price of its high-end household cleaning robots to make them accessible to the mass market. The company's president, Quan Gang, predicts that its latest model featuring an AI-powered robotic arm, currently priced at around $2,600, could eventually sell for just a few hundred dollars. This strategy aims to increase the low household penetration rate of robotic vacuums, especially in key markets like China and the U.S. The company is heavily investing in AI research and development to improve its algorithms, viewing this as the key to both cost reduction and future integration into broader humanoid robot applications.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 9-5 victory over the Colorado Rockies, salvaging a four-game series split and maintaining their one-game lead in the division. The offense was led by a two-run homer from Freddie Freeman in the first inning and strong performances from Mookie Betts and Alex Freeland, who had three hits. Starting pitcher Clayton Kershaw earned his eighth win, allowing three runs over 5.2 innings before the bullpen closed out the game. The win provides crucial momentum as the Dodgers head to San Diego for a pivotal weekend series against the second-place Padres, with the division lead on the line.</p>

          <p>China is amending its 1998 pricing law to address the issue of "involution," a term for destructive internal competition characterized by aggressive price wars. The revision, currently open for public feedback, aims to create a more stable market equilibrium and combat practices like selling products at a loss to gain market share. Industries such as the photovoltaic sector, which has suffered from severe overcapacity and cutthroat pricing, have already seen a rebound in prices following calls from authorities to rein in such competition. The move reflects a broader effort by Beijing to regulate market behavior and ensure more sustainable economic development across various sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Crystal Palace achieved a historic 1-0 victory over Fredrikstad in the Uefa Conference League, marking the club's first-ever win in a European competition. The celebratory atmosphere was bittersweet, however, as the team's star midfielder, Eberechi Eze, was absent from the squad ahead of an expected transfer to Arsenal. Manager Oliver Glasner confirmed Eze's departure post-match, expressing frustration that a replacement was not secured earlier. Despite losing their talisman, the victory represents a significant milestone for the club, which also won the FA Cup and Community Shield earlier in the year, as they embark on their first major European campaign in nearly three decades.</p>

          <p>Enterprise software company Workday reported second-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations, but its stock slipped after issuing guidance that was merely in line with estimates. The company warned of challenges in its state and local government sector, citing uncertainty around a potential slowdown in funding. CEO Carl Eschenbach also noted pressure on higher education clients, particularly those with healthcare systems, due to funding pullbacks and President Trump's executive order to shut down the Department of Education. Despite these headwinds, Workday raised its full-year subscription revenue forecast slightly and announced the acquisition of AI recruiting software company Paradox. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, a Category 2 storm, has begun moving northeastward into the Atlantic, away from the North Carolina coast. While the storm is not expected to make landfall in the U.S., it brought tropical storm conditions and dangerous coastal conditions to the Outer Banks, prompting some evacuations. The National Hurricane Center continues to warn of life-threatening surf and rip currents along most of the U.S. East Coast for the next several days. A tropical storm warning remains in effect for parts of the North Carolina and Virginia coastlines, as well as for Bermuda, as the large storm system continues its path across the western Atlantic.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A financial strategy known as a 351 conversion is gaining traction among wealthy investors as a way to defer capital gains taxes on highly appreciated assets. The method involves exchanging a diversified portfolio of stocks for shares in a new exchange-traded fund (ETF) before it launches, which is a tax-free event. This allows investors to effectively transform their appreciated holdings into a more liquid ETF without triggering an immediate tax bill. However, the strategy has strict diversification requirements and can be complex, as investors must be content with holding the new ETF, as selling it would incur the deferred capital gains.
