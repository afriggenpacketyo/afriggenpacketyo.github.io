          <p>Former FBI Director James Comey met with U.S. Secret Service officials in Washington, D.C., for an interview regarding his controversial "86 47" social media post. The post, which showed seashells arranged to read "86 47," was interpreted by some as a call to remove President Trump, the 47th president. Comey is under investigation for the post, which he later deleted, claiming he was unaware of its violent interpretation. The U.S. Secret Service is leading the investigation, with potential for involvement from the FBI and Department of Justice.</p>

          <p>A new CDC study estimates that hundreds of lives could be saved annually through increased use of life jackets and better pool fencing. The modeling found that 51 drowning deaths could be prevented with better pool fencing and 297 with life jackets during boating accidents. This could save thousands of dollars in medical spending and reduce the economic cost to the country by $4.5 billion. The study was one of the last produced by the agency's injury prevention experts before layoffs eliminated teams responsible for drowning prevention, sexual assault prevention, and traumatic brain injury research.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man, Eric Council Jr., was sentenced to 14 months in prison for his involvement in the January 2024 hack of the Securities and Exchange Commission's social media account. The account was used to falsely announce the approval of bitcoin ETFs, causing a temporary spike in the cryptocurrency's price. Council executed a SIM swap attack, obtaining control of a phone number linked to the SEC's account. Prosecutors cited a video where Council diminished his culpability and blamed the SEC's cybersecurity practices.</p>

          <p>Consumer Reports found that Kroger is overcharging customers for items marked as being on sale. The investigation, prompted by allegations from Kroger employees, revealed price tag errors leading to customers paying more than advertised. Expired discount tags were found on various products, with an average overcharge of $1.70 per item. While Kroger disputes the findings, similar allegations have been made against other retailers. The article also notes that understaffing could contribute to pricing errors, as stores struggle to manually update price labels.</p>

          <p>Crime rates are down significantly since 2020, with 2024 likely setting a record for the steepest fall in the murder rate, and 2025 showing further reductions in murder, violent crime, and property crime. Despite this positive trend, challenges in reporting and understanding the drivers of crime persist, with scholars disagreeing on the causes of past crime declines. The article notes that President Trump's policies could slow or reverse these positive trends, particularly through cuts to violence prevention programs and economic policies that may lead to recession.</p>
