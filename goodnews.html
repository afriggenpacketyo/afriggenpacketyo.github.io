        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As AI usage increases, researchers are uncovering more instances of potentially harmful responses, including hate speech and copyright infringements. This issue is exacerbated by a lack of regulations and insufficient testing of AI models. Researchers advocate for practices like red teaming, where AI systems are probed to identify potential harms, and for standardized 'AI flaw' reports. They also suggest involving third parties, such as users and journalists, in the testing process to ensure a more robust evaluation of AI systems and their potential risks.</p>

          <p>The number of Turkish citizens obtaining German citizenship has doubled in 2024, driven by political repression, economic instability in Turkey, and Germany's citizenship reforms allowing dual citizenship. Many Turks seek German citizenship for practical reasons like reduced bureaucracy and visa-free travel, as well as the ability to participate politically. While Germany has become increasingly attractive, many Turks still maintain strong ties to their culture and consider Turkey their home. Despite dual citizenship, some Turkish-Germans still experience discrimination and feel they are not fully accepted in German society.</p>

He and Richard Hill, both in their 80s, participated in Muscatine High's graduation ceremony as part of Operation Recognition, a program honoring veterans. Snyder shared that he felt "like a million dollars" when he received his diploma, which he dedicates to friends who did not return from the war.</p>
