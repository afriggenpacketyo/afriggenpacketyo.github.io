          <p>Older actors are increasingly demonstrating their enduring star power, leading successful projects and challenging ageist norms in Hollywood. Recent examples include the Netflix film "The Thursday Murder Club," starring Helen Mirren and Ben Kingsley, and the popular Hulu series "Only Murders in the Building," led by Steve Martin and Martin Short. These productions highlight a trend where seasoned performers not only draw large audiences but also bring depth and experience to their roles. Many of these actors have spoken about embracing their age and the wisdom that comes with it.</p>

The accession is expected to foster greater economic integration and political stability for the young nation, which gained independence in 2002. While membership offers new opportunities for trade and investment, there are internal concerns about whether the benefits will translate into job creation for its youthful population.

          <p>President Trump is set to announce an agreement with Pfizer aimed at voluntarily reducing the cost of its medications for Medicaid recipients. The deal reportedly includes discounted drug prices and a three-year pause on potential pharmaceutical tariffs, contingent on Pfizer building manufacturing facilities within the United States. This move is part of the administration's broader effort to align U.S. drug prices more closely with the lower costs found in other countries. The announcement follows a deadline Trump gave to Pfizer and other drugmakers to take action on lowering prices.</p>

          <p>During the first hometown event for her new book, "107 Days," former Vice President Kamala Harris defended her unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign. She framed the election as unprecedented, noting she had only 107 days to run against a former president after the incumbent decided not to seek reelection. Harris also criticized the Biden administration's priorities, stating she would have focused on economic issues like affordable childcare first. She lamented what she called the "capitulation" of major institutions, such as universities and law firms, to the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Experts confirm that the 74 million Americans receiving Social Security benefits will continue to get their monthly checks even if the federal government shuts down on October 1. Because the program is funded through mandatory spending, payments are not subject to the annual appropriations impasse. However, the Social Security Administration's operational budget is affected, meaning many customer service functions could be disrupted. According to the agency's contingency plan, services such as benefit verifications, earnings record corrections, and replacing Medicare cards would be halted during a shutdown.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve considers another interest rate cut in October, financial experts are weighing the potential effects on mortgage rates. While a Fed cut often leads to lower borrowing costs, many analysts believe the market has already anticipated and priced in a 0.25% reduction. Consequently, the immediate impact on mortgage rates may be less significant than some borrowers hope. Experts note that mortgage rates are more directly influenced by the 10-year Treasury yield and broader economic data, which could cause rates to shift even before the Fed's official announcement.

          <p>After nearly three decades in power, Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodik has resigned from all official roles in Republika Srpska, the Serb-majority entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. His departure marks a capitulation after a months-long standoff with the state judiciary, which convicted him and barred him from holding political office for six years for flouting the decisions of the international High Representative. Dodik's withdrawal ends a period of intense political crisis during which he repeatedly threatened secession, and it now clears the way for an early presidential election in November.</p>
