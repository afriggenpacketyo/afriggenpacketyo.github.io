        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Canadian government has rescinded its planned digital services tax, which would have primarily affected American technology companies. This decision came after U.S. President Donald Trump announced a termination of all trade discussions with Canada in response to the tax proposal. Following the reversal, both nations have agreed to resume negotiations with the goal of reaching a new comprehensive trade arrangement by late July 2025. The move is aimed at de-escalating the trade dispute and fostering a mutually beneficial economic partnership.</p>

          <h2>Research Suggests Electric Vehicles Are More Likely to Induce Motion Sickness</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-29 22:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent studies indicate that passengers in electric vehicles (EVs) are more prone to experiencing motion sickness compared to those in traditional combustion engine cars. Researchers attribute this phenomenon to the unique acceleration and deceleration characteristics of EVs. Specifically, the regenerative braking systems, which convert kinetic energy back into battery power, can cause low-frequency deceleration that provokes feelings of queasiness. As EVs become more prevalent, this issue presents a new challenge for automotive engineering and passenger comfort.</p>

          <p>China has officially lifted its comprehensive ban on Japanese seafood imports, which was imposed in August 2023. The ban was a response to Japan's release of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. The decision to resume imports follows an agreement reached in May between the two nations to resolve the trade dispute. While the ban is lifted, it may take a few months for procedural steps to be completed before shipments from Japan to China fully resume.</p>

          <p>According to preliminary government data, Japan's industrial output saw a modest increase of 0.5 percent in May compared to the previous month. The seasonally adjusted index of production at factories and mines reached 101.8, using 2020 as a base of 100. This data, released by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, provides a small but positive signal for the country's industrial sector. The slight uptick suggests some resilience amid broader economic uncertainties facing the nation and the global market. (not investment advice)</p>
