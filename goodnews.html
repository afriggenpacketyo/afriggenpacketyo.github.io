          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions between China and the United States, Chinese companies are actively pursuing global expansion, with the US remaining a significant market. Camera company Insta360, for instance, recently raised a substantial amount in a Shanghai listing, citing the US as a key market alongside Europe and mainland China. This trend reflects a broader strategy among Chinese firms to build international brands and establish a global presence, driven by slowing growth in the domestic market. Companies are adapting by investing in user-centric research and development and monitoring market trends to meet consumer needs. </p>

          <p>China is entering the race to mass-produce high-performance photonic chips, which could lead to significant advancements in artificial intelligence, 6G, and quantum computing. Shanghai Jiao Tong University Chip Hub for Integrated Photonics Xplore (CHIPX) has announced the production of 6-inch wafers for thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) photonic chips. While Europe and the US are already established in the field, China's pilot production line is showing promise in terms of technical performance. The new TFLN material offers ultra-fast electro-optic effects, high bandwidth, and low power consumption, potentially overcoming existing limitations in high-speed optical links. </p>

          <p>South Korea's military has ceased its loudspeaker broadcasts of anti-North Korea propaganda along the inter-Korean border, marking a step toward easing tensions between the two countries. The decision, ordered by President Lee Jae-myung, is intended to restore trust and promote peace on the Korean Peninsula. The broadcasts were resumed last year in response to North Korea's campaign of sending trash-laden balloons into South Korea. This move aligns with President Lee's vow to improve relations with Pyongyang, which had reacted negatively to the hard-line policies of his predecessor. </p>
