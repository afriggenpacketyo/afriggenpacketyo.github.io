          <p>While overall inflation remains above target levels, certain sectors of the U.S. economy are experiencing deflation, with prices falling for airfare, produce, household goods, electronics, and gasoline. Economists attribute these declines to idiosyncratic factors and supply-and-demand dynamics, but caution that these lower prices may not persist due to market volatility and potential tariffs. Consumers are advised to take advantage of current price drops, as economists predict these prices are not here to stay for very long, likely reversing within weeks or months.

          <p>The 2025 Met Gala, raising a record $31 million, officially opened the Costume Institute's exhibition ‚ÄúSuperfine: Tailoring Black Style,‚Äù examining 300 years of Black fashion and the history of Black dandyism. Despite the celebration, the event takes place amidst a complex political landscape where diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives face federal scrutiny. The exhibition is a brainchild of Andrew Bolton, and while the event showcased daring and memorable looks from Black designers, stylists, and celebrities, the article notes the fashion world's slow progress in fulfilling DEI promises. The gala's co-chairs included Pharrell Williams, ASAP Rocky, Lewis Hamilton, and Colman Domingo.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that disputed ballots in the 2024 race for a North Carolina Supreme Court seat must remain in the final count, effectively securing an electoral victory for Democratic incumbent Allison Riggs. Judge Richard Myers found that removing ballots six months after election day would violate the due process and equal protection rights of affected residents. He ordered the state board of elections to certify Riggs' victory over Republican challenger Jefferson Griffin, who had sought to remove ballots he claimed were unlawfully cast. The judge delayed his decision for seven days to allow Griffin to appeal.</p>
