          <h2>Astronomers Detect Largest-Ever Black Hole Merger, Challenging Existing Models</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 10:18:46 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Scientists have detected the most massive merger of two black holes ever observed, resulting in a new black hole approximately 225 times the mass of the sun. The discovery, made by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, pushes the boundaries of current astrophysical models for black hole formation. One of the merging black holes was about 137 times the sun's mass, a size previously thought to be impossible through stellar collapse alone, suggesting it may have formed from earlier mergers. The event, named GW231123, also revealed the black holes were spinning near the maximum speed allowed by general relativity, presenting new challenges and research opportunities for astronomers.</p>

          <h2>MP Materials Stock Surges Following $500 Million Rare Earth Magnet Deal with Apple</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-15 10:12:34 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of MP Materials jumped 17% after the company announced a $500 million agreement with Apple to supply rare earth magnets and develop a recycling facility. This deal aims to strengthen Apple's U.S. supply chain for these critical components, which are essential for products like smartphones and computers. As part of the partnership, MP Materials will provide magnets from its Texas facility and collaborate on a new recycling line in California, with shipments starting in 2027. The move aligns with U.S. efforts to reduce reliance on China, which currently dominates the global rare earth market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A bipartisan group of senators is pushing to reauthorize funding for the Farm and Ranch Assistance Network, a critical mental health resource for agricultural workers. The proposed Farmers First Act of 2025, introduced by Senators Tammy Baldwin and Joni Ernst, would allocate $15 million annually for five years to the program. This funding supports a network of regional hubs that provide stress assistance and connect farmers with mental health services, addressing a crisis where farmers face a suicide rate 3.5 times higher than the general population. The initiative aims to enhance access to care by funding specialists, crisis lines, and healthcare partnerships.</p>

          <p>Alibaba is reportedly planning to launch a new promotional event called 'Super Saturdays' as competition in China's on-demand delivery sector escalates. This move is seen as a response to aggressive campaigns from rivals like Meituan, which has offered free milk tea, and JD.com, which is promoting discounted crayfish. While specific details of Alibaba's program have not been confirmed, the initiative reflects a broader price war among tech giants vying for market share. China's instant commerce market is a significant prize, with forecasts projecting it will exceed $279 billion in sales by 2030.</p>

This natural dye, known as gardenia blue, is approved for use in various products, including sports drinks, candies, and flavored waters. The approval marks another step in the administration's effort to expand the use of natural colorants in the U.S. food supply, following a call from Health Secretary Robert F.

The additive is created by reacting a compound from the gardenia fruit with soy protein, though the FDA is still reviewing an allergen exemption request.</p>

Her high finishes have already secured her playing privileges on both the LPGA Tour and the Ladies European Tour.
