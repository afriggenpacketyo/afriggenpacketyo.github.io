          <p>The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), a nonpartisan agency, is facing criticism from Republicans after projecting that their legislation would increase federal deficits by $2.4 trillion over a decade. Established in 1974 to provide Congress with objective budgetary information, the CBO acts as a counterbalance to the executive branch's Office of Management and Budget. The CBO calculates how much bills would increase or decrease revenues and spending, providing advisory cost estimates without policy recommendations, though its work is often difficult due to the complexities of economic forecasting.</p>
