          <p>While India excels in cricket, producing young talents like 14-year-old Vaibhav Suryavanshi, its football team struggles, even recalling a 40-year-old from retirement. Cricket benefits from plentiful role models, a well-structured system, and lucrative domestic leagues like the IPL. In contrast, football lacks a clear pathway for young players, suffers from weaker domestic leagues, and lacks financial resources for player development. Experts suggest focusing on grassroots development, creating a football culture, and increasing investment to improve India's performance in the sport, highlighting the disparities between the two sports in the country.</p>
