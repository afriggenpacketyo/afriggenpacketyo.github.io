          <p>At the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) summit in Tianjin, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi have pledged to foster a relationship of partnership rather than rivalry. This meeting marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years and signals a thaw in relations following years of tension, including a deadly border dispute in 2020. Both leaders emphasized a long-term strategic perspective, with Modi noting an 'atmosphere of peace and stability' and announcing the future resumption of direct flights. The summit, also attended by Russia's Vladimir Putin, is seen as a forum for member states to address shared interests amid ongoing trade disputes with the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A global surge in demand for matcha, driven by its reputation as a superfood and a post-pandemic tourism boom in Japan, is causing significant supply shortages and price hikes. Japanese green tea exports have quadrupled over the last decade, with tencha, the tea used for matcha, seeing its price jump 170% this year. The strain is felt by Japan's aging farming communities, prompting the government to consider subsidies to boost production. Retailers in Japan are now rationing supplies and reporting that prices for the green powder have doubled, while major distributors like Ito En are struggling to secure enough raw material and milling capacity to meet the intense demand.

          <p>Lucy Guo, recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire at age 30, attributes her entrepreneurial drive to a frugal upbringing that motivated her to start making money as a child. Before co-founding Scale AI, which was acquired by Meta in a $25 billion deal, Guo's ventures began on the elementary school playground, where she would trade and sell Pokémon cards and colored pencils. Her hustles evolved to selling virtual items in the online game Neopets and later creating and selling bots for video games. Guo, who dropped out of Carnegie Mellon University to accept a Thiel Fellowship, says her passion for video games naturally led her to computer science and her eventual success in the tech industry.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New figures from England's Department for Education suggest that school attendance during the first week of term is a strong predictor of future absenteeism. According to the data, 57% of pupils who missed some school in the first week of September 2024 went on to become 'persistently absent,' meaning they missed at least 10% of the school year. This contrasts sharply with the 14% of pupils who had full attendance in the first week and later became persistently absent. Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson has urged schools and parents to 'double down' on efforts to ensure children are present from the start of the new term to combat absence levels that remain higher than before the pandemic.</p>

The 32-year-old, who helped lead the Lionesses to a World Cup final, realized after a grueling season that she needed a break and could not give '100% mentally or physically.' Bright revealed she had been ignoring ongoing issues and putting out 'little fires' all season, leaving her feeling drained and unhappy. After taking the summer off for knee surgery and counseling, she now feels 'back to life' and is in a much better place mentally and physically for the new season.</p>

          <p>Leaders from across the region, including India's Narendra Modi and Russia's Vladimir Putin, have arrived in Tianjin, China, for the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit. The meeting provides a platform for Beijing to strengthen regional cooperation as it faces ongoing trade and security tensions with the United States. Founded in 2001 by China and Russia, the SCO is viewed by Beijing as an alternative to Western-led alliances and a forum for economic and security collaboration. This year's summit is particularly significant as it marks Modi's first visit to China in seven years, signaling a potential reset in relations between the two Asian powers.</p>

          <p>Germany is marking the 10-year anniversary of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's famous declaration 'wir schaffen das' ('we can do it'), which opened the country's borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees in 2015. A decade later, the nation is grappling with the profound social and political consequences of this policy. While data shows that nearly two-thirds of refugees from that wave were employed by 2022, challenges remain, with migrants facing higher unemployment rates. The current conservative Chancellor, Friedrich Merz, has distanced himself from Merkel's approach, making immigration control a key pillar of his platform and asserting that Germany has 'clearly not' managed the integration challenge.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an innovative experiment, biologists are using drones to protect livestock from gray wolves along the California-Oregon border. The drones are equipped with loudspeakers that blast sounds like AC/DC's 'Thunderstruck,' clips from movies, and live human voices to haze the predators and interrupt their hunts. This creative, nonlethal method is part of an effort to foster coexistence as wolf populations recover in the U.S. West, which has led to increased conflict with ranchers. While the high cost of the technology is a drawback, initial patrols have reportedly been successful in reducing livestock deaths by frightening the wolves with novel sounds.</p>

          <p>British Formula 1 fan Brandon Burgess is undertaking an ambitious challenge to attend every one of the 24 Grand Prix races this season on a budget of just £20,000. The 29-year-old is documenting his journey across five continents, aiming to prove that enjoying the sport is possible without immense wealth. To manage costs, he is staying in hostels, varying the number of days he attends each event, and strategically planning his travel around back-to-back races. Burgess is funding the trip with his savings and is completing the challenge while using only the 28 days of annual leave from his full-time job in London.</p>

          <p>Recent high tariffs imposed by the U.S. on Indian goods are creating a new incentive for India and China to repair their strained relationship. With both nations facing economic pressure from Washington, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to China for the SCO summit is seen as a potential turning point. The economic fallout from their 2020 border clash, which halted flights and investments, has been damaging for both sides. Experts suggest that while deep-seated mistrust remains, there is a strong case for economic cooperation, particularly in manufacturing and gaining market access, as both powers seek to diversify from their dependence on the United States.</p>

          <p>Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime has advanced to the fourth round of the US Open after a stunning comeback victory over world No. 3 Alexander Zverev. After dropping the first set, the 25th seed rallied to win the nearly four-hour match 4-6, 7-6 (7), 6-4, 6-4, securing his first Grand Slam victory over a top-five opponent. The result marks a significant return to form for Auger-Aliassime, who has struggled with injuries and inconsistent results in recent seasons. For Zverev, the title contender's loss represents his earliest exit from the US Open since 2018, continuing a difficult summer hard-court season.</p>

          <p>Tron founder Justin Sun has stated his ambition for his blockchain network to become the equivalent of the Swift system for the virtual asset sector, predicting it will surpass the traditional financial messaging service in transaction volume within five years. Sun highlighted that Tron already facilitates transactions in seconds compared to Swift's days-long process and is expected to handle $8 trillion this year. He expressed confidence that Tron's volume could eventually grow to be 100 times larger than Swift's, capitalizing on the growing influence of stablecoins. Sun also praised Hong Kong's recent progress in establishing a clear regulatory framework for the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>
