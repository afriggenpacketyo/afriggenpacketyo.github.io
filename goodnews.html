          <p>Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed a bill into law establishing a $1 billion school voucher program, a significant victory for school choice advocates. The program will provide families with up to $10,000 per year to cover private school tuition or homeschooling expenses, with increased amounts for children with disabilities. Supporters argue it will expand educational options for students in underperforming public schools, while critics contend it will drain resources from public education and benefit wealthier families. The program is capped at $1 billion for the first year and could potentially cost up to $4.5 billion annually by 2030.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The European Court of Justice has outlawed the last 'golden passport' program in the EU, specifically Malta's scheme, deeming it a 'mere commercial transaction' that undermines the solidarity and mutual trust between member states. This decision, celebrated by anti-corruption activists, highlights concerns that such programs create security risks and facilitate money laundering and tax evasion. While Malta's Prime Minister has pledged to rework the system, the ruling raises questions about the future of 'golden visa' programs, which offer residency permits in exchange for investment, and whether they will face similar scrutiny.</p>

While some political parties support introducing the option of separate surnames, conservative members of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party oppose the change, citing concerns about traditional family values.</p>
