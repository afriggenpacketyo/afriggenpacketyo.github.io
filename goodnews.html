Donald became only the second European captain to win back-to-back tournaments, prompting chants of "Two more years!" from players and fans. While humbled by the support, Donald stated he would not rush into a decision, wanting to first savor the recent win. The victory was notable for occurring amid hostile crowd behavior, which Donald acknowledged needs to be addressed for future events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>OpenAI has launched a new "Instant Checkout" feature for its ChatGPT chatbot, allowing U.S. users to purchase items directly within the platform. The initial rollout supports U.S. Etsy sellers, with over a million Shopify merchants slated to join soon, causing stock prices for both e-commerce companies to rise significantly. This move into e-commerce represents a new revenue stream for OpenAI, which will collect a fee from transactions processed through the chatbot. The underlying technology, developed with Stripe, aims to streamline the shopping process for ChatGPT's vast user base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage rates have fallen to a three-year low, presenting a potential opportunity for homebuyers who have been waiting for a more favorable market. The average 30-year rate is currently around 6.30%, significantly lower than the 7%-plus rates seen earlier in the year. However, market volatility and economic factors like inflation could cause rates to spike again unexpectedly. While the Federal Reserve is anticipated to cut rates again in late October, the fall season typically sees lower housing inventory, creating a complex decision for potential buyers weighing affordability against availability.

          <p>OpenAI is rolling out new safeguards for ChatGPT users identified as being under the age of 18, directing them to a version with more restrictive, age-appropriate content policies. These measures include blocking sexual content and, in severe cases, alerting law enforcement to ensure user safety. The company is also introducing parental controls that allow parents to link accounts, manage chat history, and set usage time limits. This announcement follows an FTC probe into the potential negative effects of AI chatbots on teens and a lawsuit from the family of a teenager who died by suicide.</p>

          <p>Brandon Stanton, the creator of the popular photography project "Humans of New York," has revealed his past struggles with drug addiction and failure that ultimately led to his life's work. After flunking out of college and battling an Adderall addiction, Stanton hit rock bottom before finding a job in finance, which he later lost. This setback prompted him to pursue photography, leading to the creation of his project to photograph 10,000 New Yorkers. The project has since gained millions of followers and raised $20 million for various causes, which Stanton views as a spiritual calling to connect people.</p>

          <p>A $1.6 billion merger has been proposed between Compass and Anywhere, the two largest real estate brokerage firms in the United States. The deal would create a massive 340,000-agent network, combining Compass's regional strength with Anywhere's national brands like Century 21 and Coldwell Banker. While the companies state the merger will deliver more value to consumers, some industry observers worry it will increase pressure on smaller, independent brokerages. The consolidation comes as the housing market is softening, and it reflects a broader trend of larger firms gaining market share through acquisitions. (not investment advice)</p>
