          <p>Coca-Cola is set to release its second-quarter earnings, with Wall Street analysts watching closely to see how it performs against a particularly strong equivalent period last year. The company previously cautioned that it would face challenging comparisons and potential short-term volatility related to trade tariffs. Despite these headwinds, analysts remain optimistic due to Coke's significant pricing power and extensive global reach. The report will also be viewed in the context of rival PepsiCo's recent results, which showed a decline in beverage volume in North America, suggesting shifting consumer behavior in response to price increases across the sector.

          <p>China's military has showcased a wide array of advanced drone and counter-drone technologies in a large-scale exercise in Inner Mongolia, simulating the seizure of critical border locations. The drill, broadcast on state television, involved multiple phases including reconnaissance, AI-driven planning, and aerial attacks using domestically produced systems. A notable part of the exercise was a live-fire demonstration of the OW-5A50 anti-drone laser weapon, which successfully shot down a target from several kilometers away. This public display highlights China's rapid advancements in unmanned warfare capabilities and its focus on integrating these technologies for complex battlefield scenarios and border control operations.</p>

          <h2>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's Political Influence in Washington Surpasses Other Tech Leaders</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:01:40 EDT</div>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has emerged as a dominant figure in Washington, with his political influence now seen as eclipsing that of other tech giants like Apple's Tim Cook and Tesla's Elon Musk. Huang's strategic lobbying and the critical importance of Nvidia's AI chips have given him significant sway within the Trump administration, evidenced by the recent reversal of restrictions on H20 chip sales to China. His ability to argue that limiting U.S. tech exports harms American leadership has aligned with key administration viewpoints. This shift marks a new era where the AI revolution's central figure holds considerable power in shaping U.S. technology and trade policy.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Suggests Democrats Can Win Back a Segment of Working-Class Trump Voters</h2>

          <p>A new analysis from the Center for Working-Class Politics suggests that a significant portion of Donald Trump's working-class voter base could be persuaded to vote for Democrats. The research indicates that about 11% of these voters hold economically egalitarian views but are socially moderate, making them a key target for a "social populist" platform. This strategy would involve embracing a worker-focused economic agenda—such as raising the minimum wage and protecting jobs—while adopting more moderate social and cultural stances. The authors argue that winning even a fraction of this demographic, which constitutes about 5% of the total electorate, could be decisive in future elections.</p>

          <h2>New Device Aims to Reduce Anxiety for Breastfeeding Mothers by Measuring Milk Intake</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-22 06:00:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at Northwestern University have developed a small, wireless device worn on a mother's breast that can accurately measure the amount of milk a baby consumes during feeding. This innovation, created by a team of pediatricians and engineers, addresses a major source of anxiety for new parents who are often unsure if their infant is getting enough nutrition. The device uses electrodes to measure changes in the breast tissue's electrical properties, sending real-time data to a smartphone app. While still in development, the technology is being hailed as a potential "game-changer" for improving breastfeeding success rates and providing crucial reassurance to families.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Los Angeles Police Chief Jim McDonnell has implemented his first major leadership shake-up, reassigning over a dozen high-ranking officials to new key positions. The changes include promoting three deputy chiefs—Emada Tingirides, Michael Rimkunas, and Scott Harrelson—to top roles and resurrecting the department's Human Resources Bureau, which was previously shut down. Tingirides becomes the highest-ranking Black woman in LAPD history as she takes charge of the Office of Operations. These moves signal McDonnell's strategy for reorganizing the department as it faces challenges with recruitment and prepares for major events like the 2028 Olympics, with a focus on strengthening detective ranks and improving misconduct investigations.</p>

          <p>UCLA researchers have deployed a new network of 20 air pollution monitors in northwest Los Angeles County to provide real-time data on airborne particles in the Palisades fire burn area. This initiative, known as CAP AIR, aims to track both fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) and coarser dust (PM 10) that can be kicked up by reconstruction activities and pose health risks. The publicly accessible online map updates frequently, using a color-coded system to help residents understand local air quality and make informed decisions about outdoor activities. The project addresses a critical data gap, as many existing systems do not adequately monitor the larger particles associated with construction and wildfire debris.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that the presence of a pet dog helps humans manage stress in a more biologically balanced way than previously understood. Researchers measured biomarkers for the body's two main stress pathways and found that while people with their dogs showed lower spikes in the long-term stress hormone cortisol, they exhibited a healthy, quick activation of the short-term "fight or flight" response. In contrast, participants without their dogs had a dysregulated, flat response, often seen in people with chronic stress or PTSD. The findings suggest that dogs help keep their owners in an optimal stress response zone, promoting better engagement and quicker recovery from stressful events.</p>

          <p>Scientists who monitor Earth's rotation have noted that recent days in July have been fractions of a second shorter than the standard 24 hours. While variations in the planet's spin speed are common, influenced by factors like the moon's gravity, atmospheric winds, and the Earth's liquid core, the last decade has seen a notable number of shorter days. Experts explain that while the Earth's rotation is slowing down over millions of years, these short-term fluctuations are normal. The recent speed-up has raised the novel possibility of a "negative leap second," though it is considered unlikely to be implemented by international timekeepers.</p>

          <p>As communities across the U.S. celebrate the 35th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), many in the disability community are expressing anxiety over potential Medicaid cuts. An article highlights a celebratory rollerskating event in Cincinnati, where disability rights activists reflect on the progress made since the landmark 1990 law, which dramatically improved accessibility and rights. However, this sense of progress is tempered by deep concerns about new Medicaid eligibility requirements, including work mandates, in a recent federal bill. Activists are now focused on coaching people with disabilities to advocate for themselves and protect the essential services they rely on for their independence.</p>
