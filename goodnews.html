          <p>Scientists in Singapore have made significant strides in developing remote-controlled cyborg cockroaches, industrializing their production for potential use in disaster search missions. A recent article in Nature Communications detailed improvements in the robotic cockroach's control, enhancing its turning ability to over 80 degrees, which was verified through precise experiments. This "insect robot factory" concept aims to reduce mass production time and cost for practical applications, making these bio-hybrid robots a more viable future tool for navigating challenging environments and assisting in rescue efforts during emergencies. A reviewer praised the work for its meaningful contribution to insect-computer hybrid robotics.</p>

          <p>A district court judge has ruled Utah's current congressional map, drawn in 2021, unlawful, mandating that the Republican-controlled legislature redraw the boundaries for the 2026 midterm elections. The judge found the map violated voters' rights by circumventing a commission designed to ensure nonpartisan districting, specifically by dividing Democratic-leaning Salt Lake County among four Republican-dominated districts. This ruling introduces significant uncertainty for the GOP, which is preparing to defend its slim majority in the U.S. House, as new maps could impact their chances. However, potential appeals promised by Republican lawmakers could delay the adoption of new maps until 2028, impacting the election cycle.</p>

          <p>Korean Air and Boeing announced a $36 billion deal for 103 new passenger and cargo jets, a significant agreement coming as President Trump pressures trading partners to increase business with American firms. This landmark order, including 787, 777, and 737 models, will modernize Korean Air's fleet ahead of its merger with Asiana Airlines, supporting an estimated 135,000 jobs across the U.S. The announcement coincided with a meeting between South Korean President Lee Jae Myung and Trump in Washington, where trade tariffs were a key discussion point. This deal, alongside Hyundai's increased U.S. investment, underscores the broader economic and political dynamics influencing international trade relations and American manufacturing.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Cleveland Browns traded quarterback Kenny Pickett to the Las Vegas Raiders for a 2026 fifth-round NFL Draft pick, following a preseason hamstring injury that sidelined Pickett. The Raiders, in urgent need of a backup for Geno Smith after Aidan O’Connell fractured his wrist, acquired Pickett for his 25 games of starting experience. This move leaves the Browns' backup quarterback position wide open, with rookies Dillon Gabriel and Shedeur Sanders now competing behind starter Joe Flacco. The trade also contradicted earlier reports that the Browns might carry four quarterbacks on their active roster, creating further speculation about their depth chart ahead of the season deadline.</p>

This rule aims to mitigate fire hazards, as these batteries can overheat and combust, and such incidents in cargo holds are significantly harder to detect and extinguish. Plug-in hair straighteners and curling irons remain unrestricted for either carry-on or checked luggage. The Federal Aviation Administration has recorded 644 verified incidents involving lithium batteries creating smoke, fire, or extreme heat since 2006, underscoring the critical safety rationale behind these new guidelines for air travelers.</p>

          <p>Attendees at this year's Burning Man event in Nevada's Black Rock Desert are encountering dust and wind, with forecasts predicting thunderstorms, small hail, and continued dust over the next few days. The event, which draws about 80,000 people, is experiencing weather conditions typical for monsoon season in the area, including average highs of 94 degrees. While heavy rains caused significant muddy delays for departure in 2023, meteorologists suggest current moisture could help reduce the amount of dust lofted into the air. The area is expected to dry up by Thursday, offering some relief before the event concludes next Monday.</p>

          <p>SpaceX has again postponed the 10th test flight of its Super Heavy-Starship rocket, this time due to an electrically charged anvil cloud near the launch pad, after an earlier attempt was scrubbed due to an oxygen leak. This milestone mission aims to test fixes and upgrades following three catastrophic failures earlier this year, with goals including demonstrating engine shutdowns during descent and deploying Starlink simulator satellites. A successful flight is crucial for a faster launch cadence, paving the way for autonomous Starship-to-Starship propellant transfers, a key requirement for NASA's planned moon landing in 2027 and eventual Mars missions. Despite thousands of engineering challenges, NASA remains optimistic about SpaceX's ability to meet its ambitious timelines.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has agreed to restore over $6.8 billion in education funding to U.S. schools, reversing an abrupt decision to freeze the congressionally-allocated funds. This reversal follows a multi-state lawsuit led by California's attorney general, which argued the administration illegally withheld money designated for programs like after-school learning, teacher training, and support for English-learners. While a White House spokesperson initially suggested the funds were "misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda," the lawsuit asserted that the president cannot unilaterally withhold funds under the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The restoration provides crucial relief to programs serving 1.4 million children, primarily from low-income families.</p>

          <p>A BBC article highlights updated advice on back health, challenging the traditional notion of rigid "sit up straight" posture. Dr. Xand van Tulleken, a BBC presenter and doctor, suggests that constant movement, building core strength, and adopting a flexible mindset are crucial for preventing back pain. He emphasizes that posture is dynamic, not static, and that gadgets are no substitute for regular movement and exercise. Additionally, the article notes that psychological factors like stress can significantly contribute to back pain, suggesting a holistic approach to well-being is essential for spinal health.

The process involves significant logistical challenges, including transporting students to a third country for visa biometric checks before coming to the UK.

Zambada, 77 and reportedly in poor health, apologized for his actions and admitted to feeding corruption in Mexico by paying off police, military commanders, and politicians. His guilty plea, which avoids the death penalty, follows his arrest last year in Texas after an alleged double-cross by the sons of his former ally, Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán.
