          <p>Former President Donald Trump declared his intention to ensure U.S. military troops receive their pay on October 15, despite the ongoing federal government shutdown. Utilizing his authority as commander-in-chief, Trump stated on Truth Social that he would direct Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to deploy "all available funds" for this critical purpose. The current government shutdown, which began on October 1, is the first since a 35-day closure in late 2018 during Trump's initial term. This announcement aims to reassure military families amidst the fiscal uncertainty, emphasizing a direct presidential intervention to circumvent the legislative gridlock.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden is currently undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment for prostate cancer, as confirmed by a spokesperson. Diagnosed in May 2025 with an aggressive form of the disease, characterized by a Gleason score of 9 and metastasis to the bone, Biden's treatment commenced several weeks ago in Philadelphia. Reports indicate he is responding well to the therapy. This is the former president's second battle with cancer in recent years, having also undergone treatment for basal cell carcinoma. His personal experience with cancer, including the loss of his son, has fueled his strong advocacy for cancer research and initiatives.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's batting performance for the Dodgers during the National League Division Series was significantly below expectations, sparking questions about his readiness for the upcoming NL Championship Series. The celebrated player recorded just one hit in 18 at-bats, accumulating nine strikeouts, often struggling against left-handed pitching. While manager Dave Roberts acknowledged the challenging matchups, he emphasized that Ohtani's "at-bat quality needs to get better," urging him to be more selective and less passive in the strike zone. The team's prospects for a World Series victory are tied to Ohtani's ability to recalibrate his approach, underscoring his pivotal role in their offensive strategy.</p>

This traditional shift, easily recalled by the mnemonic "spring forward, fall back," typically offers an extra hour. The concept of Daylight Saving Time, first adopted by Germany in 1916 during World War One to save fuel, was soon followed by the UK. While proposals to permanently adopt BST for potential economic and road safety benefits are periodically discussed, critics highlight the significantly darker winter mornings it would cause, particularly in northern regions like Scotland.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's potential debut in the Lakers' preseason game against the Golden State Warriors on Sunday remains uncertain, with coach JJ Redick stating his status is "to be determined." Despite fully participating in Saturday's practice, Doncic indicated he aims to play in two preseason games, though the precise schedule is still being finalized. The team faces an additional challenge as LeBron James will miss the start of the regular season due to a sciatica nerve issue, requiring re-evaluation in several weeks. Doncic recognizes James's absence as a significant shift but stresses a "next man up" mentality, while the coaching staff plans for adaptable lineups.</p>

Patsy, a bowel cancer survivor, views body donation as a way to express gratitude to medical professionals and aid future doctors' education, despite her daughter's initial questions about the process and funeral arrangements. Owen explored the practice at Cardiff University's anatomy centre, where donated bodies are used for teaching and can remain for up to three years before the university covers cremation or burial costs.

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a widespread surge in respiratory illnesses, including common colds, flu, and Covid-19, leading many to feel unwell. Experts attribute this to a "perfect breeding ground" created by children returning to school, adults back at work, and increased indoor gatherings as cooler weather arrives, allowing viruses to flourish. Data from the UK Health Security Agency shows Rhinovirus (common cold) is most prevalent, with Covid-19 variants also circulating, though immunity levels keep it mild for most. While an uptick in flu is noted earlier than usual, overall illness levels are not exceptionally high, and vaccination is urged for vulnerable groups.</p>

Beutner, 65, would emerge as the most formidable challenger to Bass, whose administration has faced criticism for its response to city crises, including a major fire and a substantial budget deficit. Despite these challenges, Bass has recently bolstered her political standing by opposing President Trump's immigration crackdowns.

The initial ruling by U.S. District Judge April Perry had blocked the deployment, citing a lack of evidence for a "danger of rebellion" as Trump had suggested.
