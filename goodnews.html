The 45-year-old former world number one made a return to the WTA Tour in July after a 16-month absence, securing a victory in her first match. This will mark her record-extending 25th appearance at the tournament in New York, where she is a two-time singles champion.

          <p>A U.S. federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to restore a significant portion of the $584 million in federal grant funding it had suspended for the University of California, Los Angeles. The judge ruled that the suspension violated an earlier preliminary injunction that protected the university system's grants. The administration's move to freeze the funds is tied to its threats against universities over pro-Palestinian student protests, which it claims have fostered antisemitism. The university and critics have raised concerns about free speech, academic freedom, and the administration's use of financial pressure.</p>

Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman and chairman of Dundon Capital Partners, declined to disclose the financial terms of the proposed sale. The acquisition is subject to approval by the NBA, but marks a significant development for the franchise's future ownership.</p>

          <p>Walmart, the largest private employer in the U.S., is expanding its 10% employee discount to include almost all grocery items, such as meat and dairy. Previously, the discount on most food items was only available seasonally. The change, effective immediately for its 1.6 million U.S. workers, comes as concerns about rising consumer prices are renewed due to tariffs. In a memo, the company acknowledged that the expansion was one of its most requested benefits. The move could also help the retailer retain workers and encourage them to shop in its stores.</p>

          <p>Social Security recipients could receive a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This projection, based on the latest inflation data, would be a slight increase from the 2.5% adjustment beneficiaries received this year. The Social Security Administration will make its official announcement in October, basing the final figure on inflation rates from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively steady, some economists worry that a modest COLA may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
