        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice issued a unanimous advisory opinion stating countries have a legal duty to prevent significant environmental harm from greenhouse gas emissions. Prompted by the island nation of Vanuatu, the ruling affirms that existing international treaties and human rights laws compel nations to protect the climate system. While not legally binding, the decision establishes a significant legal precedent that could influence climate litigation worldwide, requiring offending nations to cease harmful activities and provide reparations to injured parties.</p>

          <p>Goldman Sachs and BNY Mellon are collaborating to allow institutional clients to invest in tokenized money market funds, recording ownership on a blockchain platform. This initiative, which includes major fund managers like BlackRock and Fidelity, aims to bring new efficiency to the $7.1 trillion money market industry. By digitizing ownership, the banks expect to enable faster, 24/7 transactions and potentially allow the funds to be used as collateral, streamlining financial operations. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a dual-court development, a Tennessee judge ordered the release of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who is awaiting trial on human smuggling charges, finding the government failed to prove he was a flight risk. Concurrently, a Maryland judge barred immigration authorities from immediately detaining him upon release, mandating a 72-hour notice for any deportation proceedings. These rulings address concerns that Abrego Garcia, who was previously deported in what the government called an "administrative error," would face removal without due process.</p>

Over a 15-year repayment term, choosing a home equity loan over a personal loan could save a borrower over $47,000 in total interest charges. (not investment advice)</p>
