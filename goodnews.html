          <p>Birmingham Airport's runway has reopened after a light aircraft made an emergency landing due to landing gear problems, causing over six hours of closure, widespread delays, and cancellations.

          <p>Amazon's self-driving robotaxi unit, Zoox, has cleared a significant regulatory hurdle, receiving an exemption from some federal safety requirements from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. This marks a first for U.S.-built vehicles under an expanded program, paving the way for further demonstrations and commercial deployment. NHTSA also closed its probe into Zoox's self-certification, indicating confidence in the company's safety standards. Zoox plans to launch its commercial ride-hailing service in Las Vegas later this year, supported by a new manufacturing facility in the San Francisco Bay Area aiming to produce 10,000 vehicles annually.</p>

          <p>Four rare Barbary lion cubs, born in January, have made their public debut at Dvůr Králové Safari Park in the Czech Republic, a zoo actively involved in an international endangered species program. These cubs, three females and one male, are part of a long-term plan to reintroduce the breed to its native North African habitat, where it went extinct in the wild by the mid-1960s. With fewer than 200 Barbary lions remaining in captivity, their birth is crucial for genetic diversity. Discussions with Moroccan authorities are underway for a potential reintroduction, though significant logistical challenges remain.</p>

          <p>Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has stated he is "honored" to be named to President Donald Trump's council on sports, fitness, and nutrition. Tagovailoa joins other NFL stars like Nick Bosa and Harrison Butker on the council, which Trump has revitalized to also bring back the presidential fitness test for children. Despite Trump's past controversial comments about NFL players, Tagovailoa expressed no concern about the president mispronouncing his name. Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley, however, declined his invitation due to anticipated busy schedule, highlighting differing approaches to the council's role.</p>

          <p>Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in U.S. manufacturing over the next four years, increasing its total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. This move aims to ease tensions with the Trump administration, which has pushed for more U.S.-based production and criticized Apple's overseas manufacturing. The White House announced a new American Manufacturing Program to support this effort, seeking to reshore critical component production for economic and national security. While this commitment is significant, experts note that fully shifting manufacturing to the U.S. would be a lengthy process and could lead to higher product prices.</p>

          <p>A committee of Italian ministers has approved plans for a controversial 3.3-kilometer bridge connecting Sicily to mainland Italy across the Strait of Messina, with completion aimed for 2032. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government hails the €13.5 billion project as an economic boost for the impoverished south, calling it "the biggest infrastructure project in the West." Critics, however, raise concerns about building in an earthquake zone, the immense cost, potential environmental damage, and fears of mafia infiltration in contracts. Despite decades of debate, this approval marks the furthest the project has progressed.</p>

          <p>Human foot remains, discovered inside a hiking shoe on the shores of Fish Lake, Utah, in May, have been identified through DNA as belonging to David White, who went missing in 1997. White had intended to go fishing, and his boat was later found trolling with no one aboard. The distinctive 1996 hiking boot helped investigators connect the cold case disappearance. This discovery brings closure to White's family and the search and rescue team involved for 28 years, resolving a long-standing mystery.</p>
