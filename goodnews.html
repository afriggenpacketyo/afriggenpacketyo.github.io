          <p>Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes has become the second-largest investor in Throne Sport Coffee, a brand specializing in healthier ready-to-drink coffee options. Mahomes, who is now a pitchman and daily consumer of the product, was drawn to the brand for its low-sugar, high-protein formulation. The brand aims to stand out in the rapidly expanding ready-to-drink coffee market, which saw Americans spend over $17 billion in 2023. Throne's founder, a beverage industry veteran, highlights that their coffee contains significantly less sugar and fewer calories compared to mainstream competitors like Starbucks.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged to a new record high, exceeding $118,000, driven by a significant influx of institutional investment into cryptocurrency ETFs. On Thursday, bitcoin ETFs experienced their largest single-day inflow of the year, totaling $1.18 billion, which fueled the rally. The price movement also triggered over $650 million in short liquidations, further accelerating the upward trend. Analysts suggest that expectations of a more dovish Federal Reserve and concerns about the growing federal deficit are contributing to bitcoin's appeal as an alternative asset.

          <p>Denim company Levi Strauss has raised its full-year sales and earnings guidance, signaling strong consumer demand and brand momentum. The company now expects revenue to grow between 1% and 2%, an upward revision from its previous forecast, and delivered second-quarter results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. Despite facing increased costs from new tariffs, Levi's plans to absorb some of the financial impact for now, though this could change depending on evolving U.S. trade policy. The company's growth is also being driven by a strategic focus on direct-to-consumer sales and successful expansion into women's apparel. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The FDA will now consider drug affordability as a key criterion when granting new national priority vouchers, which can significantly speed up the drug approval process. FDA Commissioner Marty Makary stated that this move aligns with the Trump administration's goal of lowering prescription drug prices for Americans. The voucher program aims to incentivize companies to address U.S. national interests, such as developing cures for major diseases and increasing domestic manufacturing. While the administration's criteria for assessing affordability remain unclear, the policy shift signals a greater focus on cost as part of the regulatory review process.</p>

          <h2>Analysts Suggest China Should Adopt a Pragmatic, Long-Term Trade Strategy Amid U.S. Tensions</h2>

          <p>As the U.S. continues its aggressive tariff policies, analysts advise that China should adopt a more pragmatic and long-term approach to fortify its position against Washington's protectionism. Instead of relying solely on strong rhetoric, Beijing is being encouraged to offer tangible benefits, such as broader market access, to its regional trade partners to build a more unified economic bloc. This strategy involves playing a "long game" to strengthen regional integration and collectively push back against U.S. trade pressure. The comments come as Chinese officials increase diplomatic efforts ahead of another round of trade negotiations with the United States.</p>

          <p>In a notable development, the Shanghai branch of China's state-asset watchdog (SASAC) is encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to research the potential application of stablecoins and other digital assets. The agency urged SOEs to study how emerging technologies like blockchain could be used in cross-border trade, supply chain finance, and asset tokenization. This call for exploration is significant given the Chinese government's long-standing ban on most cryptocurrency-related activities. It aligns with recent suggestions in state-owned media that China should consider regulating stablecoins and leveraging them to promote the yuan's global role.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A trend toward lighter, faster, and more athletic back-row forwards is changing the dynamics of modern rugby, exemplified by players like England's Henry Pollock. This new breed of loose forward, weighing less than traditional heavyweights, offers incredible speed and endurance, allowing them to cover more ground and be highly effective at the breakdown. Coaches and players note that as the ball-in-play time increases, speed and agility are becoming more critical than sheer size. This evolution presents a strategic choice for coaches, who must balance the benefits of a warp-speed, dynamic back row against the power of more traditional, heavier opponents.</p>
