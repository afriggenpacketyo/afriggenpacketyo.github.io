          <p>A LendingTree analysis of government data reveals significant variation in lottery spending across the U.S., with Massachusetts residents spending the most at an average of $915 annually. In contrast, North Dakotans spend the least, at just $50 per year. The report also highlights the financial importance of lotteries for state governments, as sales can constitute a notable portion of general revenue, reaching up to 3% in states like Rhode Island. This data provides context as large jackpots, like the recent $1.8 billion Powerball, continue to draw public attention.</p>

          <p>Ethan Guo, a 20-year-old American pilot and influencer, has been released after being detained for two months at a Chilean air base in Antarctica. He was accused of illegally landing his small plane on Chilean-claimed territory after providing a false flight plan during a solo trip across seven continents to raise money for cancer research. As part of his release, Guo was ordered to pay a $30,000 donation to a children's cancer charity and is banned from entering Chile for three years.</p>

          <p>Max Verstappen secured a dominant victory for Red Bull at the Italian Grand Prix, but the race was marked by a significant team orders controversy at McLaren. Lando Norris finished in second place after the team instructed his teammate, Oscar Piastri, to let him pass. A slow pit stop for Norris had initially and unintentionally dropped him behind Piastri, but McLaren management intervened to restore the original running order, a decision Piastri publicly questioned before ultimately complying with the directive.</p>

The research indicates that many companies are treating Bitcoin as a permanent investment and a long-term treasury reserve asset. (not investment advice)</p>

It posits that the majority of the 33 million U.S. small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected by the policy change. The article suggests that as long as consumer income and wealth remain strong, the broader economy can likely absorb the impact, and advises businesses to diversify suppliers and adapt pricing strategies rather than panic.
