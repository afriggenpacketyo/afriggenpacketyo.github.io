          <p>NATO defense ministers largely support a plan to increase defense spending to 5% of GDP, a demand championed by U.S. President Donald Trump.  While there is broad agreement, some allies, like Spain, remain hesitant to increase spending beyond the current 2% target.  The focus is on investments in long-range weapons, air defense, and mobile land forces, reflecting changing geopolitical realities and security concerns.
