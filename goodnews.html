          <p>The UK government is considering a significant overhaul of driving laws in England and Wales, which could see motorists over 70 banned if they fail compulsory triennial eye tests. The proposed road safety strategy also aims to tighten the drink-driving limit to align with Scotland's stricter standard and introduce penalty points for passengers not wearing seatbelts. These potential changes follow a coroner's report labeling the UK's current driver licensing system as the "laxest in Europe" after an inquest into deaths caused by drivers with poor eyesight.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While mature black holes are known for their silence, newly formed ones produce a unique form of "music" through gravitational waves. This phenomenon occurs as a young black hole, created from a star's collapse or a merger, settles into a stable, mathematically perfect shape dictated by its mass and angular momentum. During this brief, dynamic phase, the distortion of space-time rings out, providing a unique signature that scientists will soon be able to detect. This offers a window into the otherwise imperceptible process of a black hole's birth.</p>

          <p>China has launched a nationwide childcare subsidy program, offering families 3,600 yuan (US$501) annually for each child under three years old. The financial impact of this handout is expected to be more significant in less affluent regions where the subsidy constitutes a larger percentage of the average resident's income. For example, the subsidy represents over 13.5% of an average income in the poor province of Gansu, compared to just 4.1% in Shanghai. This disparity suggests the policy could provide a more substantial boost to consumption and potentially birth rates in smaller cities and rural areas. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chip manufacturers Nvidia and AMD have reportedly agreed to pay the U.S. government 15% of their revenue from specific high-performance chip sales to China. This arrangement is part of a deal to secure export licenses for these products, including Nvidia's H20 and AMD's MI308 chips, which were designed for the Chinese market following earlier U.S. export restrictions. The move comes amid easing trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, with Nvidia stating it hopes the rules will allow American technology to compete globally while adhering to government regulations.

          <p>English golfer Justin Rose captured his 12th PGA Tour title by winning the St. Jude Championship in a dramatic three-hole playoff against American JJ Spaun. Rose, who had lost a playoff at this year's Masters, held his nerve to secure the victory after both players matched each other through the first two extra holes. The win was a disappointment for fellow Englishman Tommy Fleetwood, who entered the final round with the lead but finished one stroke short of the playoff. The result advances the top 50 players in the FedEx Cup standings to the next playoff event.</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled new measures designed to make it easier for NHS employers in England to hire newly qualified nurses and midwives. The plan aims to cut red tape, allowing trusts to recruit based on anticipated needs even before vacancies formally exist, addressing a situation where there are more graduates than available jobs in some areas. While nursing and midwifery colleges welcomed the news as a source of hope for students, employer representatives raised concerns about how the measures would be funded, given that trust budgets are already under significant pressure.</p>

          <p>According to historian Rana Mitter, the impact of the Second World War is a crucial but often underestimated factor in the formation of modern China. The conflict, which began with Japan's invasion, shattered much of the country's pre-war infrastructure and communications, forcing a near-total reconstruction afterward. Mitter, a leading expert on the era, suggests that this history informs China's contemporary interests. He argues that looking back 80 years from the end of the war, China's primary strategic interest today lies in maintaining a peaceful and stable Asia-Pacific region.</p>
