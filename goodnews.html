          <p>Leicester City has appointed former Queens Park Rangers head coach Marti Cifuentes as their new manager on a three-year contract. The club, recently relegated to the Championship, is seeking stability after significant managerial turnover and faces challenges including potential points deductions for financial rule breaches. Cifuentes is expected to implement a modern, possession-heavy style of football similar to his predecessor, but he faces a tight schedule to prepare the squad for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Defense Department is accelerating its efforts to reduce reliance on China for critical minerals by taking direct equity stakes in domestic mining companies. The Pentagon recently became the largest shareholder in MP Materials, which operates the only rare earth mine in the U.S., to bolster the supply chain for materials essential for military technology like F-35 jets and drones. This public-private partnership model is part of a broader strategy to strengthen America's industrial base for national security.</p>

          <p>The Enmanji Buddhist Temple in Sebastopol, California, recently marked the 70th anniversary of its annual Teriyaki Barbecue, an event that symbolizes community resilience and unity. The tradition's origins are deeply connected to the period after World War II, when local residents of different backgrounds protected the temple from vandalism while its Japanese American members were in internment camps. The popular gathering continues to serve as a powerful lesson in mutual respect and friendship overcoming historical prejudice.</p>
