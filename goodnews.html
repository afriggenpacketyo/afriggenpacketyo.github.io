          <p>A tractor-trailer carrying approximately 250 million bees overturned in Whatcom County, Washington, leading to the escape of the pollinators. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area, particularly those allergic to bee stings, while beekeepers worked to re-hive the bees and locate the queen. The road was closed for an estimated 24 to 48 hours to facilitate the bee recovery efforts. By the next morning, most of the bees had returned to their hives, and those responsible for the delivery took charge of the situation. </p>

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its COVID-19 vaccine recommendations, advising parents to consult with a doctor about whether their children should receive the shots. This change follows a directive from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who rescinded the department's 2022 acceptance of the CDC's recommendations for routine COVID-19 vaccination in children and pregnant women. Professional medical groups, such as the American Academy of Pediatrics, continue to recommend COVID-19 vaccines for these groups based on scientific evidence. Public health experts have expressed concerns about the process used to make these changes, which they say lacked transparency.</p>

Akazawa noted that Tokyo's stance to demand the United States remove all its additional tariffs on Japanese imports has not changed.

Macron's speech comes amid a regional tour where he has sought to bolster France's defense cooperation with other nations, worried about becoming collateral damage in the U.S.-China trade war and amid continued geopolitical disputes with Beijing.

          <p>Norway is addressing concerns about the increasingly elaborate and disruptive "Russ" bus partying tradition among school leavers. These celebrations, involving weeks of partying on midnight buses, have raised alarms among parents and politicians due to heavy drinking, drug use, and the financial burden on teenagers. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that the culture has spun out of control, leading to efforts to move celebrations to the post-exam period. The goal is to reduce social exclusion, peer pressure, and high costs for young people, creating a more inclusive graduation celebration.</p>

          <p>Harvard University has agreed to transfer a set of historic photos depicting enslaved people to the International African American Museum in South Carolina. This agreement ends a long legal battle between Harvard and Tamara Lanier, who argues she is a descendant of two people shown in the photos. The images, taken in 1850, will be placed in the museum where the people shown in the photos were enslaved. The photos were commissioned by Harvard professor Louis Agassiz as part of discredited research to prove the superiority of white people.</p>

          <p>A clinical trial suggests that the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab could significantly extend the lives of people with advanced head and neck cancer. The study showed that the drug doubled the length of time patients were cancer-free, on average, from around 2.5 years to five years. Patients given pembrolizumab had a 10% lower risk of their cancer returning elsewhere in the body after three years. The immunotherapy primes the body's defenses, helping it learn to attack the cancer if it returns.</p>
