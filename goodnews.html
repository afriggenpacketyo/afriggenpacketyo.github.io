          <p>Microsoft has offered to unbundle its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 software suites from its Teams workplace communication app in an effort to address competition concerns raised by European regulators. The European Commission is scrutinizing Microsoft's tying of Teams with its popular Office productivity suite, following a legal claim made by Slack in 2020. Microsoft has committed to making versions of Office 365 and Microsoft 365 available without Teams at a reduced price, as well as allowing customers to switch to the tools without Teams, even under existing contracts. Microsoft also committed to offer Teams' competitors increased interoperability with other Microsoft products and let customers move their data out of Teams to competing products.</p>

          <p>Taxpayers may be paying more than they should due to over-assessments, with estimates suggesting a significant percentage of taxable properties in the U.S. are incorrectly assessed.

Steps include verifying the accuracy of your assessment, comparing your property to neighbors', checking for tax exemptions, and meeting appeal deadlines.

          <p>"Final Destination: Bloodlines" reinvigorates the horror franchise with over-the-top death sequences and a family tree death order structure. The film centers on Stefani Reyes, who discovers a psychic gift and her connection to a horrific hotel collapse in 1968. While the characters are well-drawn, the stars of the film are the creatively staged and executed death sequences, elevated by clever staging and perfect editing. The film revels in the gory and low-brow thrills that are the hallmark of the franchise.</p>
