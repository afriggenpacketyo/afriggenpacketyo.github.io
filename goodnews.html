          <p>Amazon is rolling out 'Hear the Highlights,' an AI feature that generates audio summaries for products using catalog data, customer reviews, and web information. The tool, now available to all U.S. customers on the mobile app, aims to simplify shopping by distilling thousands of reviews into concise audio clips. While this feature could significantly improve accessibility for visually impaired shoppers, critics express concern that the AI-generated summaries may lack the nuance of human experiences. Experts warn that by blending marketing language with genuine user opinions without attribution, the tool could overlook critical negative feedback and inadvertently mislead consumers.</p>

          <p>Shares of AI cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave increased by nearly 8% after the company revealed a significant agreement with Nvidia. The deal obligates Nvidia to purchase at least $6.3 billion of CoreWeave's unsold cloud capacity through April 2032, highlighting the strong relationship between the two companies. As CoreWeave is a major customer for Nvidia's GPUs and Nvidia is a key investor, this news has bolstered investor confidence. The arrangement has helped CoreWeave's stock triple in value since its March IPO, pushing its valuation over $58 billion. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent CBS News poll indicates that Zohran Mamdani holds a significant lead in the New York City mayoral race, primarily fueled by voters' concerns over the city's affordability. The survey reveals that a desire for change is a more potent factor for voters than a candidate's experience, which benefits Mamdani. Former Governor Andrew Cuomo shows more competitive numbers among voters who prioritize crime, but this issue is currently secondary to economic pressures. The poll also highlights that many voters, particularly Mamdani's supporters, prefer a mayor who will oppose President Trump, reflecting the influence of national politics on the local election.</p>

          <p>After a challenging first quarter, Tesla's stock has rebounded dramatically, rising 85% from its April low to turn positive for the year. The electric vehicle maker's shares recently surpassed their 2024 closing price, a recovery attributed to renewed Wall Street confidence and a new filing showing CEO Elon Musk purchased approximately $1 billion in shares. Despite the rally, Tesla faces ongoing challenges, including an aging product line, fierce competition from Chinese manufacturers, and consumer backlash linked to Musk's political activities. The company is attempting to shift investor focus toward future projects like robotaxis and humanoid robots. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price rose over 3% after CEO Elon Musk disclosed the purchase of approximately $1 billion worth of the company's shares. This is Musk's first open-market stock acquisition since 2020 and his largest ever by value, an action widely interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the electric vehicle maker. The purchase comes as Tesla's stock has faced headwinds from slumping sales and controversy surrounding Musk's political activities. The move is seen by some analysts as Musk doubling down on his vision for Tesla's future in artificial intelligence and robotics. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Conor McGregor, the former mixed martial arts star, has announced he is no longer a candidate in Ireland's upcoming presidential election. After previously stating his intention to run on a platform of "real change," McGregor cited consultations with his family and criticized Ireland's political rules, which he claims prevent a "true democratic" election. To appear on the ballot, candidates require nominations from 20 members of parliament or four local authorities, a hurdle McGregor did not clear. His brief political foray attracted support from far-right figures but was also met with skepticism from established Irish politicians.</p>

          <p>Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has become the fourth U.S. company to achieve a market capitalization of $3 trillion, following a more than 4% jump in its share price. The milestone was reached after a favorable antitrust ruling in early September, where the penalties imposed were less severe than investors had feared. This legal victory propelled the stock to a record high, and shares are now up over 30% for the year. The achievement comes as CEO Sundar Pichai navigates intense competition in the artificial intelligence sector and ongoing regulatory scrutiny in both the U.S. and Europe. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As the Federal Reserve is expected to cut its benchmark interest rate, homeowners may wonder about the impact on mortgage costs. The Fed's rate directly affects short-term loans between banks, but its influence on long-term mortgage rates is indirect. Fixed-rate mortgages typically align more closely with the 10-year Treasury note yield, which reflects long-term economic outlooks and investor sentiment. While mortgage rates have already slightly decreased in anticipation of the Fed's decision, experts advise that homeowners should not expect an immediate, significant drop following the official announcement, as the market has already priced in the cut.

          <p>With U.S. homeowners holding a record $17.8 trillion in collective home equity, many are considering borrowing against this asset for major expenses. For those looking to access around $50,000, several options exist, each with distinct advantages. A home equity loan offers a lump sum with a predictable fixed interest rate, while a home equity line of credit (HELOC) provides a flexible, revolving credit line, often with variable rates. A cash-out refinance replaces an existing mortgage with a larger one but could mean sacrificing a previously secured low rate. (not investment advice)</p>

Placing $15,000 into a certificate of deposit (CD) can still yield significant interest, though rates are expected to fall. For example, a 1-year CD at a rate of 4.25% could earn approximately $637.50, while a 3-year CD at 3.97% could generate over $1,850 in guaranteed interest. Because CD rates are fixed for the term, they offer a stable investment vehicle to protect savings from the effects of falling rates and market volatility. (not investment advice)</p>

A looming deadline has pressured TikTok's Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. division or face a ban.

          <p>The IRS deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is September 15, a crucial date for freelancers, self-employed individuals, and those with investment income. Tax experts advise that this year's payments may be more complicated due to President Trump's recent tax changes, which could lead some taxpayers to overpay if their paycheck withholdings have not been adjusted. To avoid underpayment penalties, filers should adhere to safe harbor rules by paying at least 90% of their current year's tax liability or 100% of the previous year's. Tax professionals recommend running projections to ensure payments are accurate for the remainder of the year. (not investment advice)</p>
