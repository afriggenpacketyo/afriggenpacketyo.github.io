          <p>The Berkshire Hathaway board has unanimously voted for Greg Abel to succeed Warren Buffett as CEO on January 1, 2026, while Buffett will remain chairman. This decision, revealed at the annual shareholder meeting, designates Abel, the current vice chairman of non-insurance operations, as Buffett's successor. Buffett reassured shareholders that he will continue to assist with significant acquisition opportunities, particularly during volatile markets, leveraging Berkshire's substantial cash reserves of over $347 billion. The article notes that Berkshire shares experienced a slight dip in premarket trading despite the CEO transition announcement and somewhat underwhelming earnings reports, but the shares had closed at a record high the prior Friday.</p>

          <p>Amid concerns over potential cuts to Medicaid and the dismantling of agencies supporting independent living for disabled Americans, disability rights advocate Ari Ne'eman reflects on historical strategies used to defend disability rights. Ne'eman highlights the importance of both massive mobilization and reframing disability rights priorities to appeal to a broader political spectrum. He emphasizes that disabled people are often devalued by the healthcare system yet have a significant need for healthcare and support services. Ne'eman expresses concern over potential rollbacks in services that enable disabled people to remain in their homes and communities, potentially leading to increased institutionalization and unmet healthcare needs.</p>

          <p>Five people, including a pilot and a 6-year-old boy, survived for 36 hours in a Bolivian swamp infested with alligators and anacondas after their small plane crashed. The survivors clung to the wreckage, enduring mosquito attacks and the presence of predatory reptiles, sustaining themselves with ground cassava flour. The pilot speculated that the stench of jet fuel kept the animals at bay. Rescuers found them after they used cell phone flashlights and shouted for help, and they were taken to a hospital for treatment of dehydration, minor chemical burns, infected cuts, bruises, and insect bites.</p>

          <p>The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) in the UK has issued a warning about cyber criminals impersonating IT help desk personnel to infiltrate organizations, following recent attacks on Marks & Spencer, Co-op, and Harrods. The NCSC advises organizations to review their IT help desk password reset processes, particularly authentication methods for senior employees. Cyber security experts recommend implementing additional security layers, such as code words, to verify the identity of staff members requesting credential changes. The NCSC suggests that the tactics used align with those of the Scattered Spider cyber criminal group, known for using social engineering in their attacks.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has reduced the default withholding rate for new overpayment notices from 100% to 50% for Title II benefits, which include retirement, survivors, and disability insurance. This change comes shortly after announcing the 100% rate, sparking concerns about financial hardship for beneficiaries. While the 50% rate is an improvement, experts warn it can still be devastating for those relying on benefits to cover essential expenses. Beneficiaries have 90 days to request a lower withholding rate, reconsideration, or waiver of recovery, otherwise the agency will withhold up to 50% of their benefits until the overpayment is recovered.</p>

          <p>Trump's tariffs, though economically unsound, signal a broader political vision of protectionism aimed at safeguarding a way of life, particularly for those who lost out from globalization. The author argues that capitalism requires a "spirit" to justify its pursuit of profit and that Trump's protectionist spirit, while appealing, risks creating new cycles of dismay. Instead, a democratizing spirit is needed, one that guides collective efforts to ensure decent lives for all, even in a chaotic world. The article suggests Democrats should emphasize the spirit of their vision, highlighting community and a version of America that works for everyone.</p>
