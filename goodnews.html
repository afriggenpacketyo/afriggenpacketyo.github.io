          <p>A new study suggests that the prehistoric Chav√≠n people in the Peruvian Andes used psychoactive drugs, including DMT, during exclusive rituals to establish social and political hierarchies. Archaeologists discovered artifacts, including snuff tubes with traces of hallucinogenic substances, at Chav√≠n de Hu√°ntar. The rituals, held in hidden rooms, likely involved select members of society, contributing to the creation of early class structures. This is compelling evidence that psychoactive plants were part of formalized and tightly-controlled rituals rather than individual vision-quests or shamanic healing practices.</p>

          <p>New and highly effective anti-obesity medications known as GLP-1s have revolutionized our understanding of weight loss, and of obesity itself. These drugs alone are not a panacea for the obesity crisis that has engulfed the nation, and we should not mistake them for one. But their effectiveness underscores the fact that being overweight or obese was never the result of a lack of willpower. Forty percent of American adults are now obese. These foods have contributed to a rise in diseases characterized by visceral fat, or what I call toxic fat ‚Äî fat that accumulates within our abdomens and surrounds the liver, heart and pancreas.</p>
