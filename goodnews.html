          <p>President Trump is set to release a report from the White House‚Äôs Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Robert F.

The report, while not offering specific policy prescriptions, aims to highlight the nation's health crisis and suggest areas for further investigation and reform. The report has already faced pushback from Republicans and the agriculture industry, particularly regarding its focus on agricultural chemicals like glyphosate. Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith cautioned against insinuating that glyphosate is unsafe, emphasizing its importance to farmers, while Kennedy assured her that the commission would not jeopardize their business model.</p>

Moody's recent downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt has also contributed to Bitcoin's appeal as a hedge against fiat instability.
