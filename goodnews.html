          <h2>Trump to Announce Medicare Drug Pricing Plan</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump is expected to unveil a "most favored nation" plan aimed at lowering Medicare drug prices, a policy previously attempted during his first term. This plan would tie the cost of certain Medicare drugs to the lowest prices offered by drug manufacturers in other countries. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Health and Human Services Secretary, has pointed to the high cost of drugs like Ozempic as a key impediment. The administration also scrapped a proposal to cover weight loss drugs in Medicare and Medicaid due to concerns about the overall cost to the healthcare system. This article indicates a renewed push for drug pricing reform under the Trump administration.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, fueled by President Trump's announcement of a trade agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom. The cryptocurrency's rise reflects its status as a resilient asset amidst market uncertainty, as investors seek clarity on trade policy. Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto exchange Nexo, noted Bitcoin's outperformance versus U.S. equity benchmarks and its role as a safe haven asset. However, he expects Bitcoin's resilience to be tested further by rising tensions between India and Pakistan and the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to cutting rates.</p>

          <p>The Gates Foundation announced it will close its doors permanently on December 31, 2045, committing to spend down its endowment and Bill Gates's remaining personal fortune. This decision is driven by a belief that their central goals in health and human development can be achieved in a shorter time frame, allocating over $200 billion in the next 20 years. Gates expressed concern over the Trump administration's cuts to foreign aid, estimating millions of additional childhood deaths as a result. The foundation aims to leverage biomedical tools and AI to address global health challenges, hoping to create a world where the Gates Foundation is no longer necessary.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>California drivers who filed claims in a $50-million settlement over gasoline price gouging are starting to receive payments. The settlement stems from a case involving three gasoline trading firms accused of manipulating gas prices in 2015 following an explosion at an Exxon Mobile refinery. The companies allegedly took advantage of the market disruption to drive up gas prices, resulting in consumers paying more. More than a million Californians will receive payments of $21.65 via check, direct deposit, or Venmo, depending on their preference.</p>

          <p>Amanda Hess's book, Second Life: Having A Child In The Digital Age, explores how technology shapes every aspect of parenting. Hess discusses how technology can both inform and create anxiety during pregnancy, citing her own experience with prenatal testing and online communities. She also examines the potential impact of baby monitor surveillance and the reliance on high-tech bassinets, arguing that technology can sometimes confuse care with surveillance and make it difficult to understand a child's needs. Despite the challenges, Hess acknowledges the comfort and support found in online communities for parents facing rare conditions.</p>

          <p>Cardinal Robert Prevost was elected as the 267th Pope, becoming the first American to hold the position, taking the name Pope Le√≥n XIV.

          <p>President Trump unveiled a "major" trade deal with the United Kingdom, but many details of the agreement remain to be negotiated. The announcement was notable for Trump reversing course on his "extreme tariff policies." While trade deals are typically announced after details are finalized, Trump appeared eager to publicize the agreement to signal America's readiness to negotiate. Experts predict that the coming negotiations could take months and involve thorny issues such as agricultural exports and tariffs on foreign film shoots.
