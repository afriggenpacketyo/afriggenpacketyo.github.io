          <p>Shares of Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest battery manufacturer, jumped nearly 17% in their Hong Kong trading debut. Investors are optimistic about the company's potential to capitalize on the booming electric vehicle market, with the IPO raising HK$35.7 billion ($4.6 billion). CATL plans to use 90% of the funds to build a factory in Hungary, supplying batteries to European automotive clients like Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen. While facing challenges like punitive tariffs on Chinese EVs and being placed on a U.S. watchlist, CATL's net profit increased by 15% year-over-year despite a slight revenue drop.</p>

Kushner is the father of Jared Kushner, former advisor and son-in-law to Trump, who praised him as a tremendous business leader and dealmaker.

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has struck trade deals with the European Union, the United States, and India, demonstrating Britain's ability to engage with major trade partners post-Brexit. However, the deals required politically sensitive concessions, reflecting Britain's position as a midsize economy between larger trading blocs. The agreement with the EU allows British travelers easier access at some European airports, while the U.S. deal reduces tariffs on British luxury cars. Despite these agreements, Britain still faces economic challenges from Brexit, including a significant GDP loss, leading to debates over the deals' benefits and trade-offs, particularly regarding fishing rights and agricultural access.</p>

          <p>Shares of China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Co Limited (CATL) surged on their first day of trading in Hong Kong, marking the biggest initial public offering (IPO) of the year.

          <p>Shares of CATL, the world‚Äôs biggest maker of batteries for electric cars, surged in their Hong Kong debut, but U.S. onshore investors were blocked from buying its stock.

The CATL Hong Kong stock sale marks a reversal from a decade ago when Chinese companies like Alibaba were welcomed on Wall Street. Despite these tensions, CATL raised $4.6 billion ahead of its secondary listing, indicating strong investor interest outside the U.S.</p>

          <p>Sesame Street will be available on Netflix after facing an uncertain future due to funding cuts and the non-renewal of its deal with Warner Bros Discovery. The move follows President Trump's decision to block federal funding for PBS, alleging biased coverage. Netflix will offer a new season and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers, while PBS will retain access to the episodes. This agreement ensures the continued availability of the iconic children's program, which has been a cornerstone of children's media for over half a century, while Netflix expands its focus on children's content.</p>

Eto apologized, explaining that he had exaggerated and that his wife does buy rice when donated supplies run out, while affirming his commitment to continue as farm minister.</p>

          <p>China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion into its bond and equities markets in April, despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. This inflow contrasts with concerns about rising Treasury yields and the Moody‚Äôs downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this reflects a shift in global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets since the trade war began. Bank of America analysts noted that a weaker U.S. dollar, a peak in U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery are driving investment towards emerging markets.</p>

The move is part of Beijing's efforts to stimulate its economy, with state-backed commercial lenders also reducing deposit rates. Capital Economics forecasts further lending rate cuts by year-end.

The deal entails trade-offs, such as accepting "dynamic alignment" with EU rules in exchange for easier trade, a point of contention for critics who view it as a surrender of power. The annual UK-EU summits highlight the continuous need for negotiation and conversation, underscoring the semi-permanent nature of resetting the relationship.</p>
