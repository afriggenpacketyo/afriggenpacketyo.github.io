          <h2>Study Suggests Pigs Were Domesticated in China During Neolithic Period</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-12 21:00:11 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeological research suggests that pigs were domesticated in southern China as early as 8,000 years ago, coinciding with the development of rice cultivation and sedentary lifestyles. Researchers from Chinese and US institutes analyzed two early Neolithic sites in the Yangtze Delta region, finding evidence that pigs consumed human-cooked foods and waste. This challenges the conventional view that pigs were first domesticated in the Near East. The study, published in PNAS, highlights the early domestication process of Sus scrofa, the wild boar, in ancient China.</p>
