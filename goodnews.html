        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The United Kingdom has announced £150 billion in investment pledges from U.S. firms, a development timed with President Trump's state visit. Major tech companies like Microsoft and Google are contributing significantly, with the government hoping to create over 7,600 jobs. However, this influx of foreign capital contrasts with slowing domestic business investment and recent decisions by major pharmaceutical companies to halt or move their UK investment plans, citing an increasingly challenging business environment. The announcement comes as UK job figures show a recent decline.</p>

          <p>China's National Immigration Administration has reported a significant increase in visa-free entries, totaling nearly 16 million from January to August. These arrivals constitute approximately two-thirds of all international entries, indicating a rebound in the country's tourism and travel sectors. A key factor in this growth is a new reciprocal visa-free agreement with Malaysia, which has already resulted in 150,000 visa-free trips since its implementation in July. Russia is also anticipated to become a major contributor to visa-free tourism in the near future.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump's well-documented admiration for the British royal family is reportedly rooted in his late mother's deep reverence for the institution. Mary Anne MacLeod Trump, a Scottish immigrant, was enthralled by Queen Elizabeth II's 1953 coronation, a memory the president often recounts. This personal connection is seen as a factor in his historic second state visit to the U.K., an honor no previous U.S. president has received. During the visit, Trump has emphasized his friendship with King Charles and praised the royal family's role, reflecting a long-held personal sentiment.</p>

          <p>Despite a year of inconsistent results and criticism, U.S. Men's National Team coach Mauricio Pochettino argues for a more optimistic view of the team's progress ahead of the World Cup. He contends that the period has been a necessary reset, allowing him to experiment with tactics, introduce new players, and build depth that was previously lacking. The article suggests that while recent losses have caused concern, Pochettino has successfully injected new energy and tactical flexibility into the squad. Ultimately, the team's success will depend on player health and fortune, not just preliminary results.</p>

          <p>Following a day of royal pageantry at Windsor Castle, President Trump's U.K. state visit has pivoted to substantive political and economic talks with Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The leaders are meeting at Chequers to discuss the finalization of a U.S.-U.K. trade deal, with contentious issues like tariffs on British steel on the agenda. The discussions will also cover geopolitical matters, including the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. Despite their different political backgrounds, the surprisingly amicable relationship between Trump and Starmer is noted as a key factor in the visit's diplomatic proceedings.</p>

          <p>The Italian song 'Bella Ciao,' found etched on a bullet casing linked to Charlie Kirk's assassination, has a long history as a global anthem of resistance. While widely associated with Italy's anti-fascist partisans during World War II, its origins are debated, with roots possibly in 19th-century folk songs. In recent decades, the adaptable melody has been adopted by various movements, from leftist and feminist protests to pop culture, notably in the Netflix series 'Money Heist.' Its appearance in the Kirk case highlights its enduring status as a symbol of opposition.</p>
