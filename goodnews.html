          <p>Delta Air Lines saw its shares surge after reinstating its 2025 profit forecast, signaling a stronger summer travel season than analysts had predicted. CEO Ed Bastian noted that while booking patterns have shifted, with customers booking closer to their travel dates, overall demand has stabilized after a dip earlier in the year. The airline now projects adjusted full-year earnings of $5.25 to $6.25 a share, a downward revision from its initial, more optimistic forecast but still a sign of confidence. This positive outlook has lifted not only Delta's stock but also shares across the airline industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company's mission is to leverage the microgravity environment of space, which allows for different crystallization of medicines that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital injection, bringing its total funding to $329 million, will help Varda increase its flight cadence and expand its capacity to work on more complex molecules. The company has already completed three space launches and recently received FAA approval for its first capsule to return from orbit.</p>

          <p>CEO Elon Musk announced that Tesla is expanding its robotaxi service area in Austin, Texas, and plans to integrate the xAI chatbot, Grok, into its vehicles within the next week. This move comes as xAI launches its Grok 4 update, despite recent controversy over antisemitic content generated by a previous version. Musk also mentioned that a robotaxi launch in the Bay Area is awaiting regulatory approval. These developments occur during a challenging period for Musk, who has been in public disputes with the Trump administration, impacting investor confidence and Tesla's stock value.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Defense is set to become the largest shareholder in MP Materials, the owner of the only operational rare earth mine in the United States, through a $400 million investment. This public-private partnership aims to bolster the domestic supply chain for rare earth magnets, which are critical components in advanced military systems like F-35 jets and drones. The move is a direct effort to reduce U.S. reliance on China, which dominates the global rare earths market. The investment will fund the expansion of MP Materials' processing and magnet production capabilities. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Recent data, including a U.S. Census Bureau survey, reveals that the adoption of artificial intelligence tools by businesses and consumers is growing rapidly, yet still has significant room for expansion. The survey found that 9.2% of firms used AI in the second quarter, up from 5.7% in late 2024, suggesting the market is in its early stages. This trend supports a bullish outlook for the AI sector, from chipmakers like Nvidia to data center suppliers. Analysts believe that as AI adoption crosses key thresholds, it will continue to drive monetization and investment across various industries. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new book, "Loud and Clear," by Brian Anderson, details the history of the Grateful Dead's legendary "Wall of Sound," a massive, innovative sound system from the early 1970s. Conceived by sound engineer Owsley Stanley, the system aimed to provide perfect, uniform audio for the entire audience by placing a behemoth stack of speakers and amps directly behind the band. While utopian in its goal, the wall was a logistical nightmare, weighing as much as a dozen elephants and proving costly and difficult to maintain. The book argues this ambitious but flawed endeavor contributed to the band's eventual burnout and hiatus.</p>
