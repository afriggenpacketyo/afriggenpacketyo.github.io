          <p>Bronny James showcased his potential during a Lakers' NBA Summer League game, scoring 14 points with solid defense in a win against the New Orleans Pelicans. His father, LeBron James, was present courtside, actively offering advice and encouragement throughout the game. At one point, LeBron instructed his son to be more aggressive driving to the basket, which Bronny immediately followed with a successful layup. The performance highlighted his decision-making skills and confidence under the watchful eye of his famous father.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom is enduring its third heatwave of the year, with temperatures reaching highs of 33.1°C in England. Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland also recorded their warmest days of the year so far. Amber heat health alerts remain in effect for southern and eastern England, warning of potential health risks, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions. The heat has prompted hosepipe bans and wildfire warnings, but the Met Office forecasts a cooldown with rain expected for most of the country early next week.</p>

          <h2>New Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams May Increase Dry-Season Water Flow to India</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers insights into the impact of China's dam-building on the Brahmaputra river, which flows into India. Contrary to fears that new dams could cause droughts downstream, data from two existing dams suggests the opposite may be true. The study found that since 2014, water flow during the dry season has significantly increased, with low flows in February rising by over 50%. This research provides the first concrete evidence on the downstream effects, indicating that China's water management might be augmenting rather than diminishing water supply for India during critical periods.</p>

          <p>China's space ambitions are increasingly being fueled by private investment, aligning with a global trend that is projected to see the space economy triple to $1.8 trillion by 2035. Driven by technological advances and state support, private Chinese aerospace companies are achieving significant milestones. Firms like i-Space and LandSpace have successfully launched rockets into orbit, with the latter pioneering methane-fueled launch vehicles. This surge in private enterprise is crucial for China's goal of becoming a major power in space travel, satellite constellations, and resource exploration. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Several companies, including UK-based Better Dairy, are pioneering the production of lab-grown cheese that aims to replicate the taste and texture of traditional dairy products without using animals. The process involves genetically modifying yeast to produce casein, the key protein in milk, through precision fermentation. While facing challenges like high costs and regulatory hurdles, these startups hope to overcome the quality issues that have plagued the plant-based cheese market. They aim to launch their products in the coming years, targeting consumers and food manufacturers with a more sustainable and potentially healthier alternative.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the reality TV show "Love Island" is experiencing a revival, largely attributed to its massive growth on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV ratings are improving, the show's official accounts have gained millions of followers, with short clips, recaps, and fan analysis driving online discourse. This shift in consumption allows viewers to keep up with the drama without committing to the daily hour-long episodes. Analysts and former contestants note this changes the viewing experience, as character narratives are compressed into bite-sized, context-lacking clips for a new generation of fans.</p>
