          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-09 13:06:35 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Internal Revenue Service has released its annual inflation adjustments for federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year. This measure is designed to prevent "bracket creep," where inflation pushes taxpayers into higher tax brackets without a real increase in income. The update means Americans will need to earn more to reach a higher tax rate, and standard deductions will also increase for all filing statuses. The article explains the progressive nature of the U.S. tax system, providing an example of how to calculate an effective tax rate under the new brackets. (not investment advice)</p>

The optimistic outlook reflects a recovery in travel demand and strategic flight adjustments to improve profitability. Revenue from premium cabins, such as first class, grew by 9% and is on track to surpass main cabin sales next year, indicating a robust market for high-end travel experiences.

          <p>A new book by "Gavin & Stacey" creators Ruth Jones and James Corden, titled "When Gavin Met Stacey," shares previously unknown details about the beloved British sitcom. The book reveals that a scene explaining the infamous "fishing trip" was filmed but cut for time, and an argument between the writers inspired an iconic scene involving wedding vows. It also discloses that the show's theme song was initially rejected by the artist and that the 2019 Christmas special was conceived during Corden's 40th birthday party. The creators also considered making the finale a feature film before deciding to keep it on television.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's pursuit of the Nobel Peace Prize has become a prominent and undisguised feature of his foreign policy, particularly in the context of the recently announced Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal. His allies have publicly advocated for him to receive the award, and Trump himself has frequently mentioned it, suggesting he is being unfairly overlooked. Foreign diplomats have reportedly noted the prize as a key motivator for his international engagements, including his efforts to broker peace in Gaza. Despite the intense push, the Nobel committee's final meeting reportedly occurred before the ceasefire deal was announced.</p>

          <h2>Rare Earth Mining Stocks Surge Following New Chinese Export Restrictions</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Shares of U.S. companies involved in mining rare earths and critical minerals experienced a significant surge after China announced tighter restrictions on their export. Beijing now requires a license for exporting products containing even small amounts of rare earths, a move seen as an effort to control global technology supply chains. This has fueled speculation that the Trump administration will increase investment in developing a domestic supply chain to reduce U.S. dependency on China. The new rules come ahead of a planned meeting between President Xi Jinping and President Donald Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has granted a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, who was convicted of killing his two-year-old daughter in 2002 based on a "shaken baby syndrome" diagnosis. The court's decision allows for a re-examination of the case under a 2013 Texas law that permits review of convictions based on scientific evidence that has since been discredited or evolved. Roberson has consistently maintained his daughter's death was due to pneumonia complications, and his lawyers argue the conviction was based on outdated medical theories. The lead detective on the original case now believes Roberson is innocent.</p>

          <p>This essay examines the phenomenon of "collective illusions," where individuals privately disagree with a majority opinion but remain silent out of fear, thus reinforcing the false consensus. Drawing on survey data showing widespread self-silencing in the U.S. on sensitive topics, the author argues this dynamic harms both democracy and individual well-being. The article proposes a solution inspired by Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay "Self-Reliance": stop expressing views you don't hold, reframe ideological independence as a strength, and quietly withdraw from social circles that demand conformity rather than engaging in direct confrontation.</p>

In return, the Israel Defense Forces will withdraw to a pre-agreed "yellow line" within Gaza. The release of the approximately 20 living hostages is expected to occur within 72 hours of the Israeli government's ratification, signaling a significant step toward de-escalating the conflict.</p>
