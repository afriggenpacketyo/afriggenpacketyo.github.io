          <p>Edan Alexander, an American-Israeli hostage held by Hamas for 584 days, was recently reunited with his family in a deal brokered by the Trump administration. His parents recounted the emotional moment they learned of his impending release and their subsequent journey to Israel to meet him, expressing immense gratitude to the U.S. government. They detailed the challenges Edan faced during captivity, including injuries sustained during the initial attack and the constant fear of bombings, which at one point caused a tunnel to collapse. Despite his ordeal, Edan is now focused on spending time with his family, while his parents continue to advocate for the release of the remaining hostages.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden has been diagnosed with an "aggressive" form of prostate cancer that has metastasized to his bones after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms, according to his office. Despite the advanced stage, the cancer is reportedly hormone-sensitive, which may allow for effective treatment options that Biden and his family are currently reviewing. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in American men, with diagnosis rates increasing since 2014. Experts emphasize the importance of early screening for successful treatment, noting that many symptoms may also be due to an enlarged prostate, a common condition among older men.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's takeover of the U.S. Institute of Peace (USIP) was unlawful, deeming the efforts by the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to dismantle the agency "null and void." The ruling asserts that President Trump exceeded his constitutional authority by unilaterally attempting to disband the USIP, a think tank supporting the executive and legislative branches. Judge Beryl Howell criticized the administration's use of law enforcement to forcibly take over the agency, calling it a "gross usurpation of power" that traumatized USIP employees. The administration is expected to appeal the ruling.</p>

          <p>The UK and the European Union have reached a new agreement aimed at resetting relations post-Brexit, covering areas including trade, defense, fishing, and youth mobility. The deal includes potential benefits for UK food exporters through reduced checks, but requires the UK to align with future EU food standards. Fishing access is extended for EU vessels in UK waters for 12 more years, drawing criticism from some UK fishing groups. The agreement also aims to facilitate youth mobility and potentially allow British tourists to use eGates at EU airports. However, key details and financial contributions from the UK remain under negotiation.</p>

          <p>Greggs, the popular UK bakery chain, is trialing a new policy of moving self-serve food and drinks behind the counter in select stores to combat increasing shoplifting. The measure is being tested in locations with higher levels of antisocial behavior, including Whitechapel in London. This decision comes as shoplifting offenses recorded by the police rose by 20% in 2024, and retailers report even higher numbers of thefts. While the change is not expected to be implemented across all 2,600 Greggs bakeries, it may be rolled out to sites with high levels of theft, prioritizing the safety of colleagues and customers.</p>

Yatra, who gained fame with hits like "Traicionera" and "Robarte un Beso," has embraced a deeper connection with spirituality since his teenage years. He also reflected on his experiences with the animated film "Encanto" and his Broadway debut in "Chicago," viewing life as a video game to avoid taking himself too seriously.</p>

Additionally, the agreement lacks concrete commitments for easing touring restrictions for British bands in Europe and securing mutual recognition of UK qualifications in the EU.

          <p>JPMorgan Chase will now allow its clients to purchase bitcoin, despite CEO Jamie Dimon's longstanding criticism of the cryptocurrency. Dimon clarified that the bank will not custody bitcoin but will include it in client statements. This decision signals a significant step in bitcoin's entry into mainstream investing, even as Dimon remains skeptical, citing concerns about money laundering, lack of clarity surrounding ownership, and illicit activities. The move follows Morgan Stanley's decision to allow its financial advisors to pitch some spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds to qualifying clients since August.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that the islands of Mbanie, Conga, and Cocoteros, located off the coast of Gabon, legally belong to Equatorial Guinea, resolving a decades-long territorial dispute. The islands, controlled by Gabon since 1972, are potentially rich in oil and gas. The court rejected Gabon's claim based on a 1974 treaty, the Bata Convention, and instead upheld a treaty from 1900 that divided French and Spanish colonial assets, handing the islands to Spain, from which Equatorial Guinea gained independence. As a result, Gabonese troops will have to leave their base on Mbanie.</p>
