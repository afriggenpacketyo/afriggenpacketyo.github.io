          <p>Bernalillo County sheriff's deputies in New Mexico successfully de-escalated a tense situation involving two young boys, ages 7 and 9, who were found holding a loaded handgun in a residential backyard. The deputies utilized a drone to gain a crucial vantage point, allowing them to communicate with the children while maintaining cover. After about five minutes of dialogue, deputies deployed a non-lethal projectile and safely retrieved the weapon, averting potential tragedy. Sheriff John Allen emphasized the drone's effectiveness in de-escalating conflicts, particularly in sensitive situations involving children, and noted the department had visited the home over 50 times due to domestic violence issues, working to provide the family with trauma therapy and behavioral support.</p>

          <p>Microsoft is set to lay off 3% of its global workforce across various levels, teams, and locations, as announced on Tuesday. The company cites the need to adapt to a dynamic marketplace as the primary reason for these organizational changes. Despite reporting strong quarterly results and an optimistic forecast in late April, Microsoft is proceeding with these cuts, which are expected to impact thousands of employees. A company spokesperson clarified that these layoffs are not performance-based, distinguishing them from a smaller round of performance-based layoffs that occurred in January, and this new round of job cuts will be Microsoft's largest since the elimination of 10,000 roles in 2023.</p>

          <p>Stadium concerts, while popular and lucrative for artists, are increasingly criticized for providing a subpar experience for fans. Attendees have cited issues ranging from obstructed views and poor acoustics to chaotic VIP sections and high ticket prices. The article suggests that these large-scale events often prioritize social media content over genuine musical enjoyment, with many concertgoers more focused on posting online than fully engaging with the performance. Despite the communal aspect of sharing a live experience with thousands of others, the practical challenges of stadium concerts can detract from the overall value for fans.</p>

          <p>Following recent trade talks between the US and China, both nations claimed victory after most of President Trump's "Liberation Day" tariffs were removed. However, some analysts argue that Beijing emerged with the upper hand, reinforcing its geopolitical position and consolidating its status as a credible counterweight to Washington. China entered the negotiations from a position of strength, having learned from previous dealings with Trump and preparing for years. The real significance, therefore, lies in the performative dimension of power projection, which could prove more valuable over the long term than immediate economic gains.</p>

          <p>For homeowners nearing retirement, tapping into home equity can be a strategic way to bolster savings. Options include taking out a HELOC as a safety net, downsizing and investing the proceeds, refinancing the mortgage for cash, or using a reverse mortgage for steady income. Experts advise carefully considering the terms and risks associated with each option, such as variable interest rates on HELOCs or potential foreclosure with reverse mortgages. Consulting with a financial advisor can help homeowners make informed decisions to meet their retirement goals.</p>
