          <p>Los Angeles has emerged as a center of resistance against increased immigration raids, with community patrols and support networks forming to aid vulnerable immigrants. Activists and organizations are protesting the Trump administration's anti-immigrant policies, which have led to detentions in public spaces like factories and shopping centers. Community members are providing resources like free food and legal assistance to those affected by the raids. The article highlights the historical context of anti-immigrant sentiment and the contributions of Latino immigrants to the United States, emphasizing the importance of solidarity and advocacy in the face of government actions.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that plastic bag bans and fees are effective in reducing shoreline pollution, with areas implementing these policies seeing up to a 47% reduction in plastic bag waste. The study analyzed data from over 45,000 beach cleanups between 2016 and 2023, finding that fee-based policies were more effective than full or partial bans. California's experience with plastic bag regulations, including a statewide ban with a loophole for thicker plastic bags, highlights the importance of well-designed policies. The research also suggests that plastic bag laws may reduce harm to marine life, with a decrease in entangled animals in areas with such regulations.</p>

Directed by Danny Boyle and written by Alex Garland, the film adopts an ambitious position by extending its geographical coverage and introducing a supposedly idyllic community serving as a safe haven. The story follows a family tested by the virus outbreak, with a particular focus on the character Spike, portrayed by Alfie Williams, who evolves from a child of the apocalypse to a child of war. The film explores themes of survival and the human condition in a world threatened by various types of evolved creatures, offering a visually engaging experience that is both impressive and challenging.</p>

          <p>The review describes "28 Years Later" as a kooky spectacle with unusual ambition, quirky side characters, and maniacal editing, though tonally ungainly. The film picks up nearly three decades into a viral pandemic, focusing on a community on Lindisfarne, isolated from the world. Spike, a young character, embarks on a coming-of-age journey, but the film's editing and score create an abrasive and confounding experience. The filmmakers suggest that humankind's natural state is struggle and division, with the infected splitting into different sub-species, and the movie challenges the audience to consider who the real savages are.</p>
