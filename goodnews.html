          <p>Twenty-four-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic advanced to the US Open fourth round, defeating Britain's Cameron Norrie 6-4 6-7 (3-7) 6-2 6-3 in a nearly three-hour contest. Djokovic battled a lower back injury, requiring medical time-outs, yet demonstrated remarkable resilience and an improved serve, ultimately ending British singles interest in the tournament. Norrie, reflecting on his performance, admitted to being "a little overconfident" after an early break in the third set but acknowledged Djokovic's ability to elevate his game when it mattered most. This article highlights the Serb's enduring dominance and Norrie's positive perspective on his career trajectory despite the loss, noting the challenging conditions and Djokovic's strategic play.</p>

          <p>All SkyWest Airlines flights were grounded for 21 minutes on Friday night across the United States at the request of the airline, according to the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). A ground stop advisory was issued at 0149 GMT and canceled at 0210 GMT, with no immediate details provided by SkyWest regarding the cause of the disruption. This article highlights a significant, albeit brief, disruption to air travel, affecting operations for major carriers like United, Delta, American, and Alaska Airlines, for which SkyWest is the largest regional partner.

          <p>A 10-mile section of the scenic Angeles Crest Highway (Highway 2) has reopened just in time for Labor Day weekend, after years of closure due to severe storm damage and the 2024 Bridge fire. Heavy rains during consecutive stormy winters triggered slope failures, rock slides, and collapsed pavement, necessitating $7.9 million in repairs including new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. This article highlights the restoration of a crucial route connecting to popular hiking trails, which is expected to alleviate overcrowding and enhance public access. However, the reopening coincides with extreme fire danger warnings for the Angeles National Forest, raising concerns among the local hiking community about timing and safety.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has unanimously blocked the Trump administration's plans to end Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for 600,000 Venezuelans, allowing them to continue living and working in the US. The court upheld a lower court ruling, finding that the Homeland Security Secretary lacked authority to vacate a prior TPS extension, and that Congress designed TPS to be predictable and insulated from politics. This article highlights a significant legal victory for immigrant advocates, despite the DHS condemning the decision as "obstruction from unelected activist judges." The ruling aims to provide stability for TPS holders, though the immediate impact on those whose protections already expired remains unclear, prompting calls for further action.</p>

This article highlights a significant shift in beverage trends, with chains like Blank Street Coffee gaining cult followings for their diverse matcha offerings and TikTok appeal. Analysts attribute Costa's challenges to changing preferences for healthier, more unique drinks, rising coffee prices, and the growth of smaller, artisanal cafes that offer a more curated experience.
