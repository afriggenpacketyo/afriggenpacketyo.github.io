          <p>After securing a victory in the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at Watkins Glen, 19-year-old driver Connor Zilisch sustained a broken collarbone in a bizarre accident. During his celebration, he climbed onto his car's roof, slipped, and fell headfirst onto the ground. Zilisch was transported to a hospital where he was confirmed to be awake and alert, with CT scans of his head coming back clear. The incident capped an eventful day for the driver, who had battled back from an earlier wreck in the race to win.</p>

          <p>The Japanese practice of shinrin-yoku, or "forest bathing," is growing in popularity as a mindfulness technique for improving mental well-being. The practice involves immersing oneself in nature and connecting with the environment through all senses to lower stress and enhance focus.

          <p>Billy Wilder's iconic 1950 film noir, "Sunset Boulevard," is being celebrated on its 75th anniversary with a new 4K restoration. The article examines the movie's lasting impact, its sharp critique of Hollywood, and its iconic performances by Gloria Swanson and William Holden. It also traces the film's legacy through its successful stage adaptation by Andrew Lloyd Webber, which recently saw a Tony-winning Broadway revival starring Nicole Scherzinger, demonstrating the story's timeless resonance.</p>

          <p>In a humorous commentary, author David Sedaris explores the modern dilemma of digital tipping prompts, particularly in situations with minimal human service. He describes the internal conflict of feeling like a cheapskate for not selecting a 20% or 22% tip at a self-service airport kiosk, despite having done most of the work himself. Sedaris uses his signature wit to capture the awkwardness and guilt associated with navigating the evolving etiquette of gratuities in an increasingly automated world.</p>

          <h2>Environmental Scientist Rebuts Common Climate Change Myth on Social Media</h2>

          <p>In a widely shared video, an environmental scientist debunked the common myth that current global warming is merely part of a natural cycle. She acknowledged that the Earth undergoes natural warming and cooling periods but emphasized that scientific data overwhelmingly shows human activity has drastically accelerated the current trend. By releasing unprecedented levels of greenhouse gases, human influence has caused the planet to heat up far more rapidly than in natural cycles, leading to more extreme weather events.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Cardiologists are advising individuals with high blood pressure to avoid taking licorice root supplements. The active compound in licorice, glycyrrhizin, can significantly raise blood pressure by causing the body to retain sodium and lose potassium, placing additional strain on the cardiovascular system. Doctors warn that consuming licorice in any form, including teas and candies, can be dangerous for those with hypertension and recommend focusing on proven lifestyle changes like a healthy diet and exercise.</p>

Son's arrival, for a reported MLS record transfer fee, was met with a warm reception from fans, which he noted was a pleasant contrast to the booing he often faced in away games in the Premier League.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to an expert who assists Americans in moving abroad, Albania is a top overlooked European destination for expats. The country's primary appeal lies in its affordability, with significantly lower costs for rent, dining, and healthcare compared to the U.S. and much of Western Europe. A major draw for Americans is the ability to live in Albania for up to one year without a visa, providing a unique opportunity to "test drive" life abroad without complex paperwork.</p>
