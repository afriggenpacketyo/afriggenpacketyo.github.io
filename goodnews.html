          <p>The Transportation Security Administration has reportedly begun phasing out the requirement for passengers in standard security lines to remove their shoes at several U.S. airports. While an official policy change has not been broadly announced, sources and travelers confirm the practice has stopped at airports including BWI, PHL, and LAX. This change aligns the standard screening process more closely with the TSA PreCheck program, where shoe removal is not required. The TSA stated it is always exploring ways to enhance the passenger experience while maintaining strong security.</p>

          <p>The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) will terminate its partnership with the online education company Simplilearn following a class-action lawsuit. The suit alleged that the university and the firm misled students by marketing a cybersecurity "boot camp" as closely tied to Caltech, when the connection was minimal. As part of the settlement, Simplilearn will refund $2.4 million in tuition to hundreds of students. The case is seen as a significant outcome for critics of the growing online program management industry, which often leverages university brands with little academic oversight.</p>

          <p>President Trump has announced that the U.S. will resume sending defensive weapons to Ukraine to help the nation defend itself against Russian aggression. The statement comes just days after the White House confirmed a temporary halt on some shipments, which was attributed to a review of dwindling U.S. military stockpiles. Trump emphasized the need for Ukraine to be able to defend itself, stating that "so many people are dying in that mess." The U.S. has provided tens of billions in aid since Russia's full-scale invasion began.</p>

          <p>The Department of Veterans Affairs has reversed its plan to conduct large-scale layoffs, stating that a reduction of 30,000 employees through attrition and a hiring freeze has made the cuts unnecessary. The agency had previously considered a reduction-in-force (RIF) to bring its staff levels back to what they were in 2019, which would have meant cutting over 80,000 jobs. VA Secretary Doug Collins said the department is now "headed in the right direction" but will continue to seek improvements. Critics argue the staff reduction is due to a "toxic work environment" and will negatively impact veteran care.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was named to the National League All-Star team for the 11th time in his career, this time as a "Legend Pick" by the commissioner. The selection, which recognizes his career accomplishments, came as a surprise to the 37-year-old pitcher, who has only made nine starts this season after returning from surgery. Kershaw expressed gratitude for the "tremendous honor," describing the selection as "weird but cool." He is now tied for the most All-Star selections among active MLB players.</p>

          <p>South Korea has canceled a $2.2 billion plan to purchase 36 additional AH-64E Apache attack helicopters, a decision reportedly influenced by the war in Ukraine. A South Korean lawmaker stated that the vulnerability of traditional platforms like helicopters to modern air defenses and drones prompted the move. The funds will instead be redirected toward developing and acquiring more advanced capabilities, such as drones and smart systems, that reflect the realities of the future battlefield. The decision signals a potential shift in military procurement strategies globally.</p>

          <p>Police in Budapest have announced they will not pursue legal action against individuals who participated in the city's Pride parade, even though the event had been officially prohibited by the government. Authorities cited public uncertainty over the event's legal status, which was fueled by Budapest's mayor declaring it an official municipal event. This decision comes amid a broader anti-LGBTQ+ agenda from Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government. Despite the ban and threat of fines, the march attracted a record crowd of over 200,000 people.</p>

Thousands of sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted for financial shortfalls caused by the faulty Horizon IT system. Many lost their homes, businesses, and were even imprisoned in one of the UK's largest miscarriages of justice. While this report will address redress for victims, the second part, which will assign blame for the scandal, is not expected until 2026.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Market analyst Jim Cramer has advised investors not to overreact to President Trump's latest tariff announcements, suggesting the threatened rates are not "meaningful" and likely represent a starting point for negotiations. He argued that the administration has a history of postponing or reducing tariffs and that the ultimate goal may be to boost U.S. exports rather than to implement the steep levies as announced. While acknowledging the market's negative reaction, Cramer believes the tariffs may not significantly impact inflation or Federal Reserve policy if they are indeed part of a broader negotiating strategy.
