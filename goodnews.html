          <p>A small, 3.0 magnitude earthquake occurred Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey, causing brief shaking felt across the New York City area. While the event startled residents, with some reporting it felt like an impact or explosion, no significant damage or injuries have been reported. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that such minor quakes are not uncommon for the region, though they are infrequent. This event follows a more significant 4.8 magnitude earthquake that shook the same area in April 2024, which was one of the largest on the East Coast in the last century.</p>

          <p>Despite a steep 66% drop in its second weekend, "The Fantastic Four: First Steps" remained at the top of the North American box office, earning $40 million. The Marvel film's global total has now reached $369 million. The weekend's new releases, the animated comedy "The Bad Guys 2" and the reboot "The Naked Gun," secured the second and third spots with $22 million and $17 million, respectively. Analysts noted the significant drop for the superhero film was surprising given its positive reviews, highlighting the challenges facing the summer box office in reaching its $4 billion target.</p>

          <p>A new series from NPR's 'Embedded' podcast, titled 'Tested,' investigates the complex and controversial history of gender and sex testing in competitive sports. The series examines the evolution of these tests and delves into the ongoing debate about what constitutes fairness in athletic competitions. It explores how sports governing bodies have attempted to define and regulate biological advantages, often with profound impacts on athletes' careers and lives. The podcast aims to provide a comprehensive look at the scientific, ethical, and personal dimensions of this contentious issue.</p>

          <p>Pauline Ferrand-Prévot has won the Tour de France Femmes, making her the first French cyclist to claim victory since the women's edition of the race was re-established four years ago. The 33-year-old cross-country champion finished the grueling nine-day race with a commanding lead of over three minutes. Ferrand-Prévot had shifted her focus from mountain biking back to road racing this season specifically to compete in the Tour. Her victory marks the culmination of a successful season that also saw her win the prestigious Paris-Roubaix classic in April.</p>

Rodman, who had been sidelined with a back issue since April, was visibly emotional after scoring her first goal for the club in nearly a year. She described the injury as the hardest thing she has had to go through. The win moves the Spirit into second place in the National Women's Soccer League standings as the team returns to play following the league's six-week summer break.</p>

          <p>Florida has surpassed California in new utility-scale solar energy capacity, adding over 3 gigawatts last year, a surge driven primarily by large utilities rather than rooftop installations. Analysts attribute the boom to favorable economics, as solar has become a cheaper option than natural gas, and a state rule that fast-tracks the approval process for projects. However, the industry faces headwinds from the rollback of federal tax credits and growing constraints on the electrical grid. The growth highlights a shift where cost-effectiveness, not just environmental policy, is a primary driver for renewable energy expansion.</p>

          <p>The final Test match between England and India is set for a tense conclusion, with England needing 35 runs to win and India requiring four wickets. After being in a difficult position, a remarkable partnership between Joe Root and Harry Brook, who both scored centuries, brought England back into contention for a historic run chase. However, a late collapse saw both centurions dismissed, leaving the match on a knife-edge before bad light stopped play. The outcome will determine the series winner, with England aiming for their biggest series victory of the Bazball era.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), announced that applications for a new $50 billion rural hospital fund will be available in early September.

Dr. Oz also defended changes to Medicaid, including new work requirements, stating that technology will be used to streamline implementation and connect recipients with jobs. He argued the goal is to save the program and help vulnerable populations by promoting work and self-sufficiency.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0, relying on situational hitting and aggressive baserunning rather than power to break a scoring drought. After being shut out for 18 consecutive innings, the Dodgers manufactured runs through timely singles, a double-steal, and a sacrifice fly. Pitcher Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen closed out the game to secure a 5-4 record on their nine-game road trip. The victory provides some positive momentum for the team's slumping lineup as they head back home.</p>

          <p>A number of former Justice Department attorneys and officials are seeking public office for the first time, motivated by what they describe as the politicization of the agency under President Trump. These candidates, who resigned from their career positions, are now running for offices ranging from the U.S. House to state attorney general. They are openly criticizing the administration's policies, such as the dismantling of anti-corruption and civil rights divisions, and are campaigning on a platform of restoring the rule of law. Their candidacies represent a new trend of career public servants entering the political arena in direct response to administration actions.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is planning a compensation scheme for consumers who were victims of mis-sold car finance deals involving hidden commissions. Following a Supreme Court ruling that deemed extremely high commissions unfair, the FCA will consult on a plan that could cost the industry between £9bn and £18bn. Payouts are expected to be less than £950 per deal, with the first payments anticipated next year for agreements dating back to 2007. The FCA has advised affected consumers to complain directly to their loan providers rather than using claims management companies.</p>

He recovered by successfully executing a challenging one-stop tyre strategy that ultimately paid off. The victory sets the stage for a close and intense battle between the two McLaren drivers for the Formula 1 title in the second half of the season.</p>
