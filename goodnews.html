          <p>A recent government report indicates that Japan is lagging behind many other countries in addressing gender inequality, particularly in increasing the representation of women in leadership roles. Despite setting a goal in 2003 to raise the share of women in leadership positions to about 30 percent by 2020, the target was later delayed due to insufficient progress. The report acknowledges that current efforts remain inadequate, as reflected in Japan's low ranking in the World Economic Forum's Global Gender Gap Index. The government plans to intensify efforts to advance gender equality by ensuring women have more opportunities to participate in decision-making across various sectors.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese exports to major industrial centers in Southeast Asia have risen significantly in the first five months of the year, driven by growing consumer markets and offshore factory investments. Shipments to Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia have increased by double-digit percentages, offsetting losses from high US tariffs. Chinese manufacturers are increasingly shipping goods to factory sites in Southeast Asia for local sale or re-export to Western countries, including the US. This diversification of exports reflects closer economic and investment relations between China and Southeast Asian nations, although some exports may be transshipped to avoid US tariffs.</p>

          <p>Japan and the United States plan to hold summit talks between Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and President Donald Trump in Canada on the sidelines of the Group of Seven leaders' meeting in mid-June. Prior to the summit, Japan's chief tariff negotiator Ryosei Akazawa will visit Washington for the sixth round of ministerial-level negotiations on the Trump tariffs. Japan seeks the removal of tariffs on cars, steel, and aluminum, but is considering accepting reduced tariff rates due to the United States' refusal to eliminate them entirely. The two countries aim to reach a deal as early as possible, focusing on boosting investment and reducing the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. (not investment advice)</p>

This move will reduce the country's rice reserve to around 100,000 tons, down from approximately 910,000 tons before the government began releasing stocks in March and April.

          <p>A new report by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) warns of an 'unprecedented decline' in world fertility rates, with many people unable to have their desired number of children due to financial limitations and lack of suitable partners.

The report urges caution in response to low fertility, warning against panicky policies and nationalist, anti-migrant, and gender-conservative measures.

Researchers suggest possible factors include wider Narcan distribution, weaker fentanyl potency, increased addiction healthcare, and safer drug choices among Gen Z.
