          <p>Seattle Mariners slugger Cal Raleigh has etched his name in baseball history by hitting his 48th and 49th home runs of the season, establishing a new single-season record for catchers in major league baseball. This remarkable achievement surpassed Salvador Perez’s 2021 total with the Kansas City Royals. Raleigh's record-breaking performance also marked his ninth multi-home run game of the season, setting a new major league record for switch-hitters, surpassing Mickey Mantle. A first-time All-Star at 28, Raleigh's recent success follows a lucrative six-year, $105 million contract extension and his victory at the All-Star Home Run Derby, solidifying his status as a prominent force in the sport.</p>

Featuring a lively children's parade and the early morning J'ouvert celebration, Europe's largest street party saw thousands of revellers adorned in bright costumes, enjoying diverse musical performances, towering sound systems, and an array of Caribbean food stalls. Despite earlier funding challenges that jeopardized its future, the event underscored a powerful display of community spirit and multiculturalism, attracting over a million attendees. While police reported 140 arrests, the carnival also paused for a poignant 72-second silence to commemorate the 72 lives lost in the Grenfell Tower fire.</p>

With maximum sustained winds of 45 mph, Fernand poses no immediate threat of landfall to coastal communities. This development follows Hurricane Erin, which became a Category 5 storm earlier in the season. NOAA had predicted an above-normal hurricane season this year, anticipating between 13 and 18 named storms, emphasizing continued vigilance in the region.</p>

          <p>Manchester United's new £200 million attacking trio, featuring Matheus Cunha, Bryan Mbeumo, and Benjamin Sesko, is experiencing significant "teething problems" with a notable lack of goals from open play in their initial Premier League matches. Despite substantial summer investment, the team has managed only one open-play goal in four games, raising concerns about the coherence and effectiveness of their frontline. Manager Ruben Amorim, however, remains optimistic, pointing to numerous chances created and emphasizing the need for the new players to adapt to the team's style and integrate with each other. The article highlights the growing pressure on United to improve their performance as they currently sit 16th in the league standings, with a crucial match against newly promoted Burnley approaching.</p>

          <p>The Powerball lottery jackpot has dramatically increased to an estimated $750 million, positioning it as the game's tenth-largest grand prize, after no ticket matched all winning numbers in Saturday's drawing.

Although the top prize remains unclaimed, several winning tickets were sold for smaller prizes, including three that matched all five white balls in New York, Maine, and South Dakota. The odds of securing the grand prize are a challenging 1 in 292.2 million, with the next drawing scheduled for Monday evening. This marks an extended period without a jackpot winner since May 31, fueling anticipation among prospective players. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>SpaceX is gearing up for the 10th test launch of its colossal Starship rocket, the largest ever constructed, from its facility near Boca Chica Beach, Texas. The flight aims to rigorously test the Super Heavy booster's landing burns over the Gulf of Mexico and the Starship upper stage's suborbital trajectory, which includes an attempt to deploy simulated satellites. This critical launch follows a series of recent test failures, but SpaceX founder Elon Musk maintains a public stance of learning and iteration from each event. Starship is a cornerstone for NASA's ambitious plans to land astronauts on the moon by 2027 and Musk's long-term vision of colonizing Mars, despite the significant developmental challenges.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer analyzes the stock market's recent "rip higher," attributing it to Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's signals for impending interest rate cuts, primarily driven by concerns over a dramatic deceleration in hiring rather than tariffs alone. He delves into the varied prospects of the "Magnificent Seven" megacap tech stocks, each facing distinct issues, and highlights an "outrageously bullish narrative" for sectors like housing, mergers and acquisitions (M&A), and initial public offerings (IPOs), all buoyed by the "don't fight the Fed" sentiment. Cramer also identifies vulnerable areas, such as enterprise software, and warns of potential market volatility in September due to profit-taking and anticipated joblessness, despite the positive Fed outlook.

          <p>Jerry Adler, a revered figure who spent decades as a stage manager, producer, and director on Broadway before transitioning to a successful acting career in his 60s, has passed away peacefully at the age of 96. Adler was widely recognized for his memorable roles as Tony Soprano's adviser Hesh Rabkin in "The Sopranos" and law partner Howard Lyman in "The Good Wife." His unexpected pivot to acting, which he humorously described as saving him from a "mediocre career," led to over 30 years of consistent work across film and television. Adler, who published a memoir last year, firmly believed in staying active, famously stating, "I think retirement is a road to nowhere."</p>

The month-long project, built on an old utility trailer, prioritized efficiency, incorporating features like a compact AC/heating unit, a tilting bed in the vaulted loft, and solar panels for power. Kelly personally tested the tiny house during a snowstorm and for camping with his son, confirming its resilience and coziness.
