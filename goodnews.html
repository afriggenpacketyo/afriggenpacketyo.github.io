          <h2>Popular Destinations Grapple with Environmental Impact of Overtourism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-03 03:53:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many popular holiday destinations are struggling with the environmental impact of excessive visitor numbers, known as overtourism. Overtourism strains infrastructure and local resources, leading to noise, littering, and damage to landscapes and water resources. Emissions from tourism are increasing, with air travel being a major contributor to the climate crisis. Some cities and regions are implementing measures to limit travelers, such as taxes, access restrictions, and digital booking systems, while others are promoting attractions outside city centers or rewarding climate-friendly travel.</p>

          <p>A primary school in east London has restricted pupils to indoor activities after a buzzard nested in the playground and began dive-bombing residents. Dame Tipping Primary School is working with Havering Council and the RSPCA to manage the situation, as buzzards are a protected species. Head teacher Stella McCarthy said the school is using the situation as a learning opportunity, educating children about the bird and its behavior. The school is also trying to allow children to play outside where possible, while taking precautions to mitigate risks.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Red Bull made two key mistakes during the Spanish Grand Prix, first by ordering Max Verstappen to give back a position after contact with George Russell, and second by pitting Verstappen for fresh hard tires under the safety car. The stewards later ruled that no further action was needed regarding the Verstappen-Russell incident, suggesting Verstappen could have justifiably kept the place. Christian Horner, Red Bull's team principal, admitted that the decision to pit Verstappen for hard tires was also incorrect. Verstappen himself questioned the tire strategy after returning to the track.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom will increase defense spending and undertake sweeping changes to its military, including building new nuclear-powered attack submarines and preparing its army to fight in Europe. Prime Minister Keir Starmer said the changes are designed to address the threat posed by Russia and to signal Europe's commitment to its own defense. The measures include increasing weapons production, investing in cyber command, and developing new drone technology. The government aims to increase defense spending to 2.5% of national income by 2027 and potentially 3% before 2034.</p>
