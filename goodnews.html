          <p>The offshore yuan experienced a surge against the US dollar amidst ongoing US-China trade discussions, fueled by optimistic reports of potential breakthroughs. The currency moved from 7.24 to 7.22 per US dollar, reflecting market anticipation of constructive outcomes from the Geneva negotiations. These talks, the first formal discussions since increased tariffs by both nations, aim to alleviate trade tensions that have disrupted global supply chains and heightened recession risks. Both sides have indicated 'substantial progress,' raising hopes for a joint statement detailing the agreements made during the meeting, which could lead to a reduction in tariffs. Optimism has increased as the world awaits news of potential agreements which may be announced soon.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced plans to sign an executive order to lower medication costs by tying Medicare payments for drugs administered in doctors' offices to the lowest price paid by other nations. This initiative, dubbed the 'most favored nation' policy, aims to address complaints about high U.S. drug prices compared to other wealthy countries. The proposal, which would primarily affect drugs covered by Medicare Part B, faces strong opposition from the pharmaceutical industry, which argues it could stifle innovation. Similar attempts by Trump during his first term were blocked by courts, citing procedural issues, and the Biden administration later abandoned the plan due to stakeholder concerns. The proposed policy is likely to only impact certain drugs covered by Medicare and given in an office, such as infusions that treat cancer and other injectables.</p>

          <p>The UK's Eurovision entry, Remember Monday, a country-pop trio, is heading to Basel, Switzerland, aiming to improve on past UK performances with their song 'What The Hell Just Happened.' The band has been touring Europe, promoting their song and engaging with fans, after quitting their jobs to pursue music full-time. Formed over a decade ago, the band members have a diverse background, including musical theater and teaching. The group hopes to bring a theatrical, girl-band concert feeling to their Eurovision performance. The trio has been working hard to immerse themselves in Eurovision and are hopeful for a good result, with a placement in the single digits being their goal.</p>

          <p>Investors reacted optimistically to reports of progress in US-China trade negotiations, although specific details remained undisclosed. Meetings between US and Chinese officials in Geneva concluded with both sides claiming 'substantial progress' and calling the talks 'candid, in-depth, and constructive.' The meetings marked the first formal negotiations since President Trump increased tariffs on Chinese imports to 145 percent, prompting retaliatory measures from China. Analysts at Wedbush Securities described the talks as a 'positive step in the right direction,' anticipating a potential initial agreement involving reduced tariff levels. The escalating trade war has raised concerns about a possible economic downturn, particularly in Asia, where economies heavily rely on trade with both China and the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration is temporarily banning imports of cattle, horses, and bison through southern border ports due to the spread of New World Screwworm (NWS) in Mexico. USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins announced the suspension, citing concerns over the devastating impact of NWS on livestock. NWS fly maggots can burrow into the flesh of living animals, causing serious and often deadly damage. The USDA said NWS was recently detected in remote farms as far north as 700 miles from the U.S. border. The U.S. and Mexico are collaborating to eradicate NWS, employing strategies including field surveillance, animal movement control, and sterile insect dispersal. The suspension will continue monthly until containment is achieved.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Taiwan are facing criticism for removing the 'Han' category from demographic groups listed on the official information page, a move seen as an effort to distance the island from mainland China. The change categorizes Han Chinese, the majority on both sides of the Taiwan Strait, as 'other population.' This action comes as Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) intensifies efforts to promote the island's indigenous identity while gradually eroding its historical and cultural ties with the mainland. The revised web page now states that Taiwan's registered population is 2.6% indigenous, 1.2% foreign, and 96.2% other population, prompting criticism from the KMT party for denying history.</p>

He notes that the US is recognizing the consequences of extreme tariffs, including weak economic data and instability in the dollar. Yao believes the first step towards a resolution is for both sides to roll back tariffs to a more manageable level, such as the original 34 percent. He also mentions potential US demands in negotiations, such as China buying more American goods.

          <p>Japan's health insurance system, globally recognized for supporting a long-lived population, is facing strain from a shrinking workforce and aging population, becoming entangled in political maneuvering ahead of key elections. The system, ensuring affordable medical care through capped out-of-pocket costs, is now subject to rushed reforms driven by electoral pressures, analysts warn. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's government aims to secure funds for child-rearing steps, partly from medical system savings, but faced backlash for proposing increased burdens on high medical cost patients. The government has since frozen the hikes, pushing the deadline for a new plan after the upper house election, indicating the system's vulnerability to political influence.</p>

          <p>The U.S. has halted all imports of live cattle, horses, and bison across the Southern border due to concerns over the spread of the New World screwworm in Mexico. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins made the decision, citing the northward spread of the parasite. New World screwworms are fly larvae that burrow into wounds or mucous membranes of animals and rarely humans, feeding on flesh and blood. The U.S. and Mexico were able to eradicate the screwworm in the 1960s and '70s by releasing sterile adult flies. The new ban will continue on a 'month-by-month basis, until a significant window of containment is achieved'.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug costs by aligning them with what other wealthy countries pay, an idea that was blocked in court during his first term. The proposal, which he calls a 'most favored nation' pricing model, is likely to be subject to challenges in court, especially without action by Congress. The pharmaceutical industry bitterly opposes the idea, which would almost certainly cut into its profits, and has been lobbying against it. In his first term, Mr. Trump tried unsuccessfully to enact a version of this idea for Medicare, but a federal court blocked it.</p>

Manufacturers often use protein as a marketing tool, adding protein-rich ingredients to reach required levels for labeling claims.

Both drugs led to substantial weight loss, but Mounjaro's 20% weight reduction after 72 weeks exceeded the 14% from Wegovy. Researchers said both drugs have a role, but Mounjaro may help those with more weight to lose. The trial, paid for by Mounjaro's manufacturer, involved 750 obese people and showed that 32% of people lost a quarter of their body weight on Mounjaro, compared to 16% on Wegovy.
