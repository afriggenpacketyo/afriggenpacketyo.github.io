          <p>A new educational comic aims to illuminate the vast and largely unexplored world of Earth's oceans. The article highlights fascinating facts, such as the ocean producing about half of the world's oxygen and being the source of key medicines. Despite its importance, scientists acknowledge that humanity has seen less than 0.001% of the deep sea floor, knowing more about outer space than our own planet's marine depths. The comic serves as an engaging medium to share what is known about marine science and the incredible life that exists within the ocean.</p>

          <p>In an inflationary economy, Certificates of Deposit (CDs) offer a secure way for savers to protect and grow their money, with top accounts currently yielding rates that outpace inflation. This article provides an overview of current national average CD rates for various terms and highlights that online banks often offer significantly higher returns. It explains the concept of an inverted yield curve, where short-term CDs presently have higher rates than long-term ones, and suggests strategies like laddering to maximize earnings.

          <p>The UK government is reviving the Pensions Commission to tackle a looming retirement savings crisis, warning that pensioners in 2050 could be worse off than today's retirees. With nearly half of working-age adults not saving into a private pension, the commission will explore ways to boost retirement savings, particularly among the self-employed, low earners, and certain ethnic groups. The Department for Work and Pensions highlighted stark disparities, including a significant gender gap in private pension wealth. The government has also commissioned a new review of the state pension age.</p>

          <p>To combat "neijuan," or involution—a cycle of excessive and inefficient competition—China must stimulate domestic demand and foster innovation-led growth, according to analysts. A report from China International Capital Corporation (CICC) argues that expanding the market through increased demand can create a more favorable environment for businesses. The analysts suggest that companies should focus on research and development to offer differentiated products, breaking the self-defeating pattern where firms invest more resources for diminishing returns. They also emphasize the need for supportive top-down macroeconomic policies.</p>

          <p>High-net-worth individuals are increasingly turning to gold as a safe-haven asset, with some financial institutions reporting that affluent clients have more than doubled their allocations this year. Investors are using various methods, from buying fractions of unallocated gold bars held in bank vaults to stashing physical bullions in high-security facilities like former Swiss military bunkers. This trend is driven by anxieties over trade wars, geopolitical tensions, and a desire to diversify away from the U.S. dollar, reinforcing gold's traditional role as a store of value during uncertain times.

          <p>A Belgian environmental project is using a century-old shipwreck off its coast as a nursery to reintroduce rare native flat oysters to the North Sea. Scientists deposited 200,000 oyster larvae into the ship's hull, hoping to re-establish reefs that are crucial for marine ecosystems but have been decimated by overfishing and disease. These oyster reefs purify water and provide vital habitat for other species. The shipwreck was chosen because it is a protected heritage site where disruptive activities like fishing are banned, providing a safe haven for the molluscs to grow and reproduce.</p>
