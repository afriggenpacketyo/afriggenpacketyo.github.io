        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese researchers have developed "Meteor-1," the first highly parallel optical computing integrated chip, marking a significant advancement in optical computing technology. The chip boasts a theoretical peak computing power comparable to Nvidia's advanced GPUs, potentially accelerating AI and data center operations. As traditional electronic chips face physical limitations, optical computing offers advantages such as ultra-high speed, broad bandwidth, and low power consumption. This development comes as US export controls restrict China's access to advanced semiconductors and AI chips, pushing China to innovate in alternative computing technologies.</p>

          <p>Oil prices fell after Iran's missile strike on a U.S. airbase in Qatar resulted in no reported casualties, easing concerns about escalating conflict in the Middle East. The price drop indicates investor confidence that the conflict will de-escalate following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that President Trump's actions may have successfully de-escalated the situation. President Trump thanked Iran for providing early notice about the strike, enabling the prevention of casualties and calling for peace.</p>

          <p>President Trump's decision to involve the U.S. in the conflict between Israel and Iran through airstrikes may have led to a possible ceasefire. Trump announced that the two countries had agreed to a ceasefire, potentially de-escalating a conflict that threatened to engulf the region. Iran stated that it would halt attacks if Israel ceased its aggression by a specific time, and Israeli attacks reportedly stopped as the deadline approached. The situation underscores the volatility of the region and the potential for de-escalation through diplomatic efforts.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in Boston blocked the Trump administration from implementing a plan to bar foreign nationals from entering the United States to study at Harvard University. US district judge Allison Burroughs issued an injunction barring Trump‚Äôs administration from carrying out its latest bid to curtail Harvard‚Äôs ability to host international students amid an escalating fight pitting the Republican president against the prestigious Ivy League school. The proclamation prohibited foreign nationals from entering the US to study at Harvard or participate in exchange visitor programs for an initial period of six months, and directed Marco Rubio to consider whether to revoke visas of international students already enrolled at Harvard.</p>
