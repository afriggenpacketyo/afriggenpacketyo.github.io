Wagner explained that both he and Wolf, a singer with an R&B rock band, are comfortable in their own spaces and enjoy going back and forth. Wagner emphasized the importance of having personal space, especially as they get older, making this arrangement ideal for their relationship.</p>

          <p>Two Illinois-based toy companies, Learning Resources and hand2mind, are urging the Supreme Court to quickly review their challenge to President Trump's tariffs, citing the significant impact on businesses and consumers. They argue that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not grant the president the authority to impose such tariffs. The companies seek a decision before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit weighs in, proposing arguments be heard as early as September or October. The lawsuit is separate from another challenge that was temporarily blocked but later reinstated, highlighting ongoing legal battles over Trump's trade policies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is updating its Graviton4 chip with increased network bandwidth, aiming to reduce AI training costs and offer an alternative to Nvidia's GPUs. AWS has invested significantly in AI, including backing startup Anthropic and building an AI supercomputer called Project Rainier. Anthropic's Claude Opus 4 AI model is trained on Trainium2 GPUs, with Project Rainier powered by over half a million of these chips, potentially diverting orders from Nvidia. This move highlights AWS's strategy of developing custom chips to compete with traditional semiconductor players in the AI infrastructure space.</p>

          <p>James Gunn, co-head of DC Studios, believes the movie industry is "dying" due to incomplete screenplays and rushed productions. Gunn emphasizes that DC Studios prioritizes finished scripts before starting productions and scrapped one project due to an inadequate screenplay. He also commented on Marvel Studios, stating that Disney's mandate to increase output has "killed" it. Gunn addressed rumors about Matt Reeves' sequel to "The Batman," confirming that the film, titled "The Brave and the Bold," is still in development but has been delayed to October 2027.</p>

          <p>Members of Parliament in England and Wales have voted to decriminalize abortion for women, marking the biggest change to abortion laws in nearly 60 years. The amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill, put forward by Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi, passed with a significant majority. While the law still penalizes those who assist a woman in obtaining an abortion outside the legal framework, women who terminate their pregnancies outside the rules will no longer face police investigation. The new clause does not alter existing laws regarding abortion services within healthcare settings, such as time limits and the need for two doctors' approval.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for the 2001 murder of her husband, Bob, has been overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed inconsistencies and foreign DNA, leading to doubts about the original verdict. The prosecution conceded that the DNA evidence was different in quality and quantity than what was presented at trial. Though initially retried, the charges were ultimately dismissed due to insufficient evidence, prompting Dorotik to file a civil suit against the County of San Diego.</p>

Smith is set to be taken off life support, while the baby remains in the neonatal intensive care unit.

          <p>The standard charge for car drivers using the Dartford Crossing, which connects Essex and Kent, will increase from ¬£2.50 to ¬£3.50 in September. Transport Minister Lilian Greenwood stated that the current charge is "no longer sufficient" to manage demand, as the road is used by as many as 180,000 vehicles each day. Significant discounts will be available for local residents, and drivers with pre-pay accounts will pay a reduced fee of ¬£2.80 per crossing. The increased fees have been met with criticism from some MPs, who argue it is another tax on motorists.</p>
