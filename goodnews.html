          <p>New college graduates are encountering a more challenging job market compared to expectations earlier in the year, as indicated by rising unemployment rates and decreased job postings. Economic uncertainty stemming from policy changes like federal hiring freezes and concerns about job displacement due to artificial intelligence are contributing factors. Experts advise graduates to maintain a positive attitude and consider opportunities at smaller firms, which may offer better growth prospects. A recent study showed that graduates who start at smaller companies are more likely to become founders later in their careers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is facing internal divisions over deals to sell advanced computer chips to the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, raising concerns about potentially outsourcing the future of the AI industry and enabling China. While some officials believe these deals will boost American AI companies and expand their global reach, others worry about inadequate protections preventing the technology from benefiting China and the concentration of data centers in the Middle East. The deals involve billions of dollars and aim to help the Gulf States develop their own AI industries, but critics fear the U.S. may be repeating past mistakes by exporting critical technology.</p>

          <p>A rare clue at a Minneapolis crime scene, bloody bare footprints, ultimately led to the conviction of Jerry Westrom in the 1993 murder of Jeanie Childs. Investigators initially struggled to identify the killer, but forensic advancements in DNA testing and investigative genetic genealogy provided a breakthrough. The unknown DNA profile from the crime scene matched Westrom, who initially denied knowing Childs or being at her apartment. Ultimately, footprint analysis confirmed that Westrom's prints matched those left in Childs' blood, solidifying the case against him.</p>

          <p>Cava, the Mediterranean fast-casual chain, reported better-than-expected sales in its latest fiscal quarter, bucking the trend of a broader restaurant industry slowdown. Same-store sales grew by 10.8%, driven by increased traffic and premium attachment on higher-priced items. Cava's CFO noted that diners are trading up from fast food and down from casual-dining restaurants, a trend observed for several quarters. Despite strong performance, Cava reiterated its conservative same-store sales forecast, projecting slower growth in the latter half of the fiscal year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is allocating a quota of its stockpiled rice to supermarkets and retailers to expedite distribution and lower prices for consumers. Sixty percent of the 300,000 tons of reserve rice to be released over three months will be designated for retailers. This measure aims to ensure that consumers quickly benefit from lower prices, preventing the rice from being diverted to food service businesses.</p>

          <h2>Supreme Court Hears Arguments on Judicial Power and Trump's Immigration Policies</h2>

          <p>The Supreme Court heard arguments on the extent of judicial power, specifically regarding whether a single lower-court judge can block the president's policies nationwide. The case stems from President Trump's efforts to end birthright citizenship, with the administration arguing that courts should only apply injunctions to individual cases. The justices explored potential compromises, such as limiting universal injunctions to constitutional questions or requiring three-judge panels for such rulings. A decision is expected in the coming months.</p>
