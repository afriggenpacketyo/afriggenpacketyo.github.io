        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article summarizes various newspaper headlines, focusing on the new US-UK trade deal and the selection of a new Pope. The trade deal, described as 'historic' by both leaders, aims to reduce tariffs and boost trade, but its scope is limited and leaves Britain in a worse position than before the US trade war. The deal includes a clause allowing the US to object to Chinese firms investing in Britain, a claim disputed by the government. In Vatican news, Cardinal Robert Prevost was swiftly chosen as the new Pope, Leo XIV, sending a message of unity and a commitment to building bridges.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's overall exports experienced a surprising surge in April, despite a significant 21% drop in shipments to the U.S. due to tariffs. Imports saw a smaller decline as Beijing implemented stimulus measures. The increase in overall exports is partially attributed to transshipment through third countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were announced. The Chinese government is encouraging exporters to focus on the domestic market, potentially leading to deflation. The article notes that trade data is expected to weaken in the coming months.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump announced a trade deal framework with Britain aimed at reducing tariffs and boosting trade, marking his first trade deal of his second term. The agreement will increase U.S. access to the U.K. market, especially for agricultural products, and fast-track American imports through U.K. customs. However, a 10% tariff on U.K. imports will remain, although the first 100,000 vehicles imported annually will be subject to this rate. This framework is seen as a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 8.1% in April, surpassing expectations despite increased tariffs from the United States. This resilience potentially strengthens China's position in upcoming trade negotiations with the U.S. The growth may be due to transshipment through other countries and contracts signed before the tariffs were imposed. However, experts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months, emphasizing the need for a swift trade agreement between China and the U.S. to mitigate global trade shocks.</p>

While President Trump touts the deal as a significant achievement, analysts suggest the substantive benefits are limited. The 10% import tax on most UK goods remains in place, with the White House agreeing to roll back some import taxes on strategic sectors in exchange for expanded access for American agricultural products in the UK. The deal has drawn mixed reactions, with some praising it as a breakthrough and others noting its narrow scope.</p>
