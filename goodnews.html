          <p>The Federal Reserve is likely to maintain current interest rates this week, impacting various financial aspects for consumers. Credit card rates remain high, and while the Fed is on the sidelines, consumers can explore options like zero-interest balance transfers. Mortgage rates have remained relatively stable, keeping housing affordability a challenge. Auto loan rates are fixed but rising car prices, potentially exacerbated by Trump's trade policy, are increasing payments. Federal student loan rates are set annually, shielding borrowers from immediate Fed moves, but forgiveness options are diminishing. (not investment advice)</p>
