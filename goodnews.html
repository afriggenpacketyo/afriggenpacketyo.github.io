          <p>Sophie Ingle, a 33-year-old midfielder, has been chosen for Wales' 23-player squad for the 2025 Women's European Championship, even though she has not played competitively this season. Ingle, who recently left Chelsea, suffered an anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury in a pre-season friendly last September. Despite the injury, she has demonstrated enough progress in training to convince head coach Rhian Wilkinson that she deserves a spot on the team.

The acquisition positions Nippon Steel as the world's fourth-largest steelmaker and expands its global capacity as it aims to tap into overseas markets.

It was awesome, Sheehan said, once I was out there, it was kind of just back in compete mode once you see a hitter in the box.</p>
