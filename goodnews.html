During the episode, Wallen performed two songs from his upcoming album and later capitalized on the viral exit by selling merchandise with the phrase "Get me to God‚Äôs country."

          <p>President Trump signed an executive order aimed at lowering U.S. drug prices by forcing drug companies to match the lower prices paid in other developed countries. The order directs agencies to take action against policies that lower drug prices abroad and facilitate direct-to-consumer sales. It also threatens to tie drug prices paid by government programs like Medicare to those paid in other countries if drugmakers don't voluntarily comply. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) criticized the order, arguing it's a "bad deal for American patients."</p>

          <p>Germany's Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt has ordered stricter controls on the country's borders to curb irregular immigration, a move that is legally and politically controversial. Non-EU citizens without a visa will be turned back, including asylum seekers without valid entry documents or those who have already applied in another EU country. This policy aims to prevent migrants from reaching Germany and motivate EU neighbors to stop migrants from passing through. The decision has sparked mixed reactions, with left-wing politicians criticizing the measures and the far-right AfD calling for even stricter border closures.</p>

The plans also involve scrapping the dedicated care visa, stricter rules for overseas graduates, and tougher English tests.

          <p>President Donald Trump announced that he spoke with Apple CEO Tim Cook following the U.S. and China's agreement to suspend most tariffs for 90 days. Trump indicated that Cook intends to increase Apple's investments in the U.S., potentially reaching $500 billion and building more plants. This news followed Apple's previous announcement in February that it would spend $500 billion to expand its U.S. operations, including assembling artificial intelligence servers in Houston. The easing of trade tensions is expected to benefit Apple, given its significant production and sales in China.</p>

          <p>Freddie Freeman credits a sixth-inning single off Paul Skenes on April 25 as the turning point for his recent offensive surge. Prior to that game, Freeman had been struggling with his swing, but the single provided a sense of rediscovery. Since then, he has been on a tear, batting .475 with five home runs and 22 RBIs in his last 61 at-bats. Despite battling a lingering ankle injury, Freeman has been able to maintain a consistent performance.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, leads to greater weight loss compared to semaglutide, known as Ozempic and Wegovy. Over a 72-week period, tirzepatide users lost approximately 20% of their body weight, while semaglutide users lost about 14%. The study, funded by Lilly, also highlighted additional health benefits, such as improved blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Despite the effectiveness, the high cost of these drugs remains a barrier, with limited insurance coverage.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump praised Qatar's offer of a 747 jet to serve as Air Force One, attributing the need for such a donation to delays at Boeing. Trump contrasted the existing Air Force One with planes in Arab countries. A White House official clarified that no aircraft "gift" will be presented or accepted during Trump's visit to Qatar. Trump expressed respect for Qatar's leadership.</p>

          <p>A Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos 482, launched in 1972 on a mission to Venus, crashed back to Earth after an engine malfunction prevented it from reaching its destination. The spacecraft reentered Earth's atmosphere and landed in the Indian Ocean. Due to its design to withstand Venus' harsh atmosphere, parts of the probe may have survived reentry, although they are unlikely to be recovered. Scientists hope to learn from the probe's condition to improve future spacecraft design for missions to Mars.</p>
