          <p>The Senate's tax plan for Trump's spending package aims to permanently extend the tax cuts introduced in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), while introducing new tax breaks. According to the Tax Foundation, most taxpayers will see a tax cut under the plan. Both the House and Senate versions of the bill seek to prevent tax increases that would occur if the 2017 provisions expire. The Senate bill raises the nonrefundable Child Tax Credit to $2,200 starting in 2025, and both versions eliminate taxes on tipped income, though the Senate caps the deduction at $25,000 a year.

          <p>Despite ongoing conflicts, Israel's economy has shown surprising resilience, though it faces significant strain due to military spending and labor shortages. The country's 2025 budget includes a 21% increase in spending, with $38.6 billion allocated for defense. While sectors like tourism and manufacturing have suffered, high-tech, defense, and retail food industries remain strong. The high-tech sector employs 12% of the workforce and contributes significantly to exports and GDP, but the number of local high-tech employees has stagnated, and some fear higher taxes could lead to further relocation.

          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The amendment was introduced after police investigated over 100 women for suspected illegal abortions in the past five years. Supporters of the bill said it would keep women from going to prison for ending their pregnancy, while opponents argued it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy. Changes during the COVID-19 pandemic allowed women to receive abortion pills through the mail for at-home terminations within the first 10 weeks.</p>

Studies suggest men and women gossip positively and negatively at similar rates, but women engage in neutral gossip more frequently. The article suggests that men's reluctance to gossip openly may stem from societal expectations and fears of appearing "messy." It also explores whether improving men's gossiping skills could help address the male loneliness epidemic, as sharing stories fosters intimacy and builds relationships.</p>

          <p>Temperatures in the UK are expected to reach 30C (86F) in parts of the country, potentially leading to the first heatwave of 2025. Nights will also be warmer, with temperatures in the high teens, and different regions will experience peak temperatures on different days. The Met Office said that the risk of 40C temperatures in the UK is rapidly increasing due to climate change. A Met Office study suggests there is a 50:50 risk of temperatures exceeding 40C in the UK in the next 12 years.</p>

          <p>Liam √ìg √ì hAnnaidh, a rapper with Irish language hip-hop group Kneecap, has been released on unconditional bail after appearing in a London court on a terror charge. He is accused of displaying a flag in support of Hezbollah at a London gig. Supporters of the group gathered outside the court, and Kneecap has denied the offense. The band is known for their provocative lyrics and merchandise, and their rise to fame inspired a semi-fictionalized film.</p>

          <p>The Premier League 2025-26 fixtures have been announced, but there is a warning that games may move at short notice due to European matches. With nine teams in Europe, including six in the Champions League, the likelihood of fixture changes has increased. England's boss may face challenges as Liverpool, Chelsea, and Manchester City have tough games before international windows. Manchester City will play at home before five of their first six Champions League matches, but face four away fixtures directly after.</p>

          <h2>"Tariff Engineering" Used by Businesses to Avoid Higher Duties</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-18 07:40:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As tariffs increase, businesses are employing "tariff engineering" to lower duty costs by changing product materials, dimensions, or compositions. This involves altering items to fit into different "harmonized system codes" with lower tariff rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products allow companies to benefit from tariff engineering. The practice, legal as long as goods are honestly presented to customs officers, has been used by companies like Columbia Sportswear and Converse to reduce tariff costs on their products.
