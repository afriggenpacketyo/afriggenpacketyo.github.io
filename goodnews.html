          <p>The new Syrian government has agreed to assist the United States in locating and returning Americans who went missing in the war-torn country, signaling improved relations between the two nations. This agreement followed a meeting between U.S. envoy Thomas Barrack and Syrian President Ahmad al-Sharaa during the latter's visit to Turkey. The Syrian government will aid the U.S. in honoring the remains of those who died there and bringing home those who went missing. The Trump administration has also granted Syria exemptions from sanctions, aiming to help the new government create better conditions for the Syrian people and defeat ISIS.</p>

          <p>Lando Norris secured his first pole position since the season-opener in Australia, converting it into a victory at the Monaco Grand Prix. The race was relatively straightforward for the front-runners, with the only safety car intervention being an early virtual one after a crash for Sauber's Gabriel Bortoleto. Norris, Leclerc, and Piastri all followed a similar strategy, starting on medium tires and then switching to two stints on hard tires. Verstappen, at a disadvantage with limited tire sets, finished fourth after Red Bull attempted an inverted strategy hoping for a red flag.</p>
