        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article discusses the ongoing debate about women serving in combat roles, highlighting the experiences of Captain Emelie Vanasse, one of the first women to serve as an Army infantry officer and graduate from Ranger School. Vanasse recounts her experiences in Ranger School, where she felt the need to prove herself and faced skepticism from some male instructors. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's insistence on gender-neutral fitness standards for combat jobs is also discussed, alongside Vanasse's perspective on the importance of physical fitness and lethality in combat. Vanasse asserts that the standards were never lowered for her during Ranger School and that lethality extends beyond just physical fitness. Optimism score is 65.</p>
