          <p>Jack Clark, co-founder of Anthropic, stated that Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek is still behind US frontier companies in AI technology. Speaking at an industry event, Clark acknowledged DeepSeek's "clever algorithmic ideas" but suggested the hype around the company is "overblown." Clark added that DeepSeek's models do not pose a national security risk, based on internal Anthropic tests. His comments come amidst speculation about DeepSeek's next generation models following the open-sourcing of its Prover-V2 model.</p>

          <p>A new poll indicates that the majority of Americans utilize federal science information, such as weather forecasts and food safety warnings, on a weekly basis, often without realizing the source. Despite this reliance, only a small percentage of respondents expressed concern that cuts to federal science funding might impact their access to this information. The poll highlights a gap between the public's use of federal data and their understanding of its origin. It also suggests bipartisan agreement on the importance of federal investment in STEM education for future economic prosperity.</p>

          <p>This article discusses the polarized views on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, noting that both the right and left often misunderstand their purpose and impact. While conservatives express concerns about free speech and meritocracy, the article argues that thoughtful DEI trainings can improve communication and create more inclusive environments. It also points out that many on the left struggle with difficult conversations about race and promote virtue-signaling, which undermines the effectiveness of DEI efforts. The author contends that Americans need to tolerate diverse perspectives to overcome cultural conflict.</p>

          <p>Officials in Southern California are utilizing sterile male mosquitoes to combat the invasive Aedes mosquito, which has been linked to a recent surge in dengue fever cases. The approach involves releasing thousands of sterile males to reduce the mosquito population, as eggs produced after mating with sterile males do not hatch. Data from vector control districts show encouraging results, with significant reductions in invasive Aedes mosquito populations in release areas. While challenges remain in scaling up the intervention, the technique offers an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical spraying.</p>

Despite macroeconomic and tariff uncertainty, the company reiterated its full-year guidance. Revenues fell 2% on a currency-adjusted basis to 999 million euros, surpassing analysts' forecasts. Weaker sales were primarily attributed to subdued consumer demand in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in China.</p>
