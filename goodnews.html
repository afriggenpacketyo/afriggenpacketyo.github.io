          <p>Five people were stabbed at a music event in Thamesmead, south-east London, leading to their arrests on suspicion of violent disorder. Emergency services responded to reports of multiple injuries on Nathan Way, where they found five individuals, aged between 22 and 32, with stab wounds. Three of the victims sustained injuries not believed to be life-threatening or life-changing, while the remaining two are undergoing medical assessment.

          <p>Chinese scientists have identified a new strain of bacteria, named niallia tiangongensis, aboard the Tiangong space station. This microbe, a variant of a known terrestrial bacteria, exhibits enhanced abilities to combat oxidative stress and reverse radiation-induced damage, which could have implications for space technology, agriculture, and medicine. The study, published in the International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology, emphasizes the importance of understanding microbial characteristics during long-term space missions to protect astronaut health and spacecraft functionality.

          <p>Colin Jost, the longest-running "Weekend Update" host on Saturday Night Live, has found comedic success by embracing his persona as a punching bag. Instead of trying to be the witty center of attention, Jost allows cast members like Sarah Sherman and Michael Che to mock his privileged background and perceived out-of-touch perspectives. By willingly taking the brunt of the jokes, Jost has become a pressure-release valve for cultural anxieties, making him more relatable and sympathetic to audiences. His willingness to be the target has ultimately solidified his legacy on the show.</p>

          <p>Nissan Motor Co. is contemplating the closure of two plants in Kanagawa Prefecture, near Tokyo, as part of its broader restructuring efforts. This decision follows the company's announcement earlier this week that it would shut down seven vehicle plants and reduce its workforce by 20,000 globally, a response to a net loss of 670.90 billion yen ($4.6 billion) for fiscal year 2024. The move reflects the challenges facing Japan's third-largest automaker as it seeks to streamline operations and improve financial performance in a competitive global market.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump's recent trip to the Middle East underscored his "malleable" and "unpredictable" approach to foreign policy. According to Peter Baker, Trump's visit involved re-altering dynamics in the region by recognizing Syria's new government and moving closer to a deal with Iran, echoing his earlier policies. The trip and its outcomes have highlighted the administration's evolving strategies and transactional nature in international relations. The discussions also included perspectives from Stephen Hayes, David Ignatius, and Andrea Mitchell.</p>

          <p>The release of a 2023 audio recording of President Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s interview with Special Counsel Robert K. Hur has reignited concerns about his cognitive fitness.
