          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-08 21:09:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 stock index surged to a new record high, closing above the 44,000 mark for the first time, driven by a rally in technology stocks. The market's upward momentum followed the resignation announcement of Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, which has fueled investor speculation about a new wave of fiscal stimulus to bolster the economy. Analysts suggest that while short-term political uncertainty may cause volatility, the leadership change could lead to greater long-term policy stability and a pro-growth environment. Some financial institutions are forecasting further gains for the index in the coming year. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, NHS trusts in England have been rated and ranked in new public league tables, with specialist hospitals securing the top positions. The rankings are based on metrics such as patient waiting times and financial performance, and trusts are placed into one of four categories every three months. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated the tables are designed to identify where urgent support is needed and to increase transparency for patients. While the government hopes this will drive improvement, organizations like NHS Providers have raised concerns about the accuracy and potential unintended consequences of the new system.</p>

          <p>Cannabis use among Americans aged 65 and older has seen a significant 46% increase between 2021 and 2023, according to a recent study. With marijuana now legal for medical or recreational use in most states, the stigma surrounding it is diminishing, and many seniors are exploring it as a solution for issues like chronic pain, PTSD, and anxiety. While users tout its benefits, some medical professionals express caution. Researchers warn that THC, the psychoactive compound in marijuana, may pose cardiovascular risks, regardless of whether it is smoked or ingested as an edible.</p>

          <p>Infielder Max Muncy has been activated from the injured list and immediately returned to the Los Angeles Dodgers' starting lineup, providing a much-needed boost for the team. Muncy had been sidelined for 23 games with an oblique injury, during which the team struggled offensively and posted a losing record. His return is seen as a significant reinforcement as the Dodgers head into their playoff stretch drive. The team anticipates further help soon, with several other key players, including Alex Vesia and Tommy Edman, also expected to return from injuries shortly.</p>

          <p>A port operator in northeastern China is establishing a new fruit transit center and a dedicated shipping service dubbed the "durian express" to accelerate imports of the popular fruit from Southeast Asia. This initiative aims to cut shipping times from up to twelve days down to as few as six, ensuring fresher deliveries to the region's 100 million consumers. Historically, the long transit distance to northeastern China has posed logistical challenges, threatening the quality of perishable fruits like durian. The new service is expected to handle approximately 10,000 shipping containers of fresh durians annually.</p>

          <p>The California Legislature has passed a bill aimed at shutting down the pipeline from out-of-state puppy mills by banning certain online pet dealers and brokers. The legislation targets websites and middlemen who misrepresent commercially bred puppies as being from small, local breeders. This move closes a loophole in a 2019 law that barred pet stores from selling such animals but did not cover the growing online market. If signed by the governor, the bill will prohibit brokers who sell dogs bred by others for profit, a measure intended to protect consumers from purchasing sick or poorly bred pets.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved updated COVID-19 vaccines for the fall season, specifically targeting adults 65 and older and younger individuals with certain underlying medical conditions. This narrower approval framework means access may be more limited for some people who previously received shots routinely. Federal officials have clarified that anyone can still get a vaccine after consulting with their doctor, but insurance coverage and pharmacy administration may be more complex. Conditions that qualify for eligibility include asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, and pregnancy, among others that increase the risk of severe illness.</p>

          <p>MBDA, Europe's largest missile manufacturer, is set to introduce several new weapon systems, including a novel missile designed to be launched from a tank's main 120mm cannon. This Akeron MBT missile will provide tanks with a non-line-of-sight capability, allowing them to engage targets hidden behind obstacles, a lesson drawn from the conflict in Ukraine. The company will also showcase a low-cost, long-range cruise missile called Crossbow, a glide variant of its Spear missile, and a new stealthy cruise missile. These developments aim to provide more affordable and versatile options for modern armed forces.</p>

          <p>England's Test cricket coach, Brendon McCullum, has expressed frustration with what he calls "disrespectful" misconceptions about his team's aggressive style of play, often dubbed "Bazball." He clarified that the team's approach is not about recklessly swinging the bat but about creating an environment where players can perform without being restricted by the pressures of international cricket. McCullum emphasized that the mindset is about empowering players to use their talent freely, rather than adhering to a rigid, high-risk strategy. The coach's philosophy has been credited with reviving a team that had previously won only one of its last 17 matches.</p>

          <p>Norway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Stoere has won a second term in office after his Labour Party emerged as the winner in a closely contested parliamentary election. The Labour party and its four left-leaning allies secured a narrow majority of 87 seats in the 169-seat parliament. The election campaign focused heavily on domestic issues such as the rising cost of living, taxes, and public services, as well as the stability of an incumbent government amid international turmoil. On the right, the populist Progress Party significantly increased its support, doubling its score from the previous election.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer reviewed several instances of market pessimism over recent months that ultimately did not materialize, suggesting that negativity on Wall Street can often be overhyped. He pointed to concerns about tech giants like Alphabet, where fears of a punitive breakup following a monopoly ruling caused a dip, only for the stock to recover after a more favorable outcome. Similar narratives affected Amazon and Apple, whose stocks weathered negative theories about competition and AI strategy before rebounding. Cramer argued that while it is easy to focus on potential negatives, the market often moves on when those fears prove unfounded. (not investment advice)</p>
