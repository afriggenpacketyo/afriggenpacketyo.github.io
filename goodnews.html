        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Hinge Health, a digital physical therapy startup, priced its IPO at $32 per share, raising approximately $273 million. The company's software assists patients with musculoskeletal injuries and post-surgery rehabilitation remotely, and it experienced a 50% revenue increase in the first quarter, reporting a net income of $17.1 million. The IPO is closely watched by the digital health sector, which has struggled since 2021, and could signal a broader recovery in tech IPO activity. Hinge Health's IPO marks a significant moment for the digital health sector, which has seen limited public offerings in recent years due to post-Covid slowdowns.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Nike is set to raise prices on some of its trainers and clothing in the United States starting in early June, following a similar warning from Adidas about potential price hikes due to tariffs. The sportswear giant attributed the increase to regular "price adjustments" amid external factors creating uncertainty. While Nike did not explicitly mention US tariffs, almost all of the company's goods are manufactured in Asia, a region targeted by President Trump's tariffs. The price increases will affect most Nike shoes costing over $100, with prices rising by up to $10.</p>

          <p>Leadership and workplace researcher Zach Mercurio emphasizes the importance of small talk for creating a sense of mattering among employees. Meaningfully personal conversations that foster connection are more effective motivators than perks like pizza parties and vacation packages. Sincere interest in employees' well-being builds trust and rapport, particularly for remote workers and those in underappreciated positions. Transactional communication via technology should be balanced with genuine check-ins on employees' personal lives and challenges.</p>
