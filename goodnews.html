          <p>Donald Trump has announced that Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City, will be awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Giuliani gained national prominence as "America's Mayor" for his leadership during the 9/11 attacks, though his reputation has since been marred by legal and financial troubles related to his work as Trump's personal lawyer and false claims about the 2020 election. The announcement comes shortly after Giuliani was hospitalized for non-life-threatening injuries from a car accident. Past recipients of the nation's highest civilian honor include a wide range of prominent figures.</p>

          <p>Piotr Szczerek, a Polish CEO, has issued a public apology after a video of him taking a hat intended for a young boy at the US Open went viral. The incident occurred after tennis player Kamil Majchrzak won his match and threw his cap towards the child in the stands. Szczerek stated he mistakenly believed the hat was being passed to him and called his action a "huge mistake," expressing regret for hurting the boy and disappointing fans. He has since returned the hat, and Majchrzak later met with the young fan to give him more merchandise.</p>

          <p>Aston Villa has secured two significant signings on loan, bringing in Liverpool midfielder Harvey Elliott and Manchester United forward Jadon Sancho. The deal for Elliott, valued at £35 million, includes an obligation for Villa to buy him and a buy-back clause for Liverpool. For Sancho, Villa will cover the majority of his substantial wages, providing a new opportunity for the winger who has struggled to find consistent form at United. These moves are intended to bolster Villa's squad after a lackluster start to their Premier League season.</p>

          <p>U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has expressed confidence that the Supreme Court will validate President Donald Trump's use of the 1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose widespread tariffs. This statement follows a federal appeals court ruling that found most of the tariffs illegal. Bessent argues that the influx of fentanyl constitutes a national emergency, justifying the use of IEEPA, and revealed the administration has a contingency plan involving the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. The administration's legal brief will underscore the urgency of addressing both trade imbalances and the opioid crisis. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In "The Smashing Machine," written and directed by Benny Safdie, Dwayne Johnson portrays pioneering MMA and UFC champion Mark Kerr during a pivotal crisis in his career. The film, based on a 2002 documentary of the same name, explores Kerr's struggle with substance abuse and relationship anxieties after experiencing his first professional loss. Johnson's performance is noted as the only possible casting for the role, though the film is described as a solid but not groundbreaking drama. While it features strong moments of vulnerability, the review suggests it doesn't fully explore the emotional depths of its characters, particularly Emily Blunt's role as Kerr's girlfriend.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has confirmed his six wildcard picks, creating a team with 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Despite this continuity, Donald warned the U.S. team not to expect a "rinse and repeat" of their previous strategy, emphasizing that playing on American soil at Bethpage presents a different challenge. He stated that pairings and lineups will be adapted for the away match, where Europe has not won since 2012. The captain also urged his players to embrace the famously raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has responded to a new book ban in the province of Alberta by publishing a satirical short story. The move comes after her classic novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," was removed from some school library shelves under a new provincial directive targeting materials with "explicit sexual content." Atwood's new story sarcastically describes "very, very good children" who grow up without any biological realities, taking aim at the policy and its supporters. The incident reflects the growing trend of book challenges, similar to those seen in the U.S., spreading into Canada.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains, led by a surge in the aerospace and defense sector. The positive movement was driven by the announcement of a £10 billion deal for Norway to purchase British-made Type 26 frigates, the U.K.'s largest-ever warship export agreement. Shares of BAE Systems, the manufacturer, rose significantly on the news. Additionally, the health-care sector was boosted by positive trial data for Novo Nordisk's weight-loss drug Wegovy, which showed superior performance in reducing heart disease risk compared to a rival drug from Eli Lilly.
