          <p>Chile and Google have signed an agreement to install the first-ever submarine fiber optic cable connecting South America, Asia, and Oceania by 2027. The "Humboldt Project," a 14,800-kilometer cable from Valparaiso, Chile, to Sydney, Australia, via French Polynesia, aims to improve connectivity and provide a faster alternative to existing cables connecting Chile to the US. The project is expected to benefit Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil, with Google investing between $300 million and $550 million and the Chilean government contributing $25 million. The new cable will also reduce the lapse between sending and receiving a signal, which will cause a big difference in the field of telemedicine. </p>

          <p>A Chinese study of dinosaur feathers found in Burmese amber has shed new light on the evolution of flight feathers, which allowed early birds to surpass dinosaurs in conquering the skies. The study, analyzing 99-million-year-old feathers from the Cretaceous period, provides insight into feather evolution during this era. Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) highlighted the development of feathers that helped generate thrust and lift as essential to bird evolution. While modern birds are direct descendants of dinosaurs, most feathered dinosaurs lacked the same flight capabilities. </p>

          <p>UK scientists have found that the first bacteria our bodies encounter after birth may protect against dangerous infections. The research shows that beneficial bacteria, particularly Bifidobacterium longum, can halve the risk of young children being admitted to hospital with lung infections. Researchers at University College London and the Sanger Institute collected stool samples from newborns and tracked their health for two years. The protective bacteria were found more often in babies born via vaginal delivery, suggesting early microbial exposure is crucial for immune system development. </p>

          <p>A judge has granted a temporary restraining order against Sable Offshore Corp., halting efforts to restart an offshore oil operation along Santa Barbara County's coastline. The ruling, siding with environmental groups, delays the reactivation of the Santa Ynez Unit, which was shut down after a major spill in 2015. The order prevents pipeline work until at least July 18, with a full hearing scheduled to discuss the matter. Environmental groups argue that the state fire marshal improperly issued waivers for repair work without proper environmental review or public input. </p>

Concerns have arisen due to the increasing popularity of these 'skinny jabs,' with many women not using them safely or receiving proper advice.
