          <p>Following President Trump's announcement of a new trade agreement with the United Kingdom, stocks experienced a notable rise, with the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and Nasdaq Composite all showing gains. The agreement aims to increase market access for American exports, particularly in agriculture, and eliminate non-tariff barriers. However, the existing 10% baseline U.S. tax on imports from Britain will remain on some products, generating revenue for the United States. Despite the positive market reaction, analysts anticipate continued volatility due to ongoing trade negotiations with other countries, including China.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin's price surged above $100,000 for the first time since February, driven by optimism surrounding the U.S.-U.K. trade deal announcement and its perceived status as a safe haven asset. The cryptocurrency's rise coincided with gains in stocks and other risk assets, as investors reacted positively to the trade news. Some analysts suggest that recent market uncertainty has bolstered Bitcoin's appeal as investors question the stability of the U.S. dollar. Despite potential volatility stemming from geopolitical tensions and Federal Reserve policies, Bitcoin's resilience is expected to be tested further.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an age of increasingly loud egos and declining well-being, adopting a "quiet ego" can be a countercultural strategy for happiness. Psychologists define quiet ego as a self-identity that is neither excessively self-focused nor excessively other-focused, incorporating virtues like charity, humility, self-awareness, and hope. Research indicates that cultivating a quiet ego is associated with better mood balance, greater life satisfaction, and a stronger sense of life's meaning. The article provides practical strategies for developing a quiet ego, such as questioning conventional wisdom and focusing on contributing to others.</p>

          <p>Nicola Packer, a 45-year-old woman, was acquitted of unlawfully administering a substance to herself with the intent to procure a miscarriage. The court heard that she took abortion medication at home during a coronavirus lockdown when she was about 26 weeks pregnant. The legal limit for taking medication at home to terminate a pregnancy is 10 weeks, while the outer limit for any abortion in England, Scotland and Wales is 24 weeks, apart from in certain circumstances. Ms Packer spoke of her "shock" and "surprise" at being pregnant, and said if she knew she was that far along she wouldn't have done it.</p>

          <p>At least 10 cast members from the current North American touring production of Les Mis√©rables are choosing not to participate in an upcoming performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, in order to boycott the anticipated attendance of Donald Trump, according to CNN. Cast members were reportedly given the option to opt out of the 11 June show. The president has reshaped the board with his own appointees, and the former Kennedy Center president Deborah Rutter has been replaced by the Trump ally Richard Grenell.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration on Wednesday prepared to rescind U.S. chip export restrictions known as the "AI diffusion rule," effectively stopping a set of artificial intelligence semiconductor limits from taking effect next week. Nvidia shares climbed Wednesday in reaction to the news. The company has been vocal in its stance that restricting chip exports limits U.S. leadership in advanced technology.</p>
