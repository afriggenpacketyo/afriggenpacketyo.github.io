        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>US buyer activity on Alibaba Group Holding‚Äôs wholesale marketplace surged by over 40% the week after the US and China agreed to a 90-day pause on new tariffs. This spike indicates that US businesses are quickly trying to stockpile goods to mitigate the impact of potential high tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Some buyers are also looking to secure inventory for the holiday season, with inquiries related to Christmas products climbing more than 20% during the week. The increased interest from US users highlights the impact of the ongoing trade war on e-commerce platforms.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new report from Silicon Valley Bank indicates that venture capital firms focused on artificial intelligence are driving much of the growth in the startup market, while companies in other areas are struggling to raise cash. About 40% of the total amount raised by U.S. venture funds last year was from funds that "list AI as a focus," up from 10% in 2021. Many investors were bullish that President Donald Trump's return to the White House would reinvigorate the startup economy due to the prospect of lower taxes and less regulation, but the aggressive tariff policy announced in early April led several companies to delay planned IPOs.</p>

The National Crime Agency (NCA) reports that Ebid, who arrived in the UK on a small boat in 2022 and applied for asylum, ruthlessly exploited desperate individuals, bribed officials, and ordered threats of violence toward the migrants.
