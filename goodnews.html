          <p>President Trump announced that a group of House Republicans who initially voted to block a package of cryptocurrency regulation bills have agreed to support the legislation after a meeting at the White House. The procedural vote had unexpectedly failed earlier, with thirteen Republicans joining Democrats, causing a temporary setback for the crypto-friendly measures during the House's "Crypto Week." The bills include the GENIUS Act for stablecoin regulation and another to clarify oversight between the SEC and CFTC. This reversal highlights Trump's significant influence over the Republican conference. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>At a summit in Pittsburgh, President Trump announced over $90 billion in new private investments from leading technology and energy companies aimed at developing Pennsylvania's artificial intelligence sector. The initiatives include building new data centers powered by the state's natural gas and nuclear resources, and establishing an energy innovation hub for workforce training. The event, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick, brought together major industry leaders and government officials. The announcement was met with protests from activists concerned about the focus on fossil fuels and AI for surveillance, leading to minor clashes with police.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. House is considering the Genius Act, a bipartisan bill that would establish a regulatory framework for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to stable assets like the U.S. dollar. Proponents, including large issuers like Circle, argue that stablecoins offer a less volatile digital currency, enabling faster and cheaper financial transactions outside of traditional banking hours. The legislation aims to provide consumer protections and clear rules for issuers, potentially paving the way for wider adoption by banks and credit unions. This is part of a broader push by the Trump administration to support the crypto industry. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In an article for the Communist Party's main theoretical journal, President Xi Jinping reiterated China's commitment to economic globalization and opposition to protectionism. Published as a major supply chain expo opened in China, the article compiles Xi's statements advocating for free trade and criticizing unilateral sanctions and trade barriers. The piece positions China as a defender of an open international economic system, contrasting with the more protectionist policies adopted by other nations. Xi pledged that China would uphold "genuine multilateralism" to foster inclusive global economic growth.</p>

          <p>An article in the People's Daily, the Chinese Communist Party's official newspaper, has urged local governments to use their legislative powers to stimulate economic and social development. Since 2015, more Chinese cities have been empowered to draft local laws on issues like urban development and environmental protection. The state media article highlights that tailored, localized legislation can create a stable and open system, allowing market entities to operate effectively under the rule of law. This represents a shift from relying on top-down directives to using legal frameworks to address economic challenges.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering effort, marine scientists are crossbreeding Elkhorn coral from Honduras with Florida's native population to restore the state's dying reefs. Over 95% of Florida's Elkhorn coral, a critical reef-building species, has been lost to warming oceans and disease. Researchers selected tougher coral from Honduras's Tela Bay, which lives in more challenging conditions, to create a more resilient hybrid nicknamed the "Flonduran." The first of these crossbred corals have now been planted off the Miami coast, with hopes they can better survive future marine heatwaves and help protect Florida's coastline.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Chargers have revealed two new alternate uniforms for the upcoming 2025 NFL season, sparking a wide range of reactions from fans and players. The first, a bold all-gold "Charger Power" look, has been compared to everything from mustard bottles to the Minions from "Despicable Me." The second is a "Super Chargers" navy blue uniform, a modern throwback to the design worn during the team's only Super Bowl appearance in the 1990s. The team will debut the gold uniforms in an October game against the Indianapolis Colts.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a trade agreement with Indonesia that avoids a threatened 32% tariff, instead setting the rate at 19%. As part of the deal, Trump stated that Indonesia has committed to purchasing $15 billion in U.S. energy, $4.5 billion in American agricultural products, and 50 Boeing aircraft. The pact was finalized after a call with the Indonesian president and is one of several deals the administration has been pursuing to avert widespread tariff hikes. This agreement follows similar announcements with the UK, China, and Vietnam.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A growing number of central banks, particularly in Africa and Latin America, are buying gold directly from local mines instead of on the international market. This strategy allows them to bolster their reserves using local currency, avoiding the need to spend foreign exchange reserves like the U.S. dollar. The World Gold Council reports this trend is driven by soaring gold prices and the desire to support domestic industry, although it can present challenges if the country lacks certified refining capabilities.

          <p>Los Angeles County has agreed to a $14 million settlement for Alexander Torres, who was wrongfully convicted of murder and spent over two decades in prison. His 2001 conviction was based on unreliable witness testimony, and he was found factually innocent in 2022 after a review by the D.A.'s Conviction Integrity Unit. The case against him was weak, with multiple alibi witnesses and evidence that a cast he was wearing would have made it difficult to commit the crime. The settlement provides restitution for the years Torres lost while incarcerated.</p>

          <p>An independent review of the UK's National Health Service has recommended that physician associates (PAs) and anaesthesia associates (AAs) should be retitled as "assistants" to avoid patient confusion. The review, commissioned after concerns over patient safety, also suggests standardized uniforms and badges to clearly distinguish them from doctors. It further states that associates should not be responsible for diagnosing patients. The recommendations follow several high-profile cases where patients died after being treated by PAs whom they believed were fully qualified doctors, prompting calls for greater clarity on their roles and limitations.</p>

          <p>The historic Palm House at London's Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is set to close in 2027 for a five-year, £50 million restoration project. The ambitious plan involves replacing 16,000 panes of glass, repairing the building's iron structure, and carefully relocating 1,300 tropical plants, including a 250-year-old cycad. The renovation is necessary due to the toll the hot, humid interior has taken on the 175-year-old structure. The project will also upgrade the heating system to make the glasshouse net-zero, significantly reducing its carbon footprint.</p>

          <p>The UK's Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) has banned an advertisement for Trip drinks for making unauthorized health claims that its products can "help you feel calm" and reduce stress. The ad for the cucumber, mint, and magnesium drink also referenced other "calming" ingredients like L-theanine and ashwagandha. The watchdog ruled that this language implied the drink could treat anxiety, a claim not permitted on the national register for food and supplement marketing. The ASA also found a claim about "0g added sugar" to be inaccurate.</p>
