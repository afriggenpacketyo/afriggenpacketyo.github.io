          <p>New York City officials have identified three more victims from the September 11, 2001, terror attacks using advanced DNA analysis. The identifications of Barbara Keating, 72, and Ryan Fitzgerald, 26, were made public, while a third victim's name was withheld at her family's request. This development brings the total number of identified victims to 1,653 out of 2,753 who died in New York City. The city's chief medical examiner reaffirmed the ongoing commitment to identifying all the victims, offering a measure of closure to families nearly a quarter-century after the tragedy.</p>

          <p>Southern California grocery chain Stater Bros. has reached a tentative three-year contract agreement with the union representing 12,000 of its workers, successfully averting a potential strike. While details were not released, the deal reportedly includes wage hikes, improved pension and healthcare benefits, and better safety protections. The agreement follows months of tense negotiations, during which workers had authorized a strike and the union had filed charges of unfair labor practices against the company. The resolution brings labor peace to the chain, aligning it with other major Southern California grocers who recently ratified similar contracts.</p>

          <p>Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a plan to spend approximately $600 billion in the U.S. over four years, a move seen as an effort to appease President Trump's demands for domestic manufacturing. The announcement highlighted partnerships with U.S. suppliers like Corning and Coherent for key components but stopped short of committing to final iPhone assembly in the country. In a joint appearance, Trump praised the investment and suggested Apple would be exempt from a planned tariff on chips. Analysts view this as a savvy move by Cook to avoid tariffs without making disruptive changes to Apple's global supply chain. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>U.S. rare earths miner MP Materials posted a smaller second-quarter loss than analysts had anticipated, driven by a significant increase in production. The company, which operates the only U.S. rare earths mine, saw production of concentrate increase by 45% and key elements like NdPr jump by 120%. This growth comes as the U.S. government seeks to build a domestic supply chain to reduce reliance on China, highlighted by recent deals between MP Materials, the Pentagon, and Apple. The positive report sent the company's shares up nearly 8% in after-hours trading. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A recipe for the classic Roman pasta dish cacio e pepe published on the UK's Good Food website has caused fury in Italy. The recipe was criticized for incorrectly listing parmesan and butter as ingredients, and suggesting cream as an option, when the traditional dish contains only pecorino cheese, black pepper, and pasta. An Italian restaurant association was so incensed it contacted the British embassy in Rome to complain about the "astonishing" error. The incident highlights the deep cultural importance of culinary tradition in Italy and the passionate reactions that can be provoked by perceived misinterpretations of classic recipes.</p>

          <p>The California Supreme Court has unanimously sided with environmental groups, ruling that a lower court was wrong to block a legal challenge against the state's decision to cut rooftop solar incentives. The case, which now returns to the appeals court, contests the Public Utilities Commission's 2022 move to slash credits for solar panel owners who send excess power to the grid. Environmental groups argue the commission violated state law and that the cuts disincentivize solar adoption. The ruling affirms that the commission is not above the law and must be held to the same standard of judicial review as other state agencies.</p>
