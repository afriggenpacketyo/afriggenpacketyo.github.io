          <h2>Decline in Deep Reading May Be Impacting American Politics, Analysts Suggest</h2>

          <p>A Vox article explores the potential impact of declining deep reading habits on American politics, suggesting a shift back to pre-literate modes of cognition. Sustained engagement with long-form text activates cognitive capacities, while the average American reads fewer books than ever. Some theorists believe the digital age's modes of thought increasingly resemble those of pre-literate oral cultures, impacting commitment to pluralism and rational self-government. The article suggests that while digital media has its benefits, it may be impacting the way that voters and citizens think about rational self-government.</p>

          <p>President Trump is attending a NATO summit in The Hague, Netherlands, following a ceasefire announcement between Israel and Iran. European allies are increasing defense spending to meet Trump's demands, with NATO reaching an agreement for nations to boost spending to five percent of their GDP, excluding Spain. Trump stated he doesn't think the U.S. needs to hit the 5% target but that other nations should, and Rutte said NATO would stand behind the U.S. after Iran launched a counterstrike on its air base in Qatar. Rutte also defended the U.S. strikes on Iran, emphasizing that Iran should not possess nuclear weapons.</p>

          <p>Following the January Eaton fire, residents in Los Angeles are finding hope in the blooming jacaranda trees, even those partially burned. These trees, known for their vibrant purple flowers, symbolize resilience and recovery for those who lost their homes and landscapes. However, experts caution that the trees still face threats from post-fire recovery efforts, including construction activities and premature removal. Residents are encouraged to take steps to improve their trees' chances of survival, such as providing adequate water and removing dead branches.</p>

          <p>Literacy experts suggest that parents should not focus on teaching 3-year-olds to read, emphasizing that language development at this age is best fostered through play, conversation, and reading aloud. Research indicates that oral language skills are more valuable than early reading, with strong vocabulary predicting school readiness in later grades. While some children may learn letters early, the prime time for reading instruction is between ages 5 and 7. Forcing reading too early can potentially turn children off from the activity.</p>

          <p>Senator Chris Murphy has been on an intellectual journey, influenced as much by the Trumpist right as by the Sanders left. He has come to think that the Democratic Party can regain working-class support only by calling out the powerful corporate villains who he believes are to blame for the country‚Äôs problems. Murphy started with Why Liberalism Failed, by the Notre Dame professor Patrick Deneen, and started spending time listening to the Red Scare, and reading Curtis Yarvin, and going through the stuff that the Claremont Institute was producing.  He has come to feel that the new right‚Äîskeptical of free-market libertarianism and eager to use state power to impose its values on American institutions, including Big Business‚Äîwas asking the right questions, even if its answers were alarming.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has pledged that the UK will meet a new NATO target to spend 5% of its GDP on national security by 2035. The agreement is expected to be finalized at a NATO summit in the Netherlands, splitting the spending between core defense (3.5%) and defense-related areas such as resilience and security (1.5%). This move aims to satisfy US President Trump's call for increased NATO spending while providing flexibility for EU countries. However, Conservative shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel criticized the plan, arguing it lacks new funding and doesn't address immediate security threats.</p>
