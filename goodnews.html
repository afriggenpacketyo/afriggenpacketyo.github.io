          <p>Sony Group shares experienced a surge of over 3.5% amidst volatile trading following the announcement of a share buyback of up to 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion). The company's operating income for the recent financial quarter surpassed analyst estimates, although it showed an 11% decrease compared to the previous year. Sony also detailed plans for a partial spinoff of its financial unit, intending to distribute over 80% of the shares to shareholders through dividends. Despite these developments, Sony's outlook for the current financial year ending in March 2026 was described as lackluster, presenting a mixed picture for investors.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established a new government department focused on streamlining the state apparatus, appointing Karsten Wildberger to lead it, drawing comparisons to Elon Musk's role in the US government. Wildberger's ministry will oversee the state's IT infrastructure, aiming to improve efficiency and digitalization, with Wildberger advocating for reduced business regulations. However, unlike Musk, Wildberger faces constraints from the EU's data privacy regulations and Germany's federal system, requiring him to build alliances with state governments. Some experts caution that appointing business executives to government positions can lead to policies that benefit their own sectors, highlighting the need for Wildberger to balance business interests with public service.</p>

          <p>Chinese tech giant Tencent announced a 13% year-on-year revenue increase in the first quarter of 2025, driven by strong performance in its key gaming business.

Tencent's WeChat, with over 1.4 billion monthly active users, has also seen growth in marketing services revenue, up 20% due to robust advertiser demand. While revenue exceeded expectations, net profit fell slightly short, reflecting the competitive landscape and ongoing investments in new technologies and platforms.</p>

          <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Mehmet Oz, Brooke Rollins, and Scott Turner argue that America's welfare programs have strayed from their original mission by including millions of able-bodied adults, diverting resources from the truly needy. They advocate for requiring able-bodied adults to work, participate in job training, or volunteer at least 20 hours a week to receive benefits. Citing the success of the 1996 welfare reform, they assert that work provides purpose, dignity, and strengthens communities, reducing dependency and improving lives. The officials state that their agencies are ready to implement these work requirements to prioritize the vulnerable and empower individuals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study indicates that weight-loss medications, specifically GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and bariatric surgery can effectively reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers (ORC). Researchers found that GLP-1 RAs have a direct effect on reducing ORC risk beyond just weight loss, estimating a 41% relative risk reduction compared to bariatric surgery. Experts suggest that the anti-inflammatory properties of GLP-1 RAs and their ability to improve metabolic health may contribute to this decreased cancer risk. While promising, further research is needed to confirm these effects and understand the underlying mechanisms, with a focus on long-term safety and potential side effects.</p>

To accommodate the growing demand, Shenzhen is adding new international routes, including a direct flight to Dubai, and is attractive to travelers due to its trade status, proximity to Hong Kong, and relatively low cost of living.</p>

          <p>Lyle and Erik Menendez were resentenced to life in prison with the possibility of parole, setting the stage for their potential release after more than three decades for killing their parents. Judge Michael V. Jesic of Los Angeles Superior Court made the decision after hearing testimony from family members, who testified that the brothers had turned their lives around through education and self-help groups. While the judge acknowledged the horrific nature of the crime, he was swayed by the support from corrections officials and stated that the brothers had done enough to earn a chance at parole. The brothers will now be eligible for parole, and their future will be in the hands of Gov. Gavin Newsom and state parole-board officials.</p>
