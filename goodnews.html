          <p>Annalena Baerbock, Germany's former foreign minister from the Green Party, has begun her new role as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Her election was conducted via a secret ballot requested by Russia, a move seen as a reaction to her vocal criticism of the war in Ukraine. Despite some domestic criticism regarding her nomination over a more experienced diplomat, Baerbock aims to act as a unifier and honest broker for all 193 UN member states. Her transition to the international stage comes as her Green Party adjusts to being in the opposition back in Germany.</p>

          <p>Artist and mycologist Sam Shoemaker successfully paddled a kayak grown entirely from mycelium, the root structure of mushrooms, for over 26 miles from Catalina Island to the California mainland. The 12-hour journey marks a significant achievement in the field of fungal innovation, promoting mycelium as a biodegradable alternative to plastics used in aquatic recreation. Shoemaker's project, supported by the arts organization Fulcrum Arts, aims to inspire further research into "AquaFung" materials. While acknowledging the technology is still in its early stages, he hopes his open-source research will encourage others to build upon his work.</p>

          <h2>Analyst Argues Economic Strength Can Absorb Impact of Trump's Tariffs</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration's elimination of the "de minimis" loophole, which allowed tariff-free imports under $800, has sparked concern among some small businesses. However, this article argues that the panic is misdirected, as the majority of small businesses are service-based and will not be directly affected. The author contends that while tariffs will lead to price increases, the broader economy can likely absorb these costs as long as income and wealth continue to grow. The piece suggests the real concern should be the overall health of the labor market and consumer affordability, not the specific details of tariff policy.</p>

          <p>After a three-month period without a grand prize winner, two tickets sold in Missouri and Texas have won the estimated $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot. The prize is the second-largest in the game's history, with a cash value of approximately $826.4 million. This marks the fifth time the jackpot has been won this year, with the odds of winning the top prize standing at 1 in 292.2 million. The largest Powerball jackpot ever was $2.04 billion, won by a single ticket in California in 2022. Winners can choose between a lump-sum payment or an annuity paid over 30 years.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to pediatrician Dr. Daniel Golshevsky, establishing healthy sleep habits, or "sleep hygiene," in infancy is one of the most critical things parents can do for their children's future health and success. These foundational habits are linked to better cognitive development, emotional regulation, and resilience later in life. Dr. Golshevsky advises creating a soothing environment that mimics the womb with warmth, white noise, and gentle motion. He also recommends that both parents get involved in settling the baby and stresses the importance of a flexible routine that responds to the baby's needs rather than a rigid schedule.</p>

          <h2>Op-Ed Argues Solar Power Aligns with Prepper and Conservative Individualism</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 09:00:22 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece makes the case that solar energy should be embraced by right-wing preppers and conservatives, not for environmental reasons, but for its alignment with principles of self-sufficiency and independence. The author contrasts the complex, failure-prone fossil fuel supply chain with the simplicity and resilience of solar panels and batteries, which offer a direct, long-lasting energy source from the sun. By providing energy independence from fragile grids and complex systems, solar power is presented as the ideal power source for those concerned with civilizational breakdown. The article suggests this shared interest could bridge political divides on energy policy.</p>

          <p>Bill Belichick earned his first victory as the head coach of the University of North Carolina with a 20-3 win over Charlotte. Following the game, Belichick addressed reports of animosity with his former team, the New England Patriots, confirming that he has banned their scouts from UNC facilities. He stated that since he feels unwelcome at the Patriots' facility, they are not welcome at his, signaling a clear deterioration in the relationship since his departure. The win provided a much-needed positive result for the Tar Heels after an embarrassing season-opening loss to TCU.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Increased Coal Power Use Serves as a 'Shock Absorber' for Renewables</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-07 08:30:08 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion piece argues that China's recent expansion of coal power capacity is not a reversal of its climate policy but a pragmatic strategy to support its massive transition to renewable energy. With solar and wind power generation growing at a record pace, the existing grid struggles with intermittency and curtailment, where clean energy is generated but cannot be used. Coal plants are being used as a reliable backup to prevent blackouts during peak demand or when renewables fall short, such as during droughts affecting hydropower. This approach provides stability, giving grid operators the confidence to continue integrating unprecedented amounts of new green energy.</p>

          <p>Milda Mitkutė, co-founder of the online marketplace Vinted, recounts how the need to clear out her oversized wardrobe before moving to a smaller apartment led to the creation of a billion-dollar company. In 2008, she and a friend, Justas Janauskas, quickly launched a simple website in Lithuania for selling secondhand clothes, which rapidly gained popularity through word of mouth. After expanding into Germany, the platform grew into the global brand Vinted, which now has over 16 million users in the UK alone. The company overcame early financial struggles to become Lithuania's first tech "unicorn," capitalizing on the growing trend of sustainable, second-hand fashion.</p>
