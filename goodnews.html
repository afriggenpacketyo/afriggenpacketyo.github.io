        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A fourth-round Wimbledon match between Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova and Sonay Kartal was temporarily halted due to a significant failure in the electronic line-calling system. The system failed to make an audio call on a crucial point, leading to confusion and a decision by the chair umpire to replay the point, which frustrated Pavlyuchenkova. She argued that the umpire should have made the call himself, as the ball was visibly out. The incident, attributed to operator error, has sparked debate about the reliability of the new technology and the procedures in place for such malfunctions.</p>

          <p>Volkswagen has introduced its new autonomous vehicle, the ID. Buzz van, which is engineered for driverless fleet operations rather than individual ownership. The vehicle achieves SAE Level 4 autonomy, capable of navigating without human input in specific conditions, by using a sophisticated array of 27 sensors, including cameras, LiDAR, and radar for 360-degree vision. Developed with technology from Mobileye, the van is designed for public transit and corporate mobility services. Pilot programs are planned for Hamburg and Los Angeles, with a broader rollout anticipated for 2026, aiming to address transit challenges like driver shortages.</p>

          <p>India's cricket team achieved a commanding 336-run victory over England in the second Test at Edgbaston, successfully leveling the series at 1-1. Despite a resilient 88-run effort from England's Jamie Smith, the host team was bowled out for 271. Indian bowler Akash Deep was instrumental in the win, delivering a superb performance that earned him a five-wicket haul and final figures of 6-99. The decisive win for India sets up an exciting continuation of the series, which is scheduled to resume at Lord's on Thursday.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, with its maximum sustained winds decreasing to 35 mph. Consequently, all tropical storm warnings for the coastal areas have been discontinued. The storm is expected to continue weakening as it moves further inland over the Carolinas and is projected to dissipate by Monday. While the immediate storm threat has lessened, flood watches remain in effect for parts of North and South Carolina due to the potential for heavy rain and localized flash flooding from the system's remnants.</p>

          <p>White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's new domestic policy bill, projecting it will stimulate 3% economic growth and ultimately reduce the federal deficit. He dismissed contrary analyses from the CBO and other groups, citing the administration's past modeling accuracy. Hassett also addressed upcoming trade deadlines, indicating that new deals with foreign partners are imminent, while letters will be sent to others. He asserted that the administration's tariff strategy is successfully encouraging companies to move production to the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>On the 50th anniversary of its release, the cast and crew of the 1975 classic 'Jaws' are reflecting on its challenging but ultimately historic production. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalled his initial reluctance to join the film, which was plagued by a malfunctioning mechanical shark and a schedule that ballooned from 55 to 159 days. Despite the difficulties, director Steven Spielberg, then only 27, transformed the troubled shoot into the first-ever summer blockbuster. The film's success not only changed Hollywood but also permanently linked the careers of its stars to the iconic story of three men against a great white shark.</p>

          <p>Pulitzer Prize-winning biographer Ron Chernow is releasing a new book on the life of Samuel Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, exploring the complexities of the iconic American author. Chernow's work delves into how Twain's painful early life and fear of poverty shaped his famous sardonic humor and dominated his adult years. The biography traces his journey from a boy on the Mississippi to a world-famous writer and speaker who, despite his fame and wealth, was plagued by ill-fated investments. Chernow argues that Twain's engagement with themes of race, politics, and class remains deeply relevant today.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Peru have announced the discovery of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico, believed to have been a vital trading hub for early American civilizations. Located in the northern Barranca province, the site connected communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes mountains, and the Amazon basin. Researchers suggest the discovery provides crucial insight into the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, which declined due to climate change. The excavation at Peñico, which took eight years, unearthed 18 structures, including ceremonial temples and residential buildings, along with numerous artifacts.</p>

          <p>Despite rising trade tensions at the national level, many local government officials in the United States continue to welcome Chinese investment, according to a leader from the China General Chamber of Commerce. City leaders are reportedly eager for Chinese-invested projects, particularly in manufacturing, to help stimulate their local economies. While geopolitical friction has made some potential investors hesitant, mayors in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are said to be very receptive. The push for local production is also driven by U.S. tariffs, which incentivize Chinese companies to manufacture goods within the U.S. for domestic sale. (not investment advice)</p>
