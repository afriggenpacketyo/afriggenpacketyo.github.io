        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Palantir increased its revenue forecast following strong growth in both commercial and government sectors, driven by what CEO Alex Karp describes as a 'tectonic shift' in AI adoption. The company's commercial revenues jumped 71%, while government sales increased by 45%, with U.S. commercial revenues expected to exceed $1.178 billion this year. Karp credited the government sector growth to increased U.S. defense adoption and noted a surge in demand for large language models and supporting software. Despite the positive outlook, Palantir's shares experienced a slight after-hours decline of approximately 5% following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Hollywood Studio Stocks Dip After Trump Proposes Foreign Film Tariff</h2>

          <p>Shares of major Hollywood studios like Netflix, Disney, and Warner Bros. Discovery experienced a brief decline after President Trump proposed a 100% tariff on movies produced overseas. Trump cited foreign tax incentives as a 'national security threat,' but the implementation and scope of the proposed tariffs remain unclear. Industry experts worry about the impact on relationships with other countries and the potential for retaliatory measures that could affect international box office sales. The tariff's impact is uncertain, as the majority of projects are shot digitally, and transporting the final product can be done online.</p>
