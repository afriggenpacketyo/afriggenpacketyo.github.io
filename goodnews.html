        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Best Buy announced a modest sales recovery for its most recent quarter, exceeding Wall Street's revenue and earnings expectations, primarily boosted by a strong back-to-school season and the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Despite this positive performance, CEO Corie Barry maintained the company's full-year forecast, citing significant uncertainty regarding potential tariff impacts on consumer spending and the broader economy. The retailer is actively working to stimulate growth by expanding its third-party marketplace and introducing new in-store experiences, while also grappling with challenges like reduced demand for big-ticket items due to higher interest rates. The company's cautious outlook reflects ongoing economic headwinds, even as its computing category showed its sixth consecutive quarter of sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The UK government has unveiled the first electric vehicles (EVs) eligible for a new grant scheme offering discounts of up to £3,750, aiming to accelerate the transition from petrol and diesel cars. Ford's Puma Gen-E and e-Tourneo Courier qualify for the maximum discount, with 26 other models receiving £1,500 reductions. This initiative, funded by a £650 million scheme over three years, seeks to make EVs more affordable and bridge the price gap with traditional vehicles. Despite industry support and the goal of banning new fossil fuel car sales by 2030, some drivers and critics highlight ongoing concerns about high upfront costs and the need for more charging infrastructure.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the absence of federal regulation, 23 U.S. states are increasingly enacting or expanding laws to restrict the collection and use of biometric data, including facial recognition technology. States like Colorado and Texas now require consent for its use and ban the sale of such data, while Illinois's strict law allows individuals to sue, leading to large settlements against tech giants like Google and Meta. Experts argue that robust laws, especially those with a "private right of action," are crucial for shaping corporate behavior and protecting privacy in an era of ubiquitous AI-driven surveillance. However, the global nature of some tech companies, like PimEyes, can challenge the enforcement of even the toughest state laws.</p>

          <p>For a significant portion of Americans, Social Security represents a critical financial lifeline in retirement, underscoring the importance of maximizing these benefits. This article details three effective strategies to boost future checks: delaying the claim until age 70, which can increase monthly payments by 24% permanently, continuing to work to ensure 35 high-earning years are factored into calculations, and strategically coordinating spousal benefits for married couples. While Social Security is often insufficient to cover all retirement costs, supplementary financial tools such as annuities, reverse mortgages, and diversified retirement portfolios are also recommended. Proactive planning and implementation of these strategies are presented as essential for securing greater financial stability in later life. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Comparing Interest Earnings: $40,000 CD Versus Money Market Account in a Shifting Rate Environment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a financial climate marked by recent Federal Reserve rate cuts and anticipated further declines, this article compares the interest-earning potential of a $40,000 Certificate of Deposit (CD) versus a Money Market Account. While CDs offer fixed, guaranteed rates, money market accounts have variable rates that are likely to fall with future Fed cuts. Analysis shows that over shorter terms, money market accounts might offer slightly higher returns based on current rates, but CDs provide stability and guaranteed returns over the specified period. Savers are advised to consider the certainty of a CD's fixed rate against the potential for declining variable rates in money market accounts, especially for those prioritizing guaranteed earnings.

          <p>Nike is undertaking another round of corporate layoffs, impacting less than 1% of its staff, as CEO Elliott Hill continues his strategic realignment to refocus the business on growth. These cuts are part of a broader restructuring effort initiated last February, which saw 2% of staff laid off. Hill's vision involves shifting the company's structure from a men's, women's, and kids' segmentation back to a sports-and-culture-centric model, aiming to reignite innovation and deepen connections with athletes and consumers. The company anticipates sales and profit declines to moderate, signaling a potential turnaround. Employees will be notified by September 8, with new roles taking effect later that month.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly, the manufacturer of the popular weight loss drug Mounjaro, has offered a discounted deal to UK suppliers, aiming to mitigate a previously announced price increase for consumers. While the list price was set to jump significantly, the highest dose will now be sold to suppliers for a more moderate amount, reducing the anticipated burden on patients. This move follows past complaints from figures like U.S. President Donald Trump regarding high drug costs in the U.S. The new arrangement does not affect the NHS, which has its own negotiated rates. With over 1.5 million people in the UK using weight loss drugs, mostly privately, pharmacies are working to support patients through these price adjustments.</p>

CEO Jensen Huang expressed optimism about a potential $50 billion opportunity in China and the prospect of selling advanced processors there, despite the H20 chip's fate remaining unclear.

          <p>In a notable shift in energy sector investment, traditional oil and gas stocks, like Exxon Mobil and Chevron, have been outperformed by utilities this year, despite positive returns. According to Paul Baiocchi of SS&C ALPS Advisors, this trend reflects a changing investor perspective, moving from crude oil and natural gas to broader power generation. Factors like the surging demand for electricity due to AI data centers, a new tech arms race, and renewed interest in nuclear power are driving this transformation. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) has seen significant inflows and tripled the performance of the broader energy sector ETF (XLE), indicating a fundamental re-evaluation of energy investment strategies.

          <p>Mexico is reportedly preparing to increase tariffs on Chinese imports, specifically for automobiles, textiles, and plastics, as part of its 2026 budget proposal. This potential policy shift, urged by the U.S. under President Donald Trump's "Fortress North America" initiative, aims to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains. Trump has been a vocal critic of what he perceives as trade "loopholes" allowing Chinese goods, particularly cars built in Mexico, to enter the U.S. duty-free, threatening high tariffs in response. If implemented, these tariffs would mark a significant change in Mexico's trade strategy, impacting its substantial imports from China, which exceeded $51 billion last year.</p>

The GDP figures also reflected the unusual impact of tariffs, with a sharp decline in imports contributing to the overall growth.
