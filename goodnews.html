          <p>Sources indicate that the Trump administration is considering accepting a Boeing 747-8 jumbo jet, dubbed a 'flying palace,' from the Qatari royal family, potentially for President Trump's use as Air Force One until shortly before he leaves office. The plane would then be transferred to the Trump Presidential Library Foundation. Legal analyses from the White House counsel's office and the Department of Justice reportedly conclude that accepting the gift is legally permissible, as it's not conditioned on any official act and is given to the Air Force and the library foundation, not an individual. The estimated value of the aircraft is around $400 million, excluding security upgrades, and L3Harris has been commissioned to overhaul the plane.</p>

          <p>A proposal to replace public basketball courts with pickleball facilities on Fort Lauderdale's historic beachfront has ignited controversy, with some residents alleging racial motives. The basketball courts, built after the end of segregation, have been a popular gathering spot for a diverse community. The city commission's agreement with developers to redevelop the Bahia Mar marina includes pickleball courts, but protesters argue that replacing the basketball courts was never specified. Some fear the change will exclude minority residents who frequent the basketball courts, while developers argue pickleball has broader appeal.</p>

          <p>After a century of progress, U.S. life expectancy has declined in recent years, but scientific advancements offer hope for reversing this trend. Cardiologist Dr. Eric Topol suggests several evidence-based strategies, including knowing and lowering your biological age through blood tests, adopting a Mediterranean diet rich in whole grains and seafood, prioritizing deep sleep, engaging in strength training, and fostering social connections. Research indicates that these steps can significantly contribute to a longer, healthier life, without relying on futuristic technologies. Topol emphasizes the importance of personalized risk assessment and lifestyle changes in promoting healthy aging.</p>

          <p>Mathematicians from Fudan University and UCLA have purportedly solved the 65-year-old Kervaire invariant problem, a long-standing puzzle in the field of topology. The breakthrough, achieved through computational methods, provides proof of the existence of manifolds of Kervaire invariant one in dimension 126. The Kervaire invariant is a function that determines whether a topological space can be transformed into a sphere through surgery. This solution resolves a key aspect of a hypothesis related to the classification of manifolds.</p>
