In Chicago, Los Angeles, and Phoenix, manual labor positions like freight and stock movers are among the most common, with median annual salaries around $40,000. Among the top five most frequent jobs across the largest U.S. metropolitan areas, registered nurses and general and operations managers command the highest salaries, with both roles earning over six figures in New York.

          <p>The annual Sienna awards for aerial photography have showcased a collection of breathtaking images captured by drones, offering unique perspectives on landscapes and human activity worldwide. The top prize went to German filmmaker Dennis Schmelz for "The Lone Horseman," a striking winter photo taken in Cappadocia, Turkey. Other winning entries feature a sprawling urban panorama of Dhaka, Bangladesh, the vibrant chaos of a traditional wrestling tournament, and the stark beauty of a ship stranded in Iran's drought-stricken Lake Urmia. The competition celebrates how drone technology enables photographers to reveal patterns and tell compelling stories that are invisible from the ground.</p>

          <p>A family from West Virginia experienced a medical odyssey after four of their six children were diagnosed with Chiari malformation, a rare condition where brain tissue extends into the spinal canal. The journey began when their youngest daughter, Austyn, underwent successful brain surgery that dramatically improved her constant pain and developmental delays. Subsequently, three of her older sisters—Amelia, Aubrey, and Adalee—were also diagnosed after exhibiting various symptoms, each requiring surgical intervention. While a genetic link is present in about 10% of cases, it is highly unusual to see it in so many siblings. The family is now enjoying a "new normal" with their children healthy and active.</p>

          <p>Authorities in the UK have discovered and dismantled the country's first known illegal production facility for weight loss medications, resulting in a massive seizure of trafficked drugs. The operation in Northampton uncovered tens of thousands of empty injection pens, raw ingredients, and over 2,000 filled pens of unlicensed Retatrutide and Tirzepatide. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) described the bust as the largest of its kind by any law enforcement agency worldwide. Officials warned that these unauthorized products are untested and potentially deadly, urging the public to only purchase medicines from registered pharmacies to avoid funding criminal networks.</p>

          <p>In her first UK interview since losing the 2024 presidential election, former Vice President Kamala Harris told the BBC she is considering another run for the White House in 2028. While not making a formal decision, she stated, "I am not done," and expressed confidence that a woman would be president in the near future, adding it could "possibly" be her. Harris dismissed unfavorable polls and strongly criticized President Trump, labeling him a "tyrant" who has weaponized the Department of Justice. The interview is part of a tour for her new book, "107 Days," which recounts her campaign after President Biden withdrew from the race.</p>

          <p>Dr. Roy Meals, an 80-year-old hand surgeon, has documented his journey of walking the entire 342-mile perimeter of Los Angeles in a new book, "Walking the Line." Motivated by curiosity and a desire to better understand the city where he has lived for half his life, Meals divided the trek into 34 segments. His adventure led him to explore diverse neighborhoods, sample local cuisines, and uncover historical sites, from the treaty grounds of Campo de Cahuenga to a monument for Japanese Americans sent to Manzanar. Meals's project is a prescription for others to explore their own communities on foot, fostering curiosity, fitness, and engagement.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite widespread panic in Hollywood over advancements in AI video generation like OpenAI's Sora 2, the technology's actual disruption of the industry has been limited so far. Major studios, including Disney and Lionsgate, have invested heavily in AI but have yet to see significant cost savings or revolutionary creative outputs, facing challenges with legal copyrights, security, and integration into established production workflows. While AI is being used for tasks like dubbing and animation, it has not yet replaced jobs or produced feature films as some predicted. For now, AI remains more of a developing tool and a source of anxiety than an existential threat to the entertainment business.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Starboard Value has taken a nearly 5% stake in engineering and construction company Fluor, aiming to unlock value from its significant holding in NuScale Power. Fluor's 39% stake in the small modular nuclear reactor company is valued at approximately $4.3 billion, representing over half of Fluor's total enterprise value. Starboard argues that this valuation suppresses the worth of Fluor's core business, which they believe is trading at a steep discount compared to its peers. The activist is pushing for a separation, such as a sale or a tax-free spinoff of the NuScale shares, to re-rate the core company's stock and deliver value to shareholders.

          <p>Georgia's State Security Service has arrested three Chinese citizens in the capital, Tbilisi, for attempting to illegally acquire two kilograms of uranium. According to the agency, the suspects intended to pay $400,000 for the nuclear material and planned to transport it back to China via Russia. The operation was reportedly coordinated by other members of a criminal group based in China. Authorities stated that the individuals were detained while negotiating the final details of the illicit transaction. The security service released video of the arrests but did not specify when they occurred or the identities of the suspects.</p>

          <p>A new Charles Schwab survey indicates that 45% of investors are interested in alternative investments, with two-thirds believing that supplementing traditional stocks and bonds is necessary for success. This trend, particularly strong among younger investors, reflects a growing disillusionment with conventional portfolios. Financial advisors suggest that exchange-traded funds (ETFs) can be a practical way to gain exposure to alternatives like real estate or commodities without the liquidity issues of direct private investment. Despite the interest in alternatives, experts still recommend that the core of long-term investment portfolios for goals like retirement should remain in diversified, traditional assets.

          <p>Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell has been elected as the new deputy leader of the UK's Labour Party, defeating Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson. The election was initiated after Angela Rayner's resignation last month. Powell ran on a platform promising to give grassroots members a stronger voice and to push for a "course correction" from the government's current direction under Prime Minister Keir Starmer. In her victory speech, Powell called for the party to be "bolder" and vowed to be an ally to Starmer while also bringing critical perspectives to the heart of the party's leadership.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant moment for traditionalist Catholics, American Cardinal Raymond Burke celebrated the old Latin Mass in St. Peter's Basilica, an event seen as a sign of a more conciliatory approach from the new Pope Leo XIV. The celebration comes after Pope Francis enacted restrictions on the traditional liturgy in 2021, citing its potential to create division within the church. Many traditionalists felt marginalized by this decision and are now hopeful that the new pontiff will be more open to their form of worship. The permission for the Mass was reportedly granted by Pope Leo himself, signaling a potential shift toward healing liturgical divisions.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has begun a five-day tour of Asia, with planned stops in Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, where high-stakes trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping are scheduled. As he departed, Trump told reporters he would be open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, their first potential encounter since 2019, though U.S. officials later downplayed any current plans for such a meeting. The primary focus of the trip is the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea, where Trump and Xi are expected to seek a resolution to their escalating trade war before a new round of U.S. tariffs takes effect.</p>
