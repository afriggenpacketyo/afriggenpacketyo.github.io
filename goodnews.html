          <p>Federal prosecutors in the U.S. have announced they will not seek the death penalty against Ismael "El Mayo" Zambada and Rafael Caro Quintero, two of Mexico's most infamous drug lords. Both men, who have pleaded not guilty to extensive drug trafficking charges, are being prosecuted in the same Brooklyn courthouse where "El Chapo" Guzmán was convicted. This decision removes capital punishment as a possibility for Quintero, who is charged in the 1985 killing of a DEA agent, and Zambada, a long-time leader of the Sinaloa cartel. While lawyers for the defendants welcomed the move, it remains unclear if it opens a path toward potential plea agreements in these high-profile cases.</p>

          <p>Indiana Fever's Sophie Cunningham has publicly criticized former teammate DeWanna Bonner for her handling of her departure from the team. Bonner left the Fever nine games into the season for "personal reasons" and subsequently returned to the Phoenix Mercury, where she was met with boos from Indianapolis fans upon her return. Cunningham, speaking on her podcast, suggested Bonner lacked professionalism by not communicating with her teammates directly about her exit. While expressing a desire for Bonner to be happy, Cunningham stated that Bonner should have anticipated the negative reception from fans given the circumstances of her controversial mid-season departure.</p>

          <p>Michigan's Democratic Governor, Gretchen Whitmer, met with President Trump to discuss critical issues affecting her state, leveraging their cordial working relationship. During the meeting, Whitmer advocated for a three-year delay in federal changes to Michigan's Medicaid program to avoid disrupting care for vulnerable residents. She also highlighted the detrimental impact of the administration's tariff policies on Michigan's vital automobile industry. This meeting underscores Whitmer's strategy of maintaining bipartisan communication with the White House to secure federal support and investment for her state, even while disagreeing on certain policies and rhetoric.</p>

These models are designed to be lower-cost alternatives that developers and researchers can run and customize, competing with similar offerings from Meta, Mistral AI, and DeepSeek. The release follows delays for extensive safety testing, where OpenAI worked to mitigate potential malicious use. The models, available on platforms like Hugging Face and GitHub, are optimized to run on a wide range of hardware, from consumer laptops to cloud servers, aiming to broaden access to powerful AI technology.</p>

          <p>Federal authorities have arrested two Los Angeles County residents, Chuan Geng and Shiwei Yang, for their alleged role in an illegal scheme to export high-powered AI microchips to China. The duo, who operated a tech company called ALX Solutions Inc., are accused of violating the Export Control Reform Act by shipping tens of millions of dollars' worth of sensitive technology without the required licenses. Prosecutors claim they concealed the shipments by routing them through third-party countries like Singapore and Malaysia and falsifying labels. If convicted, Geng and Yang face a maximum of 20 years in prison for undercutting U.S. national security controls on emerging technologies.</p>

          <p>Austin Robert Drummond, the man suspected of killing four members of his girlfriend's family, has been arrested in rural Tennessee, ending an intensive weeklong manhunt. Drummond is accused of fatally shooting the parents, grandmother, and teenage uncle of a baby he then abandoned in a car seat outside a stranger's home. The arrest occurred after authorities issued a shelter-in-place warning near Jackson and received multiple tips from the public. The killings were described as a targeted attack, and Drummond now faces multiple charges, including four counts of first-degree murder. The infant is reported to be safe and in care.</p>

          <p>Despite significant technological advancements, public perception of weather forecasting accuracy remains mixed, a phenomenon this article explores in detail. Lead weather forecaster Carol Kirkwood explains that while a one-day forecast is now over 90% accurate, the chaotic nature of the atmosphere means tiny initial errors can lead to vastly different outcomes, an idea known as the Butterfly Effect. The article discusses the difficulty of predicting weather for very small geographic areas and the challenge of communicating complex meteorological data and uncertainty to the public. It also looks to the future, where AI could provide more granular, long-range predictions but also presents new challenges for clear communication.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice is preparing to indict Elias Rodriguez on federal hate crime charges for the May shooting that killed two Israeli Embassy employees, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Lynn Milgrim. According to a source, the indictment is expected to include special findings that would allow prosecutors to seek the death penalty. Rodriguez is already facing first-degree murder charges after allegedly attacking the couple as they left an event at the Capital Jewish Museum in Washington, D.C. After the shooting, he reportedly told police, "I did it for Palestine, I did it for Gaza," prompting the hate crime investigation.</p>

          <p>President Trump has indicated that he views Vice President JD Vance as the probable frontrunner to succeed him as the leader of the Republican party. When asked if Vance was the "heir apparent to MAGA," the president responded that he is "most likely" the leading contender at this early stage. Trump also mentioned Secretary of State Marco Rubio as another potential figure, suggesting he might team up with Vance in the future. Both Vance and Rubio, once critics of Trump, are now seen as key allies and potential candidates for the 2028 GOP presidential nomination, though both have been publicly reserved about their ambitions.</p>

McDonald, who became a fugitive after failing to appear before the SEC in 2021, defrauded investors after his firm lost up to $40 million on a risky market bet. He then solicited new funds under false pretenses, misappropriating the money for personal expenses, including a Porsche and luxury rent, and to make Ponzi-like payments to other clients.

          <p>The House Oversight Committee has officially issued subpoenas to the Department of Justice, former President Bill Clinton, and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for records related to the Jeffrey Epstein case. Committee Chair James Comer stated the move is essential for congressional oversight of how the federal government handled the investigation and prosecution of Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. The bipartisan-supported subpoenas demand all relevant documents and communications by August 19. This action escalates a push for transparency and risks a confrontation with the White House over the politically sensitive saga.</p>

          <p>The U.S. is making a concerted effort to reduce its heavy reliance on China for rare earth elements, which are crucial for everything from consumer electronics to advanced military technology. A key part of this strategy is the revival of California's Mountain Pass mine, which was once the world's dominant supplier but closed in 2002. With significant funding from the Department of Defense, the U.S. government is aiming to re-establish a domestic supply chain after previous private sector attempts to restart the mine ended in bankruptcy. This strategic push reflects growing urgency in Washington to secure American access to these critical materials.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a new proposal aimed at making it easier for companies to use drones for commercial purposes like deliveries and inspections. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy explained the proposal would streamline the approval process, which previously required waivers on a case-by-case basis, a system he said stifled innovation. Under the new rules, commercial drones would need to meet specific industry and safety standards, including collision avoidance technology. The move was welcomed by the commercial drone industry, which has argued that regulations have not kept pace with technological advancements in the field.</p>

          <p>A U.S. district judge has issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from redirecting funds from the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program. The ruling comes after 20 states sued the administration, arguing that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) could not legally cancel the multibillion-dollar grant program without congressional approval. The BRIC program was created to help communities protect critical infrastructure before natural disasters occur. The judge found that the states showed a high likelihood of irreparable harm and that there is a strong public interest in ensuring the government follows the law.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is reportedly planning a pilot program to allow Medicare and Medicaid to cover costly weight loss drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound. This move could significantly expand access for millions of Americans with obesity, as spotty insurance coverage is currently a major barrier to these popular GLP-1 treatments. Under the plan, state Medicaid programs and Medicare Part D plans could voluntarily opt-in to cover the drugs for weight management. While details are still emerging, the potential for government coverage is seen as a major positive for drugmakers Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. (not investment advice)</p>
