          <p>A 20-year-old woman was likely bitten by a juvenile sand tiger shark while swimming in waist-deep water at Jones Beach, Long Island. Officials from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation came to this conclusion after examining photos of her injuries, which included gashes and teeth marks. The woman received immediate medical attention and was taken to a hospital for stitches before being released. Following the incident, swimming was temporarily suspended and authorities conducted drone searches for marine threats, though none were found.</p>

          <p>The long-standing mystery of Glastonbury's secret act, billed as "Patchwork," was resolved when Britpop icons Pulp took to the Pyramid Stage. Frontman Jarvis Cocker humorously acknowledged the poorly kept secret before launching into a set that celebrated the 30th anniversary of their historic 1995 headline performance. The band played a mix of beloved classics like "Common People" and "Sorted for E's & Wizz," alongside new material from their chart-topping album "More!". The performance was a nostalgic and triumphant moment for the festival, culminating with a flypast by the Red Arrows.</p>

          <p>An estimated 100,000 people participated in the 30th annual Budapest Pride march, defying a government ban in one of the largest LGBTQ+ demonstrations in Hungary's history. The event proceeded as a direct challenge to Prime Minister Viktor Orb√°n's government, which passed a law in March outlawing events deemed to promote homosexuality to minors. Budapest's mayor declared the march a municipal event to bypass the ban, though attendees still risked fines. The massive turnout, which included EU officials, was seen as a significant rebuke of Orb√°n's policies targeting LGBTQ+ rights.</p>

The company will also eliminate synthetic dyes from food sold to K-12 schools by the 2026-2027 school year. While many of its products, like Uncrustables, are already free of these additives, some items such as sugar-free jams, ice cream toppings, and certain Hostess brand snacks still contain them. This move aligns Smucker with other major food companies like Nestle and Kraft Heinz, which have made similar commitments amid increased federal scrutiny of artificial dyes.</p>

The drugs were discovered hidden beneath dozens of shipping containers on a vessel that had arrived from Panama. This marks the sixth-largest cocaine seizure on record in the UK. Border Force officials stated that container ships are a primary method for criminal organizations to smuggle cocaine into the country, which is one of Europe's largest markets for the drug.
