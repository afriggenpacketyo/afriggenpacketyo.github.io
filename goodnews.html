          <p>Pomona College is seeing a growing movement among students and faculty to reduce the pervasiveness of technology in campus life. Students are forming clubs and writing op-eds to encourage tech-free spaces and classes, while professors are experimenting with banning electronic devices and limiting ChatGPT use. The article suggests Pomona is well-positioned to become a leader in creating a less tech-dependent campus due to its resources and close-knit community. However, the administration has not yet aligned itself with these efforts, and challenges remain, including accessibility requirements and the integration of technology into coursework.</p>

          <p>The US National Guard is a reserve component of the US Armed Forces, consisting of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard, and is deployed for various purposes, including disaster relief and internal security. When deployed within a state, the governor typically assumes command, while the US president serves as commander-in-chief during nationwide deployments. President Trump recently overrode California Governor Gavin Newsom's authority to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles amid immigration protests, citing national security concerns. Joining the National Guard requires meeting certain physical, mental, and legal requirements, with members typically serving part-time.</p>

          <p>A state-backed think tank in China has proposed the country's "four core principles" as a framework for addressing disputes in the South China Sea. These principles include resolving disputes through consultation, managing differences through co-management, achieving mutually beneficial cooperation, and opposing external interference. The report blames regional tensions on external actors that fuel rival claimants' actions and weaken maritime cooperation. China's expansive claims over the resource-rich waters are contested by several ASEAN member states, leading to frequent face-offs between Chinese and Philippine vessels.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Experts suggest that sleeping position can significantly impact skin aging, with side and stomach sleeping potentially leading to wrinkles and sagging. Dr. Svetlana Danovich explains that compression and friction from these positions weaken collagen and elastin. Back sleeping is recommended as the most skin-friendly position, preventing direct contact between the face and pillow. Preventing sleep-related damage involves smart skincare, lifestyle adjustments, and internal wellness, such as silicone chest pads, retinoids, and minimized salt intake. In-office treatments like Botox, dermal fillers, and laser therapy can also help revive sleep-damaged skin.</p>

The speaker rejects the desire for extreme exploration, instead finding joy in simple observations like the gold flare in cottonwood leaves and the smell of pi√±on. The poem references Blake's idea that persistence in folly leads to wisdom, and concludes with a sense of acceptance and wonder at life's exploding, birthing stars. The tone is contemplative and appreciative of the present moment.</p>

The industry is working to attract younger people, with companies like GE Aerospace offering training and competitive salaries.
