          <h2>India and US Consider Zero-Tariff Trade Deal Amidst Economic Shifts</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 03:04:14 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India is reportedly considering a zero-tariff trade agreement with the U.S. on steel, auto components, and pharmaceuticals, signaling a shift from its protectionist policies as India looks to scale its economic growth from 6% to 8-9% and needs foreign investment. While some experts believe this deal could significantly benefit sectors like financials, materials, and healthcare, others are skeptical about the substantial impact on India's domestic manufacturing, particularly in steel and pharmaceuticals, but logistics companies may benefit from increased trade. The U.S. remains India's largest trading partner, with bilateral trade reaching $129 billion in 2024, and India seeks to loosen its protectionist stance to reduce regulatory burden.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Exports Surge as US Tariffs Prompt Shift to Southeast Asian Markets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-09 02:56:38 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports experienced a notable surge in April, driven primarily by increased shipments to Southeast Asian countries, which helped offset a significant decline in exports to the U.S. due to rising tariffs. Chinese exports to the U.S. plunged by over 21% year-on-year, while exports to ASEAN countries surged by 20.8%. This shift suggests a redirection of trade flows and potential transshipment through third countries. Despite the overall export growth, analysts anticipate a gradual weakening of trade data in the coming months as the full impact of tariffs becomes more evident.</p>

          <p>Albania is holding parliamentary elections, seen as a critical test for the country's democratic progress and its aspirations to join the European Union.

However, analysts emphasize that EU membership depends on substantial reforms and fighting corruption, not just political slogans. The opposition, united in the Alliance for a Magnificent Albania, is promising to improve living standards, but faces challenges including corruption allegations against key figures.</p>

          <p>The Venice Architecture Biennale is exploring strategies for cities to adapt to rising temperatures caused by climate change. The exhibition highlights the need for architects and urban planners to address the overheating of urban areas due to sealed surfaces and lack of green spaces. The biennale emphasizes the importance of collaboration across disciplines and generations to rethink the built environment and implement solutions like increasing green spaces and transforming cities into flood-resistant "sponge cities". Several examples of climate-adapted designs are presented, including projects in Frankfurt and Paris.</p>

          <p>Japan remains committed to securing the complete removal of tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, including a 25% levy on cars and duties on steel and aluminum. This stance comes after a U.S.-Britain trade agreement left some tariffs in place. The Japanese government is planning a third round of trade talks with Washington, maintaining that full removal of these tariffs is a prerequisite for reaching an agreement.</p>

          <p>President Trump announced the framework of a trade deal with Britain, which aims to lower the burden of his tariffs and provide a political victory for Prime Minister Keir Starmer. The deal includes increased access for U.S. agricultural products and reduced non-tariff barriers. However, a 10% tariff on U.K. imports remains in place. The deal is seen as symbolically important and a relief for British exporters, but its impact on overall trade deficits is limited.</p>
