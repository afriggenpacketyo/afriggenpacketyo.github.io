          <p>The UK is on track to potentially break its record for the hottest day of the year for two consecutive days, with temperatures expected to reach up to 33C. Health alerts have been issued across England due to the heatwave, which is expected to meet heatwave criteria in many regions. While some relief is anticipated on Sunday, the UKHSA has warned of significant impacts on health and social care services. Firefighters are also urging caution due to a surge in wildfires, marking a substantial increase compared to the previous year.</p>

          <p>Former President Joe Biden spoke at a Juneteenth Celebration Service in Galveston, Texas, criticizing what he described as ongoing efforts to erase history. He highlighted the importance of Juneteenth as a federal holiday and appeared to reference President Trump's administration, without naming him directly, for attempts to reinstate Confederate military base names. Biden emphasized the significance of remembering the events of Juneteenth and the moral stain of slavery in America's story. Several speakers recognized Biden for his role in making Juneteenth a national holiday.</p>

          <p>A half-mile-long drug-smuggling tunnel connecting Tijuana and San Diego was shut down by the Border Patrol. The tunnel, equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation systems, and a track system, was discovered as it was actively under construction. The entrance in Tijuana was hidden under recently placed tile. Authorities seized a package containing methamphetamine inside the tunnel. Contractors are expected to fill the tunnel with concrete to prevent future use, and this discovery marks the 95th tunnel found and decommissioned in the San Diego area since 1993.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump Administration cannot withhold transportation grant funding from states that refuse to cooperate with immigration enforcement. The ruling grants a preliminary injunction in a case filed by 20 states, stating that irreparable harm would occur without it. The Department of Transportation had imposed conditions on the funding, requiring states to adhere to an Immigration Enforcement Condition. The judge agreed with the states that the government lacked a plausible connection between cooperating with ICE and the approved purposes of the Department of Transportation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBOC), has kept its benchmark lending rates unchanged following monetary easing measures last month, as a trade deal with the U.S. eases some growth concerns. The 1-year loan prime rate remains at 3.0%, and the 5-year LPR at 3.5%. Trade-war fears have receded after U.S. and Chinese trade representatives agreed to honor the consensus reached in Geneva, allowing for rare earth and tech trade while suspending tariffs. Chinese authorities are likely to exercise "limited urgency" in rolling out additional fiscal stimulus in the near term. (not investment advice)</p>
