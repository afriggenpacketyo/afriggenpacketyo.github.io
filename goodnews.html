          <h2>China to Resume Seafood Imports from Japan After Fukushima Water Discharge Ban</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 23:31:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China has agreed to resume importing seafood from Japan, ending a two-year ban imposed due to concerns over the discharge of wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant. The agreement was reached during a meeting in Beijing, with exports expected to begin once China completes necessary procedures. The agreement is based on China's participation in water sampling missions as part of the International Atomic Energy Agency. China had halted seafood imports in 2023, citing risks to the fishing industry and coastal communities, despite Japan's assurances that the discharge met international safety standards.</p>

DOGE, created by executive order, has reportedly saved $175 billion through various spending cuts. Despite criticism from Democrats, markets have responded positively to Musk's return to the private sector, with Tesla shares rising.</p>
