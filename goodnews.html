          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-11 23:31:36 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Google has hired Varun Mohan, the co-founder and CEO of AI coding startup Windsurf, along with other senior employees, in a deal valued at $2.4 billion. This arrangement involves licensing fees and compensation, but not a direct investment in Windsurf, allowing the startup to remain independent. The move is a significant development in the escalating competition for top AI talent among tech giants like Google, Meta, and OpenAI. Windsurf specializes in AI tools for writing code, a rapidly growing sector that has attracted high valuations and strategic interest from major industry players.</p>

          <p>Luxury fashion brand Prada has announced plans to partner with Indian artisanal footwear makers after facing criticism for selling sandals that closely resembled traditional Kolhapuri chappals. The controversy erupted when Prada showcased the design at Milan Men's Fashion Week without acknowledging its Indian origins, sparking a social media outcry. Following the backlash, Prada engaged in discussions with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, which represents Kolhapuri artisans. This move is seen as a positive step towards respectful collaboration between global fashion houses and traditional craft communities.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. District Judge has issued a temporary restraining order preventing federal immigration agents in seven Southern California counties from conducting stops based solely on factors like race, ethnicity, or language. The ruling responds to a lawsuit by the ACLU and immigrant rights groups, which alleged that agents were unconstitutionally targeting individuals based on their appearance. The judge cited a "mountain of evidence" supporting the claims of constitutional violations. This order provides a temporary halt to these practices while the broader lawsuit against the administration's enforcement tactics proceeds.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in New York has permitted a lawsuit from two voice-over artists against AI startup Lovo Inc. to move forward on claims of breach of contract and deceptive business practices. The artists, Paul Skye Lehrman and Linnea Sage, allege the company used their voices to create AI clones for its text-to-speech platform without their consent, after initially hiring them for work described as for internal or academic use only. While a federal copyright claim on their voices was dismissed, the case will continue, marking a notable development in the legal battles between creators and AI companies over the use of personal data for training models.</p>

          <p>An increasing number of Chinese law firms are establishing a global presence, driven by demand from Chinese companies expanding abroad and encouragement from Beijing. These firms find that Chinese businesses often prefer legal support from compatriots they trust. As of the end of last year, there were over 200 overseas branches of Chinese law firms, a 70% increase since 2018. While serving Chinese clients is the primary focus, attracting international clients remains a challenge, particularly amid current geopolitical tensions, representing a pivotal moment for China's legal services industry.</p>

          <p>With the patent for semaglutide, the active ingredient in the popular weight-loss drug Ozempic, set to expire in China next year, dozens of local companies are developing rival medications. As many as 60 similar drugs are reportedly in trial phases, positioning China to enter the lucrative global weight-loss market, estimated to be worth $150 billion. The introduction of generic versions is expected to significantly lower the cost of these treatments, making them more accessible to a wider population. Analysts predict intense competition among up to 20 generic manufacturers, which will likely drive prices down.</p>

          <p>A major terminal operator at the Port of Long Beach has initiated a $365-million expansion project designed to increase cargo-handling capacity by 50%. The project involves extending the quay to accommodate larger ships, a move intended to strengthen the U.S. supply chain. This development comes at a time of uncertainty, as cargo movement through the port has recently declined, partly due to shifting international tariffs. Despite the slowdown, port officials expressed confidence in the long-term need for growth and infrastructure investment to handle future demand.</p>

          <p>A decade after its release, "The Night We Met" by indie band Lord Huron has achieved massive, unexpected success, surpassing three billion streams on Spotify and outperforming major hits from artists like Beyoncé and Charli XCX in 2024. The song, a wistful ballad from their 2015 album, gained initial traction after being featured in the Netflix series "13 Reasons Why" in 2017. Its popularity has since snowballed through its widespread use on TikTok, where its emotive lyrics have resonated with a vast audience, demonstrating a rare long-tail effect for a track that was not initially a hit.</p>

          <p>The Wimbledon women's final will feature a compelling matchup between five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Swiatek and the resurgent Amanda Anisimova, who is reaching her first major final after a break for mental health. Despite being close in age, the two have never faced each other at the tour level, adding an element of unpredictability. Analysts suggest the outcome will depend on who better manages the pressure of the occasion, with Swiatek's experience giving her an edge, while Anisimova's status as an underdog could allow her to play more freely and aggressively.</p>

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is navigating rising global tensions by championing a foreign policy doctrine of "Australia first," seeking to balance its relationships with both the United States and China. In a recent speech invoking wartime leader John Curtin, Albanese emphasized the need for Australia to act in its own strategic interests, rather than being defined by tradition or external pressures. This recalibration comes as his government continues to support the AUKUS security pact while also engaging in high-level diplomatic visits to Beijing, reflecting a pragmatic approach to the complex geopolitics of the Asia-Pacific region.</p>

          <p>Viraj Dhanda, a 19-year-old with non-speaking autism, has been accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) after years of being perceived as having a severe intellectual disability. His father's persistence led to the discovery that Viraj could communicate by typing with his thumb on an iPad, unlocking his hidden brilliance. In less than three years, he progressed from basic math to calculus, achieved a near-perfect ACT score, and graduated from high school. Viraj hopes his story will serve as a breakthrough for the entire non-speaking autistic community, showing that others may have similar hidden potential.</p>
