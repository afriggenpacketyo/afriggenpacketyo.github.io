          <h2>Elon Musk Expresses Regret Over Critical Posts About President Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Elon Musk stated he regretted some of his recent criticisms of President Trump, following their public disagreement over a spending bill. Musk had previously engaged in a social media feud with Trump, even suggesting the creation of a new political party. Trump had threatened Musk with consequences if he funded Democrats, given Musk's companies' federal contracts. The White House indicated that Trump appreciated Musk's apology, seeking to de-escalate tensions between the president and the technology billionaire. The episode underscores the complex relationship between political figures and influential business leaders, but the situation seems to be calming down.</p>

          <p>Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang addressed AI chip demand, stating that supply shortages are improving and forecasting strong demand for the company's AI infrastructure projects, particularly in Europe. He emphasized that Nvidia's business model is not reliant on AI applications running on devices like phones, as the data center remains crucial for training and verifying AI models. Separately, Capital One CEO Richard Fairbank expressed cautious optimism about the U.S. consumer, noting that spending data has not been significantly affected by macroeconomic uncertainties such as President Trump's tariffs. However, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon warned of a potential economic downturn. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Social Security beneficiaries may see a 2.5% increase in their benefits in 2026, according to estimates from The Senior Citizens League and an independent policy analyst. This adjustment aims to help monthly checks keep pace with inflation, with the official change announced in October based on third-quarter inflation data. The COLA may increase further if President Trump's tariff policies cause inflation and consumer prices to rise. The consumer price index rose less than expected in May, showing limited impact from Trump's tariff policies. The government will likely continue to monitor inflation to see how the COLA will be affected.</p>

          <p>The Women's Tennis Association (WTA) will now protect the rankings of female tennis players who undergo egg or embryo freezing procedures. This policy allows players ranked in the top 750 to take more than 10 weeks away from competition without losing their ranking. Sloane Stephens, a former US Open champion, highlighted that this rule reduces pressure on players to return to the court prematurely. This initiative supports players' family planning decisions and overall well-being, promoting a healthier balance between career and personal life.</p>

The company is following the lead of other cloud providers focused on AI, and it is building its own data centers rather than leasing.

These are strategic reprioritizations with long-term implications, such as infrastructure projects and new social housing.
