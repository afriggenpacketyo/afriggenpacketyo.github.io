          <p>A Macau-based conglomerate, HN Group, is developing a luxury senior housing project in Zhuhai, targeting affluent Hong Kong retirees. The project, Serensia Woods, includes a hotel, residential towers, wellness centers, and a spa, aiming to address the shortage of high-end retirement options in Hong Kong. The development seeks to capitalize on the growing demographic of elderly individuals in Hong Kong, where a significant percentage of seniors prefer living in their own homes but lack professional care options. This initiative reflects a broader trend of cross-border integration within the Greater Bay Area, with a focus on providing specialized services to meet the needs of a specific demographic.

          <p>European startup founders are pushing back against pressure to adopt China's '996' work culture, which involves working from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week. While some VCs argue that overwork is necessary to compete globally, many founders emphasize the importance of sustainable innovation and work-life balance. They contend that Europe's most successful companies have thrived through innovation rather than overwork, and that younger generations prioritize work-life balance. Instead of increasing working hours, founders advocate for more funding and resources to enable startups to compete effectively on the global stage.
