          <p>A former software CEO has completed a five-year, multi-million-pound renovation of Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fortress off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales. The historic property, which was once a hotel known for its parties, had been abandoned for 17 years and lacked basic utilities. After an arduous restoration process, the island now features 40 beds, modern amenities, and a nightclub, and is back on the market for £3 million. The owner hopes its future involves hosting unique events and boosting local tourism.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As UK families face rising food prices, parents are employing creative strategies to feed their children affordably during the six-week summer holidays. Cost-saving tactics include buying reduced "yellow-sticker" items for the freezer, batch cooking, and organizing daily food rations to prevent over-snacking. Many parents rely on local food pantries and council-issued vouchers to supplement their budgets. These measures have become crucial as increased rent, mortgage, and childcare costs offset any recent wage growth for many households.</p>

          <p>Hollywood Forever Cemetery, the final resting place for many classic film stars, has opened a new five-story mausoleum to address the growing demand for burial space in Los Angeles.

The modern structure features marble interiors, natural light, and views of city landmarks, reflecting the cemetery's evolving role as a cultural venue that also hosts festivals and movie nights.

          <p>As they prepared for their GCSE exams, a group of students in the UK opened letters they had written to their future selves as 11-year-olds during a COVID-19 lockdown in 2021. The letters captured their anxieties about the pandemic and their hopes for the future, including personal goals and questions about whether life would return to normal. The exercise served as a poignant reminder of their resilience and aspirations after their secondary education was significantly disrupted by remote learning and social distancing measures. The students reflected on their personal growth since writing the letters.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Guatemala have successfully secured the release of nine prison guards who were held hostage for three days by rioting inmates from the Mara Salvatrucha gang. The riots began in two separate prisons earlier in the week, with gang members demanding the return of 10 leaders who had been transferred to a different facility. This incident is part of a larger pattern of gang-related violence within Guatemala's prison system, where rival gangs like Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha vie for control.</p>

          <p>A new music collection titled "Sunset Boulevard" documents the final creative burst of Elvis Presley, compiling recordings made in Los Angeles between 1972 and 1975. This period includes his last top 10 hit, "Burning Love," and soulful ballads recorded amidst his divorce. According to his friend Jerry Schilling, this era also marked a significant disappointment for Presley when he lost the co-starring role in "A Star Is Born," a setback that Schilling believes contributed to the decline of his career before his death in 1977.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share increasing from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined.
