          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator reported that President Trump's decision to double tariffs on steel and aluminum was not raised during recent talks with U.S. officials in Washington. Ryosei Akazawa, Japan's minister in charge of economic policy, met with U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent amidst Trump's announcement on social media regarding the tariff increase, citing national security concerns. Akazawa stated that the Japanese government would closely monitor the specific details of the measures, and he was instructed to continue negotiating with the highest priority of reaching an agreement. Akazawa also expressed optimism regarding Nippon Steel Corp.'s plan to acquire United States Steel Corp. and mentioned arrangements for a meeting between Prime Minister Ishiba and Trump at the G7 summit.

          <p>A Chinese scientific team has traced the origins of modern Tibetans' "ghost ancestors" to Yunnan province through ancient DNA analysis. The study, published in Science, verifies the hypothesis that an archaeological site in central Yunnan is one of the origins of populations on the Tibetan Plateau. Scientists have determined that around 80% of the genetic composition of Tibetan Plateau populations originates from northern Chinese populations dating back 9,500 to 4,000 years ago. This research fills a critical gap in the genetic data of prehistoric populations in East and Southeast Asia and identifies one of the Tibetan Plateau‚Äôs ‚Äúghost ancestors‚Äù.</p>

Diamondback Energy (FANG) is another pick, with RBC Capital analyst Scott Hanold reaffirming a buy rating due to the company's free cash flow priorities and low-cost structure.

          <p>Germany's National Police Chief, Dieter Romann, has given a favorable initial assessment of the tightened border controls implemented since September 16, 2024. Temporary checks have been reintroduced at all nine of Germany's land borders, with personnel reinforced by almost 1,200 colleagues, bringing the total to 13,000 to 14,000 federal police officers deployed at the borders. Romann dismissed concerns about overburdened personnel and rejected the assumption that personnel would be withdrawn from other operational areas for border controls.

          <p>The article discusses orthorexia, a growing condition characterized by a preoccupation with healthy eating and a fixation on food purity. While not yet an official diagnosis, orthorexia involves extreme food restrictions, social isolation due to food-related anxiety, and excessive analysis of ingredient lists. Breaking food rules can lead to anxiety and guilt, disrupting mental and physical health. The article advises seeking support from dietitians or mental health professionals specializing in disordered eating, focusing on realistic goals, and practicing self-compassion to maintain a balanced approach to nutrition.</p>

          <p>Rev Dr Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back argue that lessons from past poor people's movements are crucial for resisting Donald Trump's policies. They highlight the welfare rights movement of the 1960s and 1970s, particularly the National Welfare Rights Organization (NWRO), as a model for building popular power. The authors emphasize the importance of uniting across differences, assuming strong leadership, building visionary projects of survival, and using these projects as bases for broader organizing. They propose the Johnnie Tillmon model as a strategic framework for transforming growing indignation into lasting power.</p>
