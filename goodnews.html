          <h2>Chinese Scientists Claim to Have Addressed Hyperloop Ride Discomfort</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists working on a full-scale test line have reportedly discovered a solution to reduce turbulence in Hyperloop systems, potentially mitigating the 'extremely unpleasant' ride quality identified in Elon Musk's Hyperloop concept. The study, published in the Journal of Railway Science and Engineering, highlights that minor track imperfections and electromagnetic resonance can cause violent low-frequency vibrations at high speeds. However, the research team, led by Zhao Ming, claims to have found a method to decrease turbulence intensity by nearly half, improving ride comfort using supercomputer simulations and scaled-down prototype tests. The findings could significantly advance the development of vacuum-tube maglev technology and improve passenger experience.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its ninth test flight of the Starship mega-rocket, achieving orbit but ultimately experiencing a 'rapid unscheduled disassembly' during reentry due to a propellant leak and loss of attitude control. The Super Heavy booster also suffered a catastrophic failure upon attempted splashdown. Despite these setbacks, the mission marked the first reuse of a previously flown Super Heavy first stage and demonstrated improvements in ascent performance. The company plans to accelerate the launch cadence for future flights, incorporating data from this test to enhance Starship's reliability for future missions to the moon and Mars.</p>

The 24-year-old is the 75th yokozuna and the first Japanese-born grand champion since his stablemaster Nishonoseki in 2017. Onosato secured his promotion by winning the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament and is the only wrestler to reach yokozuna without a single losing record.

          <p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will no longer recommend routine COVID-19 shots for healthy children or healthy pregnant women, according to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. This decision marks a significant shift from the previous recommendation of annual shots for everyone aged 6 months and older. Kennedy cited a lack of data supporting additional shots for healthy children, while federal health officials did not explain the change regarding pregnant women. Public health experts have expressed concerns, emphasizing the risk of severe disease and hospitalization among infants and the vulnerability of pregnant women to COVID-19 complications.</p>

          <p>Representatives Sydney Kamlager-Dove and Judy Chu have introduced the Fairness, Inclusion, Rehabilitation, and Expungement for Incarcerated Firefighters Act (FIRE Act) to provide job training and opportunities for former inmate firefighters. The act seeks to address the barriers that prevent former inmate firefighters from obtaining employment in fire departments due to their criminal records. If passed, the act would offer incentives for states to establish fire camp programs, expand safety coverage, and provide wage protections for incarcerated firefighters, while also creating a pathway for expunging criminal records for those who successfully complete probation and reentry.</p>

Musk, who previously led the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), believes the bill undermines the work of his team. The legislation, which includes extensions of Trump's 2017 tax cuts and increased border security spending, is projected to increase the deficit by $3.8 trillion by 2034, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Musk stated that a bill can be either big or beautiful, but not necessarily both.</p>
