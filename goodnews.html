          <p>A dual-certified child life specialist and therapist shares six actionable steps parents can take to build trust with their children. These include normalizing discussions about feelings, not avoiding difficult topics, being honest about personal challenges, and modeling behavior rather than interrogating. Making meaningful conversations a part of the daily routine, such as sharing highs and lows at dinner, is also crucial. Teaching coping strategies for managing emotions helps children navigate their feelings effectively. Building trust happens through consistent, small moments of open communication and emotional support. </p>

          <p>The UK's upcoming defence review will signal a strong message to Moscow amid growing concerns about Russian aggression, including daily cyber-attacks on UK military networks. The review will outline plans to deter Russia and other countries like China, committing ¬£1.5 billion to build six new munitions factories to revive Britain's industrial base. This investment will bring UK munitions spending to ¬£6 billion during this parliament, creating 1,800 new jobs. The government plans to establish an "always on" munitions production capacity, procuring long-range weapons like drones and missiles over several years. The review will also recommend a new "cyber and electromagnetic command" to lead defensive and offensive cyber operations. </p>

          <p>A Chinese student's graduation speech at Harvard University, focusing on "shared humanity" and global unity, has gained significant attention. This occurs amid escalating tensions between the U.S. and China, particularly regarding student visas. Yurong ‚ÄúLuanna‚Äù Jiang, the first Chinese woman selected as a student speaker, delivered her address on the same day a federal judge blocked an order seeking to prevent Harvard from enrolling international students. The U.S. State Department recently announced stricter screening and potential revocation of student visas for Chinese nationals with ties to the Chinese Communist Party or studying in critical fields. The speech serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of cross-cultural understanding and collaboration during a period of geopolitical strain. </p>

          <p>Researchers in China have created an infrared contact lens that enables humans to see in the dark by converting infrared light into visible light. The lenses combine conventional soft contact lenses with nanoparticles of gold, sodium gadolinium fluoride, ytterbium, and erbium ions. These upconversion contact lenses (UCLs) convert infrared light with wavelengths between 800 and 1,600 nanometers into visible light. While the resulting images are somewhat blurred, the lenses allow users to recognize patterns, letters, and flashing infrared signals, even with closed eyes. Potential applications include surgical procedures, encryption, and rescue operations in low-visibility conditions. </p>

          <p>Wall Street analysts have largely given Nvidia a pass for a recent quarter that was considered confusing and not typical for the company. While Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.81, below estimates of $0.93, it posted a second adjusted EPS figure of $0.96 after excluding the "H20 charge and related tax impact" due to the fall of its China business. Despite the adjusted figures, some argue that Nvidia does not fully deserve the positive reception it received, as the $0.96 figure represents a reality that does not exist. CEO Jensen Huang mentioned that demand for AI chips remains strong, and CFO Colette Kress stated that profit margins will likely return to historically normal levels later this year (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Japanese universities have received approximately 2.7 billion yen in subsidies for security-related technology since the Defense Ministry's program began in fiscal 2015. This funding supports research amid budget constraints, especially for universities outside Tokyo. The ministry's program has become an important funding source for researchers as operational subsidies to national universities decline. An expert expressed concern about the potential for military applications, emphasizing the need to consider the risks. The subsidy budget has increased over the years, with universities working on projects such as gas-absorbing sheets and AI systems for detecting cyberattacks. </p>
