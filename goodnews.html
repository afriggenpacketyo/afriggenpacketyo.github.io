          <h2>Psychologist Identifies 'Why Can't You Be More Like...' as a Relationship-Damaging Phrase</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 10:22:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a psychologist who studies couples, using the phrase "Why can't you be more like [insert other person's name]?" is highly detrimental to relationships. This phrase, often used during arguments, conveys a message that the partner is inadequate and someone else could do a better job. It can lead to insecurity and questioning of one's worth within the relationship. The psychologist suggests that this phrase is often a symptom of deeper issues, such as a fear of openly communicating needs and frustrations. A better approach involves clearly and directly expressing one's needs without resorting to comparisons.</p>

          <p>The article argues that many media reports depicting a dissatisfied US workforce, using terms like "quiet quitting" and "rage applying," are based on questionable surveys conducted by HR firms and media sites with specific agendas.
