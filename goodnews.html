          <p>The Powerball jackpot's climb to $1.8 billion is providing a substantial boost to DraftKings through its lottery courier app, Jackpocket. The platform has processed 15 million ticket orders during this lottery run, with sales surging as the grand prize grows. This increased activity highlights the value of DraftKings' 2024 acquisition of Jackpocket, which the company uses to cross-sell customers to its sports betting and iGaming services. The company projects the subsidiary will add hundreds of millions in revenue by 2026.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 13:38:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage saw a significant drop to 6.29%, its largest one-day decrease since August 2024. This decline was a direct reaction to a weaker-than-expected August employment report, which has influenced the bond market. For a homebuyer purchasing a $450,000 house, this rate drop could translate to a monthly saving of around $169. However, economists remain uncertain if this decrease is substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as high home prices and economic uncertainty persist. (not investment advice)</p>

This action is part of a broader surge in counter-narcotics efforts in both the Pacific and the Caribbean. The agency released images from the operations, including one of a burning vessel that had been intercepted by authorities.</p>

          <p>A new image from the International Gemini Observatory in Chile reveals the expanding tail of comet 3I/ATLAS, the third-known interstellar object to visit our solar system. The photograph shows that the comet's coma and tail have become significantly more extended, indicating it has grown more active as it approaches the sun. Scientists used the observation to study the comet's spectrum, which provides data on its chemical composition. The rare visitor poses no threat to Earth and offers a unique opportunity to study an object from beyond our solar system.</p>

          <p>An article in The Atlantic reflects on the nature of political dissent, drawing lessons from the recent pro-democracy protests in Georgia. Author Lauren Grodstein observes that many Georgian protesters continue their fight against a pro-Russian government despite believing their efforts may be futile. This mindset is described as a "remarkable ability" to persevere in the face of hopelessness. The essay draws parallels to the current political climate in the United States, suggesting that the fight for democracy is a long-term, perhaps lifelong, commitment.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson is reflecting on her decades-long career in her new memoir, "Eternally Electric: The Message in My Music." She credits her late mother, Diane, for her early success, recalling how she fought for Gibson to write and produce her own music at a time when the industry was dominated by male executives. Gibson, who at 17 became the youngest female artist to write, produce, and perform a Billboard number-one hit, says she is now thriving more than ever. She attributes this to her independent spirit and direct connection with her audience through social media.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Winning the $1.8 billion Powerball jackpot, the second-largest in U.S. history, comes with a significant tax liability. The winner faces two choices: an annuity paid over 30 years or a lump-sum cash option of approximately $826.4 million. Regardless of the choice, the IRS requires a mandatory 24% federal withholding on prizes over $5,000. However, since the winnings push the recipient into the highest federal income tax bracket of 37%, a substantial additional tax payment will be due. State taxes may also apply, further reducing the final take-home amount. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The city of Norwalk, California, has agreed to repeal a local law that banned the development of homeless shelters as part of a settlement to end a state lawsuit. Attorney General Rob Bonta had sued the city, alleging the policy was discriminatory and violated fair housing laws. As part of the agreement, Norwalk will also dedicate $250,000 toward affordable housing and accept increased state monitoring. The settlement resolves a conflict where local leaders claimed the ban was a necessary tactic to get attention for the city's homelessness challenges.</p>

          <p>As the Powerball jackpot reaches $1.8 billion, data analysis shows significant variations in take-home winnings based on state tax laws. States like California and Florida do not tax lottery prizes, allowing winners to keep more of their money, while high-tax states like New York see the lowest payouts after all taxes are applied. The analysis also looked at which numbers have been drawn most and least frequently, although each drawing is a random event. The current jackpot run is the longest in the lottery's history without a grand prize winner.</p>

          <p>Financial experts suggest that a good retirement income is typically 75% to 85% of one's pre-retirement earnings, but the reality for most Americans is far different. The median retirement income is around $47,000 annually, or about $3,900 per month, which may not be sufficient in high-cost-of-living areas. The article explores various strategies to increase retirement income and ensure financial stability. These methods include purchasing annuities for a guaranteed income stream, utilizing reverse mortgages for homeowners, and optimizing Social Security benefits by delaying claims until age 70.

The project features collaborations with artists like Tems and Lil B and was created with many of the same producers from the first "Swag" album. Lyrically, the songs focus on themes of marriage, fatherhood, and religion, reflecting Bieber's current stage in life.</p>

          <p>With global stock markets at all-time highs, financial experts are advising investors to consider strategies to protect their significant portfolio gains. A weak August jobs report has increased expectations for a Federal Reserve rate cut, but it also signals potential economic trouble ahead. Analysts suggest that now is a good time to rebalance portfolios that may be over-concentrated in mega-cap tech stocks. Shifting some capital into more defensive sectors and value stocks could help insulate returns from a potential market downturn later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Mortgage interest rates have continued their downward trend, with the average rate on a 30-year term falling to 6.50%, its lowest point since October 2024. This decline is largely driven by market anticipation of an imminent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve at its upcoming meeting. Lenders often lower their rates preemptively in response to expected Fed actions and cooling Treasury yields. For prospective homebuyers, this encouraging development presents an opportunity, though experts advise them to act strategically by getting pre-approved and checking their credit reports now.
