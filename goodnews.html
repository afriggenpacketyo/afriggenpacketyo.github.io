          <p>Broadcom's stock value increased by over 9% after the company announced a new $10 billion order for custom artificial intelligence chips. While the customer was not officially named, multiple financial analysts believe it to be the AI startup OpenAI, based on previous reports and the scale of the deal. This significant order has prompted Broadcom to raise its AI revenue forecast for the upcoming year, when shipments are set to begin. The news underscores the company's growing prominence alongside Nvidia in the competitive AI hardware market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-05 15:25:49 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage fell significantly following the release of a weaker-than-expected August jobs report, marking the largest one-day drop in over a year. The rate decreased to 6.29%, offering potential relief to homebuyers facing high housing prices. This drop could save a buyer of a median-priced home over $150 per month on their mortgage payment. However, economists remain uncertain whether this decrease will be substantial enough to reinvigorate the housing market, as mortgage demand has remained sluggish. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following the departure of Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has initiated a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle to recast his government. Instead of a simple replacement, Starmer has appointed new individuals to major offices, including a new home secretary and a new foreign secretary. This move is seen as an attempt by the prime minister to reassert authority and re-energize his administration after a difficult first year in office. The reshuffle aims to create a new team focused on delivering results ahead of future political battles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Department of Transportation has officially dropped a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. The rule, introduced under the previous administration, was never enacted and faced strong opposition from airlines, who argued it would increase ticket prices. A DOT spokesperson stated the department will reconsider requirements that go beyond what Congress has mandated, while still enforcing existing refund laws. Airline industry groups praised the decision to scrap what they considered an overly burdensome regulation.</p>

          <p>An employment tribunal judge in the UK has ruled that spending less than an hour of work time on personal online browsing is not a sufficient reason for dismissal. The ruling awarded over £14,000 to an accountancy administrator who was fired after her employer used spyware to track her personal computer usage. The judge noted that the time spent was not excessive, the company had no clear policy against it, and the owner herself used her computer for personal reasons. The judge concluded the dismissal was likely motivated by other factors.</p>

          <p>A multi-year, $143.7-million repaving project is set to begin on a 10.2-mile stretch of the 405 Freeway in Los Angeles, causing significant partial closures on upcoming weekends. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) will reduce the freeway to three lanes in each direction through the Sepulveda Pass. The project, which will restore 92 miles of lanes and upgrade guardrails and signage, is expected to require up to 25 weekend closures before its completion in late 2028 or early 2029. Motorists are being strongly advised to seek alternative routes.</p>
