          <p>Actress Reese Witherspoon has co-authored her first adult fiction thriller, "Gone Before Goodbye," focusing on a skilled female surgeon as the protagonist. She explains her motivation was to create a character whose value comes from her unique skills rather than her sex appeal, contrasting it with the bikini-clad women in James Bond films she watched growing up. Witherspoon, who has championed female-led stories through her production company Hello Sunshine, collaborated with author Harlan Coben on the novel.</p>

          <p>Rupert Lowe, a former Reform UK Member of Parliament, has been given a seat on the UK's powerful Public Accounts Committee by the Conservative Party. Lowe, who was expelled from Reform UK after a dispute with its leadership, will occupy one of the three seats reserved for the Tories on the committee that scrutinizes government spending. The Conservative Party justified the appointment by stating Lowe "shares our values on cutting waste," while a Labour source criticized the move, citing a lack of fiscal credibility.</p>

          <p>California State Senator Scott Wiener, a prominent Democrat known for his pro-housing legislation and LGBTQ+ advocacy, reportedly plans to run for the congressional seat currently held by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. While Wiener had previously indicated he would wait for the 85-year-old Pelosi to retire, the entry of a progressive challenger into the race appears to have accelerated his timeline. If elected, Wiener would become the first openly gay person to represent San Francisco in the U.S. Congress.</p>

          <h2>Making Payments May Not Protect Debtors from Legal Action by Collectors</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-17 12:28:40 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explains that making payments on a delinquent debt does not automatically prevent a debt collector from filing a lawsuit. Unless a formal written agreement explicitly states otherwise, collectors generally retain the right to sue to secure a legal judgment, which grants them stronger collection tools like wage garnishment. To protect themselves, individuals with debt are advised to get any payment plan terms in writing, explore lump-sum settlements, and understand their rights under state and federal consumer protection laws.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cultural shift is underway in the bodybuilding community, with many enthusiasts moving away from "dirty bulking"—consuming massive amounts of processed, high-calorie foods—to "lean bulking." This newer approach involves a more moderate caloric surplus from healthy food sources to build muscle more sustainably and with less fat gain. The trend reflects a broader societal embrace of wellness, minimally processed foods, and a desire to maintain a chiseled physique year-round, though experts caution it can still lead to extreme dieting and body image disorders.</p>

The CNBC Investing Club has stated its intention to hold shares in both entities following the spinoff. (not investment advice)</p>

The memoir also touches upon the 2012 stroke that has since limited his physical mobility.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has removed the travel restrictions on Mahmoud Khalil, a Palestinian activist and former Columbia University graduate student, allowing him to speak at events across the country. Khalil was arrested by ICE in March amid a Trump administration crackdown on pro-Palestinian campus activism and is currently fighting a deportation order. His lawyers argued that the travel was necessary for First Amendment reasons, and the judge agreed, noting Khalil is not a flight risk and has complied with all release conditions.</p>

          <p>The data center capacity around Milan, Italy's financial hub, is projected to grow tenfold over the next five years, adding approximately two gigawatts of power consumption. This rapid expansion, driven by the demands of artificial intelligence, presents a significant revenue opportunity for local utilities like A2A, which will supply the necessary electricity. To meet this surge in demand without straining the local grid, new facilities will connect to the high-voltage grid, and authorities are supporting an increase in both renewable and thermal power generation.</p>

          <p>In his updated book, "Just Visiting This Planet," astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson uses an alien character named Merlin to explore a range of scientific questions. He comments that while AI can provide factual answers, it lacks the soul and personality needed for more imaginative inquiries. Tyson remains skeptical that aliens have visited Earth, noting the lack of high-resolution evidence in an age of ubiquitous cameras, and he also debunks popular science fiction tropes, like Superman reversing time by spinning the Earth backward.</p>
