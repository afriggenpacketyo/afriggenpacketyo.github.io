          <p>According to marketer and music executive Steve Stoute, conflict and disagreement are crucial for a business's success. Stoute, who has worked with Jay-Z and Google, believes that a business with "no conflict" has "something wrong." He encourages healthy conflict within teams by emphasizing the importance of respectful challenge. Experts support Stoute's view, suggesting that embracing and navigating conflicts is better than avoiding them. The key is to approach disagreements as conversations rather than opportunities to score points.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has rejected an appeal from gun rights advocates, allowing Maryland's ban on assault-style rifles and high-capacity magazines to remain in effect. Justices Alito, Gorsuch, and Thomas dissented, arguing that the Court should address the issue nationwide. Justice Kavanaugh agreed with letting the law stand for now but expects the high court to weigh in formally on the legality of the AR-15 in the near future. Maryland has seen a decline in gun violence since enacting laws aimed at curbing access to dangerous weapons.</p>
