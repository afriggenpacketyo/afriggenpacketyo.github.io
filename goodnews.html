        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, the devastation to pets left behind spurred a national change in disaster preparedness, leading to the 2006 Pet Evacuation & Transportation Safety (PETS) Act. This landmark law incentivizes states and agencies to include animals in evacuation plans, recognizing that many people refused to evacuate without their pets, contributing to human fatalities. Animal rescue organizations, overwhelmed by the scale of animal suffering post-Katrina, now strongly emphasize the critical message for owners to take their pets during any disaster evacuation. While significant progress has been made, challenges remain in ensuring comprehensive pet preparedness nationwide.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ojai's oldest hotel, now named Hotel El Roblar, has reopened after years of extensive restoration, aiming to evoke Old California and attract visitors from Los Angeles. Built in 1919, the property features 39 guest rooms, 11 bungalows, and two restaurants, with nightly rates starting at $455. The new owners, including entrepreneur Eric Goode, prioritized historical authenticity while incorporating unique elements like a wrap-around mural and Aldabra giant tortoises. This significant reopening for Ojai, a town with limited lodging, has sparked local debates over parking and the delicate balance between promoting tourism and preserving the community's distinctive small-town character.</p>

          <p>Christian Svanes Kolding and Adriana Estrada transformed their Long Beach home's water-hungry Bermuda lawn into an ocean-friendly habitat garden, inspired by their runs in local hills. After years in New York City apartments, the couple prioritized a water-saving landscape that captures rainwater and features native California plants, creating a vibrant, fragrant space. The project, partially funded by a rebate program, includes bioswales and permeable pathways, effectively stopping runoff and fostering local wildlife. This personal endeavor also aimed to connect with neighbors, embodying a vision of their home as a welcoming "Casa Hiatus" and a model for sustainable urban living.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Helen Oyeyemi's eighth novel, "A New New Me," offers a whimsical yet profound exploration of identity and narrative through the lens of Kinga, a Polish woman with seven distinct selves, each governing a day of the week. The story begins as Kinga-A discovers a tied-up man in her pantry, initiating an internal mystery about his presence. The article notes that while the novel touches on dissociative identity disorder, it primarily delves into the chaotic nature of storytelling and how individuals construct and communicate their realities.

          <h2>Addressing America's Housing Shortage Requires More Than Just Land-Use Reform</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-26 06:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>America faces a critical housing shortage of 4.7 million units, driven by restrictive zoning laws and a significant slowdown in construction since 2008. While "YIMBY" advocates rightly push for relaxing land-use regulations, this article argues that a comprehensive solution also requires addressing other fundamental constraints. These include the high cost and limited availability of construction financing post-2008, a persistent shortage of skilled labor, and surging material costs due to sawmill closures and tariffs. The article suggests a multi-faceted approach involving government financing, new loan programs, tax incentives, expanded vocational training, and increased productivity through modular construction to truly achieve housing abundance.

          <p>Transport for London (TfL) is launching a campaign to urge mobile users to wear headphones on buses and Tubes, addressing the "nuisance" of loud music and calls played on loudspeakers. TfL research indicates that 70% of passengers find such behavior disruptive and stressful, particularly for those with heightened sensitivities. Existing TfL by-laws prohibit loud content, allowing enforcement officers to intervene, potentially asking individuals to stop or even remove them from services. The campaign, starting on the Elizabeth line and expanding in autumn, aims to improve the overall travel experience and foster a more respectful public transport environment for all commuters.</p>

          <p>A Chinese woman, identified only as Zhou, was dramatically rescued after being trapped for 30 hours in a locked guesthouse room in Sichuan province. Realizing the door's malfunction and without her phone, she ingeniously bit her finger and used her own blood to scrawl "110 625" (China's emergency number and her room number) on a pillow. She then flung the desperate plea from the sixth-floor window, where it was spotted by a food delivery driver, Zhang Kun. Zhang immediately alerted police, who successfully kicked open the door to free the dishevelled woman. Zhang was subsequently awarded 3,000 yuan for his quick thinking.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Fernand is expected to continue weakening over the central Atlantic Ocean, posing no threat to land, according to the National Hurricane Center. Located approximately 635 miles east-northeast of Bermuda, Fernand currently has maximum sustained winds of 45 mph and is moving northeast. Forecasters anticipate it will transition into a post-tropical cyclone and fully dissipate by Thursday. Fernand marks the sixth named storm of the 2025 Atlantic hurricane season, following Hurricane Erin, which also formed in a similar area and reached Category 5 strength but did not make landfall, reassuring coastal communities.</p>

          <p>Twenty years after Hurricane Katrina, a student ID lost in the devastating storm was miraculously returned to Catherine Hamel, its original owner, by a wildlife biologist on Horn Island, Mississippi. Ranger Becky Copeland found the 1969-1970 ID, which later became legible, and traced Hamel through social media. Hamel, who lost nearly all her possessions and mementos in the storm, expressed profound shock and joy at the discovery, believing the ID had floated from a metal box in her home to the island. This unique find offers a poignant moment of connection to a devastating past, bringing a small piece of her history back.</p>
