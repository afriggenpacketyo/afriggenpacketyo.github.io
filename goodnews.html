          <h2>Supreme Court Ruling Favors Trump on Agency Head Firings, Addresses Federal Reserve Independence</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 17:40:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, granted President Trump a stay on a lower court order, allowing him to remove heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board without cause, a move previously deemed illegal. The conservative majority argued that the president's executive power allows him to remove officers exercising executive power, while the dissenting justices emphasized the importance of congressional will and precedent. The ruling also addressed concerns regarding the Federal Reserve, asserting that the case does not necessarily implicate the constitutionality of for-cause removal protections for Federal Reserve board members, as the Federal Reserve is structured uniquely as a quasi-private entity. The decision has been closely watched due to its implications for the president's control over independent agencies.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Supreme Court's recent decision, while allowing President Trump to remove members of other federal agencies' boards, implies that Federal Reserve board members have greater protection against presidential firings. The court stated that challenges to terminations did not necessarily implicate the Federal Reserve due to its unique, quasi-private structure, suggesting any presidential attempt to fire a Federal Reserve board member would likely face strong legal resistance. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell previously stated that the president lacks the power to fire him. This ruling provides insight into the judiciary's view on the Federal Reserve's independence, amid ongoing scrutiny of the relationship between the executive branch and the central bank.</p>

          <p>The newly appointed head of the Social Security Administration, Frank Bisignano, told agency staff that he had to Google the job after being offered the position by the Trump administration. Bisignano, a former Wall Street executive, acknowledged his lack of familiarity with the agency during a town hall meeting, seeking to reassure staff amid concerns about leadership turnover and potential budget cuts. He emphasized that Social Security is "not going away" and aims to modernize the agency's operations, comparing it to tech giants like Amazon. His appointment has faced criticism from Democrats and activists, who worry about the future of the Social Security program under his leadership.</p>

          <p>Gas prices are projected to average $3.08 per gallon for the Memorial Day weekend, marking the lowest level since 2021, with prices potentially dipping below $3 a gallon later in the summer. This decrease is attributed to uncertainty over the Trump administration's economic policies and increased oil production by OPEC+ countries. While gas prices are down, other vacation-related expenses, such as entertainment and dining out, have increased. The states with the lowest average gas prices are primarily in the South, while California and Hawaii have the highest prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have developed blood and urine tests that can detect the amount of ultraprocessed foods a person consumes. The tests use machine learning to identify metabolites correlated with processed food intake, creating a "biomarker score" to predict consumption levels. The findings, published in PLOS Medicine, aim to reduce errors associated with self-reported dietary questionnaires. Researchers hope the method can be used in future studies to link processed food consumption with chronic diseases. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>David Brooks critiques the populist narrative promoted by figures like Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders, which idealizes a bygone era of American manufacturing and blames globalization for economic decline. Brooks argues that this narrative is historically inaccurate, pointing out that the supposed era of pure globalization never existed and that median wages have grown since NAFTA and the WTO. He contends that manufacturing job losses are primarily due to increased productivity and technological advancements, not neoliberalism or globalization. Brooks concludes that the forces driving populism are more about cultural values, immigration, and social distrust than economic decline.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that GLP-1 agonists, commonly known as weight loss drugs, may modestly reduce the risk of obesity-related cancers, particularly colorectal cancer. The observational study compared the effects of GLP-1 drugs, like Ozempic and Wegovy, to dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitors in adults with obesity and diabetes. Researchers found that patients taking GLP-1 receptor agonists had a 7% lower risk of developing an obesity-related cancer and an 8% lower risk of death from any cause. The authors hope to continue their research with larger populations and those without diabetes.</p>
