        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In response to the catastrophic floods in south central Texas that have claimed numerous lives, NASA has dispatched two specialized aircraft to aid in search and recovery operations. A high-altitude WB-57 aircraft is conducting aerial surveys with a high-resolution imaging sensor to map the affected Guadalupe River area, which has been obscured by cloud cover. Additionally, an aircraft equipped with synthetic aperture radar, which can detect water through vegetation, is collecting data to assess the extent of the flooding. This data will help emergency management teams allocate resources and accelerate response times.</p>

          <p>Paris Saint-Germain secured a decisive 4-0 victory over Real Madrid in the Club World Cup semi-final at MetLife Stadium. PSG dominated the match from the beginning, scoring three goals within the first 30 minutes, with two from Fabián Ruiz and one from Ousmane Dembélé. Real Madrid, featuring their former star Kylian Mbappé, was unable to mount a competitive response to PSG's relentless pressure and fluid play. A late goal by Gonçalo Ramos sealed the comprehensive win, showcasing the French club's formidable strength under manager Luis Enrique.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined a request from Florida officials to lift a lower court's block on a controversial state immigration law. The law, known as SB 4-C, would have made it a state felony for certain undocumented immigrants to enter Florida. A federal judge had previously ruled that the law likely overstepped state authority by encroaching on the federal government's exclusive power to regulate immigration. The Supreme Court's decision keeps the injunction in place, preventing Florida from enforcing the law while the legal challenge proceeds in the lower courts.</p>

          <p>Amazon's cloud division, AWS, has announced the development of its own proprietary hardware designed to cool the next generation of power-hungry Nvidia GPUs used for AI. Faced with the immense energy and cooling demands of these chips, Amazon engineered a solution called the In-Row Heat Exchanger (IRHX) that can be integrated into existing data centers. This innovation allows AWS to support large-scale AI workloads without the lengthy process of building new liquid-cooled facilities. The new systems are now available to customers, enabling access to Nvidia's latest high-density computing platforms.</p>

Bitcoin is often treated as a risk asset that moves in tandem with growth-oriented stocks during periods of high investor confidence. Analysts suggest that increased corporate buying and potential crypto legislation in the U.S. could continue to fuel bullish sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic humorously offers advice on how to identify an AI-powered impostor of Senator Marco Rubio, playing on a real report of an unknown individual using AI-cloned voices to contact government officials. The piece lists several comical "signs" that a caller is not the real Senator, such as not aggressively drinking bottled water and expressing support for due-process rights. The satire uses this premise to critique the Senator's political stances and actions, including the decision to end USAID. It serves as a commentary on both the public figure and the emerging threat of AI-driven disinformation.</p>
