          <p>Afghanistan and Pakistan have agreed to upgrade their diplomatic ties by appointing ambassadors in each other's capitals, signaling a potential thaw in their strained relationship. This decision follows a trilateral meeting in Beijing, where Chinese officials expressed willingness to assist in improving relations between the two nations. Relations have been tense due to Pakistan's accusations that Afghanistan harbors the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and Pakistan's deportation of Afghan refugees. The move aims to enhance bilateral cooperation across various domains, though no country has officially recognized the Taliban administration since they took control in 2021. The improved relations may help in regional stability and cooperation, as well as economic growth.</p>

          <p>A rare gold lobster, named Calvin, was saved from being cooked at a restaurant in Rhode Island after a cook recognized its unique genetic mutation. This mutation, occurring in approximately one in 30 million lobsters, results in a yellowish-orange shell. The restaurant donated Calvin to the Biomes Marine Biology Center, where he is now on display. Experts highlight that gold lobsters are often mistaken for more common orange ones, and boiling would have turned it red like any other cooked lobster. The lobster's rescue highlights both the rarity of the mutation and the importance of conservation efforts.</p>

          <p>Denmark's decision to raise its retirement age to 70 has prompted discussion among experts about whether the U.S. might follow suit. While some Republicans have proposed raising the U.S. retirement age to address Social Security's looming depletion dates, experts caution that such a move could disproportionately harm lower-income individuals with shorter life expectancies. Denmark's more equal society makes raising the retirement age a more viable solution compared to the U.S. The article explores the potential benefits and drawbacks of raising the retirement age in the U.S.</p>

          <p>The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is reviewing hundreds of parole hearings to determine if inmates were wrongly denied parole due to faulty drug tests. Nearly 6,000 drug tests in California prisons are believed to have yielded false positives between April and July last year. Inmates denied parole because of the faulty tests may be entitled to a new hearing before the parole board. The review will determine if there is sufficient evidence to support an incarcerated person‚Äôs denial of parole without the positive drug screening. This situation raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of drug testing in the prison system.</p>
