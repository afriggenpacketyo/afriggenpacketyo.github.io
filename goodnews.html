          <h2>Study Suggests China's Upstream Dams in Tibet May Increase India's Dry-Season Water Flow</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-13 00:00:09 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study offers preliminary evidence that could ease concerns in India about China's planned mega-dam in Tibet creating a water crisis. By analyzing data from two existing large dams, Zangmu and Jiacha, researchers found that downstream water flows to India actually increased during the dry season. The data, measured since 2014, showed low flows were up by over 50% in February. Contrary to fears of drought, the study indicates that these upstream dams have so far resulted in more, not less, water for India during its driest periods.</p>

          <p>Iga Swiatek secured her first Wimbledon championship with a decisive 6-0, 6-0 victory over American Amanda Anisimova in a match lasting just 57 minutes. This marked the first time in 114 years that a player failed to win a single game in the Wimbledon women's final. For the 24-year-old from Poland, this is her sixth Grand Slam title, extending her perfect record in major finals to 6-0. The match was a first-time Grand Slam final for Anisimova, who had made a remarkable comeback to the tour after taking a break for mental health reasons in 2023.</p>

          <p>Drake countered recent negative publicity by headlining three nights at London's Wireless festival, featuring a host of high-profile surprise guests. His performances, which drew over 150,000 people, included appearances by Lauryn Hill, Dave, Central Cee, and J Hus, demonstrating his continued influence and strong industry connections. The rapper structured each night around a different era of his music, from R&B to UK rap, creating a series of viral moments. The enthusiastic reception from the massive crowds and the support from fellow artists served to dispel social media narratives that his cultural relevance was fading after a public feud with Kendrick Lamar.</p>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China's space economy is poised for massive growth, with private investment expected to skyrocket and reach an estimated US$1.8 trillion by 2035. The piece highlights the success of private Chinese aerospace companies like i-Space and LandSpace, which have achieved significant milestones such as putting rockets into orbit. This boom is driven by technological advancements, reduced costs, and strong state support for the private sector. The author suggests this burgeoning industry presents a significant opportunity for Hong Kong to play a crucial role in China's ambitious leap into the commercial space sector.

          <p>China is strategically cultivating "future industries" to drive a new growth model based on technological innovation and industrial upgrading. First mentioned by President Xi Jinping in 2020, this concept refers to emerging sectors with immense potential, such as humanoid robots, 6G networks, brain-computer interfaces, and next-generation aircraft. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) has released guidelines to target development in these areas. This focus on cutting-edge technology is a core part of China's strategy to gain a competitive edge in the global technology race and shift its economy toward high-value sectors.</p>

          <p>Start-ups like Better Dairy in the UK are developing lab-grown cheese using precision fermentation, a process where genetically modified yeast produces milk proteins like casein. This technology aims to create cheese that mimics the taste and texture of the real thing without involving animals. While proponents tout health benefits like no cholesterol and lower saturated fats, the industry faces significant hurdles, including high production costs and consumer skepticism about ultra-processed foods. Despite a recent decline in plant-based cheese sales, companies are targeting a "silent revolution," hoping to first replace cheese in products like frozen pizzas before reaching supermarket shelves.</p>

          <p>Jess Basey-Fisher, a 53-year-old nurse from Norfolk, successfully found the older brother she never knew she had after learning of his existence six years ago.

After a determined search, Jess connected with her brother, Alistair Dalgliesh, in Australia, only to learn shortly after that he had been diagnosed with stage four lung cancer. She flew to Australia to support him through chemotherapy, allowing the siblings to forge a bond and make precious memories after decades of being apart.</p>

          <p>After several years of declining viewership, the UK reality show Love Island is experiencing a resurgence, driven largely by its massive engagement on social media, particularly TikTok. While TV ratings have improved, the show's official accounts have gained 1.8 million followers in 2025, with TikTok clips often garnering more views than entire broadcast episodes. Content creators and fans note that short-form recaps and commentary make it easier to keep up with the daily drama and participate in the online discourse. This shift in consumption habits suggests that social media has become essential for the show's survival and ability to attract new, younger audiences.</p>

          <p>With the price of package holidays rising, families are using creative strategies to reduce the cost of their summer vacations. One couple saved thousands on a honeymoon to Mexico by booking just two days before departure, finding it cheaper than a trip to Europe. Another family saved over £3,000 on a trip to Spain by traveling off-peak and using a "free child place" filter on travel websites. Other money-saving hacks include using home-swapping websites to get free accommodation, collecting credit card points for flights, and house-sitting to enjoy a holiday with minimal lodging costs.</p>

          <p>A federal judge in California has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration, ordering officials to stop "indiscriminately" arresting people suspected of being in the U.S. illegally. The order, from U.S. District Judge Maame Frimpong, also bars officials from denying individuals access to legal counsel. The ruling stems from a lawsuit filed after several individuals, including U.S. citizens, were arrested at a bus stop. The judge found a "mountain of evidence" that officials were conducting roving patrols and making arrests based solely on factors like race or speaking Spanish, in violation of the Constitution.</p>
