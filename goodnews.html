          <p>A U.S. federal appeals court has maintained an injunction against a Trump administration policy that restricts passport gender markers to biological sex at birth. The policy, a reversal of the previous administration's allowance for an "X" gender marker, was challenged by the ACLU for being discriminatory. The court found the government failed to justify its appeal, noting the policy likely stems from unconstitutional prejudice against transgender Americans and causes irreparable harm to those affected.</p>

          <p>Authorities in China's Hunan province are considering a novel application for the country's central bank digital currency, the e-CNY, to resolve persistent payment defaults. The plan involves using the digital yuan to create a more transparent and traceable system for clearing "chain debts," where funds can be directed to the final recipient in a payment chain. Analysts suggest this could enhance real-time visibility and control over transactions within the economy, expanding the currency's use beyond its initial retail applications.

          <p>The London City Lionesses, newly promoted to the Women's Super League, have agreed to a world-record £1.4 million deal to sign midfielder Grace Geyoro from Paris St-Germain. This landmark signing is part of an ambitious summer transfer window funded by the club's American owner, Michele Kang, which has seen 16 permanent signings. The move for the 28-year-old French international demonstrates the club's intent to disrupt the established order of the WSL and compete at the highest level.</p>

          <p>While a third of American adults now have at least one tattoo, indicating a significant shift towards mainstream acceptance, some social stigma persists. Research shows that people with tattoos may still face negative assumptions in professional settings. The prevalence is highest among millennials, with over 40% having a tattoo, and is consistent across political affiliations. Art institutions are beginning to recognize the medium, with exhibits like one at the Flint Institute of Arts showcasing the work of tattoo artists.</p>
