        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves' decision to reinstate the winter fuel payment for over three-quarters of pensioners in England and Wales, specifically those with an annual income of ¬£35,000 or less, has elicited varied reactions. Bob Pritchard, a 78-year-old from Bath, expressed relief at having his allowance reinstated, citing financial strain due to health issues and taxi costs. Alice George, a 71-year-old from Watford, voiced disapproval, stating she donates her payment to charity and believes the funds could be better allocated to the NHS or housing. Gail Impey, a 71-year-old finance manager, lamented missing out on the payment due to her income slightly exceeding the threshold, highlighting her struggles after her husband's death and the need to work to make ends meet. The diverse responses underscore the complex financial realities faced by pensioners and the varying perspectives on government support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge dismissed Justin Baldoni's $400 million lawsuit against Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and Lively's publicist, Leslie Sloane. Baldoni had accused the trio of civil extortion and defamation following Lively's accusations of sexual harassment and retaliation, which Baldoni denies. The lawsuit against The New York Times, which initially reported Lively's complaint, was also dismissed. Baldoni and his production company, Wayfarer Studios, have the option to amend some of the claims by June 23, according to the court ruling. Lawyers for Lively hailed the decision as a complete vindication.</p>
