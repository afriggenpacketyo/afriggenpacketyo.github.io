        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Lionesses experienced a mixed week as they prepare for Euro 2025, dealing with Mary Earps' international retirement and Millie Bright's withdrawal. England responded emphatically to the distractions by thrashing Portugal, showcasing their attacking depth. However, they ended the week with a 2-1 loss to Spain in the Nations League, but England's coach views the defeat as a valuable learning opportunity. The coach will be naming her Euro squad on Thursday.</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom has been exempted from President Donald Trump's executive order, which doubles steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50% for most countries. While the UK will not face the increased tariffs, the existing 25% levy remains in place until a UK-US tariff pact signed in May comes into effect, which will eliminate all import taxes on steel and aluminum. A UK government spokesperson stated the commitment to protecting British business and jobs across key sectors. The Conservatives, however, described the order as a "fresh tariff blow."</p>

          <p>A US judge ruled that the Bureau of Prisons must continue providing gender-affirming care to transgender inmates, despite an executive order signed by Donald Trump to halt funding for such care. The ruling allows a class-action lawsuit by over 2,000 transgender inmates to proceed. The judge ordered the Bureau of Prisons to provide hormone therapy and accommodations, but not surgical care. The American Civil Liberties Union praised the ruling as a reminder that transgender people have constitutional rights. The Justice Department had argued the judge should defer to the policy decision of the president, but the judge stated that democracy requires respect for duly enacted laws.</p>
