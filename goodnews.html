The revised text would also reduce itemized deductions for certain taxpayers in the 37% income tax bracket, which could lower the benefit of the higher SALT cap. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>U.S. Treasury to Halt Production of Pennies</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Treasury is set to stop producing pennies, citing rising production costs and President Trump's desire to reduce unnecessary spending. The move is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually. The last of the new pennies will enter circulation early next year, eventually leading to businesses rounding prices to the nearest nickel. The Treasury Department estimates that producing each penny costs 3.69 cents, making the production of the coin fiscally unsound. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Treasury to Discontinue Minting Pennies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 11:51:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue minting pennies, citing the high cost of production. Each penny costs nearly four cents to produce, resulting in an estimated savings of $56 million per year. Pennies will remain legal tender, but the phase-out may require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel. The move is expected to have a minimal impact on consumers, as non-cash payments become increasingly common. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Net Migration to UK Halved in 2024, Driven by Reduced Work Visas and Student Numbers</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-22 11:41:32 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Net migration to the UK nearly halved in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The decrease was attributed to declining numbers of people coming to work and study, as well as a drop in dependents accompanying visa holders. The government highlighted a reduction in asylum seekers housed in hotels and increased returns of failed asylum seekers. The figures are being debated among political parties, with each claiming credit for the changes.</p>

          <p>A homeowner in Norway awoke to find a 440-foot container ship had run aground just meters from his house. The ship, NCL Salten, ran ashore for an unknown reason, causing damage to a heating pipe in the homeowner's cabin. The homeowner, who slept through the incident, was alerted by a neighbor who had repeatedly tried to ring his doorbell. None of the 16 crew members were injured, and the cause of the incident is under investigation.</p>
