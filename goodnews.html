          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland aims to open a clinic by the end of the year offering ketamine as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for patients with severe, treatment-resistant depression. This initiative follows the opening of a private clinic in Lanarkshire that provides ketamine-assisted therapy, which costs ¬£6,000 for four infusions and psychotherapy. While ketamine is not officially licensed for depression treatment, it can be used 'off-label' by doctors; however, the Royal College of Psychiatrists has urged caution regarding its use. Professor Andrew McIntosh believes ketamine could offer additional hope to patients who have not responded well to traditional treatments, suggesting it may enhance brain plasticity or alter brain connections, but the exact mechanism remains unclear.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. military's recent engagement in the conflict between Israel and Iran, global markets have largely remained stable, with the MSCI World index experiencing only a slight decline. Strategists suggest that the market views the attack on Iran as a relief, with minimal risks of the conflict spreading regionally, though the gravity of the situation is not dismissed. Safe-haven assets like the Japanese yen weakened, while gold prices saw a minor dip; the dollar index rose slightly. Investors are closely monitoring potential countermeasures from Iran following the U.S. strikes on its nuclear facilities; however, so far the markets have brushed off the escalation.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government has signaled some support for the U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, viewing them as a demonstration of Washington's determination to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya stated that de-escalating the situation regarding Iran's nuclear activities is of utmost importance. While traditionally maintaining amicable ties with Iran, Japan acknowledges the U.S. has been actively pursuing dialogue on the Iranian nuclear issue amid challenging circumstances. Japan continues to express its strong hope for the resumption of dialogue between the United States and Iran, pledging diplomatic efforts in cooperation with the international community to promote peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>

          <p>At the upcoming NATO summit in The Hague, member states are expected to set ambitious defense spending goals, potentially requiring Germany to allocate 5% of its GDP to defense by 2032. This significant increase would place heavy demands on the Bundeswehr, necessitating additional troops and advanced military capabilities amid ongoing tensions with Russia. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz supports these measures, some within his coalition government express skepticism, citing concerns about the economic impact and questioning the security policy justification. Experts emphasize that increased investment in the armed forces is crucial for Germany's national security, particularly in light of potential reductions in the US military presence in Europe.</p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency has reported observing over 180 earthquakes near the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan over the weekend, urging residents to remain vigilant for a strong tremor. A quake measuring 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale of 7 occurred twice on Sunday and once early Monday on Akuseki Island in the island chain in Kagoshima Prefecture.

          <p>U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has urged China to persuade Iran not to close the Strait of Hormuz, a crucial global shipping route. This appeal comes after Iranian state media reported parliament's approval of a plan to close the Strait, though the final decision rests with the Supreme National Security Council. Any disruption to the Strait could severely impact the global economy, particularly China, which is the largest buyer of Iranian oil. Rubio emphasized that closing the Strait would be "economic suicide" for Iran and urged other countries to consider the broader economic consequences.</p>

          <p>New York City is implementing ranked choice voting in its upcoming Democratic mayoral primary election, a system where voters rank multiple candidates in order of preference. This system aims to ensure that even if a voter's top choice doesn't win, their other rankings still contribute to the final outcome. If no candidate secures a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices, continuing until a winner emerges. While this system can lead to broader support for the elected candidate, it also presents challenges in terms of transparency and predictability, potentially leading to questions about the accuracy of the results.</p>

          <p>Dr. Fred Pestello, the president of Saint Louis University (SLU), is preparing to step down at the end of the month after a decade of leadership marked by significant growth in student numbers and research activity. Pestello, who is not a Jesuit priest, emphasized the university's mission-focused, student-centered, and research-driven vision. During his tenure, SLU achieved R1 classification, the highest designation for a research institution. Pestello will take a sabbatical before returning to SLU as a professor, and will be replaced by Edward Feser on July 1.</p>
