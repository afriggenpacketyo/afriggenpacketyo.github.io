          <p>Elon Musk has announced plans to significantly decrease his political donations after spending over $250 million supporting Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Musk indicated that he feels he has "done enough" and does not currently see a reason to continue spending at the same scale, despite his previous high-profile involvement in political initiatives. This decision follows a political setback earlier in the year when a candidate he backed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court was defeated. Musk also reaffirmed his commitment to leading Tesla for the next five years amidst concerns about his focus on political endeavors affecting the company's performance.</p>

          <p>Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government has secured trade deals with the European Union and the United States, showcasing Britain's ability to engage with both major trade partners post-Brexit. However, these agreements required politically challenging concessions, highlighting Britain's diminished position in the global trade arena. While the deals offer benefits such as reduced tariffs on British luxury cars and easier access for travelers, they also involve trade-offs like allowing European trawlers to fish in British waters. The article suggests that Britain is operating in a constrained environment, squeezed between powerful trading blocs like the U.S. and the E.U.</p>

          <p>President Trump cautioned House Republicans against making changes to Medicaid during a closed-door meeting, urging them to pass a major tax bill. The tax bill's progress has been hindered by a faction of Republicans seeking cuts to Medicaid and the implementation of work requirements for eligibility. Critics argue that work requirements would create bureaucratic challenges and burden the government with verifying employment status for millions of people. Medicaid, jointly funded by the federal government and states, provides healthcare coverage to nearly 80 million Americans.</p>

          <p>Millions of consumers in the UK could receive up to ¬£70 each following a court ruling that found historic fees administered by Mastercard were unfair. The ruling stems from a long-running legal case alleging that shoppers were charged higher prices due to wrongly levied fees on transactions between 1992 and 2008. Consumers who lived in England, Wales, or Northern Ireland for at least three months during this period and purchased goods from UK businesses accepting Mastercard are eligible to claim compensation. Consumers in Scotland are eligible to claim if they lived there from May 1992.</p>

Parker distinguishes between two types of hate: elemental hate, which is rare and dehumanizing, and petty hate, which is more common and related to psychic atomization. He suggests detaching from technology, unplugging the ego, and being kinder to neighbors and oneself as ways to combat the latter. He also addresses the overuse of the word "existential", defending its relevance in the current era.</p>
