          <p>South Korean tech giant Samsung has invested in AI chip startup Rebellions, which is currently raising between $150 million and $200 million ahead of a potential IPO. Rebellions, formed from a merger with Sapeon, is positioned as a domestic rival to Nvidia and is collaborating with Samsung to manufacture its next-generation "Rebel" chip. This partnership is seen as a strategic move for Samsung's foundry business, aiming to secure a major customer and boost its market share against competitor TSMC. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-29 03:54:57 EDT</div>

          <p>Automotive group Stellantis has reinstated its financial guidance for the second half of the year, anticipating a gradual recovery despite reporting a net loss of 2.3 billion euros for the first half of 2025. The company, which owns brands like Jeep and Fiat, expects increased net revenues and improved cash flow, though it flagged "tough decisions" ahead. The guidance is based on the assumption that current trade rules, including the recently negotiated 15% US tariff on most EU goods, will remain in place, impacting the firm's full-year performance.

          <p>Amid the current collectible toy craze for Labubu monsters, an article revisits the history of the Monchhichi, a popular monkey doll from the 1980s. Created in Japan in 1974, the toy became a global phenomenon but was unavailable in communist East Germany. In response, a state-owned enterprise in the toy-making town of Sonneberg produced a similar doll called the Tiemi, which became popular throughout the Eastern Bloc. Today, these vintage East German dolls have become sought-after collector's items, representing a unique piece of Cold War-era consumer culture.</p>

          <p>British bank Barclays reported a second-quarter pre-tax profit of £2.5 billion, surpassing analyst expectations and leading to the announcement of a £1 billion share buyback. The strong performance was largely driven by its investment banking division, which saw a 10% year-on-year income increase due to heightened market volatility and trading activity. This result aligns with a broader trend of banks benefiting from market turbulence, as Barclays continues to implement its three-year strategic plan focused on cost savings and delivering higher returns for investors.

          <p>Manchester United is reportedly targeting Aston Villa's Ollie Watkins and RB Leipzig's Benjamin Sesko as potential striker reinforcements for the current transfer window. The club acknowledges the need to sell some existing players first to fund any new acquisitions, which may delay moves until closer to the September deadline. While Villa has stated Watkins is not for sale, United believes this could change, though they consider the rumored £60 million price tag too high. United also faces competition for Sesko, with Newcastle reportedly interested in the Slovenian forward.</p>

Experts note that the International Olympic Committee prioritizes political and popular support, but Qatar's human rights record and the political dynamics with neighboring Saudi Arabia could complicate its bid.

          <p>For the first time, India has overtaken China as the leading exporter of smartphones to the U.S., according to new market research. In the second quarter, smartphones assembled in India constituted 44% of U.S. imports, a dramatic increase from 13% the previous year, while China's share fell from 61% to 25%. This significant shift is largely driven by Apple's strategy to diversify its manufacturing away from China amid ongoing trade uncertainties.
