          <p>A royal expert has shared a story about the late Queen Elizabeth II once hiding in the bushes of Buckingham Palace to avoid Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceaușescu during a 1978 state visit. The Queen reportedly found Ceaușescu and his wife "ghastly" and took evasive action while walking her corgis in the gardens. The incident highlights the occasional awkwardness of diplomatic duties, where monarchs must host figures invited by the government, regardless of their personal feelings.</p>

          <h2>French President Macron Argues Recognizing Palestinian State is Key to Combating Hamas</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron defended his plan to formally recognize a Palestinian state, countering criticism that the move is reckless. He argued that recognition is a necessary step to isolate Hamas, whose goal is the destruction of Israel, not the creation of a viable state for Palestinians. According to Macron, providing a clear political pathway for Palestinians through statehood is a precondition for achieving peace and undermining the extremist group's influence in the region.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has dismissed suggestions that excluded players Raheem Sterling and Axel Disasi are facing a "hard life," comparing their situation unfavorably to his father's 50-year career as a fisherman. The comments came as the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) is in talks with the club about the duo's ongoing separation from the first-team squad. Maresca maintained that the club is providing the players with the tools to train properly despite their exclusion from team activities.</p>

          <p>Following the Federal Reserve's recent interest rate cut, financial experts are advising consumers to carefully consider whether refinancing loans is the right move. While the cut may eventually lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans, and student loans, the impact is not immediate and may require several more cuts to be significant. Homeowners are advised to look for at least a one-percentage-point difference between their current and potential new rate before refinancing to ensure the savings outweigh the closing costs.

          <p>A new book by AI doomsayer Eliezer Yudkowsky argues that superintelligent AI will inevitably lead to human extinction, a view that this article critiques as being logically flawed and based on shaky analogies. The article posits that both the doomers, who fear an AI apocalypse, and the tech utopians, who promise an AI-driven paradise, are fundamentally mistaken. Both camps share an unfounded belief in the imminent and transformative power of superintelligence, distracting from more immediate, real-world issues caused by current technology.</p>

Kyle stated that the UK Border Force is specifically responsible for policing borders and that the military's primary focus is national defense. The comments came during Trump's state visit, where he advocated for using military force to handle illegal migration, a method his administration has employed at the U.S. southern border.</p>

          <p>Five years into the pandemic, experts are clarifying why COVID-19 can cause severe illness in some healthy people while others experience only mild symptoms. A key factor is the initial viral load, meaning the amount of virus a person is exposed to at the time of infection; a higher dose can lead to a more severe illness. While new variants continue to emerge, immunity from prior infections and vaccinations remains the most crucial tool for reducing the risk of severe disease.</p>

Kashkari also downplayed the risk of tariffs causing a significant inflation surge, a shift in perspective that adds weight to the case for further easing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amidst a crisis of public trust in higher education and the rise of AI, Dartmouth's president argues that the core purpose of a university is more vital than ever. The article contends that college is not merely about transferring knowledge, which is now abundant, but about cultivating uniquely human skills like critical thinking, empathy, and collaborative leadership. A residential college experience provides an essential environment for face-to-face dialogue and debate, teaching students how to think, not what to think.</p>
