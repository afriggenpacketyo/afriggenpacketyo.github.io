          <p>Lucy Connolly, the wife of a Conservative councillor, has lost her appeal against a 31-month jail sentence for inciting racial hatred after posting a racist message on X following the Southport attacks last year, according to the BBC. Connolly's post called for "mass deportation now" and urged her followers to "set fire" to hotels housing asylum seekers. The Court of Appeal judges ruled that the sentence was not manifestly excessive, given the wide reach of the post, which had been viewed 310,000 times before it was deleted. Her husband, Ray Connolly, subsequently lost his seat in local elections. ()</p>

          <p>Home Depot CFO Ted McPhail stated that the retailer will not raise prices due to tariffs, according to CNBC, and the company reaffirmed its full-year sales forecast.

Home Depot's sales patterns improved throughout the first quarter, with a positive response to its spring Black Friday event and strong sales in certain departments, while sales have been softer in areas related to larger renovation projects.

Even with the recent tariff reduction, the U.S. trade-weighted tariff rate on Chinese goods remains significantly higher than before the second Trump administration.

Despite Messi's complaints driving headlines and attention to the league, MLS has chosen to bury the controversial play and Messi's criticism. This approach does a disservice to fans and the media, who want a fuller understanding of the story. The author argues that the chaos and controversy are enticing entry points for new fans and that the league should embrace the drama rather than trying to create a false impression of sober proceduralism.

          <p>A California appeals court has halted the Temecula school district's ban on critical race theory while litigation is ongoing, according to the Los Angeles Times. The court found the ban to be unconstitutionally vague, creating anxiety and confusion among teachers about what they can discuss in class. The appeals panel reversed a trial court ruling that had upheld the policy, stating that the resolution lacked clear definitions and enforcement guidelines. The court also addressed the board's policy of notifying parents about issues related to a student's gender identity, noting that state law now prohibits such automatic notification policies. ()</p>

          <p>Three leaders of the Aryan Brotherhood have been sentenced to federal prison terms, paving the way for their transfer from California lockups to the custody of the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, according to the Los Angeles Times. Kenneth Johnson, Francis Clement, and John Stinson were convicted of murder and racketeering crimes committed while incarcerated in California prisons. Prosecutors showed that the men coordinated murders, drug sales, fraud, and extortion using smuggled phones. The transfers to federal prison are seen as a way to curb their criminal activities within the California prison system. ()</p>
