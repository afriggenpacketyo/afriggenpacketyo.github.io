          <h2>Japanese Survey Reveals Majority Support for Social Media Regulation During Elections</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-02 23:36:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Kyodo News survey indicates that approximately 58% of Japanese citizens believe that social media platforms should be regulated by law during elections to combat the spread of misinformation. The survey highlights growing concerns about partisan online content influencing election outcomes, particularly following a recent gubernatorial election. While Japan enacted the information distribution platform law to address defamatory content, its impact remains limited. The survey also revealed divided opinions on revising Article 9 of the Constitution, which renounces war, and strong support for allowing married couples to keep separate surnames, reflecting evolving social attitudes in Japan. Optimism score is 70.</p>

          <p>Rolando 'Rolly' Romero defeated Ryan Garcia by unanimous decision in a boxing match held in Times Square, marking a significant upset. Romero secured a knockdown in the second round and maintained control throughout the fight, earning scores of 115-112 (twice) and 118-109 from the judges. Garcia, returning after a suspension due to a failed drug test, struggled with timing and output, landing only 54 punches compared to Romero's 65. Romero's victory disrupts potential plans for a Haney-Garcia rematch and positions him for a future fight against Devin Haney. Optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>China has passed the Private Economy Promotion Law, designed to bolster the private economy and provide legal recourse for businesses. The law, set to take effect on May 20, aims to protect the private sector from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers are closely monitoring the law's implementation, particularly its impact on firms' ability to challenge local governments in court. The legislation is seen as a test of Beijing's commitment to supporting the non-state economy and curbing administrative powers. Optimism score is 70.</p>
