          <p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has revealed a new stake in UnitedHealth, acquiring over 5 million shares valued at approximately $1.6 billion. This investment is notable given the insurer's recent struggles, including a Justice Department investigation and a significant drop in its stock price throughout 2025. The move aligns with Buffett's history of value investing in beleaguered companies, and the disclosure caused UnitedHealth's stock to surge in extended trading. Berkshire also adjusted other positions, slightly reducing its holdings in Apple and Bank of America while adding smaller stakes in several other firms. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal building in Lower Manhattan, which houses offices for the Department of Homeland Security and ICE, was evacuated after an unknown white powder was found. The substance was discovered in five separate letters within the building's mailroom, prompting a response from hazmat units and the FBI. Authorities later confirmed that the powder was non-hazardous and that no ongoing threat remained to employees or the public. The incident drew attention to the building at 26 Federal Plaza, which has been a site of controversy and protests regarding the processing and holding of immigrants.</p>

          <p>Chinese fast-fashion retailer Shein saw its UK sales surge by nearly a third to £2 billion in 2024, leading to a 57% increase in profits compared to the previous year. Despite this strong performance, the company acknowledged that future consumer spending could be affected by inflation and cost-of-living pressures. Shein may also face new challenges from a potential UK government review of tax exemptions on low-value imported packages, a policy change that has already led the company to raise prices in the United States. The financial disclosure comes as Shein reportedly considers a public listing on the London Stock Exchange. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Former Chinese Economic Official Urges Removal of Purchase Restrictions to Stimulate Consumption</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A former senior Chinese economic official has advised the government to boost domestic consumption by removing purchase restrictions on items like property and vehicles. Yin Yanlin, previously with a key party economic commission, argued that encouraging affluent groups to spend more would drive market demand and create a positive economic cycle. He noted that rising national savings indicate that income levels are not the primary barrier to spending. This recommendation comes as China seeks effective strategies to invigorate its economy and unlock the spending potential of its citizens. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Airlines are finding the traditionally profitable summer season more challenging as travel patterns evolve. Carriers have reduced their August flight schedules in response to demand shifting to earlier in the summer and some European travel moving to the fall. This year, economic uncertainty and last-minute bookings forced many airlines to cut fares, impacting initial profit forecasts. In response, airlines like American and Southwest are adjusting their future schedules to better align with new trends, such as earlier school start and end dates, to optimize capacity and profitability.</p>

          <h2>Family Offices Dramatically Increase Allocations to Private Markets</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-15 07:00:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Investment firms for the world's wealthiest families, known as family offices, have significantly increased their investments in private markets like direct lending and infrastructure over the past decade. Data from Preqin shows a more than 500% surge since 2016 in the number of family offices allocating funds to these assets. This trend is driven by the large amounts of wealth these firms manage and their long-term investment horizons, which make them well-suited for illiquid private assets that offer stable growth potential compared to volatile public markets. While still bullish, recent surveys indicate they are becoming more selective, favoring private debt over private equity. (not investment advice)</p>
