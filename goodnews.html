          <p>A federal judge has struck down President Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. Judge Richard Leon issued a scathing opinion, emphasizing the importance of an independent judiciary and bar. The order, which criticized WilmerHale for hiring Robert Mueller, sought to suspend security clearances and terminate government contracts. The law firm sued, calling the order an unprecedented assault on the judicial system's foundations. The court's decision affirms foundational constitutional rights and those of WilmerHale's clients.</p>

The Chrisleys' daughter, Savannah, has been actively seeking a pardon for her parents, claiming they were unfairly targeted due to their celebrity status.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-27 18:12:11 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Stablecoin issuer Circle's upcoming IPO stands out due to a peculiar characteristic: existing shareholders are selling more shares than the company itself. This mirrors Facebook's 2012 IPO, where a significant portion of shares came from stakeholders. While Circle did not provide a reason, the move likely reflects venture capital firms' need for liquidity after a period of meager returns. The company is profitable and has substantial cash reserves, but private investors are eager for exits to distribute funds back to their investors. This situation reflects a multiyear drought in IPOs and a strong desire for early investors to gain liquidity.</p>
