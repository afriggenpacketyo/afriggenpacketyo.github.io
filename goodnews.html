          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.4%, which would be the lowest annual benefit increase in five years, according to estimates from policy analysts and senior groups. The COLA is an annual inflation adjustment to Social Security benefits, calculated by comparing third-quarter inflation data from the current year to the previous year. The CPI-W, which is used to calculate Social Security's COLA, increased by 2.1% over the past 12 months. However, the actual COLA may change depending on the pace of inflation in the coming months.</p>

          <p>The stock market has recovered to pre-tariff levels, but investors remain cautious due to uncertainty about the final level of tariffs. The Federal Reserve is also in a wait-and-see mode, unwilling to lower interest rates before the inflationary effect of the new tariffs is known. Uncertainty means businesses hold off on making investment decisions and consumers pull back from spending, slowing economic growth. The dollar index has fallen 6.7 percent so far this year, signaling concern about tariffs. (not investment advice)</p>
