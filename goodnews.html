          <p>CVS Health surpassed Wall Street expectations for its second-quarter earnings and revenue, leading to a significant jump in its stock price. The company raised its adjusted profit outlook for fiscal 2025, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy division and improvements within its Aetna insurance unit. CEO David Joyner highlighted investments in technology and labor as key drivers of pharmacy efficiency, although growth was partially offset by a decline in the health services segment. The positive results come as the company continues a multiyear turnaround and cost-cutting plan under new leadership. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Althorp House, the childhood home and final resting place of Princess Diana, will not be inherited by her sons, Prince William and Prince Harry. According to royal experts and the tradition of primogeniture followed by the Spencer family, the estate will pass to Diana's brother's eldest son, Louis Spencer. The property has been in the Spencer family since 1508, and this line of succession ensures it remains with the same surname. While William and Harry can visit their mother's grave on the estate privately, the ownership and title will transfer to their cousin.</p>

          <p>On the day of Figma's initial public offering, co-founder and CEO Dylan Field stated that he does not view AI superintelligence as an imminent threat to the design software company. As Figma began trading on the NYSE, Field expressed skepticism that AI would quickly be able to replicate the company's complex graphics engine and proprietary technology, which is not readily available in public data sets. The comments come as other tech giants like Meta are heavily investing in the pursuit of superintelligence. Figma priced its IPO at $33 per share, valuing the company at over $19 billion.</p>

          <p>West Ham United midfielder Lucas Paqueta has been cleared of spot-fixing charges by an independent regulatory commission, ending a nearly two-year investigation by the Football Association. The Brazilian international was accused of deliberately receiving yellow cards in four separate Premier League matches to influence betting markets, allegations that could have resulted in a lifetime ban. While the four main charges were found "not proven," the commission did find him guilty of two lesser charges of failing to cooperate with the investigation. Paqueta maintained his innocence throughout the process and expressed his eagerness to return to playing.</p>

          <p>Shares for Meta and Microsoft surged after both tech giants reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, with Microsoft surpassing a $4 trillion market capitalization.

Analysts noted that this spending boom is likely to benefit chipmakers like AMD and Broadcom, who are key suppliers to the companies.

          <p>Comcast reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that exceeded Wall Street estimates, even as it continued to lose broadband customers amid intense competition.

          <p>In an opinion piece, former Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif argues for the creation of a regional network for peaceful nuclear cooperation in the Middle East. He proposes an organization, tentatively named Menara, that would be open to all qualified states in the region who commit to rejecting nuclear weapons and accepting mutual verification. In return, the body would facilitate cooperation on peaceful nuclear technology for energy, medicine, and research. Zarif contends that this approach could build trust, enhance regional security, and reframe the nuclear debate away from conflict and towards shared solutions for development.</p>
