          <p>Apple has reported third-quarter financial results that exceeded analyst predictions for both revenue and profit, driven by a 13% year-over-year increase in iPhone sales. The company's overall revenue grew by 10%, marking its most significant quarterly growth since December 2021 and leading to a rise in its stock price. While Mac and Services divisions also saw strong growth, iPad and wearables sales experienced a decline. Apple also noted a positive reversal in its China market, with sales increasing by 4% after previous quarters of decline. (not investment advice)</p>

The company's advertising and cloud computing units showed significant strength, with ad revenue climbing 23% and Amazon Web Services growing 18%. Despite the positive results, Amazon's shares fell in extended trading due to a weaker-than-expected operating income forecast for the upcoming quarter.

          <p>The Pentagon has ordered the removal of 1,350 National Guard troops from Los Angeles, a significant portion of the force deployed by the Trump administration to address protests related to immigration policies. The deployment, which cost an estimated $134 million, was met with resistance from California politicians who argued it was unnecessary and drew resources from other critical areas. While 250 troops will remain to protect federal property, local leaders like L.A. Mayor Karen Bass and Governor Gavin Newsom applauded the withdrawal and called for a complete demobilization.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the country's parliament have overturned a contentious law that would have limited the independence of key anti-corruption agencies. The reversal came after days of large-scale protests across Ukraine, led primarily by young people who feared the law would jeopardize the nation's path toward European Union integration. The original bill had sparked a political crisis, raising concerns among Western partners and threatening crucial foreign financial aid. The government's U-turn is seen as a victory for civil society and a reaffirmation of Ukraine's democratic processes.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase reported mixed second-quarter financial results, causing its shares to fall in extended trading. While adjusted earnings per share beat expectations, the company's revenue of $1.5 billion fell short of analyst estimates, largely due to weaker-than-anticipated transaction revenue. Retail trading volume grew year-over-year but also missed projections, reflecting a slowdown in speculative trading compared to the first quarter. However, revenue from subscriptions and services, particularly its stablecoin offerings connected to Circle's USDC, showed notable year-over-year growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>After announcing she will not run for governor of California, former Vice President Kamala Harris has numerous options for her next chapter, according to political experts. While another presidential run in 2028 is a possibility, she could also pursue other influential roles to remain in the public eye and reshape her political narrative. Experts suggest she might focus on a specific cause, such as regulating artificial intelligence, or follow the Obamas' model of creating media content like books and podcasts. Whatever her choice, she faces the challenge of unifying a fractured Democratic party and re-establishing her influence.</p>

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has revealed the surprising origin of the potato, tracing its ancestry back to an ancient interbreeding event with a tomato species around 9 million years ago. Scientists have long been puzzled by the potato's evolution, but this research shows that a hybridization event was key. An ancient tomato provided a crucial gene that enables the formation of starchy tubers, while a wild potato-like species from Chile contributed a gene that controls their growth. This discovery solves a long-standing botanical mystery and demonstrates how new species can emerge through hybridization.</p>
