          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after becoming trapped in a 9-foot-deep abandoned well in Pembroke, Maine. The animal was discovered by a landowner who saw its antlers sticking out of the ground. The Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife orchestrated a five-hour rescue, which involved sedating the moose and using a family-provided excavator to carefully lift it to safety. After the sedative wore off, the moose ran back into the forest, apparently unharmed by the ordeal.</p>

These international bodies emphasized that no causal link has been scientifically established, directly countering the claims promoted by the White House.</p>

          <p>England's cricket team has assembled what is being called its most hostile and aggressive fast-bowling squad for an Ashes tour in Australia since the 1970s. The selection, featuring high-pace bowlers like Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, signals a strategic shift to fight Australia's strengths directly. However, the article notes that while the potential is immense, there are significant durability concerns, as many of the key bowlers have recent injury histories. The performance and fitness of this attack are seen as critical to England's chances of reclaiming the urn.</p>

          <p>Major League Baseball will introduce an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) System, or "robot umpires," for the 2026 season. The technology will be used via a challenge system, where each team can appeal two ball or strike calls per game, with reviews displayed on stadium screens. This marks a significant technological advancement for the sport, aimed at increasing call accuracy and reducing on-field disputes, which account for over 60% of all ejections. The system has been tested extensively in the minor leagues since 2019.</p>

          <p>An article details the "Medigap birthday rule," a state-specific provision that offers a valuable opportunity for seniors to manage healthcare costs. Available in about 18 states, this rule grants Medicare beneficiaries an annual window around their birthday to switch Medigap supplemental plans without undergoing medical underwriting, which often prevents those with pre-existing conditions from changing coverage. This allows seniors to move to a plan with equal or lesser benefits that may be more affordable, providing crucial financial flexibility and peace of mind.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following a recent interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the monthly cost of a $60,000 home equity line of credit (HELOC) has become more affordable. With average rates now around 8.05%, a 15-year HELOC would have an approximate monthly payment of $575. The article notes that HELOCs offer an advantage over fixed-rate loans in the current environment, as their variable rates could decrease further if the Fed implements additional cuts, automatically lowering payments for borrowers.

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer is advising investors to buy Boeing stock, citing strong potential for growth driven by President Trump's trade policies. The primary catalyst for his bullish outlook is the news that the U.S. and China are in the final stages of negotiating a massive order for Boeing aircraft, which would be the first such deal since Trump's first term. Cramer argues that this, along with other large international orders, has made the company's stock too compelling to ignore, despite recent pullbacks. (not investment advice)</p>

Without naming President Trump directly, Powell defended the Fed's independence amid an ongoing pressure campaign from the White House to influence its interest rate decisions. The remarks highlight the significant tension between the administration and the central bank, which Powell insists makes its policy decisions based on economic data, not political considerations.</p>

Campbell, who successfully fought obscenity charges in a landmark First Amendment case, advises Kimmel that he must fight back against the Trump administration's attempts to silence him. He argues that failing to resist will set a dangerous precedent, allowing the government to target any dissenting voice on television and further erode free speech protections.</p>
