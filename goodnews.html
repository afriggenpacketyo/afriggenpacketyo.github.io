          <p>Tesla has changed its corporate bylaws, limiting shareholders' ability to sue the company for breaches of fiduciary duty. The new bylaw requires shareholders to hold at least 3% of Tesla's stock to initiate a derivative proceeding, a stake worth over $30 billion. This move takes advantage of Texas state law, where Tesla is incorporated, which allows corporations to limit shareholder lawsuits. The article provides context by mentioning a previous Delaware court decision that rescinded Elon Musk's 2018 compensation package, prompting Tesla to move its incorporation to Texas.</p>

          <p>Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewelry store in Tokyo can be extradited to Japan following a landmark ruling. Kaine Wright and Joe Chappell are accused of stealing items worth ¬£679,000 from a Harry Winston store in 2015. The case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan, marking the first time Japan has successfully received fugitives from the UK, as no extradition treaty exists between the two countries. The men raised concerns over prison conditions in Japan, but the court found extradition compatible with their human rights.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court, in a 7-2 ruling, extended its injunction that temporarily bars the Trump administration from removing Venezuelan immigrants from the United States under the Alien Enemies Act. The majority said the government did not provide migrants targeted under the wartime authority with enough time or information to contest their cases. The justices sent the case back to the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Trump issued an all-caps statement on Truth Social blasting the judges in the majority for their ruling.</p>

          <p>A Wisconsin angler discovered the wreck of the J.C. Ames, a tugboat submerged in Lake Michigan for over a century. The tug was built in 1881 and scuttled in 1923 after falling into disrepair. Storms this winter apparently revealed the ship, which had been buried in the sand. The article highlights the importance of locating shipwrecks before quagga mussels destroy them.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court rejected the Trump administration‚Äôs request to remove a temporary block on deportations of Venezuelans under a rarely used 18th-century wartime law. The justices acted on an emergency appeal from lawyers for Venezuelan men accused of being gang members. Trump responded on social media, claiming the justices were preventing him from removing criminals. The case stems from a lawsuit challenging Trump‚Äôs invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.</p>

          <p>This article is not about investment advice. This article is about the potential tax savings under the GOP bill, which would disproportionately benefit the highest income earners, while offering far more modest gains to Americans lower down the ladder. The lowest-earning 20% of Americans would receive the smallest boost, their after-tax incomes would rise 0.6%, or an average of $90 annually, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The article discusses the potential impact of cuts to federal programs such as Medicaid and food stamps, which support many low- and middle-income households.</p>

          <p>President Trump went on a social media posting spree after a four-day tour of the Middle East, lashing out at critics like Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift. Trump questioned Swift's popularity and vaguely threatened Springsteen upon his return to the United States. The article suggests Trump's outburst was a comedown after receiving lavish praise during his overseas trip. The article highlights Trump's tendency to attack critics and the White House's response to the controversy.</p>
