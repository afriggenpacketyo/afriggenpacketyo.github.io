          <p>This CNBC article introduces "emotionally safe parenting," a new parenting style focused on attuning to a child's emotional needs to build resilience, trust, and connection. Unlike authoritative, authoritarian, or gentle parenting, this framework emphasizes emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. Emotionally safe parents accept their child's emotions, respond without shaming, view misbehavior as a stress signal, and take responsibility after conflicts. The article outlines practical steps for parents to practice emotionally safe parenting, including doing inner work, seeing behavior as communication, setting boundaries with empathy, and preventing shame from taking place.</p>

          <p>Tommy Paul, the 12th-seeded American tennis player, won his first-round match at the French Open after overcoming a recent incident where his truck was repossessed due to missed payments. Paul explained that he had changed banks and forgot to update his automatic payments for his Ford F-150, resulting in the repossession. After his trainer notified him of the truck's disappearance, Paul reviewed his security camera footage to discover the towing. Fortunately, he was able to regain possession of the truck, adding a humorous anecdote to his victory.</p>

          <p>This CNBC article reports Jim Cramer's analysis on whether to invest in U.S. or European stocks, noting recent underperformance in the U.S. market due to tariffs and economic concerns.

The article highlights that many S&P 500 companies have substantial international exposure, and Cramer prefers a selective approach, recommending stocks of domestic companies with pricing power and no slackening of demand.

Her efforts led to a lasting change in how the military handles these sensitive situations, ensuring that families receive compassionate care during a difficult time. In 2023, Ft. Benning was renamed Ft. Moore to honor Julie and her husband, marking the first time an American military base had been named for a civilian.</p>
