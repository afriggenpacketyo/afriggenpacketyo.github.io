        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>India's coal-fired electricity generation saw a substantial decrease in May, marking the fastest decline in five years, according to a Reuters analysis of government data. This drop is attributed to a decrease in overall power demand and a rise in renewable energy generation, which reached a record high. The decline in fossil fuel demand for electricity generation occurs amid pressure on benchmark fuel prices, which could assist India in slashing emissions. Increased generation from hydro and nuclear sources also contributed to a decline in natural gas-fired power output. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Shares of Australia's Lynas Rare Earths experienced a significant surge, reaching a two-year high, following warnings from global automakers regarding potential production delays due to China's rare-earth export restrictions. As the largest rare-earth producer outside China, Lynas is expected to benefit from concerns over global supply stability. China, responsible for approximately 90% of global rare-earth production, implemented export restrictions on strategic minerals in April. This move has raised concerns across industries reliant on these elements, which are critical for various sectors, including defense, electric vehicles, and clean energy.</p>

          <p>UK newspapers lead with Chancellor Rachel Reeves' expected 'U-turn' on winter fuel payments, which involves restoring the payment and then reclaiming it from wealthier pensioners through higher taxes. Concerns are raised about potential 'chaos' as bereaved families of deceased pensioners may be pursued to recover the payments. Immigration policies are also a key focus, with a 'battle lines' depiction of opposing policies from Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch on reducing migration numbers. Other headlines cover topics such as weight-loss jabs, U.S. debt, and free school meals for more children.</p>

          <p>A Pakistani think tank suggests China should lead Pakistan's energy transition with solar panels, creating a model for the Global South. The report states that cheap Chinese solar panels are undercutting demand for power from coal-fired plants financed by China, leading to stranded assets. It recommends China and Pakistan evolve into co-creators of a clean-energy innovation ecosystem, given rising global trade tensions. However, a Chinese energy scholar has questioned whether the vision is too expensive to be viable.</p>
