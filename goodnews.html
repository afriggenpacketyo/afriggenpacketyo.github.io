          <p>Luxury parka maker Canada Goose is reportedly receiving take-private bids valuing the company at approximately $1.35 billion, as its controlling shareholder, Bain Capital, explores offloading its stake. Private equity firms Boyu Capital and Advent International have made verbal offers, with other interested buyers including Bosideng International and a consortium led by FountainVest Capital and Anta Sports Product. This move comes as Canada Goose struggles with growth momentum in key markets and faces questions about its brand positioning and marketing strategy. The potential privatization offers greater autonomy to address these challenges and revitalize the brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets exhibited mixed trading results as investors evaluated new industrial profits data from China. China's industrial profits saw a notable recovery in July, slipping only 1.5% year-on-year after months of steeper declines, attributed to Beijing's efforts against price wars. Meanwhile, new U.S. tariffs of 25% on Indian exports, pushing total duties to 50%, are set to take effect. Japan's Nikkei 225 was marginally higher, boosted by Nikon, while South Korea's Kospi and Australia's S&P/ASX 200 showed slight movements. (not investment advice)</p>

The article notes her serve remains a work in progress, but her victory keeps alive her ambition to achieve the world No. 1 ranking.

          <p>China's industrial profits decreased by 1.5% year-on-year in July, marking the slowest pace of decline in five months and indicating a notable recovery. This improvement is largely attributed to Beijing's policy interventions aimed at stabilizing consumer price levels and enhancing corporate margins. While state-backed firms saw a 7.5% profit drop in the first seven months, businesses with foreign investments experienced a 1.8% increase. The mining industry faced a significant 31.6% plunge, contrasting with profit improvements in manufacturing and utilities sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Less than eight months after the devastating Eaton and Palisades wildfires in Los Angeles County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it is almost finished clearing debris from nearly 10,000 residential properties. Federal contractors removed 2.5 million tons of fire wreckage, completing the task four months ahead of schedule. This rapid response is hailed as the fastest wildfire recovery in modern history, despite some initial complaints about the quality of work. Many affected communities are now transitioning to the rebuilding phase, with hundreds of permits already issued for new homes.</p>

          <p>A sophisticated retail crime ring, responsible for over 600 thefts and an estimated $10 million in stolen merchandise from Home Depot stores across Southern California, has been dismantled. Authorities announced a 48-count criminal complaint against nine key individuals, including the alleged leader, David Ahl, who resold stolen high-value items through his electronics storefront. The operation, dubbed "Operation Kill Switch," led to 14 arrests and the seizure of millions in stolen goods and illicit money. This successful prosecution highlights new legislation allowing consolidation of multi-county retail crime charges, aiding law enforcement in tackling organized theft.</p>

          <p>Karen Read was found not guilty of second-degree murder and manslaughter in the death of her boyfriend, Boston police officer John O'Keefe, in a high-profile Massachusetts retrial. Jurors, after four days of deliberation, convicted her only of driving under the influence of alcohol. The defense argued Read was framed in an elaborate cover-up involving law enforcement, while prosecutors alleged she hit O'Keefe with her SUV and left him to die in the snow. This verdict follows a mistrial in her first trial due to a hung jury.</p>

          <p>SpaceX successfully launched its massive Super Heavy-Starship rocket on a critical test flight, marking a significant achievement after a series of previous failures. The 40-story-tall vehicle, the most powerful ever built, performed as planned, with its Super Heavy first stage splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico and the Starship upper stage reaching a suborbital trajectory. Despite reentry heating damaging a protective skirt and partially melting a control flap, the Starship maintained control and made a powered splashdown in the Indian Ocean. This success is crucial for NASA's Artemis moon landing program and Elon Musk's Mars colonization ambitions.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel, the U.S. restaurant chain, has abandoned its modernized logo and will reinstate its traditional "Old Timer" design after facing fierce public and financial backlash. The company's interim CEO confirmed they listened to customer feedback, including calls from President Donald Trump, who criticized the rebrand. The new logo, which removed the iconic man leaning against a barrel, was part of an effort to update the brand's image but led to accusations of abandoning its Southern roots and a 7% nosedive in stock value. This reversal aims to restore customer loyalty and brand identity.</p>
