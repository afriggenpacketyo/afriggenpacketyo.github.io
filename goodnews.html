          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company plans to launch its robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, by the end of June, with plans to expand to Los Angeles and San Francisco. The initial launch will involve approximately 10 vehicles, with the potential for rapid scaling to thousands if the launch proceeds without incidents. These robotaxis will be Model Y vehicles equipped with the latest version of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) software, known as FSD Unsupervised. Musk emphasized the importance of starting small to ensure safety and confirm the technology's reliability before wider deployment, a service which he has been promising since 2016.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration has issued temporary flight restrictions for Newark Liberty International Airport, capping hourly departures and arrivals due to technology outages, staffing shortages, and runway construction. Flights will be limited to 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, then 34 departures and 34 arrivals until October 25, aiming to reduce delays and improve passenger safety. United Airlines, the airport's largest operator, supports the restrictions. The FAA acknowledges a shortage of air traffic controllers, with only 24 currently overseeing Newark, significantly less than the 38 deemed necessary for smooth operations, exacerbating the existing staffing crisis nationwide.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Food and Drug Administration will permit Covid-19 vaccine use for adults over 65 and those with medical conditions this fall but will require additional studies before approving the shots for healthy Americans younger than 65. Agency leaders stated there was evidence to justify approval only for older people and those with medical conditions. The new rules mark a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older. Some experts worry the new criteria go too far, erecting barriers for people who will want the shots.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass signed an executive directive aimed at making it easier and cheaper to film in the city, amid concerns about the loss of production jobs to other states and countries. The directive includes streamlining city processes, lowering costs for on-location filming, and increasing access to iconic locations like Griffith Observatory and the Port of Los Angeles. Bass also urged the state legislature to increase film and TV production tax credits to enhance the state's competitiveness. This initiative comes as the local industry faces challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic, labor strikes, and a contraction in the streaming market.</p>

The FDA recommended different standards of evidence for approval based on patients' risk of getting severely sick from Covid. Drugmakers will need to track participants for at least six months "to ensure that early booster gains persist," they added.</p>
