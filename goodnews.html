        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a significant reversal of his previous stance, U.S. President Donald Trump stated that Ukraine could win back all of its territory from Russia, including its original pre-war borders. He attributed this change to Russia's economic troubles, calling the nation a "paper tiger" and urging Ukraine to act with support from Europe and NATO. This new position emerged following discussions with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky at the UN, who hailed the development as a "big shift" and a positive signal of U.S. support.</p>

          <p>Shares of European defense companies experienced a significant rally following U.S. President Donald Trump's unexpected shift in policy towards the war in Ukraine. After Trump declared that Ukraine could win back all its territory with NATO support, the Stoxx Europe Aerospace and Defense Index gained 1.4%, with firms like Sweden's Saab and Germany's Hensoldt rising by 5%. The market reaction reflects investor belief that the change in U.S. rhetoric could lead to prolonged or increased military support and spending in the region. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Pop star Dua Lipa has publicly denied media reports that she dismissed one of her agents, David Levy, for his involvement in a letter urging Glastonbury to cancel a performance by the pro-Palestinian Irish band Kneecap. Both Lipa and her agency, WME, clarified that Levy had not worked directly with her since 2019, calling the story "categorically false" and "deliberately inflammatory." While condemning the attempt to silence Kneecap, Lipa criticized the media for exploiting a global tragedy to create online division, reaffirming her pro-Palestinian stance.</p>

          <p>As the Ryder Cup approaches at Bethpage, New York, Team Europe faces the significant challenge of winning on U.S. soil for the first time since 2012. Experts and players believe this year presents a strong opportunity, citing the team's continuity with only one new player and the experienced leadership of returning captain Luke Donald. Key to their success will be managing the notoriously hostile American crowd and relying on veteran players like Rory McIlroy and Jon Rahm to perform under pressure, aiming to replicate their historic comeback at Medinah.</p>

          <p>The UK government has successfully recovered approximately £480 million lost to fraud over the past year, aided by a new artificial intelligence tool. A significant portion of the reclaimed funds, £186 million, was linked to fraudulent claims made during the COVID-19 pandemic, with other recoveries from unlawful council tax claims and illegal subletting. The AI tool, which cross-references data across departments to identify suspicious activity, will now be licensed to international partners, including the U.S. and Australia, to help combat fraud globally.</p>

          <p>The city of Datong in northern China successfully avoided disaster during heavy summer rains, a success attributed to a major infrastructure project completed over 15 years ago. Former mayor Geng Yanbo led an initiative to widen the city's main river and reinforce its banks, a move that was controversial at the time but is now credited with saving the city from severe flooding. Economists suggest that such long-term investments in urban resilience not only protect cities but can also serve as effective short-term economic stimuli.</p>
