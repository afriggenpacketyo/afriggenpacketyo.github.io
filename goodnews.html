          <p>Shares for minerals explorer Trilogy Metals soared by over 175% in premarket trading after the White House announced it would take a 10% stake in the company through a $35.6 million investment. This partnership is part of a federal initiative to develop domestic sources of critical minerals, such as copper and cobalt, in Alaska's Ambler mining district. The move reverses a previous administration's rejection of the Ambler Road project, a 211-mile industrial road that opponents argue will harm local ecosystems and communities. The investment underscores a renewed federal focus on securing domestic supply chains for resources vital to defense and energy infrastructure. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that the ongoing government shutdown provides the Trump administration with a prime opportunity to fulfill its goal of downsizing the federal government. The author suggests that President Trump should use the political standoff to initiate significant layoffs of federal workers, a move they claim is supported by public perception of government waste. The piece praises the efforts of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in cutting what it deems wasteful contracts and programs. It frames the potential workforce reduction not as a crisis, but as a necessary step toward restoring fiscal sanity and accountability to taxpayers.</p>

          <p>A couple in New Orleans clearing their yard discovered a flat marble slab that has been identified as a 1,900-year-old Roman grave marker. The homeowners, one of whom is an anthropologist, contacted university experts who determined the headstone belonged to a second-century Roman sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus. The artifact was reported missing from a museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, which was heavily bombed during World War II. The FBI's art crime team is now involved to facilitate the stone's repatriation, while researchers continue to investigate the mystery of how it traveled from ancient Rome to a modern American garden.</p>

          <p>President Trump's deployment of National Guard troops to Democratic-led cities without state approval is testing the legal limits of presidential power. The administration is using a rarely invoked statute, Title 10, which allows federal control of the Guard during an invasion or rebellion, arguing that protests are hindering federal immigration enforcement. Legal experts and state officials contend this is a misuse of authority, leading to lawsuits in Illinois and Oregon with mixed results in federal court. This article explains the different legal frameworks for Guard deployment and the ongoing debate over whether the current situations meet the high threshold for federal intervention.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-07 04:55:41 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) will begin a phased restart of production this week after a serious cyber-attack halted its manufacturing lines for over a month. The resumption will begin at its engine and battery facilities before expanding to vehicle assembly lines in the UK and Slovakia. To mitigate the financial damage to its supply chain, JLR has also launched a program to offer accelerated payments to its direct suppliers, many of whom had laid off workers due to the production stoppage. While the restart is a positive step, industry experts warn it will likely be several weeks before operations return to normal.</p>

          <h2>Chinese Solar Giant Sungrow Pursues Hong Kong IPO Amid U.S. Trade Tensions</h2>

          <p>Sungrow Power Supply, the world's largest manufacturer of solar inverters and energy storage systems, is seeking an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The move comes as the Trump administration implements new import tariffs on Chinese-made solar products, creating a challenging international trade environment. Based in Hefei, Sungrow has maintained a leading global market share for a decade and is a key player in the renewable energy industry. The company's decision to list in Hong Kong reflects a broader trend of mainland Chinese firms turning to the city's robust stock market for capital amidst geopolitical and economic pressures.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China Leads Green Energy Revolution as U.S. Remains Tied to Fossil Fuels</h2>

          <p>This opinion piece asserts that China is decisively driving the global transition to renewable energy while the United States is stuck in the past. The article highlights that China's annual additions of renewable energy capacity are vastly outpacing those of the U.S., which remains the world's top producer of oil and natural gas. Despite the Biden administration's incentives, U.S. solar installations in 2024 were only 15% of China's. The author argues the U.S. is also shirking its climate responsibilities, as its per capita carbon emissions are approximately 50% higher than China's, positioning it as a petrostate rather than a green leader.</p>

          <p>London's Metropolitan Police have conducted their largest-ever operation against phone theft, arresting 18 suspects and dismantling an international criminal network. The gang is believed to be responsible for exporting up to 40,000 stolen mobile phones, primarily iPhones, from the UK to China over the past year. The extensive investigation began after a single victim tracked their stolen device to a warehouse near Heathrow Airport, leading police to uncover the massive smuggling operation. The crackdown comes as phone theft in London has nearly tripled in the last four years, fueled by a high demand for secondhand devices abroad.</p>

          <p>In a pioneering move, China has launched the world's first commercial underwater data center off the coast of Hainan province. The facility houses servers in a 1,300-tonne cabin submerged 35 meters deep, utilizing the surrounding seawater as a natural coolant. This innovative design significantly reduces the energy consumption and operational costs typically associated with cooling land-based data centers. The project is a key component of Hainan's strategic plan to develop its "blue economy" by leveraging new marine technologies. The full project aims to eventually deploy 100 such data cabins on the seabed.</p>

          <p>Skygazers can look forward to the first of three consecutive supermoons this year, with the full Harvest Moon appearing on Tuesday night. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest approach to Earth, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than usual. This month's full moon is known as the Harvest Moon because it is the one closest to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers. The event offers a spectacular celestial display, though viewing may be dependent on local weather conditions and cloud cover.</p>
