          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer advised investors that while the top-performing stocks from the third quarter could continue to rise, the most significant gains for the year may have already occurred. He noted that fund managers often buy recent winners in the fourth quarter, which could support prices for companies like AppLovin, Western Digital, and Warner Bros. Discovery. However, Cramer cautioned that this trend doesn't guarantee the same explosive growth seen in the previous quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A BBC report addresses common myths surrounding cooking oils, featuring insights from Professor Nita Forouhi of the University of Cambridge. The article debunks claims that vegetable and sunflower oils are unhealthy, explaining they are low in saturated fats and beneficial when replacing butter or lard. It also clarifies that modern margarines no longer contain harmful trans fats and discusses the appropriate uses for different oils based on their smoke points, recommending basic olive oil for shallow frying and vegetable oil for deep frying.</p>

          <p>Arsenal manager Mikel Arteta has praised team captain Martin Odegaard for his "phenomenal" creativity, particularly highlighted in the recent Champions League victory over Olympiacos. Arteta stated that he has given the 26-year-old midfielder "total freedom" to take risks and generate opportunities on the field, which is his natural strength. Odegaard, who recently returned from a shoulder injury, was instrumental in both goals during the match and played a key role in the team's recent comeback win against Newcastle.</p>

          <p>Manchester City striker Erling Haaland voiced his disappointment after his team drew 2-2 with Monaco in a Champions League match, stating the performance was "not good enough." Despite Haaland scoring both of City's goals, the team conceded a 90th-minute penalty, continuing a troubling pattern of letting leads slip late in games. The result marks another missed opportunity for City to secure a win away from home in European competition, adding to recent frustrations for the club.</p>

          <p>The grand opening of a new In-N-Out restaurant in Monrovia, California, was interrupted by the discovery of a 3- to 4-foot-long python in the drive-thru lane. An employee spotted the snake and called Pasadena Humane, which sent a specialist to safely capture the well-cared-for serpent. The animal welfare group is now treating the python as a stray and is seeking information from the public about its owner, advising people to keep their distance if they encounter a similar snake.</p>

          <p>Despite the U.S. government shutdown, stock markets closed at record highs, reflecting a historical trend where such events have a modest impact on financial markets. Analysts note that while shutdowns have severe consequences for federal workers, the broader economic effect is often a delay in activity that is recovered once the government reopens. Analysis of 22 previous shutdowns since 1976 shows the S&P 500 gained an average of 0.3% during the closures, though a prolonged impasse could still introduce market uncertainty.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Recent signals from both Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Donald Trump suggest a potential for increased cooperation in the Arctic, a development that could challenge China's ambitions in the region. Analysts believe shared interests in energy, shipping, and geopolitics could drive the two nations to collaborate, potentially as a way for Russia to counterbalance its growing reliance on China. Any such partnership would likely focus on resources and infrastructure, directly overlapping with the areas of current China-Russia Arctic cooperation.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Rams wide receiver Puka Nacua is having a historic start to the NFL season, leading the league with 42 catches for 503 yards through four games. His impressive performance is drawing parallels to teammate Cooper Kupp's triple-crown-winning season in 2021 and has established him as a key player for the Super Bowl-contending team. Nacua's physical play style and ability to gain yards after the catch have earned him praise from coaches and players alike as he prepares for a divisional matchup against the San Francisco 49ers.</p>

          <p>Actress and activist Jane Fonda has revived the Committee for the First Amendment, a group her father, Henry Fonda, supported in 1947 to defend Hollywood figures against congressional investigations into alleged Communist ties. Supported by hundreds of celebrities like Sean Penn and Billie Eilish, the modern version of the committee aims to combat what it calls a "coordinated campaign to silence critics" by the federal government. The relaunch follows recent political pressure on media figures, asserting that the right to criticize those in power is a foundational American value.</p>

          <p>For its 51st season, Saturday Night Live is undergoing a modest cast update rather than a major overhaul, following the departure of veterans like Heidi Gardner and Ego Nwodim. The show is retaining key players such as Bowen Yang and Kenan Thompson while adding five new performers, many of whom built their careers on internet platforms like TikTok and the streaming service Dropout. This reflects a strategic shift towards recruiting talent with established online followings, aiming to connect with younger audiences familiar with short-form digital comedy.</p>

          <p>A new documentary, "The President and the Dragon," chronicles former President Jimmy Carter's determined, multi-decade effort to eradicate Guinea worm disease. When Carter began his mission in 1986, there were an estimated 3.5 million cases across Asia and Africa; by 2024, that number had been reduced to just 14. The film highlights how this remarkable public health achievement was accomplished not with vaccines, but through education, clean water initiatives, and the tireless work of local volunteers on the ground, fulfilling Carter's post-presidential legacy.</p>
