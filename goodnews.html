        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Darren Aronofsky's new film, "Caught Stealing," adapted from Charlie Huston's novel, is reviewed as a bruising and energetic crime caper set in 1998 New York City. Austin Butler stars as Hank Thompson, a former baseball player who inadvertently gets entangled with various criminal factions after agreeing to watch a cat, leading to a violent and chaotic pursuit. The article praises Aronofsky's affectionate portrayal of a grimy, pre-millennial New York and the film's vibrant soundtrack. It highlights Butler's performance as a self-loathing protagonist grappling with squandered potential, emphasizing the director's recurring thematic interest in characters at risk of failing to achieve greatness.</p>

          <p>Chinese retail stock traders are actively participating in a substantial bull run, with some investors reporting over 30% returns this year and anticipating further gains into early next year. This market optimism is largely driven by government commitments to stabilize stocks within a challenging economic environment, aiming to generate a "wealth effect" that encourages increased consumption. Investors, such as Shanghai software engineer Jacky Jia, are strategically concentrating their equity exposure in high-beta stocks across new-consumer, consumer-electronics, software, and hardware companies. This trend underscores a growing confidence among individual investors in China's equity market, despite broader economic uncertainties, as they eye continued liquidity for future gains.

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $950 million for Saturday night's drawing, after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's roughly $850 million grand prize. This makes the current jackpot the game's sixth-largest ever, with an estimated cash value of $428.9 million before taxes. Powerball officials note that ticket sales have doubled in the past week, contributing significantly to the expanding prize pool and supporting various good causes in communities. A single jackpot winner would have the choice of a lump sum payment or an annuity consisting of one immediate payment followed by 29 annual payments that increase by 5% each year. The odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets displayed mixed trading results on Thursday as investors processed the Bank of Korea's decision to keep its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting. South Korea's Kospi saw a modest gain while the small-cap Kosdaq declined, and the South Korean won strengthened against the dollar. Japan's Nikkei 225 and Topix also registered slight increases, contrasting with a flat performance from Australia's S&P/ASX 200. The article highlighted Lynas Rare Earths' plan to raise A$750 million and Qantas's shares reaching a record high after beating earnings estimates. Conversely, India's Nifty 50 started lower following new U.S. tariffs, which Barclays warned would make growth risks for the Indian economy "more real." (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>South Korea's central bank kept its policy rate unchanged at 2.5% for the second consecutive meeting, primarily to further assess housing prices in the capital and manage household debt. While noting stable inflation and "modest improvement" in economic growth, the Bank of Korea still upgraded its inflation forecast for 2025 to 2% and its GDP growth forecast to 0.9%. The article highlights expectations for a "modest recovery" in domestic demand, driven by a supplementary budget and improved consumer sentiment. However, the central bank cautioned that exports are likely to gradually slow as the impacts of U.S. tariffs expand, despite recent agreements from South Korean companies to invest billions in the U.S. in exchange for lowered tariffs.

          <h2>Robot Rabbits Deployed in Florida Everglades to Combat Invasive Pythons</h2>

          <p>Florida is deploying robot rabbits as the latest innovative tool in the ongoing battle to control invasive Burmese pythons in the Everglades. These robotic lures, which mimic marsh rabbits by emitting heat, smell, and natural movements, are designed to attract the highly camouflaged snakes for removal. The initiative, a collaboration between the South Florida Water Management District and University of Florida researchers, aims to address the pythons' devastating impact on native species, which have seen a 95% reduction in small mammals in Everglades National Park. Each solar-powered robot costs about $4,000 and is monitored remotely, with initial results showing cause for optimism in this detection strategy.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani delivered an ace-like pitching performance for the Dodgers, throwing five innings of one-run ball with nine strikeouts in their 5-1 win over the Cincinnati Reds, completing a sweep. This marked a significant breakthrough for Ohtani, who had been slowly building up his arm after his second Tommy John surgery and struggled to complete five innings in previous starts. He achieved this by adopting a new, more unpredictable pitching strategy, utilizing a wider array of his seven offerings instead of relying primarily on fastballs and sweepers. His ability to work deep into the game could be crucial for his role in the postseason, showcasing his return to top form.</p>

          <p>USC has extended a multi-year offer to Notre Dame to continue their historic football rivalry, following significant public uproar over its potential termination. USC athletic director Jennifer Cohen expressed strong optimism for reaching a deal "very soon," noting the new offer better accommodates Notre Dame's preference for a long-term commitment beyond just 2026. Previously, USC was reluctant due to uncertainties surrounding the College Football Playoff format and the new demands of its Big Ten travel schedule. The primary remaining sticking point is the game's date, as USC seeks to move the matchup to September to better balance its schedule, while Notre Dame has little incentive to shift the traditional October game.</p>

          <p>Cardi B's defense in a civil lawsuit alleging assault received a boost from witness testimony in a Beverly Hills court. The rapper, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almánzar, is being sued by a security guard, Emani Ellis, over a 2018 incident. A receptionist and the obstetrician testified they saw Ellis initiate physical contact and cause an injury to the receptionist, but never saw Cardi B strike Ellis. Cardi B herself denied touching, scratching, or spitting on Ellis, whom she believed was recording her. The rapper argued she was pregnant and smaller than the guard, making a physical confrontation unlikely, as the defense concluded its presentation.</p>

The consortium recently acquired four logistics assets from CapitaLand Ascendas Reit for S$306 million, which are expected to be part of the new REIT's asset composition.

          <p>Nvidia's shares fell in extended trading despite delivering better-than-expected quarterly results, as a slight miss in its crucial data center segment and a robust but not overwhelmingly positive outlook disappointed some investors. The company reported a 56% year-over-year revenue growth to $46.7 billion and adjusted EPS of $1.05, also announcing a $6 billion increase to its share repurchase authorization. CEO Jensen Huang expressed confidence in continued record-breaking years, citing massive capital expenditures by cloud providers and a projected $3-4 trillion AI infrastructure spend by decade-end. Nvidia's rapid innovation, with new chips like GB300 and Rubin, positions it strongly to capitalize on the AI revolution, despite the market's high expectations. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>All NATO member states are projected to meet the alliance's long-standing defense spending target of 2% of GDP this year, a significant increase driven by Russia's invasion of Ukraine and demands from US President Donald Trump. Previously lagging countries like Spain, Italy, and Belgium have now reached this benchmark. However, only three members—Poland (4.48%), Lithuania (4%), and Latvia (3.73%)—are currently meeting the new, higher target of 3.5% of GDP agreed upon in The Hague. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte welcomed the increased spending but emphasized the need to convert these funds into genuine military capability, stressing that "deterrence doesn't come from 5%; deterrence comes from the capability to fight potential enemies."</p>
