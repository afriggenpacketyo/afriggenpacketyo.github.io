          <p>Ashley Kaye, 36, sold her childhood home in Wisconsin to live and travel in a truck she renovated for $50,000, stating that she doesn't have a single regret.

She spent three years traveling during the pandemic before selling the house for $320,000. Kaye purchased a Toyota Tacoma truck for $42,934 and spent over $50,000 on renovations to make it livable, and has since traveled to over 20 countries. Kaye now lives permanently in South Dakota, as it allows for permanent residence without requiring a physical presence, and does not plan on moving back to the United States. </p>

The camera angle allows scientists to observe dust and water ice cloud layers, enabling them to observe changes over the course of seasons. The image provides new clues to how Mars' atmosphere evolves over time. Odyssey, launched in 2001, is the longest-running spacecraft orbiting another planet. </p>

          <p>Cardiologist Dr. Andrew Freeman recommends oatmeal as a go-to breakfast for maintaining a healthy heart. He suggests preparing oatmeal with water instead of milk or butter to keep it lower in calories and adding berries, flax seeds, and walnuts for added fiber and health benefits. Oatmeal is high in minerals and vitamins, containing dietary fiber and beta-glucan, which helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels and lower blood glucose levels. Eating oatmeal for breakfast can reduce feelings of hunger and keep you feeling fuller throughout the day. </p>
