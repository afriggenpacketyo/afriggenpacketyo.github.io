          <p>Marco Rubio has become the head of four government bodies, including Secretary of State, acting administrator of U.S.A.I.D., acting archivist for the National Archives, and interim national security advisor. This unprecedented accumulation of titles raises concerns about his ability to effectively manage all responsibilities, especially given President Trump's unconventional governance style. While supporters cite Trump's trust in Rubio and his relationship with chief of staff Susie Wiles, critics question potential conflicts of interest and practical challenges in fulfilling all duties. The article also mentions historical precedents, such as Henry Kissinger holding two similar roles, and notes the controversy surrounding Rubio's appointments, particularly the firing of the head archivist. The article highlights the debate around Rubio's expanded influence and its implications for the administration's effectiveness.</p>

Inspired by Monica L. Miller's book on Black Dandyism, the exhibition will examine how tailoring has shaped Black identities and challenged social hierarchies. The event will be co-chaired by figures like Colman Domingo, Lewis Hamilton, and Pharrell Williams, with a host committee including Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. The article also revisits iconic Met Gala moments from past years, such as Rihanna's papal-inspired ensemble and Doja Cat's feline transformation.

          <p>The Secure 2.0 Act brings a significant change to 401(k) catch-up contributions in 2025, allowing workers aged 60 to 63 to contribute up to $11,250, an increase from the standard $7,500 for those 50 and older. This "super funding" opportunity aims to help older investors boost their retirement savings. However, some retirement plans may not have added this feature, and many workers may not be able to afford to maximize their contributions. Financial experts emphasize the higher catch-up as a valuable tool, especially for higher earners seeking tax deductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Marco Rubio's appointment as US national security adviser, in addition to his role as secretary of state, could potentially simplify communications with Beijing despite his hawkish views on China. As the first secretary of state since Henry Kissinger to hold both positions, Rubio becomes a direct counterpart to China's Wang Yi. The appointment follows Michael Waltz's departure as national security adviser. While Rubio has been known for his tough stance on Russia, China, and Iran, he has recently shifted his focus to China's trade practices.</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has dropped plans to introduce a new misogyny law before next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to address complexities arising from a recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman. Instead, the government will amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. Plans to end conversion therapy have also been shelved, with the government urging a UK-wide solution. Critics argue the move is a way to avoid difficult debates around gender politics.</p>

          <p>TikTok has been fined 530 million euros ($600 million) for violating the European Union's data privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation.

This ruling adds to the challenges faced by TikTok's Chinese owner, ByteDance, amidst US efforts to force a sale or ban the platform. TikTok plans to appeal the decision, arguing that it complies with EU laws and has invested heavily in data protection measures.</p>

The $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress acts. While Trump previously enacted the $10,000 SALT cap, he has since expressed support for reform. Lawmakers are considering various updates, including a complete repeal or a higher deduction limit.

          <p>American cities, particularly in California, are increasingly adopting tiny homes and stricter laws to address homelessness, following a Supreme Court ruling that allows cities to enforce anti-camping bans. These cities are expanding "interim housing" options, like tiny house shelters and motel rooms, to move people more quickly off the street. Critics worry this creates a two-tiered housing system, but officials see it as a faster and cheaper solution than permanent supportive housing. This approach is gaining traction nationally, with discussions around using Housing Choice Vouchers to fund interim housing.</p>
