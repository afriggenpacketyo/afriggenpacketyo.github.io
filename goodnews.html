          <p>CoreWeave, an AI infrastructure provider, announced strong first-quarter earnings, surpassing revenue expectations with a 420% increase compared to the previous year. The company's net loss widened due to stock-based compensation costs related to its recent IPO. Management forecasts revenue between $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion for 2025, fueled by significant capital expenditures, including a five-year deal with OpenAI worth up to $11.9 billion. Despite some initial investor skepticism regarding the company's metrics, CoreWeave's CEO emphasized the influx of new clients and the diversification of its business beyond major cloud providers like Amazon.
