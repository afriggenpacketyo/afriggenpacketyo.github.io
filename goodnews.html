          <p>The Royal New Zealand Air Force successfully completed a challenging medical evacuation, rescuing three American staff members from the McMurdo Station in Antarctica. The U.S. National Science Foundation requested the mission as the individuals required medical care unavailable on-site, with one needing urgent attention. The nearly 20-hour round-trip flight was described as high-risk, conducted in total darkness and extreme cold, requiring a specially prepared ice runway. U.S. officials praised the "flawless" operation, highlighting the skill of the New Zealand crew in one of the world's most unforgiving environments.</p>

          <p>Following pressure from the Trump administration regarding tariffs, Apple has committed to investing an additional $100 billion in its U.S. manufacturing and supply chain over the next four years. This brings the company's total domestic investment pledge to $600 billion. The announcement was made at the White House, where President Trump praised the move as a step toward ensuring iPhones sold in America are also made in America. CEO Tim Cook stated the investment will support U.S. companies that produce components for Apple products, though final assembly of devices like the iPhone is expected to remain overseas for now.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government has unveiled plans for a major crackdown on the non-surgical cosmetics industry to protect consumers from "dodgy" practitioners. Under the new proposals, clinics will require a special license to offer procedures such as Botox and dermal fillers, ensuring they meet strict safety and training standards. The most high-risk treatments, like non-surgical Brazilian butt lifts (BBLs), will be restricted to qualified health professionals only. The move, which follows growing concern over injuries and even deaths from unregulated procedures, has been welcomed by industry safety advocates, though it may take several years to fully implement.</p>

          <p>The arrival of South Korean soccer superstar Son Heung-min at Los Angeles FC is being hailed as a landmark moment for the club and Major League Soccer. His transfer from Tottenham Hotspur for a record MLS fee of a reported $26 million is expected to have a massive impact both on and off the field. Beyond his world-class attacking skills, Son's immense popularity in Asia provides LAFC with an unprecedented opportunity to expand its global brand, similar to the effect other international stars have had. The move is seen as a strategic building block to elevate the club's international profile and connect with Los Angeles's large Korean community.</p>

          <p>The head of the UK's university admissions service, Ucas, predicts that a record number of 18-year-old students will secure their first-choice university spot this year, even if they narrowly miss their required grades. Dr. Jo Saxton stated that universities are keen to enroll domestic students due to uncertainty surrounding international student numbers, which have recently fallen. This reliance on UK undergraduates for financial stability means institutions will likely show more flexibility during the admissions process. The trend comes as tuition fees for students in England and Wales are set to rise for the first time since 2017.</p>

          <p>Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani showcased his rare two-way talent, delivering his best pitching performance of the season and hitting a home run in the same game against the St. Louis Cardinals. Ohtani pitched four impressive innings, allowing only one run while striking out eight, and also hit his 39th homer of the year. Despite his "Ruthian" efforts, the team's bullpen was unable to hold the lead, ultimately resulting in a 5-3 loss for the Dodgers. The performance highlighted the unique challenge and value Ohtani brings, though it also underscored the team's recent struggles to synchronize its efforts and secure wins.</p>

          <p>Financial markets are anticipating that the Bank of England will cut its main interest rate on Thursday, potentially lowering the cost of borrowing to its lowest point in over two years. A reduction from 4.25% to 4% would be the fifth cut since last August and could provide relief for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages. However, the move would also mean lower returns for savers. The decision comes as the UK economy shows signs of stagnation and the labor market appears to be cooling, even as inflation remains above the Bank's 2% target. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Archaeologists have found new evidence indicating that some people returned to live in Pompeii after its catastrophic destruction by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79. Research suggests that survivors who could not afford to relocate, possibly joined by others, established a precarious settlement among the ruins. These inhabitants are thought to have lived in the upper floors of buried homes, using the lower levels as cellars and salvaging valuable materials from the devastated city. This informal reoccupation, which lacked the infrastructure of a Roman city, may have continued until the 5th century, adding a new chapter to the site's history.</p>
