          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin held what Modi described as an "insightful" meeting on the sidelines of the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation summit in China. The friendly exchange, which included a shared car ride, is viewed as a signal of their strong bilateral relationship. This meeting occurs as India faces significant U.S. tariffs, imposed by President Trump as a penalty for India's continued purchase of Russian oil and weapons. Despite the economic pressure from Washington, India has shown no intention of altering its strategic partnerships.</p>

          <p>European Ryder Cup captain Luke Donald has announced his six wildcard selections, completing the 12-man team that will defend the trophy at Bethpage in the United States. The picks include Shane Lowry, Viktor Hovland, and Jon Rahm, resulting in a team with 11 of the 12 players who secured victory in Rome two years ago. Donald warned against expecting a simple repeat of their previous strategy, emphasizing that playing on American soil presents a different challenge that will require new tactics. He also urged his players to embrace the anticipated raucous New York crowd rather than be intimidated by it.</p>

          <p>Liverpool has agreed to a deal with Crystal Palace for the transfer of England center-back Marc Guehi, pending final ratification from the selling club. The 25-year-old defender is set to undergo a medical and sign a long-term contract after the clubs settled on a transfer fee. The move is part of a significant spending spree for Liverpool, aimed at strengthening their defense after conceding multiple goals early in the season. Guehi's transfer marks a key acquisition for the Premier League champions, who are looking to solidify their backline for domestic and European competitions.</p>

          <p>Renowned Canadian author Margaret Atwood has written a satirical short story to criticize a new book ban policy in the province of Alberta. The policy, which orders school libraries to remove materials with "explicit sexual content," has led to the removal of Atwood's own celebrated novel, "The Handmaid's Tale," from some schools. Her new story mockingly describes perfectly chaste characters to highlight the absurdity of the censorship. This move is part of a broader trend of book challenges, originating in the U.S., that is now impacting Canadian schools and drawing criticism from literary figures.</p>

          <p>European stock markets saw gains, largely driven by a surge in the defense sector following a significant corporate announcement. The U.K. government revealed a £10 billion deal for Norway to purchase British-made warships, which will be constructed by BAE Systems, causing its shares and those of other defense firms to rise. Additionally, the health-care sector experienced a lift after Danish pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk released positive trial data for its weight-loss drug, Wegovy, suggesting superior heart disease risk reduction compared to rivals.

          <h2>Study Reveals Human Impact on Animal Sizes Diverged in Middle Ages</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-01 13:05:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by researchers at the University of Montpellier has found that human activities began to have a divergent effect on the body sizes of wild and domestic animals during the Middle Ages. While domesticated species like sheep and chickens grew larger due to selective breeding, wild species such as foxes and deer became smaller. Scientists attribute the shrinking of wild animals to habitat fragmentation from human settlements and intensified hunting practices. This research, based on the analysis of over 225,000 animal bones from southern France, highlights the profound and lasting impact of human civilization on the natural world.</p>

Khelif has filed an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport, seeking to be declared eligible for the upcoming World Boxing Championships without submitting to the test. Her case highlights the ongoing and complex discussions surrounding gender verification policies in international sports and the governing bodies that enforce them.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>ScotRail, the government-owned railway operator in Scotland, has scrapped higher-priced peak-time tickets in a move aimed at simplifying fares and encouraging more passengers to use the train. The decision reflects changes in travel patterns since the pandemic, with commuter rush hours being less congested than before. While passengers have welcomed the prospect of cheaper travel, with some key return ticket prices being halved, experts are divided on the potential long-term effects. The initiative raises questions about whether the rest of the UK could adopt a similar model, though concerns remain about potential overcrowding and overall revenue impacts.</p>

          <p>After fronting the band Sublime with Rome for 15 years, singer and guitarist Rome Ramirez is embarking on a solo career. The 37-year-old artist, who joined the iconic band's remaining members in 2009, is now releasing his debut EP, "Gemini," which showcases his signature blend of West Coast reggae, hip-hop, and soul. Ramirez explains that the band had started to feel more like a job, and the pandemic provided him the time to write personal music that didn't fit the group's format. His new single, "Slow & Easy," reunites him with the Dirty Heads, with whom he first collaborated over a decade ago.</p>

          <p>A new documentary film, "The Haydn Expedition," highlights the unique democratic structure of The Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen (DKB), a world-renowned German orchestra. Founded by music students in 1980, the DKB operates on a grassroots model where all 41 musicians have a say in key artistic and operational decisions, from repertoire selection to financial management. This collaborative approach, once compared to a hippie commune, is credited with fostering deep personal investment from its members and driving the ensemble's artistic excellence. The film connects this ethos to the democratic ideals present in the music of composer Joseph Haydn.</p>
