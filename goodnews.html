          <h2>Study Suggests Venice's Iconic Winged Lion Statue May Have Originated in Tang Dynasty China</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-04 04:01:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study by Italian researchers proposes that the iconic bronze statue of the winged Lion of St. Mark in Venice may have originated as a tomb guardian in Tang dynasty China. The research, published in the journal Antiquity, points to stylistic similarities with Chinese mythical beasts and uses lead isotope testing to trace the copper to ore sources in the Lower Yangtze River basin. The researchers speculate that the 2.8-tonne statue could have been transported to Venice by the father and uncle of explorer Marco Polo before being altered. This theory challenges the long-held beliefs about the origins of one of Venice's most important symbols.</p>

          <p>The upcoming film "The Smashing Machine," starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, is based on the tumultuous life of MMA fighter Mark Kerr, whose career and struggles with addiction were first captured in a 2002 documentary of the same name. Johnson, who met Kerr in 1997, has long been interested in telling his story, which chronicles Kerr's rise as the world's top heavyweight fighter and his subsequent fall due to opioid addiction. The film, directed by Benny Safdie, has been a passion project for Johnson and represents a second chance at notoriety for Kerr, who has been sober since 2018 and is actively involved in the film's promotion.</p>

          <p>Kilian Jornet, widely regarded as the greatest mountain athlete of all time, has finished his "States of Elevation" project, climbing the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous U.S. entirely under his own power. Over 31 days, he cycled over 3,000 miles between mountain ranges in six states and ran up each peak, an effort equivalent to a daily marathon and Tour de France stage. The project was not about setting records but about exploring a new landscape and creating what Jornet calls "the most aesthetic line" through the American West. The journey showcased his unique blend of artistry, endurance, and deep respect for the natural world.</p>

          <p>An article details several surprising facts about the Nobel Prize, shedding light on its complex and sometimes controversial history. Among the facts are the Curie family's five-prize dynasty and Albert Einstein's pre-win promise to give his prize money to his ex-wife. It also notes that Einstein did not win for his theory of relativity, and that there is no prize for mathematics due to Alfred Nobel's focus on fields "useful for humanity." The list also highlights overlooked female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin, and instances where prizes were awarded for science that was later debunked.</p>

          <p>Sanae Takaichi has been elected as the new leader of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), setting her up to become the country's first female prime minister. A 64-year-old staunch conservative and protégé of the late Shinzo Abe, Takaichi is known for her hawkish security stance and opposition to progressive social policies like same-sex marriage. She faces the immediate challenges of a sluggish economy, uniting a fractured party after recent election losses, and navigating a complex relationship with the U.S. Her leadership is expected to appeal to the party's right-wing base but may struggle to gain wider popular support.</p>

          <p>With Sunderland returning to the Premier League, many are recalling the 1998 BBC documentary "Premier Passions," which gave viewers an unprecedented, raw look into the club's dramatic 1996-97 season. The series famously captured manager Peter Reid's expletive-filled team talks and documented the club's move from its historic Roker Park to the new Stadium of Light. The fly-on-the-wall production offered a candid view of the pressures of top-flight football and the commercial transformation of the game. Despite ending in relegation, the series is remembered fondly for its honesty and for helping to grow the club's profile and fanbase.</p>

          <p>The first supermoon of 2025, known as the Harvest Moon, is set to appear on the night of October 7th. This event will kick off a series of three straight supermoons, with the next two occurring in November and December. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter than other full moons. This year's Harvest Moon is the one closest to the autumn equinox, providing extra evening light.</p>
