        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The construction of the new White House ballroom is being partially funded by a $22 million contribution from Alphabet, Google's parent company, as part of a legal settlement with former President Trump over his ban from YouTube. This amount covers nearly 10% of the project's estimated $250 million cost. While Trump has stated the project will be privately funded, the full list of donors remains unclear, though corporations like Lockheed Martin have confirmed their involvement. The funding details emerge amid public questions and controversy surrounding the demolition of the historic East Wing for the project.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Public tours of the White House have been suspended for approximately two months due to the demolition of parts of the East Wing for a new ballroom project. The traditional tour route, which started in the East Wing, is currently impassable, preventing public access. White House officials have indicated that they expect to establish an updated tour route in the coming days, potentially allowing for the resumption of public visits and other events like Halloween celebrations. This construction has also temporarily displaced several White House offices, including that of the first lady, to other locations within the executive complex.</p>

          <p>Four men who were arrested for projecting an image of Donald Trump and Jeffrey Epstein onto Windsor Castle during the president's UK visit will not face charges. The Thames Valley Police announced that their investigation has concluded and no further action will be taken against the individuals. The men were initially arrested on suspicion of public nuisance and malicious communications. A political campaign group named Led By Donkeys claimed responsibility for the nine-minute projection, calling the arrests a "ridiculous overreaction" intended to prevent embarrassment for the visiting U.S. president, who was staying at the castle for a state banquet.</p>

          <p>General Motors has unveiled a roadmap for new in-vehicle software initiatives, aiming to integrate a conversational AI assistant from Google by next year and an advanced 'eyes-off' driving system by 2028. The Google Gemini AI is intended to create a more natural interaction between the driver and the vehicle. The new driver-assistance system, slated to debut in the Cadillac Escalade IQ, will allow for hands-free and eyes-off operation under certain conditions, utilizing lidar technology for enhanced environmental sensing. These announcements are part of GM's broader strategy to transform its vehicles into intelligent assistants and advance its position in autonomous technology.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to continue cutting interest rates, many consumers with high credit card debt are facing a strategic decision. While lower Fed rates could eventually offer some relief, experts caution that these cuts are incremental and may not significantly impact the high interest rates on credit cards, which are also influenced by the prime rate. Given that interest continues to compound daily, waiting for potential minor rate adjustments may be less effective than pursuing immediate debt relief options. Borrowers are encouraged to consider strategies like debt forgiveness or consolidation programs to manage their balances proactively. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, acclaimed documentarian Ken Burns explored the dual narratives of the American Revolution, acknowledging both its triumphant ideals and its tragic consequences. He discussed his new film series, which delves into the event's complexities, including its nature as a bloody civil war and its devastating impact on Indigenous and enslaved populations. Burns emphasized that acknowledging the hypocrisy of figures like Washington and Jefferson does not diminish the power of the revolutionary ideas they championed. He argues for a nuanced historical understanding that embraces these contradictions, viewing the Revolution as a pivotal, world-altering event that continues to shape contemporary American identity.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-22 14:55:29 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prospective homebuyers are currently weighing the pros and cons of locking in a mortgage rate versus waiting for anticipated further cuts from the Federal Reserve. Locking a rate now provides certainty and protection against potential market volatility, allowing for confident budgeting and house hunting. However, with a high probability of additional Fed rate cuts in the near future, waiting could lead to securing a lower rate and greater long-term savings. The decision is complex, as delaying is risky and unlocking a rate often incurs a fee, making it a critical strategic choice for borrowers in the current economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The CEO of Western Alliance stated that a case of alleged loan fraud that recently triggered a selloff in regional bank stocks is believed to be an isolated incident. The bank had set aside $30 million in reserves for a $98 million loan to the Cantor Group, whom it is now suing for fraud. Following the incident, the bank reviewed its entire note finance portfolio and found no other irregularities, helping to calm market fears. While the reassurance provided a temporary boost to regional bank stocks, analysts suggest that investor confidence has been shaken, potentially capping share gains for the sector in the foreseeable future.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles singer-songwriter Sophia James successfully engineered a viral social media trend known as "Group 7" as an experiment to promote her new single. By posting a series of seven videos and labeling them as different groups, she aimed to "bully the algorithm" and see which one would gain the most traction. The video for "Group 7" exploded in popularity, attracting millions of likes and engagement from celebrities and major brands, turning the arbitrary group into a desirable online club. Experts note her success came from gamifying the platform's engagement metrics and tapping into TikTok's participatory nature, effectively creating a "Harry Potter sorting hat" for users.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Tesla is scheduled to release its third-quarter financial results, with analysts anticipating a return to year-over-year revenue growth after two consecutive quarters of decline. The company's performance was likely impacted by higher tariff costs and the expiration of federal EV tax credits, which had previously pulled sales forward. Despite reporting a record number of vehicle deliveries for the quarter, total deliveries for the year remain down compared to the same period in 2024. Investors will be closely watching for updates on the company's Robotaxi service, new lower-cost models, and its performance in the competitive European market. (not investment advice)</p>
