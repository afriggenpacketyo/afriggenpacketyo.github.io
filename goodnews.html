          <p>Daniel Levy, the longest-serving chairman in the Premier League, has stepped down from his role as executive chairman of Tottenham Hotspur after nearly 25 years. The decision was reportedly made by the club's ownership group, the Tavistock Group, amid a desire for greater and more consistent sporting success despite significant off-pitch achievements. During his tenure, Levy oversaw the construction of a new billion-pound stadium and maintained the club's financial stability, but often faced criticism from fans over a lack of trophies. Peter Charrington will assume the new role of non-executive chairman as the club enters a new era of leadership.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Transportation has officially abandoned a proposed regulation that would have mandated airlines to provide cash compensation to passengers for significant flight delays or cancellations. This rule, introduced under the Biden administration, faced strong opposition from the airline industry, which argued it would lead to higher ticket prices and operational burdens. Airline trade groups have praised the decision to shelve the proposal, which would have required payments for disruptions within a carrier's control. The move aligns with a broader agenda of deregulation favored by the current administration.</p>

The collaboration is designed to offer wealth and retirement funds that provide individual investors and financial advisors with greater access to private markets. This move comes as T.

          <p>Quantinuum, the quantum computing company majority-owned by Honeywell, has raised an additional $600 million in funding, doubling its valuation to approximately $10 billion. This successful funding round, which included new investment from Nvidia's venture arm, is seen as a crucial step toward a planned initial public offering in 2027. A successful IPO would validate Honeywell's long-term investment in the nascent technology, which has yet to generate significant profits but holds immense potential for solving complex computational problems. The move is part of Honeywell's broader strategy to unlock shareholder value through spinoffs and focusing on core businesses. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. government has announced a significant investment in the new HIV prevention drug lenacapavir, hailed by the medical community as a potential game-changer in ending the HIV epidemic. The initiative aims to provide the twice-yearly injection to up to 2 million people in low- and middle-income countries by 2028, focusing on preventing mother-to-child transmission. This move marks a renewed commitment to global HIV prevention, reversing some of the deep funding cuts made under the previous administration that severely impacted programs like PEPFAR. The partnership involves the Global Fund and the drug's manufacturer, Gilead Sciences.</p>

The new capital will be used to expand the platform's capabilities and pursue both domestic and international growth.</p>

          <p>Amazon is ending its 'Prime Invitee' program, a long-standing perk that allowed Prime members to share free, fast shipping benefits with one other adult living at a different address. Effective October 1, the program will be fully replaced by the 'Amazon Family' program, which requires all members sharing benefits to reside at the same address. This policy change mirrors the strategy used by streaming services like Netflix to crack down on account sharing and convert shared users into paying subscribers. While some customers will lose a valuable perk, analysts believe the move is unlikely to cause a significant loss of Prime members for the e-commerce giant.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new bill introduced by Democrats in Congress, titled the 'You Earn It, You Keep it Act,' aims to permanently eliminate all federal income taxes on Social Security benefits. To offset the cost and bolster the program's finances, the legislation would also expand the Social Security payroll tax to apply to all annual earnings above $250,000. This proposal contrasts with a recent Republican law that provides a temporary, more limited tax deduction for seniors. Proponents argue the bill would provide significant relief to retirees, while also extending the solvency of the Social Security trust funds for an additional 24 years.</p>

          <p>A recent federal appeals court ruling that found President Trump unlawfully imposed certain tariffs could lead to American businesses receiving tens of billions of dollars in refunds. The court determined that the president lacked the authority to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for broad, country-based tariffs. While the Trump administration has appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, if the ruling stands, the government may have to return over $70 billion in collected revenue. This creates significant uncertainty for businesses, which must now wait for a final legal decision to know if they will be reimbursed.</p>

This milestone was driven by a rebound in the stock market during the second quarter and consistent savings behaviors from account holders, who largely continued contributions despite market volatility. The average 401(k) balance also hit a record high of $137,800, reflecting the positive market conditions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford's large, gas-powered Expedition SUV is experiencing a surge in popularity, with August sales up nearly 54% year-over-year, marking the model's best sales month in 21 years. This explosive growth for the three-row SUV stands out as a bright spot for the automaker and indicates continued strong consumer demand for traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. The trend provides a notable contrast to the industry-wide push toward electric vehicles, where Ford has taken a more measured approach than some competitors. The most popular Expedition models are higher-end trims, suggesting consumers are still willing to spend on large, feature-rich vehicles.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Residents of Gloucester, Massachusetts, are dealing with a pervasive "rotten egg" smell caused by large quantities of an invasive Japanese seaweed. City officials explained that Hurricane Erin's strong winds and high tides pushed the seaweed, Heterosiphonia japonica, onto shores and into a local estuary. As the seaweed decomposes, it releases a strong, unpleasant odor that residents have compared to gas or sewage. The red seaweed, first recorded on the East Coast in 2009, is known to spread aggressively. Officials have assured the public that the smell is part of a natural process and should dissipate over time.</p>
