          <p>Germany's incoming Interior Minister Alexander Dobrindt announced plans to implement stricter border checks with additional police officers to combat illegal migration. The new coalition government aims to reduce illegal entries by increasing border control measures and entry denials. Dobrindt emphasized the need for order and consistency in managing migration at both national and European levels. The southwestern state of Baden-W√ºrttemberg also plans to tighten border checks, utilizing surveillance drones along the Swiss border, reflecting a broader effort to address migration concerns within Germany.</p>

          <p>Lucy Powell, Leader of the House of Commons, has apologized for describing grooming gangs as a "dog whistle" issue during a heated debate on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions. Her comments, made in response to a question about a Channel 4 documentary on sexual assault gangs, drew criticism from political opponents. Powell clarified that she regards child exploitation with the utmost seriousness and was challenging political point-scoring rather than undermining the issue itself. Health Secretary Wes Streeting stated that politicians sometimes say things in the heat of debate that come across badly and that she is mortified.</p>

          <p>The Salarno family's decades-long battle for justice after the murder of their daughter, Catina, has significantly impacted victims' rights in California. After Catina was murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Steven Burns, the Salarno family fought to keep him behind bars. The experience led them to advocate for victims' rights, resulting in changes to laws that now allow victims to give impact statements at sentencing and ensure children have support when testifying. The family's advocacy has transformed their personal tragedy into a legacy of empowerment for other victims and their families.</p>

          <p>The article discusses the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby food pouches and argues that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. It critiques the notion that mothers are too lazy to cook from scratch, emphasizing the time, labor, and moral judgment involved in intensive mothering. The author suggests that societal pressures and a lack of support for parents, rather than individual choices, are the real issues. She calls for improved paternity leave, workplace creches, and other systemic changes to support good food choices and alleviate the intense pressure on parents.</p>

Eisa now enjoys playing football and attending school, activities his family never thought possible before the treatment. The gene therapy works by modifying the patient's own cells to help them create the missing protein needed to fight infection. Prof. Claire Booth said the success of the trial opens doors for gene therapy to be used in a number of conditions, including cancer and muscular dystrophy.</p>
