The BBC praised Bragg's immense contribution to broadcasting, noting that while he will be missed on the program, he will continue to work with Radio 4 on future projects.</p>

          <p>Department store operator Macy's reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street estimates, causing its stock to jump by 10%. The company attributed its strong performance to successful store revamps and robust sales trends in key areas like denim and women's contemporary apparel. Citing this positive momentum and a healthy inventory position, Macy's raised its full-year earnings and sales guidance, expressing cautious optimism despite potential headwinds from tariffs, which it says are now factored into its outlook.

          <p>For the first time, players in the top two tiers of professional women's soccer in England will be guaranteed a minimum salary, described as a "full-time wage." This new requirement is part of a broader effort by WSL Football, the company overseeing the leagues, to increase professional standards and support players who previously had to juggle part-time jobs. The regulations also mandate enhanced high-performance environments and welfare support, reflecting the rapid growth and increasing investment in the women's game.</p>

          <p>Contrary to a popular narrative that women are happier without spouses or children, a new nationally representative survey indicates that married mothers report the highest levels of happiness. The study found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to lower percentages for unmarried women, married women without children, and unmarried mothers. Researchers suggest that while motherhood presents challenges like feeling overwhelmed, it also provides a profound sense of purpose and meaning that contributes significantly to overall life satisfaction.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-03 06:40:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) experienced a significant surge, attracting over $332 million in net inflows in a single day, while Ethereum-based funds saw outflows of $135 million. This marks a potential reversal of August's trend, where investment flowed heavily into Ethereum products. Analysts suggest this rotation could be driven by historical market patterns, as September has often been a weaker month for Ethereum, and broader macroeconomic caution may be pushing investors back toward Bitcoin, which is often viewed as a safer benchmark crypto asset.

          <p>China's film market experienced a modest recovery this summer, with box office revenue increasing by 2.76% year-on-year to 11.96 billion yuan (US$5.5 billion). However, this figure remains significantly below the record set in 2023 and pre-pandemic levels, indicating persistent challenges for the industry. Despite a rapid expansion in the number of cinemas, demand has not kept pace, and many big-budget films are struggling to become profitable, with only a few titles surpassing the one billion yuan mark this year.</p>

          <p>After decades of dangerous landslides and costly temporary repairs, the California Department of Transportation is moving forward with a plan to build a $2.1 billion tunnel to bypass Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile stretch of Highway 101. This section of road is the only viable link for the remote community of Crescent City to the rest of the state and is built atop four active landslides. The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel, which would be the longest in California, is seen as a permanent solution to a problem that has claimed lives and repeatedly severed a critical economic lifeline.</p>

          <p>This article examines the long history of extremely wealthy, politically inexperienced candidates failing to win elections for governor or U.S. Senator in California. Despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars of their personal fortunes, figures like Meg Whitman and Carly Fiorina were unable to secure victory. Political strategists suggest that while money provides access, voters are often suspicious of ultra-rich candidates, perceiving an "empathy gap" and a sense of entitlement that makes it difficult for them to connect with the lives and concerns of average citizens.</p>

          <p>Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry reflects on her career of reinvention and creative risk-taking as the band prepares to release a new album, "High Noon," early next year. In a recent interview, she discussed her DIY approach to fashion, which has inspired a new clothing line, and her philosophy of doing what might be considered "wrong" to create authentic art. Harry emphasized that the band's motivation remains a search for soul and passion, which she believes distinguishes human creativity from artificial intelligence and continues to define Blondie's genre-blending sound.</p>

          <p>Independent concert promoter Sid the Cat is opening a new 500-capacity, all-ages music venue in a restored historic elementary school auditorium in South Pasadena. The venue aims to become a new hub for the local arts community, which was deeply affected by the recent Eaton fire that destroyed a nearby neighborhood popular with musicians. The self-funded project is seen as a sign of resilience, providing a permanent, artist-friendly home for a promoter that has organized shows for acts like Fiona Apple and Bright Eyes across Los Angeles for over a decade.</p>

          <p>Fox News host Greg Gutfeld reflects on the success of his late-night show, "Gutfeld!," which has become the most-watched program in its time slot by drawing over 3 million viewers nightly. He attributes his show's popularity to its unpredictable and irreverent humor, a style he honed on his earlier program, "Red Eye." Gutfeld argues that mainstream late-night shows alienated a large portion of the country by becoming too politically one-sided, creating an opportunity for a program that prioritizes having fun regardless of the political climate.</p>

          <p>The personal wardrobe of the late Venezuelan-born painter Luchita Hurtado, crafted entirely by her own hands, is being shared publicly for the first time. For nearly 80 years, Hurtado designed and wore a utilitarian uniform, typically a boxy shirt with four pockets, which she adapted with various fabrics and details. This practice began when she was dissatisfied with available maternity clothes and grew into a lifelong expression of her intentional lifestyle, where she manifested her own reality in her art, her journals, and the very clothes she wore.</p>

          <p>While ambitions for human settlement on Mars are growing, significant biological challenges must be overcome, as the human body is not ready for long-duration space travel. The nascent field of space medicine is working to address issues like radiation exposure, muscle loss, and psychological stress, which currently disqualify most people from becoming astronauts. Researchers are studying the effects of microgravity on human health to develop countermeasures, with the goal of making space travel safer and more accessible, which could in turn lead to medical breakthroughs for diseases on Earth.</p>

          <p>As freshwater scarcity increases globally, reliance on desalination is growing, but the process has significant environmental impacts, primarily from the discharge of highly salty, chemical-laden brine. This article explores emerging solutions to make the technology more sustainable. These include advanced dilution and dispersal techniques to protect marine ecosystems, as well as innovative projects that treat brine as a resource by mining it for valuable minerals like lithium and magnesium. Additionally, powering new plants with renewable energy could further reduce their overall environmental footprint.</p>
