          <p>Iga Swiatek has claimed her first Wimbledon championship, and sixth Grand Slam title overall, after a surprisingly one-sided victory over Amanda Anisimova. Swiatek won the final 6-0 6-0 in just 57 minutes, a dominant performance that underscored her skill on grass, a surface previously considered her weakest. The victory was unexpected for the 24-year-old, who had not reached a tour final in a year and had previously struggled at the All England Club. Swiatek's win marks a remarkable return to form and solidifies her position among the top players in women's tennis.</p>

          <p>FIFA President Gianni Infantino has stated that the 2026 World Cup will make greater use of indoor, air-conditioned stadiums for daytime matches to address concerns about extreme heat. This decision follows criticism regarding player welfare during the current Club World Cup in the U.S., where temperatures have been dangerously high. The plan will leverage covered venues in host cities like Atlanta, Dallas, Houston, and Vancouver to ensure safer conditions for players.

          <p>The U.S. stock market has shown resilience, remaining near all-time highs even as the Trump administration renewed its tariff campaign against major trading partners like the EU, Mexico, and Canada. Despite a slight dip on Friday, major indices held steady, a stark contrast to the panic seen during a similar tariff blitz in April. Analysts suggest investors have become more accustomed to the president's negotiation tactics and are focusing more on long-term economic drivers. Key factors supporting market optimism include deregulation and the continued, largely unfettered growth of the artificial intelligence sector. (not investment advice)</p>
