        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A decade-long study of parents with high-achieving children identifies five strategies that contribute to their children's success. These include fostering optimism, tailoring motivational approaches to each child's unique interests, recognizing learning opportunities in everyday tasks, nurturing a love for knowledge, and motivating with love rather than acting as a coach. The study emphasizes the importance of creating a supportive environment where children feel empowered to pursue their passions. The research also notes a shift in developmental psychology towards fostering a love of learning rather than solely focusing on hard work and grit.</p>

          <p>The National Health Service (NHS) in England plans to expand the use of its app to become the primary method of communication with patients, aiming to save ¬£200 million over three years. The initiative involves sending test results, screening invitations, and appointment reminders directly to smartphones, reducing reliance on traditional letters. Patients without app access will receive text messages and letters as a last resort, and NHS phone lines will be freed up. The government hopes the changes will improve patient access to healthcare management and informed decision-making.</p>

          <p>A case in Whittier, Alaska, highlights the complex issue of citizenship for residents of American Samoa, the only U.S. territory where residents are not automatically granted citizenship. Eleven residents, born in American Samoa, face felony charges for falsely claiming U.S. citizenship when registering or attempting to vote. American Samoans are considered "U.S. nationals," allowing them to hold U.S. passports and serve in the military, but not vote in most U.S. elections. The case has sparked debate over birthright citizenship and the rights of those living in U.S. territories.</p>
