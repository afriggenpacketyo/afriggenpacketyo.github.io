          <p>President Trump and Ukrainian President Zelenskyy held a meeting at the White House, joined by several European leaders, to discuss ending the war with Russia. Trump indicated the U.S. would provide Ukraine with security assistance, suggesting Europe would bear most of the burden but that America would be involved. In a shift from his previous stance, Trump stated that a ceasefire was not a necessary precondition for a peace deal, though European leaders present stressed its importance. The meeting, described as more cordial than their last encounter, also focused on arranging a trilateral summit between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Russian President Putin to facilitate a resolution.</p>

Sam Curran also contributed significantly with three wickets and a run-out. In their chase, despite an early setback, a strong partnership between Jordan Cox (56) and Sam Curran (50 not out) guided the Invincibles to victory with 11 balls remaining, solidifying their lead in the league standings.</p>

This development follows last week's news of TeraWulf signing two 10-year computing deals with AI cloud provider Fluidstack, which significantly boosted its stock price.

          <p>Labor Day, a federal holiday celebrating the achievements of American workers, will be observed on Monday, September 1, 2025. The holiday originated in the late 19th century as a culmination of the labor movement's fight for better working conditions and was signed into law in 1894. While it marks the unofficial end of summer for many, it's important to note what will be open and closed. Most major retailers and grocery stores will operate, though some may have reduced hours, while Costco will be closed. Federal government offices, the U.S. Postal Service, banks, and the stock market will all be closed in observance of the holiday.</p>

          <p>During a White House press availability, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy showcased his comedic timing in an exchange with a reporter who had previously criticized his military-style clothing. Brian Glenn, a reporter for a right-wing outlet, complimented Zelenskyy on his suit, to which President Trump pointed out that Glenn was the one who had attacked his attire before. Zelenskyy quipped back, "I remember that. You’re in the same suit. You see, I changed mine." The lighthearted moment occurred during a high-stakes meeting about the war in Ukraine and drew attention on social media, reminding many of Zelenskyy's background as a comedian before becoming president.</p>

          <p>Texas health officials have declared an end to the state's largest measles outbreak in over three decades, which infected 762 people and resulted in the deaths of two unvaccinated children. The outbreak was declared over after 42 days passed without a new case, a period equivalent to two incubation cycles of the virus. The cluster began in a county with low vaccination rates and spread across the state and into New Mexico. Officials credited a comprehensive response involving testing, vaccination campaigns, and public education for containing the virus but warned that vigilance is still needed due to ongoing outbreaks elsewhere and declining vaccination rates.</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet" offers a modern, feminist reimagining of Shakespeare's classic tragedy, built around the hit songs of producer Max Martin. The show's premise has Shakespeare's wife, Anne, intervening to propose a new ending where Juliet doesn't die but instead travels to Paris to find herself. The production is praised for its witty book by David West Read and its energetic, dance-party atmosphere, successfully integrating pop anthems from artists like Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys. The review highlights standout performances from Rachel Webb as Juliet and Teal Wicks as Anne, celebrating the show as a euphoric and empowering theatrical experience.</p>

          <h2>Understanding Age Considerations When Purchasing Annuities for Retirement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:24:37 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While there are no federal age limits for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often set their own restrictions, typically capping buyers at around 80 to 85 years old. The timing of an annuity purchase is a critical decision that affects costs and payout amounts. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates. Purchasing an immediate annuity closer to retirement age can supplement Social Security, while waiting until one's 70s or 80s can result in higher monthly payments due to shorter life expectancy, though it also carries risks like reduced product availability.</p>

          <p>Hollie Strano, a former longtime meteorologist for WKYC-TV in Cleveland, has started a new role providing morning weather forecasts for Mix 94.1, a radio station in Canton, Ohio. Strano's departure from WKYC in 2024 followed a DUI charge to which she pleaded guilty; she subsequently filed a lawsuit against the station's parent company, alleging her termination was related to her publicly sharing her journey of recovery from alcoholism. In addition to her new radio gig, Strano also provides forecasts for stations in Georgia and Alabama and hosts a podcast titled "Abruptly Authentic," focusing on mental health advocacy and personal stories.</p>
