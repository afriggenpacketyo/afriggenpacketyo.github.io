          <p>China's top engineering institution, the Chinese Academy of Engineering (CAE), has announced a record shortlist of 19 private-sector executives and chief scientists for academicianship. This unprecedented inclusion, with candidates from leading firms like iFlyTek, CATL, and BYD, signals the country's high recognition of private enterprises' innovative capabilities in critical sectors such as artificial intelligence, new energy, and biopharmaceuticals. The CAE, which typically draws members from state-owned entities, is strategically integrating private-sector talent to bolster national innovation. This development underscores China's concerted effort to cultivate a more robust and diverse scientific and technological landscape, aiming to enhance its global competitiveness through advanced innovation.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Regulators are exploring the creation of a knowledge test to grant more investors access to private market assets, such as pre-IPO companies and venture capital, which are currently largely restricted to accredited investors based on wealth. This proposed test, recently advanced by the U.S. House, aims to assess an individual's understanding of the higher risks, limited liquidity, and complex valuations associated with these investments. However, financial experts warn that designing a comprehensive and protective exam is exceedingly difficult, especially since many individuals lack fundamental financial literacy. The discussion underscores the intricate challenge of expanding investment opportunities while simultaneously safeguarding less experienced investors from significant financial losses in these unregulated markets.

          <p>Actor Noel Clarke has lost his libel case against The Guardian, which he sued over a series of 2021 articles alleging sexual misconduct and harassment. The High Court judge dismissed Clarke's claim, affirming that The Guardian successfully defended its stories on the grounds of truth and public interest. The judgment found the articles' meaning to be "substantially true," characterizing Clarke as "not a credible or reliable witness" and rejecting his assertion of an "unlawful conspiracy." This outcome is a significant vindication for investigative journalism and the more than a dozen women who testified about their experiences, underscoring the importance of holding powerful figures accountable.</p>

          <p>India's Supreme Court has modified its previous order concerning Delhi's estimated one million stray dogs, now directing authorities to release non-aggressive, non-rabid strays after they are vaccinated and sterilized. This revision comes after strong protests and legal challenges from animal welfare groups who advocated for more humane and sustainable solutions to the "menace of dog bites" and rabies, which accounts for 36% of global rabies deaths in India. The court also banned feeding strays in public spaces, mandating dedicated areas for this purpose. While the ruling, which also allows for adoption, is largely welcomed by animal welfare advocates, they emphasize the need for clear, scientific criteria to define "aggressive dogs" to prevent arbitrary confinement.</p>

The opening follows CEO Lynsi Snyder's recent public comments about leaving California, which sparked debate but clearly hasn't diminished the brand's appeal. The overwhelming reception in Ridgefield underscores In-N-Out's enduring cultural impact and its successful expansion strategy.</p>

          <p>A recent case of bubonic plague in a South Lake Tahoe resident has prompted experts to clarify the disease's modern threat and prevalence. While most associate "plague" with the devastating Black Death of the 14th century, the bacterium Yersinia pestis continues to cause a small number of cases annually, primarily affecting wild rodents and transmissible to humans via infected fleas. Experts emphasize that although the disease hasn't been eradicated, medical advancements have made it treatable with antibiotics, drastically reducing its fatality if detected early. Public health officials reassure the public that, despite its continued presence, the plague is largely under control and not a top priority for infectious disease experts, provided timely treatment is sought.</p>

          <h2>Newsom's Viral Memes Show Plausible Strategy Against Trump</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Viral memes featuring California Governor Gavin Newsom, including parodies of President Trump's imagery, are being analyzed as a potentially effective political strategy. The article suggests that these audacious and often humorous memes bypass rational thought to target the subconscious, injecting iconography into the public discourse while offering plausible deniability as mere trolling. This approach, mirroring Trump's own use of braggadocio and one-upmanship, aims to position Newsom as a tough, media-savvy fighter, a quality that resonated with voters in the 2016 primary. While Newsom faces challenges like his 'left coast' liberal image and governing record, his willingness to engage in the 'meme wars' could resonate with voters seeking a combative leader.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An article argues that despite President Trump's policies aimed at curtailing electric vehicle (EV) incentives and bolstering fossil fuels, the U.S. market is still moving towards cheaper EV production due to global pressures. While federal tax credits are set to expire and domestic EV sales have seen a slowdown, Ford's recent $5 billion investment in a new EV platform for a $30,000 pickup truck signals a strategic long-term commitment. The piece emphasizes that global markets, particularly the European Union's 2035 ban on gasoline cars and China's EV leadership, compel American automakers to innovate and remain competitive. Ultimately, the article suggests that once EVs achieve cost parity and superior performance, their widespread adoption will become an unstoppable market-driven phenomenon, transcending political opposition.

          <p>China's electricity consumption reached a historic peak in July, surpassing one trillion kilowatt-hours, driven by widespread scorching heatwaves and continued industrial activity. This record-breaking usage, an 8.6% year-on-year increase, is more than double the level recorded a decade ago and is equivalent to the annual electricity consumption of all ASEAN nations combined. The primary industry, encompassing sectors like agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, experienced the most rapid growth in electricity demand. Despite a slight deceleration in overall industrial output compared to June, this surge highlights the immense energy requirements of China's expanding economy and its increasing susceptibility to extreme weather events.</p>
