          <p>Tennis legend Venus Williams, at 45 years old, has been granted a wildcard entry into the US Open, making her the oldest singles competitor at a Grand Slam in 44 years. This marks her return to a major tournament for the first time since the 2023 US Open, following a comeback to the sport in July. Williams' inclusion has sparked some debate, with some arguing it takes a spot from a younger player, while others celebrate the opportunity for an all-time great. Her participation extends her record for home Grand Slam appearances to a remarkable 25th time.</p>

Needing five runs for victory, Clark lofted a delivery from Tymal Mills over the boundary, completing a dramatic turnaround after a tense final set of balls. The Superchargers' run chase had faltered late, with star bowler Jofra Archer taking two quick wickets, leaving the outcome in doubt until the very last moment.

          <p>Tom Dundon, the majority owner of the NHL's Carolina Hurricanes, has reached a tentative agreement to acquire the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers from the estate of the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen. The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the team was recently valued at approximately $3.65 billion. Dundon, a Dallas-based businessman and chairman of Dundon Capital Partners, is also a major investor in professional pickleball. The sale is pending approval from the NBA and would transfer ownership from Jody Allen, who has managed the team since her brother's death in 2018, concluding a long period of speculation about the franchise's future.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Walmart has expanded its employee discount program to include a 10% reduction on nearly all grocery items, such as milk, meat, and frozen foods. The move comes as rising tariffs fuel concerns about higher consumer prices, which the company's own CFO has warned it cannot fully absorb. Previously, the discount applied mainly to fresh produce and general merchandise, with broader food discounts limited to the holiday season. The expanded benefit, effective immediately for its 1.6 million U.S. employees, is a response to staff feedback and could also serve to boost employee spending at Walmart and aid in worker retention.</p>

The service allows customers to order perishable items alongside other products like electronics and apparel in a single cart for delivery within hours.

          <p>The Social Security cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026 is projected to be 2.7%, according to a new estimate from the Senior Citizens League. This potential increase is slightly higher than the 2.5% boost beneficiaries received this year and reflects recent inflation data. The Social Security Administration will make its official announcement in October after analyzing inflation figures from the third quarter. While inflation has remained relatively stable in 2025, some economists express concern that this modest adjustment may not be sufficient if consumer prices rise later in the year due to factors like new tariffs.

          <p>Students across England, Wales, and Northern Ireland are set to receive their A-level, T-level, and BTec results, with grade distributions expected to be similar to last year. This marks a period of stability after several years of fluctuation caused by the pandemic's impact on exams. The head of the university admissions service, Ucas, predicted a record number of 18-year-olds will secure their first-choice university placement, partly because universities are compensating for this cohort having received lower GCSE grades during the post-pandemic grade deflation period. This is also the fourth year of results for the vocational T-level qualifications in England.</p>

          <p>Dale Webster, a Northern California surfer who held a world record for surfing every single day for 14,642 consecutive days, has passed away at the age of 77. His remarkable streak began on September 3, 1975, and ended on October 5, 2015, only when he required surgery for kidney stones. Known as "Daily Dale," he committed to riding at least three waves to the shore each day, regardless of weather, water temperature, or personal health challenges. Webster's extraordinary dedication, which saw him build his life around the daily ritual, made him a celebrated and inspirational figure within the global surfing community.</p>

          <p>U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy has admitted to an "administrative error" after he went fishing with U.S. Vice President JD Vance without possessing the required rod licence. The angling took place at the Chevening House official residence in Kent during a diplomatic meeting. Lammy has since purchased a licence and written to the Environment Agency to notify them of the oversight. While he did not catch any fish, Vance's children reportedly did. Fishing without a licence in England and Wales can result in a fine of up to £2,500, though it is unclear if any penalty will be applied in this case.</p>

          <h2>Market Analysis: Amazon's Grocery Expansion Impacts Sector, But Costco's Model Remains Distinct</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A market analysis from CNBC's Investing Club notes the significant impact of Amazon's expansion of same-day fresh grocery delivery, which caused shares of competitors like Kroger and Albertsons to fall. However, the report argues that warehouse retailer Costco should not be similarly affected, as its business model is based on in-person, bulk-price shopping rather than delivery convenience. The analysis also touches on the recent stock decline of AI company CoreWeave, which rents Nvidia chips, and positive analyst sentiment for Nvidia itself, citing strong demand from China. This article highlights interconnected movements and competitive dynamics within the retail and tech sectors. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has priced its initial public offering at $37 per share, surpassing its expected range and valuing the company at $5.4 billion. The firm, led by former NYSE President Tom Farley, will raise $1.1 billion by offering 30 million shares, an increase from the initially proposed amount, signaling strong investor appetite. Backed by prominent investors like Peter Thiel, Bullish is geared toward institutional clients and also owns the crypto news outlet CoinDesk. The successful pricing comes amid a favorable regulatory environment for crypto under the Trump administration, which has invigorated capital markets for digital asset companies this year.</p>
