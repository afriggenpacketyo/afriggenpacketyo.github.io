          <p>Belarus released opposition leader Sergei Tikhanovsky and over a dozen other political prisoners following an appeal from the White House, signaling potentially improved relations between Belarus and the U.S. The release occurred after a visit from President Trump's special envoy, Keith Kellogg, to Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko. Tikhanovsky's wife, Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, thanked President Trump for brokering the deal, and European politicians welcomed the news. Despite this release, Belarus still holds over 1,000 political prisoners, and the country's human rights record remains a concern. </p>

          <p>A BBC report examines the challenges faced by GP receptionists in England during the daily "8am scramble" for appointments, where they often encounter frustrated and abusive patients. Receptionists at the Tudor House Medical Practice in Nottingham described the intense pressure and verbal abuse they endure while trying to allocate limited same-day appointments. The Labour government has pledged to address this issue by increasing funding and expanding online appointment options. Despite these efforts, the overall situation remains challenging, and receptionists continue to manage high demand and patient frustration. </p>

          <p>The BBC explores the growing trend of Y2K core, characterized by nostalgia for the late 1990s and early 2000s, as exemplified by the pop-punk band South Arcade. Despite not experiencing the era firsthand, younger generations are drawn to the music, fashion, and culture of the time, finding it offers a sense of escapism. Bands like Korn and Linkin Park, who were popular during the Y2K era, have also experienced a resurgence in popularity. The appeal lies in the pre-digital world's emphasis on physical items and a sense of individuality, contrasting with today's minimalist, digitally-driven culture. </p>

          <p>The BBC examines the trend of social media advice on lowering cortisol levels, a stress hormone linked to various health problems. Experts caution against relying on quick fixes like cortisol cocktails and supplements, as they often fail to address the underlying causes of stress. Instead, they recommend addressing the root causes of stress through therapy, mindfulness, and lifestyle changes. Sudden body changes should be checked by a medical professional to rule out underlying physical health problems. </p>
