          <p>A Harris's hawk, nicknamed "Bomber Harris," that had been attacking people in Flamstead, Hertfordshire, has been given a permanent home with a local falconer. The hawk had dive-bombed approximately 50 people over a month, resulting in injuries including one man being hospitalized. Falconer Wayne Housden captured and trained the bird, noting that its behavior was likely due to hormonal or territorial reasons, and he spent about ¬£1,000 building an aviary for it. Housden intends to keep the hawk and hopes to release it in the autumn, and the hawk will also be featured at the Flamstead Scarecrow Festival.</p>

Musk created a video game called Blastar at age 12 and sold it for $500. He also co-founded Zip2 with his brother, which sold for $300 million. In 2022, Musk launched a perfume called Burnt Hair, and Tesla launched its own tequila in 2020. Additionally, Musk founded X.com, which later merged with Confinity to become PayPal, and his personality inspired Robert Downey Jr.'s portrayal of Iron Man.</p>

          <p>A new report from WWF highlights the vital role of UK's saltmarshes as "sinks" that lock away climate-warming greenhouse gases in layers of mud. The charity is advocating for the inclusion of these tidal habitats in the UK's official inventory of carbon emissions and removals. Researchers have installed greenhouse gas monitoring stations on a restored saltmarsh in North-West England, revealing that plants there absorb more carbon dioxide in the summer than they release in winter. The UK has lost about 85% of its saltmarshes since 1860, many of which were drained for agriculture.</p>

          <p>Japan's parliament has begun its first deliberations in 28 years on legislation that would allow married couples to keep different surnames. Despite growing public support, the passage of the bills submitted by opposition parties is unlikely during the current Diet session. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party remains hesitant due to concerns about family cohesion and traditional values. A revision to the Civil Code is needed to enable couples to retain separate family names, with most women currently abandoning their maiden names upon marriage. A recent poll showed that 71% of respondents support the dual family-name system.</p>

These deals often use a "newco structure," combining intellectual property licensing with fundraising via a newly established corporate vehicle. This trend is driven by depressed valuations, making licensing intellectual property an attractive alternative to raising funds by selling shares. CSPC shares surged after announcing talks on licensing development and marketing rights for its drug candidates, potentially worth up to US$5 billion per candidate.</p>
