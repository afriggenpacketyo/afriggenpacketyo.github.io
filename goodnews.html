          <p>As design software company Figma prepares for its initial public offering, financial commentator Jim Cramer has expressed reservations about recommending the stock immediately after it begins trading. While acknowledging Figma's impressive revenue growth, profitability, and strong client base, Cramer is concerned that the IPO is already priced at a high valuation. He warns that if the stock price surges upon its debut, it could become too expensive for investors. Additional concerns include recent weakness in the enterprise software sector and the potential for increased AI spending to negatively impact Figma's profitability in the coming years.

The ceremony will determine the group stage matchups for the expanded 48-team tournament, which is being co-hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico. While not officially confirmed, the Sphere, a massive high-tech entertainment venue, is considered the leading candidate to stage the event.

          <p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently arrested several immigrants with prior criminal convictions, which the agency described as apprehending some of the "worst of the worst." Among those detained was Bou Khathavong, a citizen of Laos and Thailand, who was previously convicted for conspiring to murder a teenager with a baseball bat in Pennsylvania. The Department of Homeland Security highlighted other arrests, including individuals convicted of child sexual assault, drug trafficking, and causing a death in a hit-and-run incident. The agency stated that these actions align with its priority of removing public safety threats from American communities.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is collaborating with major technology companies, including Oracle and Microsoft, to enhance access to health data for older Americans and people with disabilities enrolled in Medicare. The initiative aims to create a modernized system that simplifies the exchange of patient information, giving beneficiaries more control over their own health records. This partnership is being announced on the 60th anniversary of the legislation that established Medicare and Medicaid. The effort follows a public input request from the administration on how to update the digital services offered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, signaling a significant push towards digital health integration.</p>

          <p>While watermelon is a hydrating and nutritious fruit, health experts caution that consuming it in excessive amounts can lead to adverse effects. The article notes that watermelon is high in certain sugars known as FODMAPs, which can cause digestive issues like bloating and gas, particularly for individuals with irritable bowel syndrome. It also contains high levels of tyramine, a naturally occurring amino acid that can trigger migraines in susceptible people. Due to its natural sugar content, individuals with diabetes are advised to moderate their intake to avoid significant impacts on their blood sugar levels. For most people, enjoying watermelon in moderation remains a healthy choice.</p>

          <p>Google executives are pressing employees to integrate artificial intelligence more urgently into their daily workflows to boost productivity and cut costs amid intense competition. At a recent all-hands meeting, CEO Sundar Pichai stated that during this period of extraordinary AI investment, the company must achieve more by driving higher efficiency. The push comes as Google's parent company, Alphabet, plans to increase capital expenditures to $85 billion in 2025 for building out AI infrastructure. The company is providing internal tools and training courses, such as the "AI Savvy Google" site, to help all employees, particularly software engineers, become more adept at using AI to accelerate their work.</p>

          <p>This satirical article from The Atlantic critiques the proposed "Clear Skies Act," a bill sponsored by congressional Republicans aiming to prohibit weather modification techniques like geoengineering and cloud seeding. The author humorously suggests expanding the bill to ban other nonexistent or fantastical weather-influencing phenomena, such as children singing "Rain, rain, go away," the actions of Punxsutawney Phil, and the powers of fictional characters like Thor and Storm. The piece uses absurdity to mock the legislative focus on conspiracy theories rather than addressing actual, scientifically-proven causes of extreme weather, like climate change. The author concludes by sarcastically suggesting a ban on releasing greenhouse gases as something worth trying.</p>

          <p>Paola Clouatre, the Mexican-born wife of a U.S. Marine Corps veteran, has been released from an ICE detention center in Louisiana following intervention from the office of Republican Senator John Kennedy. Clouatre was detained in May during an appointment for her green card application due to an old deportation order issued after her mother missed a court date years ago. After a judge halted the deportation, Senator Kennedy's office requested her release from the Department of Homeland Security. This case highlights instances where Republican lawmakers, who generally support stricter immigration enforcement, have intervened in specific cases involving long-term residents with strong community ties.</p>

          <p>Apple has launched its new Manufacturing Academy in Detroit, a facility offering free workshops on AI and advanced manufacturing to small and medium-sized businesses. The initiative, part of Apple's broader U.S. investment commitment, comes as the company faces increasing pressure from the Trump administration to move more of its production to the United States. President Trump has been vocal about wanting Apple to build iPhones stateside and has threatened tariffs that could impact the company's costs. While Apple has expanded production in countries like India and Vietnam to diversify from China, this Detroit academy represents a domestic investment in manufacturing skills and technology.</p>

          <p>In a significant executive move, Gap's Athleta brand has hired Maggie Gauger, the head of Nike's women's business in North America, as its new CEO. This is a major win for Athleta, which has struggled with declining sales and seen high leadership turnover, but it represents a blow to Nike at a time when it is trying to strengthen its position with female consumers. Gauger, a 20-year Nike veteran, was central to the company's strategy to close its gender gap in the crucial North American market. Her departure adds another layer of transition for Nike as it works to fend off growing competition in the women's athleisure space.</p>

The lawsuit, filed by the advocacy group Jobs to Move America, alleged that Metro's contract with manufacturer Hyundai Rotem violated policies requiring commitments to fair wages and the hiring of disadvantaged workers. Under the settlement, Metro will pay legal fees and modify the $730 million contract to include the required labor provisions. This resolution allows Metro to proceed with its plan to receive the first batch of new rail cars for the D Line extension by 2027.</p>

Growing up listening to both Spanish and English music, Rubio collaborated with Grammy-winning producer Lester Mendez to create a sound she describes as "alternative Mexican California beach rock-meets-mariachi romanticos." The EP's release was briefly postponed in response to recent immigration raids, with Rubio donating a portion of her merchandise sales to an immigrant rights group. She states that at this moment, it is more important than ever to be proud of her heritage and to speak her truth as a first-generation American.</p>
