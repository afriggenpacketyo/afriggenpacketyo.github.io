          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. (CATL), the world's largest electric vehicle battery maker and a key Tesla supplier, is aggressively expanding its global operations, particularly in Europe. Following a successful $5.2 billion IPO in Hong Kong, the company is investing heavily in new factories in Hungary and Spain to counter intense price competition and overcapacity in its domestic Chinese market. CATL also plans to introduce its battery-swapping technology to Europe, a move that could significantly alter the region's EV landscape by addressing issues like charging speed and initial vehicle cost. Analysts believe CATL is uniquely positioned to standardize this technology, further solidifying its market dominance. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Sportswear giant Nike has announced plans to decrease its reliance on Chinese manufacturing in response to US trade policies, which the company estimates could add approximately $1 billion to its costs this year. The company intends to lower the percentage of its US-bound footwear produced in China from 16% to the high single digits by 2026. This strategic shift was revealed as Nike reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, causing its shares to rally. The move comes as the White House navigates ongoing trade negotiations, with a 90-day pause on broader tariffs set to expire soon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United States and China have reached an agreement on a framework for a trade deal, a development confirmed by officials from both nations. While President Trump initially announced a signed deal, both sides later clarified it as a framework to implement a prior consensus reached in Geneva. The agreement appears to center on China increasing its exports of rare earth minerals, which are crucial for high-tech manufacturing, in exchange for the U.S. easing certain restrictive measures. This follows a period of intense trade tensions and punitive tariffs that have negatively impacted both economies, creating pressure to stabilize the relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have identified rocks in Quebec's Nuvvuagittuq Greenstone Belt that could be the oldest ever discovered on Earth, potentially dating back 4.16 billion years. This finding helps settle a long-standing debate, as previous studies yielded conflicting ages for the formation. By using two different dating methods on a new sample, scientists arrived at a consistent age, placing the rocks in the planet's earliest historical period. Studying these primordial rocks offers a rare glimpse into Earth's formative years, providing valuable insights into geological processes and the origins of life, though access to the site is currently restricted by the local Inuit community to prevent damage.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A contentious debate is underway regarding whether to remove the grizzly bear from the Endangered Species Act (ESA) protections, highlighting a paradox in conservation success. After being pushed to the brink of extinction, grizzly populations, particularly in the Greater Yellowstone ecosystem, have recovered significantly, exceeding all biological benchmarks. This success has led to increased human-bear conflicts as the animals expand their territory, prompting calls from states like Wyoming to delist the species and allow for state management. However, conservationists and some biologists argue that delisting is premature, fearing that political pressures and emerging threats could quickly reverse the decades of progress made under federal protection.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Karen Russell's new novel, "The Antidote," delves into the concept of memory erasure through a historical and magical lens, set in a Dust Bowl-era Nebraska town. The story centers on a "prairie witch" who stores painful or inconvenient memories for the townspeople, allowing them to live without guilt or regret. The novel critiques this fantasy by exploring the moral consequences of forgetting, particularly the town's founding shame of stealing land from Native Americans. Russell argues against the idea of walling off the past, suggesting that memories, both personal and collective, must be shared and circulated for a society to remain healthy and just.</p>

          <p>A coalition of prominent athletes and entertainers, including Mike Tyson and Kevin Durant, has written to President Donald Trump, urging him to enact significant cannabis reform. The letter outlines three key requests: granting clemency for individuals with nonviolent federal marijuana convictions, reclassifying cannabis from a Schedule I to a Schedule III substance, and ending discriminatory banking practices against legal cannabis businesses. They argue that current policies are outdated, economically harmful, and create absurd injustices, especially as many states have legalized marijuana. They position the reforms as an opportunity for the administration to correct these disparities and build on its criminal justice reform efforts.</p>

The Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications asked the platforms to clarify their processes for removing harmful content and to act on such requests more quickly. This move is supported by a joint statement from seven political parties, who agree that the spread of false information threatens fair elections. The request highlights the growing global challenge of balancing free speech with the need to regulate harmful online content during sensitive political periods.</p>

          <p>A new report from Coldwell Banker indicates a growing divergence in the luxury real estate market, driven by economic uncertainty and high interest rates. The ultra-wealthy, with net worths over $30 million, are continuing to make large, often all-cash purchases, viewing property as a stable asset. In contrast, less wealthy but still affluent buyers are acting more cautiously and are more sensitive to borrowing costs. The report notes a significant increase in all-cash offers in 2025, as buyers with available capital seek to avoid high interest rates and gain leverage in negotiations, reinforcing real estate's appeal as a hedge against inflation.
