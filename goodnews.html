        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is implementing temporary flight restrictions at Newark Liberty International Airport due to technology outages, staffing shortages among air traffic controllers, and ongoing runway construction. Flights will be capped at 28 departures and 28 arrivals per hour until June 15, with slightly higher limits afterward through October 25. United Airlines, the airport's largest operator, supports the restrictions, aiming to ensure safer and more reliable operations. The FAA acknowledges a significant shortage of air traffic controllers, exacerbating the issues, with recent near misses further straining the system.</p>

          <p>Apple has approved the return of Fortnite to the U.S. App Store, five years after it was removed for violating in-app payment policies. The move follows a court ruling that Apple cannot charge commissions when apps link out for payment. Epic Games had to resubmit Fortnite to the App Store and pass App Review. The return of Fortnite could signal a shift in Apple's App Store policies and its control over in-app purchases, with implications for other app developers.</p>

Analysts suggest that the chatbot could minimize the number of web pages users need to browse, but also impact Google's revenue model by reducing clicks, which are essential for generating income.</p>

Before approving Covid vaccines for wider use, the F.D.A. ‚Äúanticipates the need‚Äù for new clinical trials in which participants under 65 are randomly assigned to receive the new shots or a placebo. The decision marks a departure from the previous policy of offering annual Covid shots to everyone 6 months and older.</p>
