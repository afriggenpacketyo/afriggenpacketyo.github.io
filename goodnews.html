          <p>During a visit to a hospital in Essex, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, spoke candidly about the significant challenges of life after cancer treatment, describing it as a difficult phase that is often overlooked. She emphasized that after the 'brave face' of chemotherapy, recovery is a 'life-changing' rollercoaster and not a smooth process, as one must find a 'new normal.' This was her first public engagement since withdrawing from an appearance at Royal Ascot. Her comments are seen as a powerful message of support for other former cancer patients navigating their own recovery journeys.</p>

          <p>A new report from Yole Group forecasts that mainland China will overtake Taiwan in semiconductor foundry capacity by 2030, a significant milestone in Beijing's pursuit of technological self-sufficiency amid U.S. restrictions. China's global share of foundry capacity is projected to increase from 21% in 2024 to 30% by the end of the decade, while Taiwan currently leads with a 23% share. This growth highlights the increasing role of domestic Chinese fabs, which are expected to expand their capacity significantly in the coming years, altering the global landscape of chip manufacturing.

The shift comes after the driest spring on record has left many parts of England in or near drought conditions, with some rain expected, primarily in the northwest.</p>
