          <p>In an interview, Paula Kerger, the CEO of PBS, addresses the increasing threats to the public broadcaster's funding, including congressional pushback and executive orders. Kerger emphasizes PBS's mission, audience, and spending priorities, highlighting the importance of federal grants for local stations, particularly in rural areas. She also defends PBS against claims of bias, noting that a significant portion of their programming is for children and that they strive to present multiple viewpoints. Kerger expresses hope that the current challenges might lead to a broader conversation about the structure of federal funding for public broadcasters and the critical role PBS plays in education and emergency services.</p>

          <p>Speculation is growing in Israel that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Trump are no longer on the same page regarding the situation in Gaza. Trump's recent Middle East tour excluded Israel, and some analysts suggest that Trump is sidelining Netanyahu due to disagreements over Iran and Gaza. Trump's focus on deals with Saudi Arabia and potential direct talks with Iran contrasts with Netanyahu's hardline stance. While some believe Trump is laying the groundwork for regional changes, others suggest that Trump wants Israel to end the war in Gaza, which Netanyahu has not done.</p>

          <p>The UK Parliament is debating a bill that would allow terminally ill adults in England and Wales to seek assistance to end their lives. Amendments have been proposed to allow health workers to opt out of the process and prevent medical staff from raising the option of assisted dying with patients first. Supporters argue the bill would provide choice and dignity for those suffering, while opponents raise concerns about the potential for coercion and the impact on vulnerable individuals. The government remains neutral, allowing MPs a free vote on the issue.</p>

          <p>House Republicans' tax bill includes a temporary $4,000 deduction for older adults as an alternative to eliminating taxes on Social Security benefits. The provision, called a "bonus," aims to help retirees keep more money and would be available to adults ages 65 and over from 2025 through 2028. The deduction would phase out for single filers with incomes over $75,000 and married couples with incomes over $150,000. While the deduction would reduce the amount of income subject to taxes, it is not as generous as a tax credit. (not investment advice)</p>

While President Trump is pressuring automakers to build in the U.S., sourcing all parts domestically is not feasible due to cost and availability. Experts estimate that a 100% U.S.-made vehicle would be significantly more expensive, potentially pricing consumers out of the market. Sourcing certain materials and components, such as semiconductors and raw materials, would require substantial investment and time.</p>
