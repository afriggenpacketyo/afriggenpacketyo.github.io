          <p>eToro, a stock brokerage platform with increasing involvement in crypto, has priced its IPO at $52 a share and raised nearly $310 million, valuing the company at about $4.2 billion, as it prepares to list on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol ETOR. The IPO comes after shelving previous plans due to tariff uncertainty, and its performance may indicate the public market's appetite for risk. Founded in 2007, eToro competes with platforms like Robinhood and generates revenue through trading fees and other activities. The company's net income significantly increased last year, driven by growth in its crypto business. (not investment advice)</p>

While some programs are resuming, many workers remain laid-off, and other CDC scientists have not been reinstated, despite calls from states and lawmakers.

Economists are looking for early signs that Mr. Trump's tariffs are trickling through to American households. With inflation still expected to pick up later this year, the Fed may decide to cut rates twice in 2025, rather than the three cuts Daco had earlier expected. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services reversed the firings of more than 100 federal employees with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the federal institute that helps protect coal miners from black lung.

Shelley Moore Capito, and follows a series of ABC News reports detailing the impact the firings would have on black lung health care programs for coal miners. The announcement came just hours before a federal judge ordered HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to temporarily halt its dismissal of NIOSH officials who oversee the black lung surveillance program.</p>
