          <p>Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer Xpeng reported its eighth consecutive month of over 30,000 car deliveries in June, demonstrating resilience in a fiercely competitive market. While market leader BYD continues to dominate, Xpeng's performance stands out as rivals like Nio and Li Auto show mixed or declining results. The intense price war has drawn criticism from the Chinese government for creating "disorderly competition," even as new players like Xiaomi enter the market, putting further pressure on established brands, including Tesla, whose China sales are projected to have declined.

          <p>The United States, Japan, India, and Australia have announced a new initiative to ensure a stable supply of critical minerals, a move aimed at reducing reliance on China. The "Quad" partnership pledged to work together on the processing and refining of minerals essential for semiconductors and other advanced technologies. In a joint statement, the group highlighted the risks of economic coercion and supply chain disruptions from depending on a single country. The announcement came from a meeting of the nations' foreign ministers in Washington, D.C., signaling continued strategic cooperation despite other policy differences.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration cannot terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for nearly 350,000 Haitian migrants living in the U.S. The ruling prevents the Department of Homeland Security from ending the program in September, months ahead of a previously established 2026 deadline. The judge stated that the administration lacks the authority to partially vacate a country's TPS designation and that migrants have built lives in reliance on the program's continuation. The White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision, asserting the executive branch's authority to enforce immigration laws.</p>

          <p>Preliminary government data reveals that the number of migrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border reached a new historic monthly low in June, with just over 6,000 apprehensions. This continues a significant decline in illegal immigration that the Trump administration attributes to its aggressive deportation policies and enhanced border security measures. The current numbers are a stark contrast to the record highs seen under the previous administration. The administration's strategy includes swift deportations, military-enforced barriers, and a messaging campaign encouraging self-deportation, though these tactics have drawn considerable criticism.</p>

          <p>Minnesota has implemented the nation's most stringent law regulating PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," which are linked to serious health issues. The legislation, called "Amara's Law," is named after Amara Strande, who advocated for the ban while dying from a rare cancer she believed was linked to PFAS contamination in her community. The law will phase out the manufacture and sale of nonessential products containing PFAS by 2032. The effort was driven by Strande's powerful testimony, creating a lasting legacy just weeks after her death and holding manufacturer 3M accountable for decades of pollution.</p>

Developed by a volunteer-led effort, the tool allows surgeons to safely and minimally invasively remove metal fragments from critical areas, including the heart. With shrapnel wounds accounting for up to 80% of battlefield trauma due to drone warfare, the device has enabled doctors to perform life-saving operations with greater precision and speed. The technology, modernized from a 19th-century concept, has been distributed to thousands of front-line medics and hospitals across the country.</p>
