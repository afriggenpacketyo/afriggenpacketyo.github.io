          <p>The White House's Make America Healthy Again Commission, led by Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., released a report criticizing the state of chronic disease in America. The report attributes many chronic illnesses to ultra-processed foods, sedentary behavior, overuse of digital devices among children, and environmental chemicals. It also suggests further studies on childhood vaccines are needed, despite existing research indicating their safety and effectiveness. While the report lacks specific budget details, Kennedy maintains that addressing these health issues would save money in the long term, focusing on improving Americans' diets and reducing exposure to toxic chemicals.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary injunction preventing the Trump administration from firing half of the Department of Education's workforce and transferring federal student loan management to the Small Business Administration. The judge deemed the administration's actions unlawful, stating they would effectively make it impossible for the Department to carry out its mandated functions. The ruling halts the administration's efforts to implement the president's executive order to facilitate the closure of the Department of Education, with the judge unconvinced that the changes were aimed at improving efficiency rather than abolishing the department outright.</p>

          <p>Most teachers and doctors in England will receive a 4% pay rise after the government accepted recommendations from pay review bodies, which is higher than the previously budgeted 2.8%. While education unions welcomed the decision, they warned of potential cuts to school budgets without additional funding. Health unions reacted negatively to a smaller 3.6% rise for other NHS staff, with the British Medical Association planning a strike ballot for resident doctors due to the "woefully inadequate" rise. The government stated that it will avoid cuts to frontline services by reducing temporary staff and cutting waste.</p>

          <p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) is predicting an above-normal Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November. The forecast indicates a 60% chance of 13 to 19 named storms, with 6 to 10 expected to become hurricanes and 3 to 5 potentially becoming major hurricanes. The forecast is influenced by warmer sea temperatures and the neutral condition of the El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation cycle. This information is intended to help communities in storm-prone areas prepare for the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Nike will be raising prices on certain shoes, clothing, and equipment this week as part of a seasonal adjustment. Footwear priced between $100 and $150 will see increases of up to $5, while items priced at $150 or higher will see increases of up to $10. The price hikes will also affect apparel and equipment, but prices for Nike Air Force 1s, children's footwear, and Jordan apparel will remain the same. In addition, Nike will begin selling its shoes directly on Amazon for the first time since 2019, forcing smaller sellers on the platform to cease sales of Nike products by July 19.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Treasury Department has ordered its last batch of "blanks" used to make pennies, signaling an end to the production of the one-cent coin. This decision, driven by the rising cost of minting pennies, is expected to save taxpayers $85 million annually. The last of the new pennies will enter circulation early next year, and businesses will eventually be pressed to round prices to the nearest nickel. There are currently 114 billion pennies in circulation, and the move aligns with President Trump's efforts to reduce unnecessary government spending.</p>

          <p>The Treasury Department plans to stop minting pennies after placing its last order for blank coins, a move aimed at saving $56 million annually. The decision is driven by the fact that each penny costs nearly four cents to produce. Pennies will remain legal tender, but stores may need to round prices to the nearest nickel. The phase-out aligns with President Trump's call to eliminate wasteful spending and follows similar actions by countries like Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.</p>

          <p>Net migration to the UK fell by almost 50% in 2024, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), driven by declining numbers of people coming to work and study following changes introduced by the previous Conservative government. The decrease was also influenced by large numbers of people who arrived on study visas after Covid-19 pandemic restrictions eased leaving the country. The Home Office reported a decrease in asylum seekers being housed in hotels, though the numbers are still higher than when Labour came to power. The government highlighted increased returns of failed asylum seekers and foreign national offenders, with the Home Secretary promising further reductions in net migration.</p>
