          <h2>United Kingdom and India to Sign Landmark Free Trade Agreement</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:04:06 EDT</div>

          <p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are set to sign a landmark free trade agreement aimed at boosting the British economy by an estimated £4.8 billion annually. The deal will reduce tariffs on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, while making Indian textiles and jewelry cheaper in the UK. The agreement also includes a controversial three-year exemption on national insurance contributions for Indian workers temporarily in the UK, a measure the government insists aligns with existing reciprocal agreements. The deal is expected to create over 2,200 British jobs and includes commitments for closer collaboration on defense and tackling illegal migration.</p>

          <p>China is approving innovative drugs at a record pace, signaling a shift in the global pharmaceutical landscape. In the first half of 2025, authorities approved 43 new drugs, a 59% increase year-over-year, with many targeting serious conditions like cancer and metabolic disorders. This acceleration is attributed to reforms in the country's drug review and approval processes, which have encouraged more R&D investment from pharmaceutical companies. Additionally, China set a new record for licensing out its own innovative drugs to overseas markets, with deals valued at over $48 billion, further establishing its growing role in the global biomedicine market.</p>

          <h2>Diet, Not Lack of Exercise, Identified as Primary Driver of Modern Obesity Epidemic</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-24 05:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major new study suggests that what we eat, rather than a lack of physical activity, is the main cause of rising obesity rates in industrialized nations. Researchers compared the daily calorie expenditure of people from diverse lifestyles, including active hunter-gatherers and sedentary office workers, and found surprisingly similar results when adjusted for body size. This finding challenges the common assumption that modern sedentary lifestyles lead to burning fewer calories. The research indicates that our bodies adjust how they use energy to keep total calorie burn within a narrow range, pointing to the shift towards ultra-processed foods in modern diets as the key culprit behind widespread weight gain.</p>

          <p>Professional chef and single father David Nayfeld advocates for cooking with children as a valuable opportunity for connection and building confidence, despite the inevitable mess. In his new cookbook, "Dad, What's for Dinner?", he provides family-friendly recipes and practical tips for involving kids of all ages in the kitchen, from simple tasks like cracking eggs to more advanced skills like chopping vegetables. Nayfeld emphasizes that cooking together creates lasting memories and helps develop a child's palate beyond typical "kid food." He advises parents not to let the pursuit of perfection get in the way of the fun and developmental benefits of the experience.</p>

          <p>Deutsche Bank's shares rose significantly after the company reported a second-quarter net profit of €1.485 billion, surpassing analyst expectations and signaling it is on track to meet full-year targets. The strong performance was achieved despite mixed results in its investment banking unit, where fixed income and currencies saw an 11% revenue increase while advisory services declined. The German lender noted that the relative strength of the euro against the U.S. dollar impacted its numbers across the board. The bank's profit before tax rose 34% year-on-year, excluding litigation costs, contributing to positive investor sentiment.</p>

          <p>Marcus Rashford's move from Manchester United to FC Barcelona has sparked considerable interest in Spain, with fans and journalists curious about what the English forward will bring to the team. While Barcelona's attack is already strong with players like Robert Lewandowski and Lamine Yamal, Rashford is seen as a versatile addition who can play on the wing or as a striker. Spanish commentators acknowledge his recent dip in form but recall his early promise, viewing the transfer as a major opportunity for him to reignite his career at a world-class club. He becomes the first Englishman to play for Barcelona since Gary Lineker in the late 1980s.</p>

          <p>Nigerian artist John Madu is being featured in an exhibition at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, where his work creates a dialogue between Vincent van Gogh's 19th-century motifs and modern West African culture. In the exhibition, titled "Van Gogh x John Madu: Paint Your Path," Madu reinterprets famous paintings, such as adding a Black figure carrying a plastic chair into a Van Gogh restaurant scene. A self-taught artist like Van Gogh, Madu draws inspiration from his upbringing in Lagos and global influences like manga. He identifies as an "artist from Africa" rather than an "African artist," reflecting his global citizenship and cosmopolitan perspective.</p>

          <p>China is increasing its focus on implementing trans-Himalayan infrastructure projects in Nepal as it competes with India for influence in the strategically important South Asian nation. During a recent visit, a senior Chinese official emphasized boosting projects in agriculture, new energy, and health to promote Nepal's economic development. Landlocked between the two Asian giants, Nepal has traditionally been allied with India but has grown closer to Beijing in recent years due to significant Chinese investment in its infrastructure. This diplomatic push underscores the ongoing rivalry between China and India to secure partnerships in the region.</p>

          <p>Scottish mountain biker Sean Green has accomplished the extraordinary feat of cycling down all 282 of Scotland's Munros, mountains over 3,000 feet. The 36-year-old from Angus is believed to be only the second person to complete the challenge, which took him eight and a half years. The quest involved climbing to each summit while carrying his bike on his back before riding down the often-narrow paths. Green said the challenge combined his passions for mountain biking and the outdoors, though he acknowledged the logistical difficulties and the toll it took on his family life.</p>

          <p>China is set to launch a program offering monthly subsidy coupons to senior citizens to help cover the costs of elderly care services and stimulate domestic consumption. The electronic coupons, valued between 500 and 800 yuan, will be provided to seniors assessed with moderate to complete physical disabilities.

The policy is part of a broader effort to strengthen the country's social safety net and foster new growth drivers in the services sector.</p>
