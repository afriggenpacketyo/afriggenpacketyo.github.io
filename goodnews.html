          <p>AI infrastructure firm CoreWeave has announced it will acquire data center provider Core Scientific in an all-stock transaction valued at around $9 billion. The deal is a significant move in the competitive AI sector, giving CoreWeave ownership of critical infrastructure, including 1.3 gigawatts of power capacity across U.S. data centers. CoreWeave's CEO stated the acquisition will eliminate future lease obligations and improve operational efficiency. Following the news, CoreWeave's stock fell about 4%, while Core Scientific's shares dropped by approximately 20%, despite having rallied on earlier reports of the talks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bishop T.D. Jakes, a prominent faith leader, has officially stepped down as the senior pastor of The Potter's House, the Dallas megachurch he founded nearly 30 years ago. He has installed his daughter, Sarah Jakes Roberts, and her husband, Toure Roberts, as the new co-senior pastors. The transition, which has reportedly been planned for years, follows a health incident in late 2024 where Jakes suffered a heart attack. Jakes will continue his role as chairman of the T.D.

          <h2>UK Government Proposes Extending Bereavement Leave to Cover Miscarriages Before 24 Weeks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 10:14:03 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to extend the right to bereavement leave for parents who experience a miscarriage before 24 weeks of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only guaranteed for pregnancy loss after this point. The proposed change would provide at least one week of unpaid leave, acknowledging the grief and loss associated with early pregnancy loss. Campaigners and politicians have praised the move as a significant step forward, recognizing that such an event is a bereavement, not an illness. The measure, which will apply in England, Scotland, and Wales, aims to provide better support for grieving parents in the workplace.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh In on Whether to Secure a CD Rate in July Ahead of Potential Fed Changes</h2>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve meeting in July, savers are considering whether to lock in a certificate of deposit (CD) rate now or wait. While a rate cut in July is considered unlikely, future cuts are anticipated later in the year, which could cause banks to lower their CD yields soon. Financial experts suggest that locking in a rate now could be a smart move to secure currently high yields, especially for those with a stable emergency fund. They recommend considering personal liquidity needs and financial goals, with some suggesting a CD laddering strategy to diversify across different term lengths and maturity dates.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The umpire at the center of a significant electronic line-calling error at Wimbledon, Nico Helwerth, was not scheduled for matches on Monday. The All England Club's chief executive explained he was having a scheduled "rest day," a common practice for officials during the tournament. The controversy occurred when the ball-tracking system failed during a key point, and Helwerth opted to replay the point instead of making an overrule, a decision some criticized. The AELTC defended the umpire, stating he correctly followed the established protocols for when the electronic system fails to make a call.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The recently announced departure of Nestle Chairman Paul Bulcke was preceded by growing investor unease over the company's direction, according to sources. Shareholders were reportedly concerned with the company's lagging share price, the tenure of former CEO Mark Schneider, and an outdated governance model where former CEOs become chairmen. Bulcke's declining shareholder support in recent votes was a clear signal of this discontent. The appointment of independent vice chairman Pablo Isla to succeed Bulcke is seen by many investors as a welcome "breath of fresh air" and an opportunity to improve execution and strategic direction.

          <p>Citigroup has raised its price target for Nvidia to $190 per share, anticipating the chipmaker will capture a significant portion of the rapidly expanding market for AI infrastructure. Analysts believe that demand from governments building their own national AI capabilities is already a major revenue driver and will increase substantially. The firm noted that Nvidia is involved in nearly every sovereign AI deal, making it central to the global AI race. Despite potential risks like renewed export restrictions, Citi projects strong growth in Nvidia's data center and networking sales over the next few years. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to communication experts, a successful apology from a boss or leader requires proper timing, genuine empathy, and a clear plan of action. Waiting too long can signal a lack of care, while speaking too quickly without a plan can erode credibility. An effective apology involves taking full responsibility, demonstrating an understanding of what went wrong, and outlining steps to fix the issue and prevent its recurrence. Leaders are advised to sound human and show vulnerability without making the situation about themselves, as audiences want to hear from a person, not just a brand, to rebuild trust.</p>

Despite Smith's impressive scores of 184 not out and 88 from the number seven position in the recent Test against India, McCullum stated the team is very happy with his current role. He drew a comparison to Australian legend Adam Gilchrist, who also had a major impact from the same position. McCullum also indicated that bringing in all-rounder Jacob Bethell as a tactical spin-bowling option is not currently under consideration.</p>

          <p>Despite its focus on streaming over traditional theatrical releases, Netflix consistently lures major Hollywood directors like Martin Scorsese, Greta Gerwig, and Rian Johnson. The company achieves this by offering an appealing combination of lucrative contracts, significant creative freedom, and access to its vast global subscriber base of over 300 million. Netflix has become a haven for filmmakers with projects that traditional studios might deem too expensive or risky, such as "The Irishman" or the upcoming "The Electric State." This strategy allows Netflix to produce award-contending films and maintain a steady flow of exclusive, high-profile content for its platform.</p>
