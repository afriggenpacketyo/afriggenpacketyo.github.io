          <p>A coordinated nationwide crackdown on organized retail crime resulted in hundreds of arrests across 28 states. Led by Illinois' Cook County regional organized crime task force, the operation involved over 100 jurisdictions and more than 30 retailers, including major chains like Home Depot, Macy's, and Target. Retailers reported a significant increase in shoplifting incidents and associated dollar losses between 2019 and 2023, highlighting the growing problem of organized retail theft. Cook County State's Attorney Eileen O'Neill Burke is focused on addressing the lack of enforcement and felony thresholds that allow criminals to continue these activities.</p>

          <h2>Experts Weigh In on Mortgage Rate Outlook Following Fed's June Meeting</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 09:37:26 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article discusses the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's June meeting on mortgage rates. Industry experts suggest that significant mortgage rate relief is unlikely immediately after the meeting, as mortgage rates are more closely tied to the 10-year Treasury yield than direct Fed policy changes. Factors such as inflation and employment rates play a crucial role in determining rate decisions, with expectations for only two potential rate cuts later in the year. Experts advise potential homebuyers to consider purchasing now if they are financially ready, citing less competition and the potential for home prices to continue rising. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article reviews Maria Foscarinis' book, "And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America," which argues for recognizing housing as a fundamental human right. Foscarinis examines the origins of the homelessness crisis, how it has been perpetuated through inadequate responses, and potential solutions, including the "Housing First" model. The review emphasizes that homelessness is a policy failure, not a personal one, and that acknowledging housing as a fundamental right is essential for lasting change. The biggest barrier to ending homelessness is a lack of political will, not a lack of solutions.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed that the government will reverse its decision to limit the winter fuel payment to those receiving pension credit, allowing more people to qualify for the allowance. The 2024 decision to restrict the payment to low-income individuals on specific benefits was widely criticized, leading to this change in policy. Details about who will qualify under the revised rules are expected to be announced as part of the Spending Review and the Budget later in the year. The move aims to address concerns about older people on small incomes missing out on the payment.</p>
