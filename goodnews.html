          <p>Nintendo has projected sales of 15 million units for its Switch 2 console in the fiscal year ending March 2026, marking the first sales forecast since announcing the successor to the successful Switch device, which is slated for a June release. The company's fourth-quarter results showed a revenue decrease of 24.7% and a profit plunge of nearly 50% due to anticipated consumer hesitation ahead of the new console's launch. Nintendo also addressed concerns about potential tariffs, stating that adjustments to pricing might be necessary if tariffs are imposed, potentially impacting demand in the U.S. market. The company's stock rallied following the announcement of the Switch 2 sales forecast.</p>

          <p>One hundred thirty-three cardinals have reconvened in the Sistine Chapel to continue voting for the successor to Pope Francis, who passed away on April 21.

The initial ballot on Wednesday did not yield a result, indicated by black smoke from the chapel's chimney.

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. anticipates a 34.9% decrease in net profit for the fiscal year ending next March, projecting 3.1 trillion yen due to concerns over U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs, which are creating global uncertainty. The company's operating profit is projected to fall by 20.8% to 3.8 trillion yen, despite estimated record sales of 48.5 trillion yen. Toyota President Koji Sato acknowledged the difficulty in forecasting the outlook, given the fluid nature of the tariffs, but CFO Yoichi Miyazaki stated that the company has no immediate plans to pass the levies onto customers. The automaker group plans to sell 11.2 million units worldwide, a 1.7% increase, following a certification scandal that briefly suspended production of several models.</p>

          <p>The UK has reportedly secured a trade agreement with the U.S., marking a significant achievement for Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government after previous Conservative administrations failed to reach a comprehensive deal. While the specifics of the agreement are still emerging, it is expected to reduce tariffs on specific goods, such as British steel and cars, while the U.S. aims to gain concessions on pharmaceuticals and technology. This agreement follows a recent free trade agreement between the UK and India, estimated to bring a substantial boost to bilateral trade and UK GDP. Opposition parties are calling for parliamentary scrutiny of the deal, particularly regarding potential concessions that could affect the NHS or farmers.</p>

          <p>Toyota Motor Corp. has presented a somber forecast, projecting a significant decline in operating profit for the fiscal year ending in March, citing headwinds from a stronger yen and the impact of President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. The company estimates a $1.3 billion hit from tariffs in April and May alone, with the future impact remaining uncertain due to the volatility of the trade environment. This projection underscores the challenges faced by the Japanese auto industry, as smaller automakers with a higher proportion of imported vehicles are expected to face even greater difficulties.</p>

          <p>An avatar of the late author Agatha Christie has been created using artificial intelligence to teach an online writing course for BBC Maestro. The course uses Christie's own words and archival interviews, with her family's approval, to provide writing advice in a digestible format. While some critics raise ethical concerns about reanimating deceased individuals with A.I., others argue that this representation is educational and does not harm Christie's reputation, offering a new way for fans to engage with her work.</p>
