        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Norway's parliamentary election is expected to result in a narrow victory for the incumbent Labour Party, according to recent opinion polls. The campaign focused heavily on domestic issues such as rising inflation and the quality of public services. However, international instability, including the war in Ukraine, has also been a significant factor, potentially leading voters to favor the stability of the current government. The final outcome remains tight, with the performance of smaller parties likely to be decisive when results are announced.</p>

          <p>Following Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's intention to resign, Japan's leadership race is intensifying, with former minister Sanae Takaichi emerging as a frontrunner. An opinion poll shows Takaichi with a slight lead, positioning her to potentially become the country's first female prime minister. The transition comes as Japan grapples with a cost of living crisis and the fallout from a new trade deal with the United States. Analysts note Takaichi's strong policy ideas, contrasting her with rival Shinjiro Koizumi, who is seen as a more conventional choice.</p>

          <p>The board of English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur has announced that it is "not for sale," having rejected two preliminary expressions of interest. The statement follows the recent departure of long-serving executive chairman Daniel Levy, which had fueled speculation about a potential takeover. The club confirmed that its majority owner, ENIC Sports & Developments Holdings Ltd, unequivocally rejected the approaches and has no intention of selling its stake. Levy's tenure saw the club grow into a global brand but also faced criticism from fans.</p>

          <p>Germany's football manager, Julian Nagelsmann, faced criticism for his post-match comments following a 3-1 victory over Northern Ireland in a World Cup qualifier. Nagelsmann described Northern Ireland's direct, long-ball style of play as "not brilliant to watch," which pundits and former players found disrespectful. Critics pointed out that Germany also frequently employed long balls during the match. The comments have added extra tension ahead of the reverse fixture in Belfast, where Nagelsmann is now expected to receive a hostile reception.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A joint China-US study has discovered that Mars has a solid inner core, a finding that challenges previous models of the planet's formation and thermal history. By analyzing seismic data from marsquakes recorded by NASA's InSight lander, scientists determined the solid core has a radius of about 600km. Previously, it was thought Mars had not cooled sufficiently to form a solid inner core. This discovery places Mars alongside Earth and the Moon as the only bodies in the solar system confirmed to have this feature, offering new insights into planetary evolution.</p>
