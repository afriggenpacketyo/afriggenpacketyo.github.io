          <p>A New Yorker, known as "Streeter," has reportedly made over six figures by reporting idling vehicles through the city's Citizens Air Complaint Program. The program allows individuals to report trucks and non-city buses idling for more than three minutes, receiving 25% of any fines collected, which typically range from $350 to $600. The law, championed by George Pakenham, aims to address public health concerns related to air pollution from idling vehicles. While the program has generated significant revenue for the city, some truck drivers feel unfairly targeted, citing the challenges of operating in New York City.</p>

The new law places greater responsibility on universities to protect free speech and academic freedom.
