          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults suggests five simple parenting rules: trust your instincts, follow your culture, observe your child's individual preferences, focus on enjoyment rather than strict development, and be your authentic self. The psychiatrist emphasizes that parents should trust their inherent abilities and cultural traditions rather than relying solely on influencers or clickbait. Prioritizing a child's unique interests and creating a joyful, supportive environment are key, and parents should focus on being genuine rather than striving for perfection. These guidelines aim to simplify parenting and promote healthy youth development.</p>

Dr. Mohamed Labib at the University of Maryland Medical Center developed a unique surgical plan, accessing the spinal tumor through Flores' eye in a first-of-its-kind procedure. The "third nostril" approach involved removing part of her eye socket and cheekbone to reach the tumor, which was then successfully removed. Flores is recovering and has no evidence of cancer, and the procedure could offer a new method for operating on difficult-to-reach tumors.</p>
