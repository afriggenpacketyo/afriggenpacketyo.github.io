          <p>Bo Hines, the head of President Trump's Council of Advisers on Digital Assets, has announced his departure from the administration to return to the private sector. Hines played a key role in shaping the administration's crypto policy, leading a working group that called for new, specific regulations for digital assets. His departure follows the recent signing of the GENIUS Act, a milestone law creating a regulatory framework for stablecoins, which Hines had supported. His work was part of a broader effort to fulfill a campaign promise to overhaul U.S. crypto policy and establish clear rules for the growing market. (not investment advice)</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The booming market for "functional beverages," which promise benefits like calm and relaxation, is facing scrutiny over the validity of its health claims. An advert from a leading brand, Trip, was recently banned for suggesting its drinks could help with stress and anxiety. Nutritionists express skepticism, noting the small amounts of active ingredients like Lion's Mane or L-theanine in these drinks are unlikely to produce significant effects based on current research. While some consumers find them to be a good non-alcoholic alternative for unwinding, psychologists suggest the perceived calming effect may be more related to the ritual of taking a moment for oneself than the ingredients themselves.</p>

          <p>Ali Akbar, believed to be the last traditional newspaper hawker in Paris, is set to receive the National Order of Merit, one of France's highest honors. For over 50 years, the 72-year-old has been a beloved figure in the Saint-Germain neighborhood, selling papers like Le Monde with a shout. Despite the decline in print media and the shift to digital news, Mr. Akbar continues his work for the joy and independence it brings him. The honor, bestowed by President Emmanuel Macron who once bought papers from him as a student, recognizes his unique contribution to French culture and his persistence in a vanishing trade.</p>

          <p>A dog named Petunia has won the title of the "World's Ugliest Dog" at the annual contest held at the Sonoma County Fair in California. The event, which has been running for nearly 50 years, celebrates the unique beauty of dogs regardless of pedigree and awarded Petunia's owner, Shannon Nyman, a $5,000 prize. Many of the contestants are rescue dogs from shelters and puppy mills, and the competition serves to promote adoption by showcasing these unique animals. Organizers describe the contest as a "wonderful show of pageantry and pride" that proves a pedigree does not define a pet.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singer Ed Sheeran recently sparked a debate about identity by describing himself as "culturally Irish," prompting both criticism and support. This article explores the complex and fluid nature of what it means to be Irish today, moving beyond simple definitions of birthplace or citizenship. It discusses how identity in both Ireland and the diaspora is a blend of heritage, personal experience, and cultural touchstones, from music and literature to a shared sense of humor. The piece argues that in an era of peace and easy travel, individuals can embrace multiple identities, reflecting a long history of cross-fertilization between Irish and British cultures and a move away from rigid, historical binaries.</p>

          <p>The phenomenon of films that are so poorly made they become entertaining is explored in this article, prompted by the critical panning of the new "War of the Worlds" adaptation. Critics and film enthusiasts argue that movies with exceptionally low review scores can be more interesting and memorable than bland, forgettable blockbusters. These "junk films" often build cult followings because their earnest failures, visible production struggles, and unintentional humor provide a unique viewing experience. Unlike slickly produced but soulless movies, these flawed creations are seen as having a certain charm and are celebrated for their unintentional comedy and audacious lack of quality.</p>

          <h2>China's DeepSeek AI App Challenged Silicon Valley's Assumptions on AI Development</h2>

          <p>Six months ago, the Chinese AI app DeepSeek-R1 surged to the top of U.S. download charts, challenging the prevailing Silicon Valley belief that superior AI requires massive computational power and investment. DeepSeek claimed its powerful chatbot was developed for a fraction of the cost of its American rivals, suggesting that smarter engineering could rival brute force. While the initial shock has subsided and concerns over data security with China persist, DeepSeek's arrival marked a turning point in the U.S.-China AI rivalry. It spurred a shift in the industry, encouraging some developers to focus on smaller, more efficient models, even as major tech giants continue to invest billions in large-scale AI infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Apple's stock experienced its largest weekly gain in over five years, rising 13% and adding more than $400 billion to its market capitalization. The surge followed a White House appearance where CEO Tim Cook announced Apple's plan to spend $100 billion on American companies and parts over the next four years. This move, along with President Trump's assurance that Apple would be exempt from potential future tariffs on imported chips, alleviated investor concerns about the financial impact of trade policies. The successful meeting compounded positive momentum from Apple's recent earnings report, which showed strong revenue and iPhone sales growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The attendance of a senior Taiwanese official at Japan's annual atomic bomb commemorations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first time could test the recently improving relationship between Beijing and Tokyo. Lee Yi-yang, head of Taiwan's de facto embassy in Japan, was present at the ceremonies, part of a broader effort by Taipei to strengthen unofficial ties and raise its international profile. While Beijing is expected to view the participation negatively, observers believe both China and Japan will act cautiously to avoid undermining their diplomatic progress. The move follows a rare visit to Japan by Taiwan's foreign minister, signaling Taipei's proactive diplomatic strategy.</p>

She credited Roig with already making a positive difference, focusing on improving the overall quality and movement of her shots. The win sets up a challenging third-round match against either world No. 1 Aryna Sabalenka or former Wimbledon champion Marketa Vondrousova, providing a significant test of her recent progress.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A board-certified neurologist is advising people over 50 to eat more pomegranates to support healthy brain aging. The fruit is rich in polyphenols, which have powerful antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that can enhance learning and memory. Studies suggest these nutrients may also help protect the brain from amyloid proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease. While pomegranates can be costly and are not available year-round, pomegranate extract can be an alternative, provided it contains no added sugars. The article also recommends other brain-healthy fruits like blueberries, dark grapes, and avocados, but advises consulting a doctor before making significant dietary changes.</p>

          <p>Jonny Bairstow's phenomenal unbeaten 86 from 50 balls was not enough to save Welsh Fire from an eight-run defeat to London Spirit in The Hundred. Chasing 164, Fire suffered a top-order collapse, leaving Bairstow with a monumental task. He launched a stunning late assault, including back-to-back sixes, and shared a 100-run partnership with Chris Green, but the effort fell just short. Earlier, David Warner's unbeaten 70 anchored the Spirit's total of 163-5, helping them recover from being bowled out for 80 in their previous match and leaving both of Welsh Fire's teams winless in the competition.</p>
