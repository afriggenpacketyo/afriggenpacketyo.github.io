        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has temporarily blocked President Trump's attempt to deploy the Oregon National Guard to Portland, issuing a 14-day restraining order. The judge determined that Trump's justification for federalizing the Guard was "untethered to the facts," asserting that the protests were not sufficiently violent or disruptive to warrant deployment without the state governor's consent. This ruling significantly underscores the constitutional boundary between civil and military federal power, aiming to prevent government overreach and uphold state sovereignty. Oregon officials, including the Governor and Attorney General, have praised the decision as a "wake-up call" for the administration, emphasizing the importance of facts over social media rhetoric in such deployments.</p>

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has expressed hope for the release of all hostages from Gaza "in the coming days," following Hamas's conditional agreement to parts of President Trump's peace plan. Netanyahu indicated that Israel is preparing to implement the first phase, which includes Hamas releasing all hostages and the IDF redeploying within Gaza while maintaining control of its current territories. While Hamas accepted key elements like hostage release and a "technocratic" Palestinian body for Gaza governance, it seeks further negotiation on other aspects and its disarmament. U.S. and Israeli officials are now engaging in indirect talks in Egypt to finalize the technical details of this potentially transformative deal, aiming for a swift resolution to the conflict.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Queuing, once perceived as an inconvenience, is transforming into a desirable social activity, with people waiting for hours for exclusive product launches and events. Participants describe the experience as "exciting and exhilarating," fostering a sense of camaraderie and offering opportunities to meet new friends, sometimes even forming lasting connections. Psychologists attribute this trend to the anticipation of a "reward" and the release of dopamine, especially for hard-to-get or novel items, creating a powerful feeling of exclusivity. Brands are increasingly leveraging "experiential marketing" with freebies, interactive elements, and social media-worthy moments to engage consumers, making the act of queuing itself a significant part of the event and a valuable source of content.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (ELCA), a predominantly white denomination, has installed the Rev. Yehiel Curry as its first Black presiding bishop, marking a historic and landmark moment. Curry, the fifth presiding bishop since the ELCA's formation in 1988, will serve a six-year term, succeeding the first woman to hold the position. His election is seen as a significant step towards greater diversity within the church, which has seen declining membership but invested in multicultural ministries and global ties. Curry's unique path to leadership, growing up Catholic and entering Lutheran ministry through a program for diverse settings, highlights efforts to grow new congregations and acknowledge the long history of Black Lutherans globally, facing challenges common to mainline Protestant denominations.</p>

          <p>Previously winless UCLA achieved a stunning 42-37 upset victory over No. 7 Penn State, led by newly elevated playcaller Jerry Neuheisel and quarterback Nico Iamaleava. Neuheisel, who had only four days to devise an offensive plan, saw his team score on their first five drives, overcoming a season of national lampooning and a four-game losing streak. Iamaleava was instrumental, accounting for five touchdowns and showcasing his talent with 166 passing yards and 128 rushing yards, including a remarkable 52-yard gain. This unexpected win, celebrated by enthusiastic fans chanting "Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!", offers a significant reprieve for the Bruins and signals a potential turning point in their challenging season.</p>

          <p>"Freshers' flu," an assortment of common cold viruses, rapidly spreads among university students due to a "mixing pot" of infections from diverse backgrounds, exacerbated by close living quarters and intense social activities. Immunologists explain that late nights, poor diet, high stress levels, and alcohol consumption during freshers' week significantly weaken the immune system, making students highly susceptible. Stress, in particular, releases cortisol, suppressing immune responses and impacting sleep, further compromising the body's defenses. The article highlights that while symptoms can be severe, young immune systems are powerful, but first-time exposure to numerous viruses makes initial illness inevitable, urging students to prioritize rest and seek medical help for persistent or worsening symptoms.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has temporarily halted a Trump administration initiative that would have transferred immigrant children to adult detention centers upon turning 18, ruling it violates a 2021 court order. The previous order mandated release to the "least restrictive setting available" for these minors, provided they aren't a danger or flight risk. This decision comes amidst reports of the Trump administration offering a $2,500 stipend for voluntary self-deportation and accusations of reviving family separation tactics to coerce immigrants. Advocates warn these policies pressure children to abandon legal claims and return to danger, highlighting ongoing federal clashes over controversial immigration policies affecting minors and their families.</p>

          <p>Thousands of Israelis gathered in Tel Aviv's Hostage Square to celebrate the potential ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, expressing fervent hope for the return of hostages kidnapped on Oct. 7, 2023.

          <p>Scottish Premiership leaders Hearts are sparking title challenge hopes among their fans after an unbeaten start to the season, including a dramatic 91st-minute Edinburgh derby winner that sent Tynecastle into euphoria. Despite head coach Derek McInnes cautioning against premature title talk, the club's current five-point lead and a £10 million investment from owner Tony Bloom, who previously stated a goal for second place, fuel significant optimism. With rivals Rangers in turmoil and Celtic yet to hit top gear, former players suggest Hearts fans have every right to get carried away. While some compare their start to Aberdeen's past collapse, the current form offers genuine encouragement for a strong performance this season.</p>
