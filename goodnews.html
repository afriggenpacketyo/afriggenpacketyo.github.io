          <p>An article discusses the recent panic surrounding ultra-processed baby foods (UPFs), particularly baby food pouches, and argues that it is another way of making mothers feel guilty. The author argues that the focus on UPFs often overlooks the social, political, and economic factors at play, such as time constraints and the pressure to conform to "intensive mothering" culture. The author advocates for a more supportive society that facilitates good food choices for parents and children, rather than simply condemning convenient options like baby food pouches.
