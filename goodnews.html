          <p>Quantitative investment firm AQR Capital Management has seen several of its major hedge funds achieve double-digit returns in the first half of 2025, outperforming the broader market. The firm's Apex and Delphi funds, which utilize a mix of stock, macro, and arbitrage strategies, gained 11.4% and 11.6% respectively, compared to the S&P 500's 5.3% year-to-date increase. This performance highlights the success of AQR's quantitative, multi-strategy approach amidst a volatile market environment.

          <p>NYU Stern professor Suzy Welch advises job seekers to ask, "What kind of person should not work at this company?" during interviews to gain honest insights into a company's true values. Welch argues this question often elicits less-rehearsed and more revealing answers than direct inquiries about company culture, helping candidates assess if the environment is a good fit. Responses like "a person who doesn't want to text on weekends" can expose underlying expectations about work-life balance. The article suggests this approach helps align personal values with a potential employer's actual practices, leading to better job satisfaction.</p>

          <p>California has passed a significant reform of its landmark environmental law, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA), to expedite housing construction and address the state's affordability crisis. Governor Gavin Newsom, who championed the changes, argued that the 1970s-era law had become a bureaucratic obstacle to building much-needed housing. The overhaul aims to streamline the approval process for new developments, a move supported by housing advocates but opposed by some environmental groups. This legislative change is part of a broader state budget effort to tackle pressing issues like housing and homelessness.</p>

          <p>A widespread outage of the Clipper card payment system on Tuesday morning resulted in free rides for many commuters across the San Francisco Bay Area. Transit agencies like Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) opened their faregates, and bus operators waved passengers on without payment. The Clipper system, managed by the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, is used by hundreds of thousands of riders daily for buses, trains, and ferries. This disruption highlights the region's reliance on the centralized payment technology and occurs as the commission faces delays in rolling out an updated "Clipper 2.0" system.</p>

          <p>With interest rates on Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs) becoming more favorable, homeowners are advised to avoid several key mistakes to use them effectively. The article warns against failing to monitor the changing rate environment, as rates can fluctuate daily. It also cautions borrowers not to overborrow despite HELOCs being cheaper than alternatives like personal loans, as the home serves as collateral. Experts recommend using these funds for strategic purposes, such as value-adding home renovations, rather than for discretionary spending like vacations, to ensure long-term financial health.

While many reported that certain foods affected their sleep quality, a notable finding was the link between dairy products and nightmares. Among participants who felt food affected their dreams, 22% attributed disturbing dreams to dairy consumption, second only to desserts and sweets. The study's authors speculate that this association might be due to gastrointestinal distress from lactose intolerance during sleep, which could negatively impact dream content.</p>
