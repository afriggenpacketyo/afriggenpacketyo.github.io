          <p>Nvidia is investing $5 billion in Intel to co-develop data center and PC chips, bolstering Intel's turnaround efforts which already include investments from the U.S. government and Softbank. Intel shares surged following the news, which is seen as a major milestone for American high-tech manufacturing. The collaboration will involve Intel building x86 CPUs for Nvidia's AI platforms and x86 system-on-chips using Nvidia's RTX GPUs for PCs. The investment does not currently include Nvidia manufacturing its chips with Intel's foundry, raising questions about the extent of the collaboration.</p>

          <p>US firms have pledged £150bn in investment to the UK, expected to create 7,600 jobs, following the signing of the "Tech Prosperity Deal" between the US and UK. Microsoft and Google are among the companies committing billions to the UK, focusing on areas like AI, quantum computing, and nuclear power. However, some industries, like steel, have faced setbacks, and pharmaceutical companies have halted investment plans due to challenges in the UK business environment. While the government touts job creation, recent data shows a decline in UK payrolls and vacancies, suggesting a slowdown in domestic business investment.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by a quarter percentage point, lowering the benchmark to a target range of 4%-4.25%, signaling potential future cuts.

Market reactions were mixed, with the Dow initially rallying but later losing steam, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq posted losses. The meeting also highlighted political dynamics with new Governor Stephen Miran dissenting in favor of a larger rate cut, revealing a wide disparity among officials' views.
