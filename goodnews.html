          <p>Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is facing difficulties in the Tokyo assembly election, which is viewed as a precursor to the upcoming House of Councillors race. Yuriko Koike's regional party, Tomin First no Kai, is expected to perform well among independent voters, highlighting the appeal of their policies focused on quality of life. The election outcome is influenced by national issues like inflation, political funding scandals, and child-rearing policies. The LDP acknowledges a harsh evaluation from Tokyo residents, signaling potential shifts in the national political landscape.</p>

          <p>Vice President JD Vance clarified that the U.S. military action against Iranian nuclear sites does not constitute a war with Iran itself, but rather a targeted effort against Iran's nuclear program. Vance asserted that the strikes had significantly hindered Iran's ability to develop nuclear weapons in the foreseeable future. He made these remarks in an interview on ABC News' "This Week," emphasizing the precision and limited scope of the operation. The Vice President's comments aim to define the U.S. involvement and reassure the public about the administration's objectives.</p>

          <p>Senior Pentagon officials have disclosed details regarding the U.S. military operation, dubbed "Operation Midnight Hammer," which targeted three nuclear sites in Iran. The mission involved seven B-2 Spirit bombers and over 125 U.S. aircraft, employing precision-guided weapons and deception tactics to ensure mission success. According to Gen. Dan Caine, the operation inflicted "extremely severe damage and destruction" on the targeted sites. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth lauded the attack as an "incredible and overwhelming success," emphasizing that the operation did not target Iranian troops or civilians, but rather the Iranian nuclear program.</p>
