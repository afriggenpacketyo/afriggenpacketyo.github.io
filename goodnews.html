          <p>An exhibition is creating a unique cultural dialogue by juxtaposing artifacts from a Tang dynasty shipwreck with Western art. An artist involved in the project explains how she was inspired by a Monet painting of merchant ships, drawing a parallel between the historical maritime trade of goods and the borderless journey of art. The article suggests that just as ships once carried cargo across the globe, these ancient artifacts now travel to share their cultural messages, reinforcing the idea that art transcends boundaries.</p>

          <p>The World Bank has upgraded its 2025 economic growth forecast for China to 4.8%, a notable increase from its 4% prediction in April, bringing it closer to Beijing's official target. This revision is attributed to strong government stimulus measures and resilient export performance, which have helped offset a domestic real estate slump. However, the bank warns that growth is expected to slow to 4.2% in 2026 as stimulus fades and challenges like tepid consumer spending persist. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Chinese car manufacturer BYD announced that its UK sales skyrocketed by 880% in September compared to the previous year, establishing the country as its largest market outside of China. The company sold 11,271 vehicles, with the plug-in hybrid version of its Seal U SUV being the top seller. This success is partly attributed to the UK not imposing the high tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles that are in place in the European Union and the United States, making it an attractive market for expansion.</p>

          <p>In a significant conservation success, pine martens have been reintroduced to Exmoor National Park for the first time in a century. The Two Moors Pine Marten Project released nineteen of the mammals, sourced from Scottish populations, at undisclosed locations within the park. Each animal has been fitted with a radio collar, allowing researchers to track their adaptation and progress as they reclaim their role as a critical part of the local woodland ecosystem, balancing wildlife and restoring a native species.</p>

          <p>The European Union has weighed in on a diplomatic dispute by stating that United Nations Resolution 2758, passed in 1971, does not mention Taiwan. The EU spokesperson clarified that the resolution solely addressed the issue of switching China's representation in the UN from Taipei to Beijing. This position supports the view held by the United States and Taiwan, directly challenging China's long-standing claim that the resolution provides an international legal basis for its sovereignty over the island.</p>

          <p>California has passed a new law that requires streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube to ensure that the volume of their commercials is not significantly louder than the programs they accompany. This legislation extends a federal rule that has applied to broadcast and cable television since 2010, aiming to create a more consistent and less jarring viewing experience. Since many major streaming platforms are based in California, this state-level bill could effectively set a new national standard for ad volume.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers secured a 4-3 victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in Game 2 of the NLDS, taking a commanding 2-0 series lead. The team's veteran experience was on full display, from a patient four-run rally in the seventh inning to a crucial, high-pressure defensive "wheel play" in the ninth that prevented the Phillies from tying the game. Blake Snell delivered six scoreless innings, and despite a shaky ninth from the bullpen, the Dodgers' composure and execution proved decisive in a hostile road environment.</p>
