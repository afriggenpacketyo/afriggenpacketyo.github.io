          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-18 18:28:19 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ten Americans who were being held in Venezuela have been freed and are on their way back to the United States. Secretary of State Marco Rubio credited President Trump's leadership for securing their release, stating that every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free. The release was part of a broader prisoner exchange deal involving El Salvador, which agreed to repatriate hundreds of Venezuelan nationals held in its prisons. The administration reiterated its commitment to bringing home all Americans held hostage or unjustly detained abroad and continues to support the restoration of democracy in Venezuela.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A complex prisoner exchange has resulted in the release of 10 U.S. nationals from Venezuelan custody. The deal involved El Salvador repatriating approximately 250 detained Venezuelans, who had been deported from the U.S. to a high-security Salvadoran prison, in exchange for the Americans and a number of Venezuelan political prisoners. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele and U.S. officials confirmed the arrangement, which a senior U.S. official described as being "down to the wire." The successful negotiation highlights the warming relationship between the Trump administration and President Bukele, who played a critical facilitating role in the deal.</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish, which is backed by prominent investor Peter Thiel, has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) on the New York Stock Exchange. The company, led by former NYSE president Tom Farley, plans to trade under the ticker symbol "BLSH." This move represents another significant step for the digital asset industry's integration into mainstream finance, following recent public debuts by firms like Circle and Galaxy Digital. The filing states that Bullish ranked in the top five exchanges by spot volume for Bitcoin and Ether in the first quarter of 2025, with over $1.25 trillion in total trading volume since its launch.

          <p>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's recent six-day trip to China, which included meetings with Premier Li Qiang, is being interpreted as a sign of Canberra's strengthening resolve in its foreign policy. The visit, which included a CEO roundtable and cultural gestures, comes after a reset in diplomatic relations between the two nations. Analysts suggest that Australia is learning to navigate the intense rivalry between the U.S. and China more effectively. The trip demonstrates an effort to maintain crucial economic ties with Beijing while managing strategic pressures and alliances, particularly with the United States.</p>

          <p>Despite being an early pioneer in artificial intelligence with its FAIR research lab, Meta now finds itself lagging behind competitors like OpenAI and Google. In response, CEO Mark Zuckerberg is effectively rebooting the company's AI efforts, creating a new "Meta Superintelligence Labs" and reportedly spending lavishly to recruit top talent. This new push aims to build "personal superintelligence for everyone," though its practical applications seem focused on enhancing user engagement on Meta's existing social media platforms. The company's previous bet on open-source AI has not secured it a leading position, forcing a strategic pivot to catch up in the rapidly advancing field.</p>

          <p>Shares of the financial technology company Block, formerly known as Square, jumped significantly in extended trading following the announcement that it will join the S&P 500 index. Block is set to replace oil producer Hess, which was recently acquired by Chevron. Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 often leads to a stock rally, as index-tracking funds must purchase the company's shares to rebalance their portfolios. Despite being down for the year, Block's addition brings more technology weight to the benchmark index, reflecting its expansion from payments into crypto and other financial services.

          <p>Microsoft has changed its support protocols to ensure that its engineers based in China will no longer provide technical assistance for the company's U.S. defense and government cloud clients. The move is a response to national security concerns, highlighted in a recent ProPublica report, about the potential cybersecurity risks of having foreign engineers involved with sensitive Pentagon contracts. The report detailed an arrangement where U.S.-based "digital escorts" supervised more technically proficient engineers in China. Microsoft stated it is committed to providing the most secure services possible and will adjust its security protocols as needed.</p>

          <p>A new CBS News/YouGov poll reveals that a majority of Americans, approximately two-thirds, favor the U.S. returning to the moon and eventually sending astronauts to Mars. Support is particularly strong among younger Americans who did not witness the original moon landing. The 1969 Apollo 11 mission is still viewed by a large majority as a worthwhile achievement that contributes to national pride and technological advancement. These positive views on space exploration are generally consistent across different political and ideological lines, indicating broad public enthusiasm for future missions beyond Earth.</p>

          <p>The stock of online real estate company Opendoor experienced a massive 189% surge this week, a rally that began after hedge fund manager Eric Jackson publicly announced his firm had taken a new position. Jackson, who nearly shut down his fund after a difficult 2022, has been promoting Opendoor as a potential "100-bagger," drawing parallels to his successful early call on Carvana. Despite no fundamental improvement in Opendoor's business, which remains unprofitable, Jackson's growing social media influence appears to have fueled a speculative frenzy. He is betting on long-term revenue growth to justify a higher valuation. (not investment advice)</p>

Fitzpatrick expressed excitement about the challenge of playing with Scheffler, who he described as demonstrating "Tiger-like" dominance.

          <p>The new Postmaster General, David Steiner, sought to quell concerns about the future of the U.S. Postal Service by stating he does not support privatization. In his first message to employees, Steiner affirmed his belief in the USPS's current structure as a self-financing, independent entity of the executive branch. His appointment had raised concerns among unions due to his past role on the board of FedEx, a top competitor. While promising to assess the controversial 10-year reorganization plan initiated by his predecessor, his public commitment to a non-privatized USPS has been cautiously welcomed by union leaders.</p>

The landmark legislation has boosted market sentiment, with Ether's price climbing over 2% and outperforming Bitcoin for the week. This development is seen as a significant symbolic victory for the crypto industry, providing a legal framework that will be difficult for future administrations to overturn.

Netflix demonstrated healthy member growth and success in raising prices and generating revenue from its ad-supported tier. This suggests a resilient consumer appetite for streaming and provides a positive indicator for Disney, which is also implementing price hikes and focusing on the profitability of its Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ platforms. The results prove that major streaming services can increase prices and grow advertising income without significant subscriber loss. (not investment advice)</p>
