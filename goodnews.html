          <p>A rare dust storm swept through the Chicago area, significantly reducing visibility and prompting the National Weather Service to issue a dust storm warning, only the second time their Chicago office has done so and the first time such a warning included the city itself. The storm, caused by high winds blowing over dry farmlands, impacted travel, including halting flights at Midway International Airport and causing backups on expressways. Residents described the event as something out of history books, with some pulling over on Interstate 55 due to near-zero visibility. The dust storm cleared up within 30 to 45 minutes for most areas.</p>

          <p>President Trump's tour of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates was marked by extravagant displays of honor and respect, including fighter jet escorts and opulent ceremonies. Trump secured over $2 trillion in economic investments between the United States and these nations, which are major purchasers of American military equipment. He praised the wealth and efficiency of his hosts, noting their ability to pay upfront for deals. The trip also served as a campaign-style rally, with Trump making familiar political statements to friendly audiences.</p>

          <p>Two separate cases involving judges in Wisconsin and Massachusetts have brought attention to the rare and controversial issue of judges facing criminal charges for allegedly helping undocumented immigrants evade immigration authorities.

A similar case involves Judge Shelley Joseph in Massachusetts, who is accused of helping an undocumented immigrant evade an ICE agent; her case highlights the tension between state and federal authority.</p>

          <p>Following the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, 53 abused and malnourished children were rescued from the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult's compound. Mitsuo Hosaka, working at a child welfare center, took charge of these children, who were initially hostile and brainwashed, demanding to return to the cult. Over time, the children began to show signs of recovery, engaging in team sports and forming bonds with the staff. The children were eventually integrated into national child guidance centers, with some reuniting with parents who had left the cult.</p>
