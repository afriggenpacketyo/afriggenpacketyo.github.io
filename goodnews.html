          <p>A new book, "Me, But Better," by author Olga Khazan details her journey to consciously alter her own personality traits, moving from being anxious and introverted to more outgoing. The article discusses the scientific basis for personality change, suggesting that seemingly fixed traits can be modified through deliberate effort and stepping outside one's comfort zone. It features insights from a psychology professor who affirms that it is possible to change ingrained aspects of one's personality. The book chronicles Khazan's use of techniques like improv comedy to foster this transformation.</p>

          <p>An inconspicuous building in Washington, D.C., houses the Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum, a landmark commemorating a pivotal post-Civil War effort. After the war, Clara Barton established an office to locate and identify thousands of missing or deceased Union soldiers, a revolutionary undertaking that forever changed the military's approach to accounting for its members. This article highlights the museum's role in preserving the story of Barton's compassionate and meticulous work. Her efforts provided closure to countless families and established a precedent for how soldiers are honored.</p>

          <p>Germany is pivoting its foreign policy to focus on a strengthened security alliance with France and the United Kingdom, often referred to as the "E3." This strategic shift, highlighted by a new comprehensive treaty with the UK, is a response to the ongoing threat from Russia and uncertainty regarding future US commitments to NATO. Chancellor Friedrich Merz has emphasized that Europe must become more independent in its defense capabilities. The cooperation aims to leverage the nuclear deterrents of France and the UK to supplement, and if necessary, replace US protection for the continent.</p>

          <p>World number one golfer Scottie Scheffler is poised to win his first Open Championship, holding a commanding four-shot lead heading into the final round at Royal Portrush. Scheffler shot a bogey-free 67 on Saturday, including an eagle, to reach 14 under par for the tournament. A victory would mark the third leg of a career Grand Slam for the American star, who has a perfect record of winning major championships when leading after 54 holes. His closest competitor is China's Li Haotong, with Rory McIlroy trailing by six shots.</p>

          <p>This article reflects on the 81st anniversary of the July 20, 1944, plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, led by German army officer Claus von Stauffenberg. The bombing at the Wolf's Lair headquarters failed, and the subsequent coup attempt, known as "Operation Valkyrie," was quickly suppressed, leading to the execution of Stauffenberg and around 200 co-conspirators. While the plotters were long considered traitors, they are now honored in Germany as heroes who dared to resist the Nazi regime. The article also provides historical context, noting that their motivations were complex and aimed at saving Germany from total defeat.</p>

          <p>Major champions Bryson DeChambeau and Henrik Stenson have voiced criticism over the enforcement of slow-play rules at The Open Championship. Both golfers were warned by officials during the third round for their pace, a day after another player received a controversial penalty. DeChambeau described the pace in the first two rounds as "out of control" and suggested a more consistent, transparent timing system for all players. Stenson noted the inconsistency of officials ignoring long rounds early in the tournament only to suddenly crack down on minor time overages on Saturday.</p>

          <p>This article explores the efforts of Generation Life, a faith-based group of Gen Z activists who visit the Jersey shore to advocate for chastity before marriage. Framing their message as a "countercultural" response to modern dating and social media pressures, they engage with young people about love, relationships, and self-worth. The activists argue that chastity is not merely about abstinence but about seeing people for their whole selves, a message they believe resonates with a generation feeling the negative effects of a hyper-sexualized and superficial online culture. Their approach attempts to rebrand a traditional concept for a contemporary audience.</p>

Muncy, who was injured in a slide at third base on July 2, has already begun running, playing catch, and taking swings. Doctors told him he was extremely lucky to have avoided a more severe, season-ending injury. His return is highly anticipated by the team, whose offense has struggled significantly since the slugger was placed on the injured list.</p>
