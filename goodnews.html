          <p>Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche, announced it will sell its flu pill, Xofluza, directly to some patients at a significant discount to broaden access. The new program targets uninsured or underinsured individuals, offering the drug for a $50 cash price through partners like Amazon Pharmacy and Mark Cuban's Cost Plus Drug Company, a 70% reduction from its list price. This move comes as pharmaceutical companies face increasing pressure from the Trump administration to implement measures that lower prescription drug costs for American consumers.</p>

          <p>Amid efforts to reduce the shipping industry's significant carbon footprint, some experts are revisiting the idea of using nuclear power to propel cargo vessels. Proponents argue that modern, next-generation reactors would be inherently safer and more efficient than the technology used in the 1960s, offering zero-emission transit and a vast operational range without refueling. However, significant regulatory, safety, and economic hurdles remain, and the International Maritime Organization is only in the early stages of updating its decades-old rules for civilian nuclear vessels.</p>

          <p>Skygazers in the Northern Hemisphere have the rare opportunity to observe two bright green comets, named Lemmon and SWAN, as they pass through the inner solar system. Both comets are believed to originate from the Oort Cloud and can be spotted near the horizon shortly after sunset with binoculars. Comet Lemmon is expected to make its closest approach to Earth around Tuesday, while Comet SWAN is moving away from the sun and will likely become dimmer. The comets' green hue is caused by gases streaming off their surfaces as they are heated by the sun.</p>
