        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With potential Federal Reserve rate cuts on the horizon, savings experts are weighing in on the most beneficial certificate of deposit (CD) term. Short-term CDs are currently offering the highest interest rates, making them attractive for maximizing returns. Long-term CDs, while having lower rates currently, offer longer-term security and predictability, especially if further rate cuts occur. A CD ladder, which involves opening multiple CD accounts with varying terms, provides a balance between locking in rates and maintaining flexibility. It's crucial to research and compare rates from different banks and credit unions before opening a CD account. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage lending experts outline three possible mortgage rate scenarios for the summer, given the Federal Reserve's cautious approach to inflation. Experts predict rates could remain stable, rise, or decline depending on economic reports related to inflation, employment, and consumer spending. A stable rate environment would require consistent economic conditions, while rising rates could be triggered by increased inflation or rapid economic growth. Declining rates would necessitate signs of a cooling economy, prompting the Fed to cut rates. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal seeking to revive a copyright infringement lawsuit against Ed Sheeran over his song "Thinking Out Loud." The lawsuit, filed by Structured Asset Sales, claimed Sheeran unlawfully copied elements from Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On." A judge previously ruled that the musical elements Sheeran was accused of copying were too common to be protected by copyright. A separate lawsuit filed by Ed Townsend's heirs over the same issue resulted in a jury ruling in favor of Sheeran.</p>
