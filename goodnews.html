        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK economy demonstrated unexpected resilience in the first three months of the year, expanding by 0.7%, surpassing analyst forecasts of 0.6%. The Office for National Statistics attributes this growth primarily to the robust performance of the UK services sector, coupled with a significant increase in production. While Chancellor Rachel Reeves hailed these figures as evidence of the UK economy's strength, others cautioned that this rate of growth is unlikely to persist due to impending US import tariffs and increased UK employer taxes which came into effect in April. Several economists suggest that this period may represent the peak of economic performance for the year, citing weaker data for April and looming global economic uncertainties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>While overall inflation has cooled down, certain everyday items like coffee and beef continue to experience price increases. Coffee prices have soared by 9.6% year-over-year due to droughts in Vietnam and Brazil impacting global supply, while beef prices have risen due to a shrunken national herd following drought conditions in 2022. Additionally, car repair costs have climbed 7.6% due to the increasing complexity of modern vehicles and a shortage of skilled technicians. Despite these increases, economist Omar Sharif notes that the impact on individual budgets depends on the weight of these items in a person's overall spending, suggesting that some price drops may offset the impact of these increases.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a significant drop of approximately 4% following President Trump's statements in Doha, Qatar, suggesting progress in securing a nuclear deal with Iran. The prospect of an agreement has raised expectations that economic sanctions on Tehran could be lifted, potentially increasing global oil supply. International benchmark Brent crude futures fell to $63.65 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures decreased to $60.66, reflecting market anticipation of increased Iranian oil exports. The market reacted swiftly to Trump's comments, signaling a potential shift in the geopolitical landscape affecting oil markets.</p>

          <p>President Trump voiced his preference for Apple to manufacture its products in the United States rather than expanding production in India. Trump referenced Apple's $500 billion investment commitment to the U.S. and urged CEO Tim Cook to prioritize domestic production. Apple has been increasing its manufacturing presence in India to reduce reliance on China, where the majority of iPhones are currently assembled. Trump stated that the U.S. has accommodated Apple's production in China for years and now expects the company to increase its manufacturing footprint within the United States, adding that Apple is going to be "upping" its production in the United States, without disclosing further details.</p>

Despite these efforts, political undercurrents persist, with broadcasters calling for debates on Israel's participation and activists citing Russia's exclusion as a precedent.

          <p>Senator John Kennedy argues that the U.S. Supreme Court should restrict the power of individual district court judges to issue universal injunctions that halt federal government policies nationwide. He contends that the Constitution does not grant such broad authority to district courts and that these injunctions undermine the judicial process. Kennedy emphasizes that universal injunctions allow a single judge to overrule policies supported by numerous other judges and compel the Supreme Court to make rushed decisions on complex legal issues. He urges the court to seize the opportunity to end this practice, which he believes threatens the stability of the judiciary and the system of government.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on the Trump administration's challenge to birthright citizenship, a constitutional provision guaranteeing automatic citizenship to those born in the United States. The arguments are expected to focus primarily on the legality of nationwide injunctions, which have been used to block Trump's immigration policies. The 14th Amendment, enacted after the Civil War, aimed to reverse the Dred Scott decision, granting citizenship to all persons born or naturalized in the U.S. The legal challenge has prompted debate over the power of federal district court judges to issue nationwide rulings and the implications for immigration policy.</p>

While support for hardline deportation policies has softened slightly among independents, deep divisions remain over whether immigrants should receive the same legal protections as citizens.

The proposed legislation, called The Life of the Mother Act, seeks to clarify that doctors can perform abortions when a woman's life is at risk, even if not "imminent," and would provide training for physicians. The bill has received mixed reactions, with some medical groups endorsing it while others argue it doesn't go far enough to protect women's health.

          <p>Marjut Hannonen, the EU's head of trade in Beijing, stated that the European Union has no interest in reviving talks on the stalled Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) with China. She noted that trade ties with China have steadily deteriorated due to increasing barriers for businesses. Despite lobbying efforts from Chinese officials, including the former ambassador to the EU, the European side remains uninterested in resuming negotiations. The European Parliament voted to delay ratification of the CAI in 2021 over human rights concerns in Xinjiang, and these concerns remain.</p>

          <h2>Palantir's Stock Performance Questioned Despite Strong Quarterly Results</h2>

          <p>Palantir Technologies reported strong first-quarter earnings, with revenue growth accelerating and surpassing expectations, but the stock price fell following the announcement. The company's high valuation, with a price-to-earnings ratio consistently above 200, has led some analysts to label it a meme stock despite its growth and profitability. Investors are concerned that the company's stock is overvalued and that the market's expectations are too high, leading to a lack of significant upward movement despite positive financial results. Despite concerns, CEO Alex Karp maintains a positive outlook, stating the business is in the middle of a shift in the adoption of their software.</p>

          <h2>Awoniyi Injury Could Have Been Prevented By Earlier Offside Call, Says Aina</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-15 04:01:18 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ola Aina, a teammate of Nottingham Forest striker Taiwo Awoniyi, believes that Awoniyi's recent injury could have been prevented if the assistant referee had flagged an offside during the play. Awoniyi sustained a serious abdominal injury after colliding with a post while attempting to get on the end of a cross. The Nigerian player was woken from an induced coma on Wednesday after surgery to repair a serious abdominal injury. Aina stated that Anthony Elanga, who made the cross, was "miles offside" and that the flag should have been raised earlier, however the assistant referee did not raise their flag until the play was completed because of an offside protocol introduced in 2020.</p>

          <p>A juror has been dismissed from the trial of Erin Patterson, an Australian woman accused of poisoning three relatives with poisonous mushrooms. The male juror was discharged after the judge found there was a "reasonable possibility" he had discussed the case with family and friends, a potential breach of court protocol. Patterson has pleaded not guilty to the murder of three people and the attempted murder of another, all of whom consumed a lunch prepared at her home in July 2023. The judge reminded the remaining jurors that they should only talk about the case "in the privacy of the jury room".</p>
