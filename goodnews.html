          <p>Tesla's board has awarded CEO Elon Musk a substantial new stock package valued at approximately $29 billion, despite a Delaware court previously invalidating a similar 2018 plan. This move is seen by some analysts as an effort to secure Musk's leadership until at least 2030 and alleviate shareholder concerns amid the company's declining stock price and profits. The award comes as Tesla faces intensified competition and investor worries over Musk's political engagements and focus on other ventures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase has sparked a significant online debate with a musical advertisement that satirically portrays the U.K. as plagued by economic problems like high prices and job losses. The ad, titled "Everything is Fine," was praised by some in the fintech and venture capital communities for its critique but drew criticism from others for being self-promotional and misleading. The controversy highlights ongoing tensions between the crypto industry and traditional financial systems, with figures like former Chancellor George Osborne weighing in on Britain's need to embrace crypto innovation.</p>

          <p>Millions of UK consumers who purchased a car using financing over the last 18 years may be eligible for compensation due to hidden commissions. A recent Supreme Court ruling found that some dealers charged excessive fees or failed to properly disclose them, establishing a precedent for mis-selling claims. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is developing a compensation scheme, with the first payments expected in 2026. For now, consumers are advised to wait for the official scheme rather than using claims companies, which charge a fee for their services.</p>

          <p>Republican Rep. Nancy Mace has officially launched her campaign for governor of South Carolina, announcing her bid at The Citadel, her alma mater. Mace, who has served in Congress since 2021, has become known as a GOP firebrand but has also taken more moderate stances on certain issues. She enters what is expected to be a crowded Republican primary, positioning herself against South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson and other contenders. Mace cited issues like the economy, crime, and ideology in state colleges as key motivations for her run.</p>

The collaboration will bring Baidu's driverless robotaxis to Europe, with initial deployments planned for the U.K. and Germany starting in 2026, pending regulatory approval. This move follows Lyft's recent acquisition of the European ride-hailing company FreeNow and marks another international push for Baidu, which has also partnered with Uber for expansion in the Middle East and Asia.</p>

          <p>An article from Vox details the challenges faced by LARP Adventure Program, a Massachusetts-based summer camp that uses live-action role-playing to teach creative problem-solving and build community for youth. Founder Eric Love and marketing coordinator Elle Dunne discuss the financial precarity of running a small, specialized business, including rising costs and the difficulty of keeping the program affordable for the families they serve. Despite the struggles, they remain committed to their mission of providing a safe, empowering space, particularly for neurodivergent and LGBTQ+ kids who find community through the program.</p>

          <p>This personal essay recounts the author's experience of turning to "The Muppet Show" for comfort and escape while caring for her dying father, who had briefly worked as a writer for Jim Henson in the 1970s. She describes how the show's blend of silliness and sophistication provided an antidote to the daily dread of her father's illness. Rediscovering the Muppets with her own children, she found unexpected connections to her father's past and humor, using the show's surreal world as a way to navigate her profound sense of loss and the porous boundary between memory and reality.</p>

          <p>In a thrilling conclusion to their Test cricket series, India secured a victory over England by just six runs, drawing the series 2-2. The final match at The Oval was filled with drama, including an injured Chris Woakes coming out to bat with his arm in a sling in a courageous but ultimately unsuccessful effort to support his teammate. India's bowlers, led by Mohammed Siraj, held their nerve in the final moments to deny England a record-breaking run chase. The hard-fought series was celebrated by both teams and their supporters as a memorable contest.</p>

          <p>Dan Osborn, a union leader and industrial mechanic, is running as an independent for a U.S. Senate seat in Nebraska, challenging Republican incumbent Pete Ricketts. After a surprisingly strong performance in a 2024 race, Osborn is campaigning on a working-class platform, contrasting his life experience with that of the wealthy Ricketts. While Nebraska is a solidly Republican state, Osborn hopes to appeal to voters across the political spectrum who are frustrated with the two-party system. His campaign has prompted political forecasters to watch the race more closely.</p>

          <p>A new searchable public database containing over 1.5 million pages of records on police use of force and misconduct from nearly 700 California law enforcement agencies is now available. The Police Records Access Project, a collaboration between UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and several news outlets, aims to significantly increase transparency and public access to these internal records. The project is the result of years of work by journalists, data scientists, and lawyers who collected and organized the documents, which were obtained through public records requests following a 2018 state law.</p>

          <h2>Survey Reveals Children Prefer Unsupervised Play Over Screen Time</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new survey of American children aged 8 to 12 reveals a strong preference for unstructured, in-person play with friends over online socialization or adult-organized activities. However, the study also shows that most children are heavily restricted in their real-world freedoms, with many not allowed to play unsupervised even in their own yards. The authors argue that this lack of independence, driven by parental fears, pushes kids toward their phones as the only space for unsupervised social interaction. They advocate for restoring free play to improve children's mental health and development.</p>
