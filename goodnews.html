          <p>The Marks & Spencer website is currently down, preventing users from browsing, as the retailer continues to address the fallout from a cyber-attack that occurred last month. Customers have been unable to place online orders for several weeks, and the company anticipates that its online services will remain disrupted until July, with a gradual return to normal operations. M&S estimates that the cyber-attack will negatively impact this year's profits by approximately ¬£300 million, a significant financial blow to the retailer.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government has launched a revamped gasoline subsidy aimed at lowering prices by 10 yen per liter to alleviate cost-of-living pressures on consumers. Under the new scheme, the government will provide a fixed subsidy to wholesalers regardless of current prices, with the goal of reducing the wholesale gasoline price by 7.40 yen per liter in the first week and then by at least 1 yen weekly until it reaches 10 yen lower by mid-June. The reintroduction of the subsidies comes ahead of the House of Councillors election slated for the summer.

          <p>Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent have concurred that the current dollar-yen exchange rate accurately reflects economic fundamentals during tariff negotiations.

          <p>Emerging markets (EM) stocks are gaining traction as the ‚Äúsell U.S.‚Äù narrative strengthens, spurred by Moody's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Bank of America has touted emerging markets as ‚Äúthe next bull market,‚Äù citing a weaker U.S. dollar, peaking U.S. bond yields, and China's economic recovery. JPMorgan has also upgraded EM equities due to thawing U.S.-China trade relations and attractive valuations. A decline in confidence in U.S. assets has boosted the appeal of emerging markets, as reflected in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index's year-to-date performance. (not investment advice)</p>
