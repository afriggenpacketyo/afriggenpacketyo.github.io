          <p>During a screening of "Final Destination: Bloodlines" at Cinema Ocho in La Plata, Buenos Aires, a portion of the theater's ceiling collapsed, injuring several viewers. Fiamma Villaverde, an attendee celebrating her birthday with her daughter and a friend, reported being struck by debris on her shoulder, back, knee, and ankle. Moviegoers have alleged that heavy rain contributed to the collapse, which prompted social media users to remark on the eerie life-imitating-art coincidence. The theater has yet to issue an official statement.</p>

          <p>Physicists are studying the acoustics of spaceflight, particularly rocket launches, to understand the impact of increasing rocket noise on communities. SpaceX's frequent Falcon 9 launches have raised concerns about noise levels, including sonic booms from returning boosters. Researchers are investigating why Falcon 9 boosters generate a three-part sonic boom and are preparing for the even louder Starship rocket. The goal is to gather data that could help lessen disruptions from rocket noise before problems become pervasive.</p>
