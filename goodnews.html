          <p>Christian singer Brandon Lake revealed that Jelly Roll's decision to throw his phone into a river after feeling overwhelmed inspired him to establish firmer boundaries in his own life. Lake collaborated with Jelly Roll on his new album, "King of Hearts," and was intrigued by Jelly Roll's story of needing to disconnect from constant communication. Inspired, Lake obtained a new phone number to focus on his inner circle and prioritize his mental health, acknowledging the need to balance success with personal well-being. Lake also discussed his new album and how he focuses on his faith, family, and personal healing through music and farm life, explaining how these factors have helped him overcome mental health struggles and maintain a healthy lifestyle, and he says that Jelly Roll has been a constant source of encouragement.

          <p>Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has decided against dissolving the lower house of parliament for the time being, according to a lawmaker. This decision makes same-day elections for both chambers of parliament in July unlikely. The ruling bloc led by Ishiba's Liberal Democratic Party does not hold a majority in the House of Representatives. A no-confidence motion, if passed, would require the prime minister to dissolve the 465-member chamber or the Cabinet to resign en masse within 10 days.</p>

          <p>Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Florida is working to combat the U.S. shortage of air traffic controllers through an accelerated training program. The FAA is currently short over 3,000 certified controllers, leading to mandatory overtime and six-day workweeks for existing personnel. Embry-Riddle's program mirrors the FAA Academy's curriculum and allows students to begin medical and background checks early, potentially skipping the academy altogether. Graduates are eager to fill the staffing gaps and are not intimidated by the job's stresses, and with additional financial incentives and streamlined hiring processes, the FAA hopes to attract more candidates and address the ongoing staffing crisis.</p>

          <p>With a significant heat wave expected to hit much of the United States, health experts recommend taking precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses. Checking the heat index, wearing lightweight clothing, seeking shade, and staying hydrated are crucial steps to staying safe in hot weather. Recognizing the symptoms of heat exhaustion and taking breaks are also important, particularly for vulnerable populations like seniors and children. Experts emphasize that even without a heat advisory, caution should be taken when outside on a hot day, and it is crucial to plan activities accordingly.</p>

          <p>Organizers of Juneteenth events across the country are facing new challenges, including safety concerns and decreased corporate support, but remain committed to celebrating the holiday. In Bend, Oregon, the annual festival was initially canceled due to safety concerns but was revived as a smaller, indoor event. In West Virginia, state employees will no longer receive Juneteenth as a paid holiday, prompting organizers to move the Charleston event to a Friday. Despite these hurdles, organizers like Willie Sims in Nashville emphasize the importance of continuing the celebrations, which have been a part of communities since 1866.</p>
