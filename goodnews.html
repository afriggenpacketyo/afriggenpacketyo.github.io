          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-24 12:19:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>After a years-long debate over racial sensitivity, the Berlin-Mitte district has officially renamed "Mohrenstrasse" to "Anton Wilhelm Amo Strasse." The original name used the word "Mohr," an outdated and derogatory German term for people of African descent. The new name honors Anton Wilhelm Amo, a Ghanian-born 18th-century scholar who is considered the first prominent Black philosopher at a German university. The change, celebrated by local politicians as a "clear sign in favor of respect and diversity," proceeded after a court initially halted and then approved the renaming, marking a significant moment for racial inclusion in the city.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government is set to introduce a new sentencing bill that would grant courts in England and Wales the power to impose broader restrictions, such as bans from pubs, sporting events, and driving, for a wider range of offenses. The legislation aims to create more robust community sentences and is part of a larger overhaul that includes measures to ease prison overcrowding, such as restricting short sentences and allowing early release for some well-behaved inmates. These reforms are based on recommendations from a recent independent review. Critics and industry groups have raised concerns about the practicalities of enforcing such bans.</p>

The event, Europe's largest street party, began early with the traditional J'ouvert celebration, where revelers were covered in bright paint and powder. The children's parade followed, featuring elaborate costumes, steel drums, and floats with powerful sound systems. Millions are expected to attend the Bank Holiday weekend event, which celebrates Caribbean culture with food, music, and a 72-second silence to commemorate the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire and others.</p>

          <p>Nigerian authorities have confirmed the rescue of 76 hostages, including many children, from a "bandit" camp in the northwestern state of Katsina. The successful operation was carried out by the military, which used a series of precision airstrikes to target the criminal hideout. The rescued individuals are believed to have been among those abducted during a deadly assault on a mosque last week. This action is part of a broader government strategy to dismantle the criminal networks that have long plagued remote parts of Nigeria with kidnappings and violence, despite previous efforts to curb their activities.</p>

          <p>SpaceX launched its 33rd commercial resupply mission to the International Space Station early Sunday, sending a Dragon capsule with 2.5 tons of supplies, science experiments, and station hardware. The mission is also carrying a special add-on thruster kit designed to help the ISS maintain its altitude, a task primarily handled by Russian spacecraft. This new capability will allow the Dragon capsule to provide re-boosts for the station, with the first burn scheduled for September. The launch from Cape Canaveral was successful, and the Dragon capsule is expected to dock with the orbiting laboratory on Monday morning.</p>

          <p>On Ukraine's Independence Day, President Volodymyr Zelensky delivered a defiant address, vowing that the nation would continue fighting for its freedom and seeking a "just peace." The day was marked by diplomatic activity, including a visit from Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who pledged new military aid, and a prisoner exchange involving 146 soldiers from each side. The celebrations occurred amid ongoing conflict, with Russia accusing Ukraine of a drone attack on the Kursk nuclear plant, a claim Kyiv dismissed as Russian propaganda. International partners, including the UK, Norway, and Sweden, also announced new support packages for Ukraine.</p>

          <p>SpaceX, founded by Elon Musk in 2002, has grown from a struggling startup to a dominant force upon which the U.S. space industry heavily relies. The company's survival and subsequent success were critically bolstered by pivotal multi-billion dollar NASA contracts to resupply the International Space Station and later, to transport astronauts. Today, SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon capsule are NASA's primary vehicles for human spaceflight, while its Starlink satellites provide vital internet services globally. The company's dominance in launch services and its development of the Starship rocket have made it an indispensable partner for both government and commercial space ambitions.</p>

          <p>Despite a significant "charm offensive" from Beijing aimed at using trade to create distance between the United States and its allies, these nations are largely resisting a political realignment. The article argues that this resistance is not temporary but is anchored in foundational security priorities and centuries of shared cultural and strategic integration with Washington. While economic ties with China are substantial, allies instinctively prioritize their defense commitments and intelligence-sharing agreements with the U.S. As a result, their discontent with American policies leads to calls for restraint rather than any meaningful support for a China-led geopolitical bloc.</p>

          <p>A pair of coyotes, nicknamed Romeo and Juliet, have become established residents of New York's Central Park, drawing the attention of local photographers and wildlife enthusiasts. Their presence is part of a broader trend of coyotes expanding their territory eastward and adapting to urban environments across the United States. Researchers with Gotham Coyote estimate about 20 coyotes live in New York City, having learned to navigate the urban landscape. Officials and advocates emphasize the importance of coexistence, urging the public to observe the animals from a distance and not to feed them, noting that attacks on humans are extremely rare.</p>
