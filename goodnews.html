          <p>A UK minister warns of potential drinking water shortages within a decade, prompting the government to expedite the planning for two new reservoirs.  This decision overrides local concerns, potentially causing public backlash, though supporters argue it's necessary for the greater good.  The reservoirs, if completed, would increase water resilience in a region facing high demand and drought risks.  However, some experts advocate for alternative water management strategies, such as reducing waste and improving water recycling, to address the issue more effectively.</p>

          <p>The article contrasts the author's experience of a stranger gently correcting her daughter's behavior in Prague with the reluctance of Americans to do the same.  This difference highlights the shift from a more communal approach to child-rearing to a more privatized model in the US.  Historians note that collective child discipline was once common in America, but has declined due to societal changes and increased legal concerns. The author argues that a more balanced approach, involving both parental and community involvement, may be beneficial.</p>
