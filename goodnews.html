          <p>Following two days of high-level discussions in London, the United States and China have reached an agreement on a trade framework, which now awaits approval from both President Trump and President Xi Jinping. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick indicated the framework aims to implement the Geneva consensus, reached during a meeting in Switzerland in mid-May, which included a 90-day suspension of reciprocal tariffs. Jianwei Xu, a senior economist at Natixis, noted that while this framework signals a commitment to de-escalation and continued dialogue, the realization of concrete agreements remains uncertain. If both leaders approve the framework, it will be implemented, marking a potential step towards easing trade tensions between the two nations. Optimism surrounding the potential trade agreement is tempered by the need for both leaders to approve the framework. </p>
