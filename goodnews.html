          <p>World number one Aryna Sabalenka fought back from the brink of a major upset to secure her place in the Wimbledon semi-finals. She defeated 37-year-old German qualifier Laura Siegemund in a grueling three-set match that lasted nearly three hours. Siegemund's unconventional style, featuring slices and drop shots, frustrated the title favorite, who had to overcome a break in the final set to clinch the victory. Sabalenka credited her improved mental fortitude for helping her stay calm and pull through the difficult match, setting up a semi-final clash with Amanda Anisimova.</p>

          <p>The American Federation of Teachers is partnering with Anthropic, Microsoft, and OpenAI to launch a $23 million National Academy for AI Instruction. The initiative aims to train educators on how to effectively and ethically use artificial intelligence in the classroom, addressing both the potential benefits and concerns like cheating. The AFT's goal is to empower teachers to harness AI as a tool to enhance learning, rather than being replaced by it. The academy will offer free virtual training to all 1.8 million union members, with a goal of training 400,000 educators in person over five years.</p>

          <p>French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer are expected to finalize a new agreement to curb migrant crossings in the English Channel during Macron's state visit. The talks are focused on a "one in, one out" returns deal, which would allow the UK to send migrants back to France in exchange for accepting asylum seekers with family ties in Britain. The deal would also grant French police new powers to intercept boats in shallow waters. Macron emphasized that while bilateral cooperation is increasing, a broader European-level solution is essential for long-term success.</p>

          <p>A provision in a new budget bill establishes "Trump accounts," government-seeded investment vehicles for children, aiming to promote early saving and investment habits. Under the plan, children born between 2025 and 2028 will receive an initial $1,000 from the government, with parents and employers able to make additional contributions. While the money grows tax-deferred, withdrawals are generally taxed as regular income, unlike more tax-advantaged options like 529 plans or Roth IRAs. Financial experts view it as a positive "no-brainer" for eligible families to accept the initial funds but advise considering other accounts for specific long-term goals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A monthly survey from the New York Federal Reserve reveals that consumer expectations for inflation have fallen back to pre-tariff levels, suggesting that widespread fears of price spikes have subsided. Respondents in June anticipated an inflation rate of 3% for the next 12 months, down from a peak of 3.6% earlier in the year when tariff threats were more prominent. While the overall inflation outlook has eased, consumers still expect significant price increases in specific areas like medical care, college education, and rent.

By fielding a young, inexperienced roster missing many star players, he challenged them to prove their dedication and heart, successfully rebuilding the team's identity and determination ahead of the World Cup. Players like Diego Luna emerged as strong contenders for future rosters, demonstrating a new, non-negotiable standard of effort and pride. The coach's task now is to merge this newfound grit with the top-tier talent that was absent from the tournament.</p>

          <p>A new survey suggests that the post-pandemic trend of "revenge spending" is giving way to "revenge saving," as many Americans adjust their financial habits based on their feelings about the economy. This "vibe-based budgeting," particularly common among younger generations, is driven by anxiety over rising prices and potential recession, leading consumers to build up emergency funds. Financial experts caution against letting emotions solely drive financial decisions and recommend a more intentional approach. They advise savers to assess their finances, use "reverse budgeting" to prioritize saving, and automate contributions to build a secure financial future.</p>
