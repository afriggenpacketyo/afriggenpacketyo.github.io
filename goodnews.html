          <p>Elon Musk has completed his 130-day stint as head of the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) within the Trump administration, thanking President Trump for the opportunity to reduce wasteful spending.

He expressed pride in the DOGE mission, highlighting its integration into government operations. However, Musk criticized Trump's spending bill for undermining the team's efforts, signaling potential disagreements over fiscal policy.

          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-29 06:31:58 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>UK car manufacturing experienced a sharp decline in April, reaching its lowest output in over 70 years, primarily due to US tariffs and the timing of Easter. The Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) attributed the 16% year-over-year decrease to US tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars, along with the industry's broader transition from petrol cars to electric vehicles. While a US court blocked many of Trump's tariffs, the ruling does not apply to tariffs on steel, aluminum, and cars. The SMMT noted that new trade deals with the US, EU, and India could potentially boost future production. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A deceptively simple reform of building codes, allowing single-staircase apartment buildings up to six stories, could ease the housing crunch in the US. Unlike the US, where double staircases are standard for buildings over three stories, many countries allow single-stair buildings, potentially cutting construction costs by 10% and increasing usable floor space. Advocates argue that modern safety features like sprinklers make single-stair buildings just as safe, and the change could encourage developers to build more "missing middle" housing. However, fire safety officials express concerns about evacuation times and resident safety, advocating for more research before revising building codes.</p>
