        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>State Assemblyman Zohran Mamdani declared victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary after a strong first-round showing, leading former Gov. Andrew Cuomo to concede. Mamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, gained momentum with younger voters and focused on a progressive platform, while Cuomo campaigned on his experience and past confrontations with President Trump. Despite Cuomo's concession, the race will proceed to a ranked-choice count due to no candidate reaching 50% of the vote. The Board of Elections plans to certify the results on July 15, with incumbent Mayor Eric Adams running as an independent in the fall, potentially complicating the general election. The optimism score balances Mamdani's progressive victory with the complexities of the upcoming election.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump asserted that the joint U.S.-Israeli strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities resulted in "total obliteration" of the program, contradicting an early Pentagon report suggesting limited damage. Trump insisted the program was set back "basically decades" and dismissed concerns about rebuilding, stating it would be someone else's problem. Defense Secretary Hegseth and Secretary of State Rubio supported Trump's position, alleging the report leak had political motives, while Democratic senators called for answers and negotiations with Iran. The president also expressed optimism about future U.S. and Iranian relations, noting their agreement to a ceasefire. The optimism score reflects the balance between the severity of the attack and the hope for future relations.</p>

          <p>NATO allies agreed to more than double their defense spending target to 5% of GDP by 2035, marking a significant move amid tensions in the Middle East and the war between Ukraine and Russia. The declaration emphasizes unity in the face of security threats, particularly from Russia and terrorism, requiring allies to invest at least 3.5% of GDP on defense and the remainder on security and defense-related infrastructure. Member states will submit annual plans to reach the goal, following pressure from the U.S. for allies to share more of the collective defense burden. The alliance also reaffirmed its commitment to collective defense under Article 5. The optimism score reflects the increased commitment to security amid global tensions.</p>

          <h2>British Pound Hits Multi-Year High Amid Dollar Weakness</h2>

          <p>The British pound is trading at its highest level in more than three years, driven primarily by underlying dollar weakness. Analysts are divided on the potential for further upside, with some attributing the pound's strength to the U.S. economy and unpredictable trade policies. Others suggest the movement is a recovery from the "extreme low" following Liz Truss's mini budget. Forecasts vary, with some predicting further gains against the dollar and others anticipating a decline. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Germany conducted searches on more than 65 properties and questioned suspects as part of an operation to combat online hate speech. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA) supervised the operation, which involved over 140 investigations. Approximately two-thirds of the online statements under criminal investigation came from radical right-wing sources. The individuals being investigated are accused of inciting hatred, insulting politicians, and using symbols of terrorist groups. The optimism score reflects the efforts to combat hate speech.</p>
