          <p>Shares of South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean surged over 16% following the announcement of a new trade deal between the U.S. and South Korea. The agreement, which sets a 15% blanket tariff, is seen as beneficial for the company, which is expected to expand its U.S. operations at the Philly Shipyard. The stock rally was also supported by the company's strong second-quarter operating profits, which reversed a loss from the previous year. Hanwha is also launching new initiatives to enhance its global competitiveness against Chinese shipbuilders. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>India has opted not to rush into a trade agreement with the U.S. ahead of the tariff deadline, choosing to protect its domestic agricultural sector, which represents a significant voting bloc. Despite facing new 25% duties, Indian officials have stated that national interest comes before deadlines, citing the relatively small portion of its economy tied to U.S. exports. Analysts suggest that the U.S. has a strategic interest in partnering with India as a manufacturing alternative to China. India is pursuing a "multi-alignment" strategy, diversifying its trade partnerships to strengthen its negotiating position. (not investment advice)</p>

The company stated the proceeds will be used to fund its global expansion and increase its production capacity, fueling its long-term growth strategy. This move is part of a larger trend of Chinese biotech and pharmaceutical companies tapping capital markets for funding, reflecting strong investor appetite.

          <p>Filipina-Australian artist Loribelle Spirovski has won the People's Choice Award for the Archibald Prize, Australia's most respected portraiture competition. Her winning entry is a portrait of musician William Barton, which she painted with her fingers due to a nerve injury that made using a brush difficult. Spirovski expressed her joy, calling the award a "beautiful reprieve" after a challenging period. The artwork was created while listening to Barton's music, which inspired her to set aside her brush and paint directly with her hands, a process she found almost painless.</p>

The aircraft, which was attached to the VFA-125 "Rough Raiders" training squadron based at Naval Air Station Lemoore, went down on Wednesday evening. Officials confirmed that no other personnel were affected by the incident, though the crash did spark a small grass fire that burned nearly a dozen acres.

          <p>The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened its first permanent office in Wellington, New Zealand, an event FBI Director Kash Patel described as a "historic moment." The new law enforcement attaché office aims to strengthen the Five Eyes intelligence alliance and enhance cooperation on key global security issues. Officials stated the collaboration will focus on countering China's influence in the Indo-Pacific, combating cybercrime and the narcotics trade, and protecting citizens of both nations. The move signifies a deeper commitment by the U.S. to its security partnership with New Zealand.</p>

          <p>The United States and South Korea have concluded a trade agreement that sets a blanket tariff of 15% on South Korean exports to the U.S., a reduction from the 25% previously threatened. As part of the deal, President Trump announced a $350 billion investment from South Korea into U.S. industries. However, interpretations of this investment differ, with South Korean President Lee Jae-myung stating the funds will facilitate Korean companies' entry into the U.S. market. The deal successfully protected South Korea's sensitive beef and rice markets from further U.S. access. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a controversial bill into law that increases penalties for soliciting minors aged 16 and 17 for sex. The new law allows prosecutors to charge offenders who are at least three years older than the minor with a felony on a first offense, a change from the previous misdemeanor charge. The bill, AB 379, was amended after initial debate among Democrats who raised concerns about potential profiling and unintended consequences. The law also establishes a support fund for survivors, financed by increased fines on offenders and non-compliant hoteliers.</p>

          <p>Billionaire hotel tycoon Surinder Arora has submitted a competing proposal to expand London's Heathrow Airport, challenging the plan from the airport's current owners. The Arora Group's plan, named Heathrow West, features a shorter third runway that would avoid the costly and disruptive need to reroute the M25 motorway. The company claims its proposal would reduce risk and spiraling costs, with a new runway operational by 2035 for under £25 billion. This marks the first time the government is considering competing bids for the long-debated expansion project, rather than granting exclusivity to the airport operator.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles Dodgers star Shohei Ohtani left his pitching start against the Cincinnati Reds in the fourth inning due to cramping, a scare that was quickly alleviated by the benign diagnosis. Ohtani looked uncomfortable on the mound on a hot and humid night, prompting a visit from the manager and trainer before his exit. He was able to remain in the game as the designated hitter, though the Dodgers ultimately lost the game 5-2. The injury does not appear serious, and Ohtani is expected to make his next scheduled start.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Federal Reserve has decided to keep its key interest rate unchanged, maintaining it in the 4.25% to 4.5% range despite pressure from President Trump to implement cuts. The decision was not unanimous, with two board members dissenting in favor of a rate cut, a sign of broadening support for lower borrowing costs. Policymakers are navigating a complex economic environment, with recent data showing GDP growth driven by a drop in imports due to tariffs, while underlying momentum appears to be slowing. The Fed remains cautious, watching for the full impact of tariffs on inflation and employment. (not investment advice)</p>
