          <p>Internet infrastructure company Cloudflare announced it will begin blocking AI crawlers from scraping website data by default, a move that could significantly impact how AI models are trained. Website owners using Cloudflare's services will now have to opt-in to allow their content to be used by AI companies like OpenAI and Google. The company stated the goal is to return control to content creators, who have seen their work used to generate AI responses without receiving traffic or revenue. This policy shift could hinder AI firms' ability to harvest the vast amounts of data needed for their systems.</p>

          <p>Zohran Mamdani's presumptive victory in the New York City Democratic mayoral primary is being analyzed as a potential roadmap for the progressive wing of the Democratic party. The article suggests his success demonstrates that a platform of "practical socialism," including proposals like a rent freeze and a higher minimum wage, can resonate with voters. It also highlights how Mamdani's unwavering moral stance on complex issues like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, despite attacks, proved to be a political asset rather than a liability. His campaign's ability to mobilize volunteers and overcome massive spending from opponents suggests people-powered movements can still triumph.</p>

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, are organizing to prevent private prison company CoreCivic from reopening a local facility to hold immigration detainees for ICE. The opposition, which includes a local Catholic convent and former prison employees, stems from the facility's troubled history of understaffing, violence, and alleged abuses when it previously operated. The city of Leavenworth has sued CoreCivic, arguing the company needs a new permit to operate, leading to a legal battle. The conflict exemplifies a local community's pushback against the expansion of private detention facilities amid a national immigration crackdown.</p>

          <p>In an effort to bolster foreign investor confidence amid trade tensions with the U.S. and EU, China has announced new tax breaks. The policy allows foreign companies to receive a tax deduction equivalent to 10 percent of any profits they reinvest into their operations within China. This measure, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is part of a broader government strategy to signal openness and encourage capital to remain in the country. The incentives apply to direct investments like establishing new entities or acquiring equity, but exclude purchases of public stocks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The University of California is considering a systemwide shift from the quarter system to a semester calendar, a move that would align all its undergraduate campuses. Proponents argue a common calendar would facilitate easier transfers, systemwide collaboration, and better alignment with internship and job market timelines. However, the proposal faces criticism over the significant cost, estimated at over $288 million, and potential disruption to students and faculty. While some students feel the quarter system's fast pace is a disadvantage, many faculty and students are wary of the cost and workload during a time of budget cuts.</p>

          <p>Researchers from UCLA and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County are calling for volunteers for "Project Phoenix," a citizen science initiative to study how birds are affected by wildfire smoke. The project asks residents across California, Oregon, and Washington to spend just 10 minutes a week observing and recording bird activity in a familiar location. No prior birding expertise is required, as the goal is to gather a large dataset to understand changes in bird behavior and location during the West Coast's fire season.

          <p>In the Big Bend region of West Texas, a coalition of astronomers, conservationists, and local communities is actively working to combat light pollution and protect some of the world's darkest night skies. Their efforts, which include promoting dark-sky-friendly lighting ordinances and working with the nearby oil and gas industry, led to the creation of the world's largest "dark sky reserve." This designation not only benefits astronomical research at the McDonald Observatory but also supports the local tourism economy and protects nocturnal wildlife.

Core inflation, which strips out volatile items, remained steady at 2.3%, while the closely watched services inflation ticked up to 3.3%. Following the data, the ECB's chief economist stated that the bank's recent cycle of interventions is likely "done," reinforcing expectations that interest rates will remain stable in the short term.

          <p>According to mortgage lender Nationwide, UK house prices recorded their most significant monthly decline since February 2023, falling by 0.8% in June. This drop may reflect a weakening of demand following recent changes to stamp duty tax thresholds, which made property purchases more expensive for many. Despite the monthly fall, the annual growth rate remained positive at 2.1%, though this was the slowest pace in nearly a year. Economists suggest the market is in a temporary "soft patch" and expect activity to recover, supported by low unemployment and earnings growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Starting Tuesday, energy bills for 21 million households in Great Britain will fall by about 7% under the new price cap set by regulator Ofgem. This translates to a reduction of around ¬£11 per month for a typical household. However, analysts warn that prices are unlikely to fall much further and remain significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels, raising concerns about affordability during the upcoming winter. Energy consultancy Cornwall Insight forecasts only a minor 1% drop in October, highlighting ongoing market uncertainty.

Despite it affecting half the population, a 2023 study found that less than a third of OB-GYN residency programs offer dedicated menopause training, leaving many doctors ill-equipped to treat patients. California's Assembly Bill 432, for example, would require doctors to complete coursework on the topic to renew their licenses.
