          <p>Asia-Pacific markets generally rose, influenced by an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that boosted the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite, even as broader economic fears persisted. Japan's Nikkei 225 increased, although Nidec Corp's shares significantly dropped amid an accounting investigation. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 climbed after positive household spending figures for July, indicating robust demand in several sectors. Conversely, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index and mainland China's CSI 300 saw declines in volatile trading, while global bond markets, including the U.S. 30-year Treasury and Japan's 30-year bond, faced pressure from high inflation and political uncertainty.

          <p>Defending US Open champion Jannik Sinner showcased dominant form, sweeping past fellow Italian Lorenzo Musetti in straight sets to secure his spot in the semi-finals. Sinner, often described as an "artificial intelligence" player due to his precision, won 6-1, 6-4, 6-2, extending his remarkable streak to 26 consecutive hard-court Grand Slam victories. Musetti, ranked 10th, struggled to convert break points against Sinner's relentless play. This victory sets up an exciting semi-final match against Felix Auger-Aliassime, as Sinner continues his quest for another major title, demonstrating exceptional consistency and strategic execution.</p>

          <p>A survey conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre reveals a nuanced perspective among ordinary Chinese citizens regarding their nation's relationship with the United States and its global role. While Chinese respondents are largely optimistic about their country's future, economy, and military, a significant plurality, 48%, expressed interest in a "shared leadership role" globally. This suggests an openness to peaceful coexistence with the U.S. and the West, challenging the American perception that China solely seeks to displace the U.S. The survey's authors, however, cautioned that results might be influenced by self-censorship, yet still offer insights into potential pathways for de-escalating US-China tensions.</p>

          <p>Argentine authorities have announced the recovery of "Portrait of a Lady," an 18th-century Italian painting by Giuseppe Ghislandi, which was looted by the Nazis during World War II. The artwork, valued at around $50,000, originally belonged to Dutch-Jewish art collector Jacques Goudstikker, whose collection was seized after his death in 1940. The painting's whereabouts remained unknown until it was spotted in an online real estate listing in Argentina, linked to the family of Nazi lawyer Friedrich Kadgien. This discovery, initiated by Dutch journalists, led to police raids and arrests, representing a significant success in the ongoing global effort to trace and return art stolen during the Holocaust.</p>

The controversial "Great Jeans" advertisement with Sweeney, which sparked public debate and even garnered a comment from President Trump, generated billions of impressions and quickly sold out her signature jeans, proving the substantial impact of these high-profile endorsements on brand awareness and revenue.

          <p>A federal judge has invalidated the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, characterizing it as a "targeted, ideologically-motivated assault on this country's premier universities." Judge Allison Burroughs ruled that the administration violated Harvard's First Amendment and procedural rights, imposing the freeze in retaliation for the university's refusal to concede to demands that infringed upon academic freedom. The judge found the administration's focus on antisemitism was "pretextual," as the funding termination occurred without proper investigation. This ruling protects critical research projects and academic independence, although the White House has announced its intention to appeal the decision.</p>

Nio's CEO, William Li, emphasized the company's determination to double monthly EV deliveries to 50,000 by the fourth quarter.
