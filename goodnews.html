          <p>Pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly announced that its experimental oral weight-loss drug, orforglipron, successfully helped adults with obesity lose an average of 27.3 pounds over 72 weeks in a Phase 3 trial. The results position the company to seek regulatory approval from the FDA later this year, potentially making the pill available by 2026. While the efficacy is comparable to popular injectable GLP-1 drugs like Zepbound, the pill form is expected to be cheaper and more accessible. The most common side effects reported were gastrointestinal issues, causing about 10% of participants on the highest dose to discontinue the trial.</p>

Six soldiers received the Meritorious Service Medal for their bravery, with officials stating their quick actions and first-aid training saved lives.

          <p>Actress Gina Carano, Lucasfilm, and parent company Disney have settled a lawsuit over her 2021 firing from the series "The Mandalorian." Carano had alleged wrongful termination and discrimination based on her political views expressed in controversial social media posts. In a statement, Carano said she believes the agreement is the best outcome for all parties, while a Lucasfilm spokesperson noted she was well-respected and that they look forward to future work opportunities. The lawsuit was financially backed by Elon Musk's company X, which has offered to fund legal challenges for users who feel they were unfairly treated by employers over their online activity.</p>

          <p>The UK government is drafting legislation that would restrict serious violent and sexual offenders to specific geographical areas upon their release from prison. This marks a shift from the current system of exclusion zones, which only bar offenders from certain locations, to a new model that would confine them to a defined area. The Ministry of Justice states this will provide greater peace of mind for victims, who would be consulted on the boundaries of these zones. While the plan aims to use enhanced electronic tagging and monitoring, probation officers have raised concerns about increased workload and pressure on an already strained service.</p>

          <p>OpenAI has officially launched GPT-5, its newest and most powerful large-scale AI model, making it available to all ChatGPT users, including those on the free tier. The company claims the model is significantly smarter, faster, and more useful, with a lower rate of fabricating answers. A key feature is its ability to provide "safe completions" for potentially risky prompts rather than outright refusing them. During a demonstration, OpenAI showcased GPT-5's ability to generate complex web applications from simple text prompts, highlighting its advanced coding and reasoning capabilities that are now accessible to a wider audience.</p>

Firms like Booking.com, Airbnb, and Butlin's report a significant rise in last-minute bookings for domestic getaways, a trend attributed to both budget-consciousness and the desire to take advantage of favorable weather. This shift reflects how consumers are adapting their vacation habits in the current economic climate.

          <p>A pop-up health clinic on the quayside in Brixham, Devon, is being highlighted as a successful model for the future of the UK's National Health Service (NHS). The clinic brings GPs, pharmacists, physiotherapists, and other specialists directly to fishermen, a community that often struggles to access traditional healthcare services due to their demanding work schedules. This proactive, community-based approach aligns with the NHS's new 10-year plan to shift focus from hospital treatment to preventative care. By offering on-site health screenings and consultations, the clinic has successfully diagnosed conditions like sepsis and cancer early, potentially preventing more serious illness and reducing long-term costs.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced he will host a peace summit at the White House on Friday with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. In a social media post, Trump stated that the two nations, which have been in conflict for many years, will sign a peace agreement. He also indicated that bilateral economic agreements between the United States and each country would be part of the proceedings. The president framed the event as a historic diplomatic achievement for his administration, which he said has been engaged with both sides for some time to end the long-standing war.</p>

          <p>China's leading semiconductor manufacturers, such as SMIC and Hua Hong Semiconductor, are expected to face only a small direct impact from the Trump administration's proposed 100% tariff on imported chips, according to research from CLSA. The analysis suggests that these companies could even benefit from potential countermeasures from China and other nations. This assessment is supported by customs data showing that China has been successfully diversifying its integrated circuit exports to countries in Southeast Asia. In the first half of 2025, China's chip exports to the US had already declined by 11% year-on-year, lessening the blow of the new American duties.</p>

          <p>Following a sharp 25% drop in Fortinet's stock after its earnings report, the broader cybersecurity sector experienced a significant sell-off, pulling down peers like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks. However, the CNBC Investing Club with Jim Cramer views this downturn as a potential buying opportunity, arguing the market reaction is overblown for cloud-native companies not reliant on the same hardware refresh cycle that concerned Fortinet investors. The authors of this article suggest that the selling pressure is largely due to automated ETF trading rather than fundamental weaknesses across the entire sector. They express interest in adding to their positions in CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order to stop construction at a controversial immigration detention center in the Florida Everglades, known as 'Alligator Alcatraz.' The ruling came in response to a lawsuit from environmental groups who argue that the facility's construction violates federal law by proceeding without an environmental impact statement. The judge's order halts building activities like paving and fencing for 14 days but does not affect ongoing detention operations. The lawsuit contends that the facility, located in the Big Cypress National Preserve, harms the fragile ecosystem and the habitat of the endangered Florida panther.</p>

This article's review finds their chemistry remains a high point, though the plot becomes confusing with the addition of new body-swapping characters. Also reviewed is "Weapons," a highly original and ambitious mystery-thriller from "Barbarian" director Zach Cregger, which evolves into a disturbing horror film centered on the disappearance of 17 middle-school students. Finally, the independent horror film "Shaman" is noted for its unique Ecuadorian Andes setting and its exploration of cultural and religious clashes.</p>

          <p>OpenAI's launch of GPT-5 represents a strategic shift in the AI race, focusing as much on usability and user experience as on raw intelligence. This analysis suggests that while GPT-5 shows state-of-the-art performance, its real breakthrough is in creating a more intuitive, personalized, and frictionless product that consolidates previous features into one seamless model. By making the advanced model free with usage limits and adding personalization features, OpenAI aims to attract and retain a massive user base, making its ecosystem difficult to leave. The strategy is to build an indispensable artificial general assistant before achieving the more distant goal of artificial general intelligence.</p>
