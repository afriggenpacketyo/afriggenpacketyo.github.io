          <p>Hasbro reported stronger-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings, primarily driven by robust performance in its digital gaming division, including popular titles like Magic: The Gathering and Monopoly Go!. This success helped to counteract persistent weaknesses in its traditional toy business, which faced pressure from tariffs and retailer order timing. Despite reporting a net loss attributed to a goodwill impairment and tariff impacts, the company's CEO outlined strategies like cost reductions and supply chain diversification to manage these headwinds. Hasbro subsequently raised its full-year guidance, signaling confidence in continued revenue growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Trump Considers Eliminating Capital Gains Tax on Home Sales to Boost Housing Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-23 14:23:02 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Donald Trump is considering a proposal to eliminate capital gains taxes on home sales, a move aimed at boosting the housing market. Under current law, profits exceeding $250,000 for single filers or $500,000 for married couples are subject to capital gains taxes. The initiative, also proposed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, seeks to unlock equity for homeowners, especially seniors, and potentially alleviate housing shortages. However, experts warn of the significant cost and uncertain congressional support for such a measure. This policy discussion highlights ongoing efforts to address economic challenges within the real estate sector. (not investment advice)</p>

A distinctive feature is the spectacular Seebühne, a colossal stage constructed directly on Lake Constance, known for its elaborate and visually stunning productions, such as this year's "Die Freischütz." Despite its high cultural ambitions, the festival exhibits a blend of traditional Austrian seriousness and casual American-themed attire among attendees. The festival is facing a substantial government funding cut for next summer, raising concerns about its ability to maintain its grand scale and artistic quality in the future.</p>

His choice follows months of deliberation and comes amidst the broader political landscape, including former President Trump's public statements regarding Republican candidates.

          <p>The Trump administration unveiled a comprehensive AI Action Plan, a strategic roadmap designed to maintain U.S. dominance in the artificial intelligence race by accelerating innovation and building robust infrastructure. The plan outlines over 90 federal policy actions, including supporting the expansion of data centers, semiconductor fabrication plants, and the electric grid. It also aims to address perceived "ideological bias" in chatbots and remove "burdensome AI regulations," while promoting AI export packages to U.S. allies. Critics, however, contend that the plan disproportionately favors corporate interests over the broader public good.</p>

Both companies are categorized as "beaten-down penny stocks" with notable short interest, making them appealing for speculative "YOLO" trading strategies. This surge in speculative activity on Wall Street aligns with a broader market rally that has seen the S&P 500 reach new record highs, partly attributed to the passage of a budget bill, hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts, and more favorable tariff news than anticipated.

          <p>The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has delivered a landmark, non-binding advisory opinion, affirming that countries possess the right to sue each other over climate change, including claims related to historic emissions. This decision is hailed as a significant victory for climate-vulnerable nations, who have expressed frustration with the slow pace of global climate action. The court further clarified that a failure to develop the most ambitious possible climate plans could constitute a breach of the Paris Agreement, and that broader international law applies even to non-signatories. Legal experts anticipate this ruling will pave the way for compensation claims and influence national court decisions worldwide.</p>

          <p>In Los Angeles, the prevailing trend of treating dogs as "fur babies" has led to increasingly extravagant behaviors among pet owners, who deeply integrate their canines into their family lives. Examples include dogs with frequent flyer miles, gourmet human-food diets, specialized "enrichment" activities, and memberships to luxury dog parks. Some owners even adapt their living situations, such as moving to single-story homes, to enhance their aging pets' comfort and mobility. This cultural phenomenon underscores the profound emotional bond between L.A. residents and their dogs, and their willingness to invest significantly in their companions' comfort and well-being.</p>
