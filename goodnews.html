        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summer temperatures rise, it is crucial to distinguish between heat exhaustion and the more dangerous heat stroke. Heat exhaustion presents with symptoms like headache, heavy sweating, and cool skin, and requires moving to a cool place and rehydrating. If left untreated, it can escalate to heat stroke, a life-threatening condition where the body's temperature regulation fails, leading to a core temperature spike, confusion, and potential unconsciousness, which requires immediate emergency services. The article emphasizes prevention through adequate hydration, avoiding midday sun, and wearing appropriate clothing to safely manage periods of extreme heat.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A forgotten novel titled "Parting," written in 1932 by a young Sebastian Haffner before he fled Nazi Germany, has become a bestseller nearly a century later. Discovered by his son after his death, the book chronicles a youthful love affair between Berlin and Paris against the backdrop of rising fascism. The publication was delayed for over two decades due to family concerns that the light, romantic text might detract from Haffner's reputation as a serious historian and political analyst. Critics, however, have praised the novel for its literary quality and for revealing the hopeful, personal source of the grief that informed his later, more somber works.</p>

          <p>A viral satellite image circulating on social media platform X, which claims to show the aftermath of an Iranian missile strike on Israel's Weizmann Institute, has been proven false. A fact-check investigation revealed that the image actually depicts the opposite: damage to Iran's Tabriz missile base caused by an Israeli attack. By using reverse image search and cross-referencing with Google Maps and satellite images from Maxar Technologies, the location was confirmed to be in Iran.

The Spurs signed center Luke Kornet to support Victor Wembanyama, while the Rockets added veteran forward Dorian Finney-Smith and center Clint Capela, continuing their aggressive offseason overhaul that also included trading for Kevin Durant. Other notable deals include D'Angelo Russell joining the Mavericks and Tyus Jones signing with the Orlando Magic.

          <p>China's Tianwen-2 spacecraft has successfully transmitted its first images of the Earth and the moon back to the China National Space Administration (CNSA). The images were captured by the probe's navigation sensor from a distance of over 12 million kilometers while it was in orbit. The CNSA confirmed that the spacecraft, which launched in late May, is in good working condition. This milestone comes as Chinese researchers on the ground are simultaneously testing autonomous robots in underground lava caves, simulating the challenging terrain they may encounter during future lunar exploration missions, signaling progress in China's ambitious space program.</p>

          <h2>Analysis Highlights Protest's Crucial Role in Countering the 'Spiral of Silence'</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-01 07:00:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Political protest serves a critical, often overlooked function: preventing the "spiral of silence," a phenomenon where individuals wrongly believe their views are in the minority and thus remain quiet. This silence can be misinterpreted as approval of the status quo, reinforcing unpopular policies. The article cites research showing that Americans massively underestimate public support for climate action and that public demonstrations, like those after the Dobbs Supreme Court ruling, can correct these misperceptions. By making collective opinion visible, protests create "common knowledge," demonstrating to both the public and leaders what society truly believes and preventing a muted majority from being governed by a vocal minority.</p>

          <p>Denmark has enacted a new law requiring women to be included in the country's military conscription system, a change driven by heightened security concerns across Europe. Starting now, both men and women turning 18 will be entered into a lottery for mandatory military service, which has also been extended from four to eleven months. While women could previously volunteer, they are now subject to the same draft requirement as men. Denmark follows neighboring Sweden and Norway in implementing gender-neutral conscription as part of a broader effort to boost defense spending and increase its number of military personnel to meet NATO targets.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chelsea's recent transfer activity, including the pursuit of Brighton's Jo√£o Pedro, reflects new head coach Enzo Maresca's search for tactical versatility and unpredictability. Maresca's system often inverts one full-back and shifts the other centrally, which can isolate wide players and struggle against compact defenses. The acquisition of players like Jo√£o Pedro, who can drop deep, press effectively, and link play, is seen as a way to create new angles of attack and relieve the creative burden on Cole Palmer. This strategy suggests Maresca is building a squad capable of multiple formations and attacking modes to overcome the rigidity observed last season.</p>

The company, which handles roughly 16% of global internet traffic, stated the goal is to return power to creators, who are losing traffic and ad revenue as AI models generate answers without directing users to original sources.

          <p>In a rare show of cooperation, Wisconsin's Democratic Governor Tony Evers and the Republican-controlled Legislature have announced a deal on a new two-year state budget. The compromise plan includes $1.3 billion in income tax cuts aimed at the middle class, a significant funding increase for the Universities of Wisconsin, and new revenue for transportation projects. The deal also boosts funding for K-12 special education and child care programs, replacing an expired pandemic-era initiative. This bipartisan agreement in a key battleground state marks a departure from previous contentious budget cycles and signals a potential for functional governance despite deep political divisions.

          <p>Residents of Leavenworth, Kansas, a town with a long history of federal prisons, are organizing to block private prison firm CoreCivic from reopening a facility to hold immigrant detainees for ICE. Citing the facility's troubled past of violence, understaffing, and alleged abuses when it previously operated, a diverse coalition of locals, including nuns and former prison guards, is challenging the company. A state judge has issued a temporary injunction, siding with the city's argument that CoreCivic needs a new permit to operate. The local pushback represents a significant grassroots challenge to the private prison industry, which is expanding amid the Trump administration's mass deportation efforts.</p>

The incentive, which can be applied retroactively to the start of 2025, is part of a broader government effort to signal openness and stabilize foreign capital flows.

Currently, only UC Berkeley and UC Merced operate on semesters.

Proponents argue a common calendar would facilitate collaboration, internships, and transfers, while critics and some faculty express concern over the cost, increased workload, and potential negative impacts on student performance, especially amid current budget cuts and a hiring freeze.</p>

          <p>Researchers from UCLA and the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County are recruiting volunteers for Project Phoenix, a citizen science initiative to study how wildfire smoke affects birds. The project asks volunteers across California, Oregon, and Washington to spend just 10 minutes each week observing and recording bird activity in a familiar location, such as a backyard or local park. No prior birding expertise is required, as the program aims to be accessible to everyone. By collecting this data throughout the fire season, scientists hope to understand how soot and poor air quality alter bird behavior, location, and well-being, which remains an understudied area of wildfire ecology.</p>
