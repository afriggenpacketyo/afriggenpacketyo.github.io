          <p>A program called Dec My Dorm is helping students transitioning from the foster care system to college by providing them with essential dorm room supplies. Many of these students arrive on campus with minimal belongings, unaware of what they need to furnish their new living spaces. The initiative, started after learning of a student who arrived with only a trash bag, aims to level the playing field and ensure these students feel prepared and equal to their peers. The program provides everything from bedding and towels to toolboxes and school supplies.</p>

          <p>Samsung is gaining ground on Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, with its market share surging from 23% to 31% in the second quarter, while Apple's declined. This renewed competition is largely driven by Samsung's innovation in screen technology, particularly its popular foldable phones like the Z Fold 7. While Apple still leads the market, Samsung's wider range of products at various price points and its experimentation with new form factors are attracting consumers. Analysts suggest Apple may release its own foldable phone in the coming years to compete. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A fugitive drug and weapons trafficker, Jamie Rothwell, was located and arrested after inadvertently revealing his location by sharing a selfie on the encrypted EncroChat communication network. Believing the service was secure, Rothwell used it to run a multi-million-pound criminal enterprise from his apartment in Barcelona. The photo, along with another showing the view from his apartment, provided the breakthrough police needed to identify and find him. The case highlights the impact of the 2020 international law enforcement hack of EncroChat, which exposed the private conversations of thousands of criminals.</p>

          <p>Following his meeting with Vladimir Putin in Alaska, President Donald Trump announced he will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House on Monday. Trump stated the goal is to discuss a peace agreement to end the war, not just a temporary ceasefire. The announcement came after a late-night call with Zelenskyy and European leaders, who praised Trump's efforts and support for providing security guarantees to Ukraine. This development marks a significant new phase in the diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>

          <p>A new Gallup survey indicates that the percentage of Americans who drink alcohol has dropped to 54%, the lowest level since the question was first tracked in 1939. This trend is accompanied by a decrease in drinking frequency and growing public concern about the health impacts of alcohol, with a majority now viewing even moderate consumption as unhealthy. The decline is even more pronounced among underage individuals. This shift is seen as a positive public health development, potentially leading to fewer alcohol-related deaths, illnesses, and social problems.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Engine Capital has taken an approximately 3% stake in life sciences company Avantor and is pushing for significant changes to address its underperformance. In a letter to the board, Engine Capital outlined a plan that includes focusing on operational excellence, reducing costs, optimizing the company's portfolio, and refreshing the board. The activist firm argues that self-inflicted mistakes and poor capital allocation have led to a substantial decline in shareholder value, suggesting a sale of the company as an alternative path.

          <p>Two fishermen in Minnesota may have helped solve a 57-year-old cold case after their sonar device detected a submerged car in the Mississippi River. Divers recovered a 1960s-era Buick containing human remains. Authorities were able to match the vehicle's identification number to Roy Benn, a local businessman who went missing in September 1967 while driving a similar car. The remains are being examined for formal identification, but investigators believe this discovery will finally bring closure to the long-unsolved disappearance.</p>

The discovery is particularly significant as it was found near the site of a similar find in 2021, leading experts to believe the pair of high-status objects may have been deliberately buried for ceremonial or religious purposes. The piece will undergo further analysis before potentially being displayed in a museum.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Baltimore has achieved a dramatic reduction in violent crime, with its homicide rate falling to the lowest level in five decades. This success is attributed to a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that focuses on the small number of individuals most at risk of committing or becoming victims of gun violence. The city's approach combines offers of social support, such as housing and job training, with the threat of focused law enforcement for those who refuse help. This multi-agency effort, which includes social workers, police, and community groups, represents a significant shift from previous policing tactics.</p>
