          <p>Former President Barack Obama spoke about political violence in the U.S., referencing the assassination of Charlie Kirk and attacks on Minnesota lawmakers Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman. Obama emphasized the importance of disagreeing and engaging in contentious debates without resorting to violence, stating that political violence is "anathema to what it means to be a democratic country." He criticized leaders who responded to Kirk's death by blaming political enemies, urging for respectful public debate. Obama also mentioned his disagreement with some of Kirk's views, but mourned the tragedy of his death and the impact on his family. The former president joins other leaders in calling for an end to political violence. Optimism surrounding this event is moderate, as the former president reminds the country of the value of civil debate.</p>

          <p>Jake Wightman returned to the global stage, winning a silver medal in the world 1500m race after struggling with injuries in previous championships. Wightman collapsed with exhaustion after the race, narrowly missing the gold by two-hundredths of a second to Portugal's Isaac Nader. Josh Kerr, the defending champion, was unable to compete effectively due to an injury, ultimately hobbling over the finish line. Wightman's performance marks a significant comeback after facing setbacks. The event provided a mix of triumph and disappointment for the British athletes, highlighting the unpredictable nature of sports.</p>

          <p>Microsoft seized 338 websites linked to a Nigerian-based service called "Raccoon0365" that enabled phishing campaigns. The service allowed users to impersonate trusted brands and steal Microsoft user credentials, generating at least $100,000 in cryptocurrency payments for its operators since July 2024. Raccoon0365 operated through a private Telegram channel and targeted various industries, particularly organizations in New York City. Microsoft obtained a court order to seize the domains and collaborated with Cloudflare and the US Secret Service to disrupt the operations. The seizure highlights the accessibility of cybercrime and the collaborative efforts to combat it.</p>

          <p>Eli Lilly announced that its experimental pill, orforglipron, outperformed Novo Nordisk's oral semaglutide in a head-to-head trial for patients with Type 2 diabetes. Orforglipron demonstrated superior blood sugar level reduction and weight loss compared to Novo Nordisk's pill. Eli Lilly plans to seek approval for orforglipron for Type 2 diabetes treatment in 2026. The results suggest that orforglipron may be more effective than oral semaglutide at specific doses, but comparisons to higher doses of oral semaglutide are still needed. The study results advance the competition in the oral GLP-1 market. </p>

          <p>As of September 15, 2025, average home equity loan interest rates range from 8.23% to 8.38% depending on the loan term, while the average HELOC rate is 8.10%, according to Bankrate. These rates are nationwide averages and are impacted by location, lender, and credit profile. HELOCs and home equity loans both use your equity as the funding source, but the way they operate differs. HELOCs come with variable interest rates and provide the homeowner with a revolving line of credit using the home as the funding source.
