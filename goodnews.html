          <p>University of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders announced he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of bladder cancer, which required the surgical removal of his bladder. Appearing with his medical team, Sanders shared that the procedure was successful and he is now considered cancer-free. His doctor explained the high-risk nature of the tumor and confirmed they were able to create a new bladder for him using his own intestines. Sanders expressed gratitude and confirmed he will continue coaching the team this season, hoping his journey encourages others to prioritize their health.</p>

          <p>This article provides a chronological overview of the turbulent trade negotiations between the United States and the European Union throughout 2025. It details the initial imposition of steel and auto tariffs by President Trump, the EU's proposed countermeasures, and the subsequent series of threats and temporary reprieves. The timeline highlights key moments, such as Trump's "Liberation Day" tariff announcement and a threatened 50% tariff hike. The negotiations, marked by deep divisions among EU states, ultimately culminated in a last-minute deal establishing a 15% baseline tariff rate, averting a full-scale trade war for now.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Iona rapidly intensified into a Category 1 hurricane, becoming the first of the season in the central Pacific Ocean. Located southeast of Honolulu, the storm is not currently considered an immediate threat to the Hawaiian Islands, with forecasters confident it will remain well to the south. The National Hurricane Center projects Iona will strengthen into a Category 2 hurricane before gradually weakening later in the week. This development follows an active season in the eastern Pacific, which has already seen several named storms, including two major hurricanes.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles luxury real estate market showed significant strength in June, with Paris Hilton and her husband Carter Reum purchasing Mark Wahlberg's former Beverly Hills mansion for $63 million. This sale, which was the month's most expensive, represented a profitable flip for the sellers who bought it from Wahlberg for $55 million in 2023. Real estate agents note that demand from buyers displaced by recent wildfires and an increase in foreign investment are fueling the high-end market. Five of the ten most expensive U.S. home sales in June were in California, indicating a robust market despite broader economic conditions.</p>

The proposal was developed in collaboration with France and Germany following the recent breakdown of U.S.-led talks. While details remain undisclosed pending a UK cabinet meeting, the plan aims to provide immediate humanitarian relief and create a sustainable path toward a two-state solution. The initiative comes amid increasing international pressure and a call from over 250 UK MPs for the immediate recognition of a Palestinian state.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a nationwide order requiring the Trump administration to continue Medicaid reimbursements to all Planned Parenthood clinics. This ruling expands a previous, more limited injunction and blocks a provision in a new tax bill that aimed to "defund" the organization by cutting its Medicaid payments for one year. The judge's order noted that restricting services would likely lead to adverse health consequences for patients, such as an increase in unintended pregnancies and untreated STIs. Planned Parenthood had argued that the funding cut would force nearly 200 clinics to close.</p>

          <p>Interest rates for home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) have recently decreased, providing a more affordable borrowing option for homeowners compared to high-rate credit cards and personal loans. With average rates for both products now sitting around 8.25%, prospective borrowers are advised to act strategically. This includes carefully comparing the two products, shopping for the best offers from multiple lenders, and precisely determining the amount of money needed to avoid over-borrowing. As your home serves as collateral, it is crucial to borrow responsibly to minimize the risk of foreclosure. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Matty Healy, frontman of The 1975, is warning that the UK's cultural pipeline is at risk as he backs a new festival aimed at supporting small "seed" music venues. The Seed Sounds Weekender will feature events in over 1,000 pubs and bars, the types of places where iconic acts like Amy Winehouse and The Smiths began their careers. Healy stated that without these foundational venues, new talent cannot emerge, leading to a cultural economy where only the privileged can create.

          <p>For individuals reducing their red meat consumption due to associated health risks like Type 2 diabetes and cancer, nutrition experts highlight numerous alternative sources of iron. Registered dietitians recommend iron-rich foods such as lentils, beans, tofu, and spinach, as well as seafood like oysters and clams. They note that plant-based iron is best absorbed when paired with vitamin C-rich foods. Additionally, fortified breads and cereals are a major source of dietary iron in the U.S. Supplements are also an option, but experts advise consulting a doctor and prioritizing natural food sources first.</p>
