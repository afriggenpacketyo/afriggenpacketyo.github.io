          <p>A China-led international research team has analyzed seismic waves from 'marsquakes' and meteorite impacts recorded by NASA's InSight lander, revealing a mysterious zone in the Martian crust that suggests a layer of water-saturated rock. This underground layer, located between 5.4km and 8km deep, could contain a significant amount of water, potentially matching what scientists believe to be Mars' missing water. The findings offer new insights into Mars' water cycle and the potential for habitable environments on the planet. If confirmed, this discovery could reshape our understanding of Mars' geological history and future prospects for exploration.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article discusses how German companies are reassessing their investments in the United States due to ongoing trade disputes and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. Despite a long history of German companies producing goods in the U.S., recent surveys indicate a pullback in investment and a more pessimistic outlook. Many German firms are now considering keeping their investments at home, especially with a new government in Germany focused on reducing bureaucracy and energy prices. The automotive sector, heavily invested in the U.S., has been particularly affected by the tariffs.</p>

          <p>The New York Times article examines the contrasting realities of China's economy, portraying it as both a technological superpower and a nation grappling with economic challenges. While companies like DeepSeek and Huawei showcase innovation, the country faces sluggish consumer spending, rising unemployment, and a housing crisis. Experts suggest that technological advancements alone may not be sufficient to overcome these structural imbalances. The article highlights the anxieties felt by Americans regarding their country's struggles in manufacturing and innovation compared to China's rapid development in high-speed rail, robotics, and electric vehicles.</p>

          <p>China is making significant strides in the development and deployment of AI-powered humanoid robots, aiming to revolutionize its manufacturing sector. Companies like AgiBot are collecting vast amounts of data to train robots for various tasks, with the ultimate goal of robots assembling themselves in factories. The Chinese government is heavily supporting this initiative through subsidies and procurement, viewing it as a solution to trade frictions, population decline, and slowing growth. With advancements in AI and data training, these robots are expected to transition from mere spectacles to productive workers, potentially reshaping China's economic future.</p>

          <p>This New York Times article reports on an underwhelming auction of the Riggio family art collection, signaling potential caution for the art market. Despite a $272 million total, the sale lacked enthusiastic bidding and fell short of pre-sale expectations, attributed to economic uncertainty surrounding President Trump‚Äôs tariffs. A Mondrian painting, the top lot, sold for $47.6 million, below the previous record for the artist. While some paintings performed well, the withdrawal of a major Warhol painting highlighted weakness in that market. The auction's results suggest a shift from the frothy art market of 2022.</p>

The report acknowledges government reforms, including ending petrol subsidies and devaluing the naira, but notes the reforms have increased the cost of living for many Nigerians. The agricultural sector faces challenges due to insecurity and high input costs. Nearly half of Nigerians lived in poverty in 2024, making Nigeria home to the world's second-largest poor population after India.</p>

          <p>The price of gold has surged by over 40% in the past year, reaching record highs, driven by factors such as unpredictable US trade policies and geopolitical uncertainty. While gold is considered a 'safe haven' asset, it is not immune to price fluctuations, with past surges followed by significant falls. Central banks have been net buyers of gold, seeking independence from dollar-based banking systems. Some experts forecast continued upward trends, while others caution about a potential market bubble. Investors should consider diversifying their portfolios and avoid short-term speculation.</p>
