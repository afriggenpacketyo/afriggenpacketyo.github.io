          <p>Mexico's national soccer team has won its tenth CONCACAF Gold Cup, defeating the United States 2-1 in the final. The U.S. team, missing several key players, took an early lead with a goal from Chris Richards. However, Mexico equalized before halftime and later scored the decisive goal in the 77th minute, with Edson Alvarez finding the net. The victory marks Mexico's first time repeating as champions since 2011, solidifying their dominance in the tournament.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Fuzhou University in China have developed a new type of vision sensor using semiconductor "quantum dots." This innovative system can adapt to extreme changes in light conditions more rapidly than the human eye. The technology is also designed to overcome limitations of current systems by enabling faster computation with lower energy consumption. This development could represent a significant advancement in visual sensing technology with various potential applications.</p>

          <p>Chantal, which made landfall as a tropical storm near Litchfield Beach, South Carolina, has been downgraded to a tropical depression. While the immediate storm threat has lessened, concerns remain over heavy rainfall and potential flash flooding across the Carolinas and into Virginia. Forecasters predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with localized amounts up to 6 inches, prompting flood watches in the region. The system is expected to continue weakening as it moves northeast.</p>

          <p>The BRICS group of emerging economies is calling for the United Nations to take the lead in establishing global rules for artificial intelligence. In a statement from their summit in Rio de Janeiro, leaders described AI as a major opportunity for growth but warned it could widen the digital divide without fair governance. They emphasized the need for technical standards developed with public sector and UN involvement to ensure trust and security, while also advocating for equal access to AI technologies for developing nations.</p>

          <p>An SUV crashed into a Domino's Pizza restaurant in Herriman, Utah, rupturing a gas line and triggering a large explosion that destroyed the building. The driver and a passenger were rescued from the vehicle by two bystanders just minutes before it was engulfed in flames. The commercial building, which also housed a Jimmy John's and a Supercuts, sustained significant damage, but no one was inside at the time of the crash. Several people involved in the three-vehicle accident were hospitalized, but no injuries were reported from the explosion itself.</p>
