He arrived in Western Australia for a tour but was informed he would be deported to London, missing scheduled appearances in Perth and Sydney. Fisher stated that while his visa was 'legit,' authorities were displeased with his intent to work during his visit, suggesting he entered on an incorrect visa type. He spent his 52nd birthday in a detention hotel, expressing disappointment but still conveying affection for Australia, while his son confirmed his return.</p>

          <p>Dutch semiconductor equipment giant ASML sought to alleviate investor concerns regarding its 2026 growth outlook, despite forecasting a significant decline in sales from China next year. The company confirmed it does not anticipate 2026 net sales to fall below 2025 levels and maintained its 2025 annual sales growth projection of around 15% compared to 2024. ASML continues to benefit from the AI boom, which fueled substantial third-quarter orders, and plans to offer a more detailed outlook in January. The firm's shares saw a 3% increase following these announcements, reflecting a degree of market confidence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Team GB track cyclist Jack Carlin, a multiple Olympic medalist, has announced his retirement from the sport at age 28. Carlin, who secured silver and bronze medals in both the Paris and Tokyo Games, cited a lack of renewed motivation after a severe crash in his final Olympic event. Despite taking time off, he found he could not reignite his passion to compete at 100% and felt it would be a disservice to continue. He expressed contentment with his achievements over a decade at the top and is now exploring new opportunities, including a rediscovered love for golf, as he transitions from his athletic career.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has declined to hear an appeal from conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, effectively upholding the $1.4 billion defamation judgment against him. The judgment stems from Jones' false claims that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax. Jones had argued that he was wrongly found liable without a trial on the merits, but the justices rejected his appeal without comment. This decision ensures accountability for the Infowars host, who had filed for bankruptcy and faces a separate $49 million judgment in Texas, bringing some closure to the victims' families.</p>

          <p>OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced a significant policy shift, stating that adult ChatGPT users will soon have access to a less censored version of the AI chatbot, including erotic materials. This change, expected in December with the rollout of age-gating, aligns with a 'treat adult users like adults' principle. Altman explained that previous versions were highly restrictive due to mental health concerns, but new safety tools allow for relaxing these limitations for adults. This move could redefine ChatGPT's content boundaries, although it comes amidst increased scrutiny over AI safety practices, particularly concerning minors.</p>

          <p>The USA men's national soccer team clinched a 2-1 victory against Australia in Colorado, marked by a double from striker Haji Wright. The win came despite an early injury to captain Christian Pulisic, who was forced off the field in the 27th minute due to a lower leg complaint. Australia initially took the lead with a goal from Jordy Bos, but Wright's two goals ensured the USA's comeback. This result hands Australia's new manager, Tony Popovic, his first loss and prevents the Socceroos from improving their FIFA ranking ahead of next year's World Cup.</p>

          <p>Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered a historic complete game, leading the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers and a commanding 2-0 lead in the National League Championship Series. Yamamoto's three-hit, one-run performance marked the first postseason complete game in eight years and the first for a Dodgers pitcher since 2004. This stellar pitching, following Blake Snell's strong Game 1 outing, highlights the Dodgers' reliance on their starting rotation amidst bullpen struggles. The team, now 7-1 in the postseason, is two wins away from the World Series, demonstrating they are peaking at a crucial time.</p>

          <p>Donald Trump has publicly criticized a Time magazine cover featuring him, despite the accompanying article being a 'relatively good story' about his role in brokering a Gaza ceasefire. Trump expressed strong disapproval of the photograph, which was taken from a low angle, claiming it 'disappeared' his hair and made it look like a 'floating crown.' He labeled the image 'super bad' and questioned the editors' choices. This incident highlights Trump's long-standing preoccupation with his public image and media portrayal, even when a story might otherwise be favorable to him.</p>

          <p>IonQ CEO Niccolò De Masi has made a bold statement challenging Nvidia's current dominance in the AI sector, asserting that quantum computing will eventually replace GPUs. De Masi views quantum processors (QPUs) as the next natural evolution in computing, poised to take the lead as they become more powerful and energy-efficient. This perspective comes as the quantum computing market experiences significant investor enthusiasm, with companies like IonQ seeing substantial stock returns. McKinsey estimates the quantum industry's long-term market could reach $198 billion by 2040, signaling a potential shift in the technological landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed several key health bills aimed at making the artificial intelligence and social media landscape safer, particularly for minors. New laws will require AI companies to implement guardrails against self-harm discussions and alert minors every three hours that chatbots are not human. Additionally, a bill removes a civil legal defense for AI developers, holding them more accountable for harm caused by their products. Other legislation increases penalties for AI pornography deepfakes and mandates warning labels on social media platforms for minors, reflecting a proactive stance against tech-related mental health issues and online exploitation.</p>
