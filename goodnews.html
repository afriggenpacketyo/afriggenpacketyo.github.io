          <p>During a game between the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox, benches cleared after an exchange between Astros pitcher Hector Neris and the Red Sox third base coach, seemingly over sign-stealing paranoia. After the game, Neris suggested the Red Sox might have been stealing signs, prompting a pointed on-air comment from a Red Sox announcer and former player. The announcer highlighted the irony of the Astros, who were at the center of a major sign-stealing scandal that helped them win the 2017 World Series, being upset about the practice. The incident underscores the lingering tensions and sensitivities surrounding sign-stealing in Major League Baseball.</p>

          <p>A weeklong manhunt has concluded with the arrest of Austin Robert Drummond, the primary suspect in the killing of four people in northwest Tennessee. Drummond was captured in a wooded area and is now facing four counts of first-degree murder and one count of aggravated kidnapping. The victims were identified as Cortney Rose, her two children, and her daughter's boyfriend. The investigation began after the victims' infant was found abandoned in a car seat in a stranger's yard, leading authorities to discover the bodies and launch the search for the armed and dangerous suspect.</p>

          <p>Axon Enterprise, the company known for TASER devices and body cameras, saw its stock jump 16% after reporting second-quarter results that significantly beat Wall Street expectations. The company posted strong revenue growth of 33% year-over-year, driven by robust demand across all its product lines, including TASERs, software, and drone technology. Citing this accelerating demand for its security solutions, Axon also raised its full-year revenue guidance. The performance reflects growing security needs and the successful rollout of new products, which accounted for over 30% of recent bookings.</p>

          <p>According to the FBI's annual Unified Crime Report, crime in the United States decreased in every major category during 2024, continuing a downward trend from the spike seen after the COVID-19 pandemic. The report, compiled from data covering over 95% of the U.S. population, showed significant drops in violent crimes like murder (down 14.9%) and property crimes, including a record 18.6% decrease in motor vehicle thefts. While experts note that aggravated assaults remain relatively high compared to pre-pandemic levels, the overall data points to a broad and continuing reduction in reported criminal activity nationwide.</p>

          <p>The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark have collectively agreed to purchase $1 billion worth of U.S. armaments to be sent to Ukraine, following a new arrangement announced by the Trump administration. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy confirmed the deal, which includes vital components for U.S. Patriot air defense systems, crucial for defending against Russian missile strikes. This initiative allows NATO countries to support Ukraine by buying American weapons and sending them directly, a policy shift supported by President Trump. The move signifies continued international military support for Ukraine amid its ongoing conflict with Russia.</p>

          <p>A pair of 6-month-old black bear cubs are being cared for at the San Diego Humane Society's Ramona Wildlife Center after being found alone in a Northern California neighborhood. A third cub found with them had to be euthanized due to a severe, untreatable shoulder malformation and a BB pellet lodged in her paw. The two surviving male cubs are recuperating in a large outdoor enclosure designed to prepare them for an eventual return to the wild. The facility is one of the few in the region equipped to handle bear rehabilitation, providing a critical service as other centers are at capacity.</p>

          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held what he described as a "productive" phone call with U.S. President Donald Trump, covering several critical issues. The discussion focused on potential new sanctions against Russia, the ongoing Russian strikes on Ukrainian cities, and a major new drone production agreement between the two nations. Zelenskyy stated that a draft for the drone deal is ready, calling it one of the strongest of its kind. The call comes as President Trump has reportedly given Russia a deadline to move toward peace or face harsher economic penalties, a development Zelenskyy believes is pressuring Moscow.</p>

          <h2>A Guide to Reverse Mortgages and the Risk of Outliving Home Equity</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-05 13:05:46 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This article explores the mechanics of reverse mortgages, a financial tool for older homeowners to convert home equity into cash. It clarifies that a borrower cannot "outlive" the loan itself, as it does not expire or come due as long as they live in the home and meet obligations like paying taxes and insurance. However, it is possible to outlive the home's equity, as the loan balance grows with interest and withdrawals, potentially leaving no value for heirs. The article advises that payment structures like monthly tenure payments or a line of credit are more sustainable for those concerned about longevity. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the first time since 2019, OpenAI has released two open-weight AI models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, designed to be lower-cost alternatives for developers and researchers. Unlike closed models, open-weight models have publicly available parameters, allowing for greater customization and transparency. The move positions OpenAI to compete with other tech companies like Meta and Mistral that have already embraced a more open approach. After delaying the launch for additional safety testing, OpenAI stated the models were trained to filter out harmful data and are being released under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.</p>

          <p>The acting head of NASA has directed the agency to accelerate its program to deploy a small nuclear reactor on the moon, setting a target launch date for late 2029. The directive emphasizes the need for the U.S. to establish a lunar power source before China and Russia, who are planning a joint reactor by the mid-2030s. The plan, called Fission Surface Power, aims to develop a 100-kilowatt microreactor to support the Artemis lunar exploration program. This ambitious goal comes amid proposed budget cuts for NASA and as no microreactor has yet been licensed or built in the United States.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration is formally ending the "five things" program, an initiative launched by former adviser Elon Musk that required federal employees to email a weekly summary of their five main achievements. The unpopular mandate, implemented by the Office of Personnel Management to increase accountability, had already been phased out by many agencies. This official termination signals a move away from one of Musk's key policies following a public falling out between him and President Trump. The program had been criticized for being inefficient and causing confusion among the federal workforce since its inception.</p>

          <p>Pfizer increased its full-year adjusted profit guidance after reporting second-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street's expectations, causing its stock to rise. The company's strong performance was driven by better-than-expected revenue from its Covid products and other key drugs. The raised outlook also reflects confidence in the company's cost-cutting measures and strategic priorities. Pfizer's guidance accounts for existing tariffs and potential drug price changes stemming from ongoing discussions with the Trump administration, which has been pressuring the industry to lower costs for U.S. consumers.
