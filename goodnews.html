          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz's meeting with President Donald Trump was overshadowed by Trump's feud with Elon Musk, yet it's viewed as a positive outcome for Merz. Merz addressed topics ranging from US-German relations to tariffs and support for Ukraine. Merz highlighted Germany's plans for higher defense spending, likely a positive note in discussions.
