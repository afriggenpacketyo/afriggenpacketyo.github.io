          <h2>Cheaper Stockpiled Rice Hits Japanese Store Shelves Amid Soaring Prices</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-31 01:33:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Japanese government's release of stockpiled rice through direct contracts with retailers has resulted in cheaper rice becoming available to consumers. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at a lower price of 2,160 yen for a 5 kilogram-bag. The initiative aims to alleviate the burden of soaring rice prices on households. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hopes that this direct selling approach will be more effective in curbing rice prices compared to previous auction methods.</p>
