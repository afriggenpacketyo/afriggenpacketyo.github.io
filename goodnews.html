          <p>A cybersecurity expert outlines the dangers of web injection scams, a type of attack where malicious pop-ups overlay legitimate financial websites to steal user credentials. The article details a real-world example and provides a comprehensive guide for protection, including immediately changing passwords, monitoring accounts for suspicious activity, and enabling stronger multi-factor authentication. Additional recommendations include using antivirus software to scan for malware, placing a freeze on credit reports with major bureaus, and using data removal services to reduce the personal information available to criminals online.</p>

          <p>Lyft CEO David Risher recounted his 1996 decision to leave a management role at Microsoft for a then-small online startup, Amazon. Despite Bill Gates calling it "the stupidest decision," Risher was convinced by Jeff Bezos's compelling vision for the company. Bezos's two key selling points were his intense focus on the customer experience and his bold prediction that Amazon would become a billion-dollar business by the year 2000. Risher was drawn to the opportunity to build something transformative, and Amazon ultimately surpassed Bezos's revenue projection a year ahead of schedule.</p>

          <p>Activist investment firm Irenic Capital Management has acquired a roughly 2% stake in the cloud-based reporting software company Workiva. Irenic is urging the company to enhance operational efficiency, collapse its dual-class share structure, and explore strategic alternatives, including a potential sale. The firm criticizes Workiva for its lack of profitability despite strong revenue growth and a high customer retention rate, pointing to a bloated sales and marketing budget. Irenic is also seeking two new board seats to oversee these proposed changes and improve corporate governance. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Urenco uranium enrichment facility in New Mexico is central to U.S. plans to expand nuclear power, driven by rising electricity demand from AI data centers and a push for domestic manufacturing. As the only commercial enrichment plant in the U.S., it is racing to increase capacity to fill a supply gap created by the upcoming ban on Russian uranium imports. The facility, which currently supplies about one-third of U.S. demand, is expanding by 15% but faces broader supply chain bottlenecks, particularly in uranium conversion. The success of America's ambitious nuclear energy goals depends heavily on overcoming these challenges.</p>

          <p>Hamas has announced its agreement to key parts of a ceasefire proposal outlined by President Trump, including the release of all hostages. However, the group indicated that other aspects of the deal require further negotiation within a broader Palestinian framework. In response, Israel stated it is preparing to implement the first phase of the plan and has moved to a defensive-only posture in Gaza. The proposal calls for an immediate end to fighting, the withdrawal of Israeli forces to an agreed-upon line, and the transfer of Gaza's administration to an independent Palestinian body.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi, a hard-line conservative, as its new leader, setting her on course to become the nation's first female prime minister. Takaichi, a protege of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, defeated the more moderate Shinjiro Koizumi in a runoff vote. Her victory comes as the LDP seeks to regain public trust after recent election losses. As prime minister, Takaichi is expected to focus on strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance, addressing rising prices, and navigating diplomatic and security challenges in the region.</p>

          <p>Michaela Del Barrio, a 37-year-old mother with a family history of breast cancer, was diagnosed with the disease after advocating for early screening. Despite having no symptoms, she requested a mammogram at age 36 and an MRI, which revealed two suspicious masses. Her diagnosis of early-stage invasive ductal carcinoma highlights the importance of proactive health management, especially for those with higher risk factors. Oncologists emphasize that while routine mammograms begin at 40 for average-risk women, individuals with a family history should consult their doctors for a personalized screening plan much earlier.</p>

          <p>The late conservationist Jane Goodall, who died at 91, attributed her health and activism in part to a plant-based diet she adopted over 50 years ago. She made the change after reflecting on the fear and pain involved in meat production, stating her decision was rooted in ethical and environmental concerns. Goodall frequently spoke about the damage caused by factory farming and its contribution to greenhouse gas emissions. She also noted feeling physically better after giving up meat, a lifestyle choice that aligns with research linking plant-based diets to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease and certain cancers.</p>

          <p>An opinion piece reflects on the life and impact of primatologist Jane Goodall, who passed away at 91. The article recounts her pivotal moment in 1960 when she first observed a chimpanzee, whom she named David Greybeard, using a twig as a tool to eat termites. This discovery fundamentally challenged the definition of humanity and our understanding of the animal kingdom. Goodall's work, which began with no formal college experience, evolved from studying chimpanzees to establishing global conservation programs and animal sanctuaries, forever changing how humans perceive their place in the world.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The long-held belief that a prestigious college degree is the ultimate prize is weakening, as families increasingly prioritize practical outcomes like cost, career placement, and hands-on learning. With soaring tuition and a challenging job market, parents are questioning the return on investment from elite institutions. This shift is reflected in data showing fewer high-income families are willing to pay full sticker price, and many now value strong specific majors and internship opportunities over a school's brand name. Consequently, college rankings are becoming more fluid, with regional universities rising to rival traditional powerhouses.</p>

          <p>Certified financial planners recommend using the fourth quarter to conduct a thorough financial review, as actual income and spending data are available to inform key decisions. This year is particularly important for tax planning due to changes from President Trump's recent tax bill, including a temporary increase in the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap. Experts advise strategizing to maximize such benefits while also preparing for the new year, such as by creating a holiday budget to avoid starting 2026 with financial stress. Planning ahead can prevent common mistakes like considering each tax year in isolation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>China is rapidly advancing its aircraft carrier technology, recently demonstrating the launch of stealth jets from its new carrier, the Fujian, using an electromagnetic catapult system—a capability previously exclusive to the U.S. Navy's Ford-class. Despite this technological leap, experts argue China significantly lags behind the U.S. in operational experience, skilled personnel, and established doctrine, which have been developed over decades of global deployments. While China is investing heavily in training, building this institutional knowledge and a deep roster of experienced crew will take considerable time, leaving the U.S. with a distinct advantage in carrier warfare.</p>

In an unusually personal opinion, the judge accused the president of bullying and ignoring the Constitution, warning that Trump believes Americans will not defend constitutional values so long as their own interests are unaffected.</p>
