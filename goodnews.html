          <p>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz is scheduled to meet with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House next week to discuss bilateral relations and international issues. The meeting, set for Thursday, marks the first in-person encounter between the two leaders since Merz assumed office on May 6, succeeding Angela Merkel. Discussions will include Russia's ongoing war in Ukraine, the situation in the Middle East, and trade policy, as Germany aims to defuse trade tensions between the European Union and the United States. Trump had previously threatened to impose tariffs on goods imported from the EU, but later postponed the deadline. The discussions will be important to assess if a solution to the trade tensions can be reached. The meeting between Merz and Trump highlights the ongoing diplomatic efforts to address pressing global challenges. </p>

          <p>A psychiatrist who has worked with over 3,000 young adults suggests parents follow five simple rules to raise highly successful children, emphasizing the importance of trusting instincts and cultural traditions. The advice includes following one's instincts rather than influencers, adhering to cultural values instead of clickbait, and focusing on a child's individual interests rather than conforming to the crowd. The psychiatrist also recommends prioritizing enjoyment over strict developmental milestones and encouraging parents to be their real selves, rather than striving for an unattainable ideal. The expert believes that children thrive when they receive love, attention, and are engaged in playful activities with caring individuals.</p>

          <p>Sharon Horgan, the Bafta award-winning actor, writer, producer, and director, shared at the Hay Festival that she finally gained confidence after the second series of her hit show 'Bad Sisters' premiered last year. Horgan initially turned to writing because she struggled to secure acting roles, leading her to create parts for herself. She discussed penning her first pilot with Dennis Kelly for the BBC Three show 'Pulling,' highlighting the lack of female-led comedies at the time. Horgan also touched on the themes of motherhood in her work, including the hit BBC series 'Motherland,' emphasizing the importance of finding one's community and addressing feelings of loneliness.</p>

          <p>Oscar Piastri secured pole position at the Spanish Grand Prix, outperforming his McLaren teammate Lando Norris in Barcelona. The result suggests that a recent rule change aimed at restricting front wing flexing had little impact on McLaren's performance. The FIA introduced the rule after lobbying from Red Bull and Ferrari, hoping to reduce McLaren's aerodynamic advantage. Piastri noted that the rule change had limited impact on McLaren's preparation for the race. Verstappen acknowledged that he was not fast enough, despite trying different approaches to preparing his tires.</p>

President Xi Jinping positioned China as a "good friend and partner" of Latin American and Caribbean nations, offering a US$9.2 billion credit line to support development.
