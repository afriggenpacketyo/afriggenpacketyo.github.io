          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels. This minimally invasive technique, which avoids open-skull surgery like that used by Elon Musk's Neuralink, helped a paralyzed patient regain some limb movement. The procedure involved inserting a stent electrode into the patient's intracranial vasculature via a neck vein under imaging guidance. This development could represent a safer, less risky alternative for BCI technology with shorter recovery times and a wider range of potential applications for paralysis.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, taking sole possession of the best record in the MLB despite what their manager described as an incomplete performance. The game featured a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May, defensive errors, and a quiet offense in the later innings. Key contributions included a leadoff home run by Shohei Ohtani and a two-run homer from Max Muncy, which helped counter the early deficit. The game was ultimately decided by a bases-loaded, game-ending double play in the ninth inning, highlighting the team's ability to win even when not playing at its peak.</p>

          <p>Chelsea manager Enzo Maresca has publicly stated that the club has no plans to sell 19-year-old defender Josh Acheampong, despite interest from other clubs in England and Europe. Maresca emphasized his belief in Acheampong's potential to become a top defender for Chelsea and outlined that the best plan for his development is to remain with the team. Acheampong, a product of Chelsea's academy, signed a new five-year contract last year and had a breakthrough season under Maresca. The manager's comments aim to quell speculation about the young player's future ahead of Chelsea's upcoming Club World Cup match.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent study by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age people who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet. The research assessed diets comprising rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, mushrooms, and seaweed, and found that individuals adhering to this eating pattern were less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms. The study, which surveyed nearly 12,500 employees, suggests that specific nutrients in the diet, such as omega-3 fatty acids in fish and folic acid in vegetables, may contribute to improved mental well-being. Researchers hope the findings can inform public health measures for depression prevention.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a residence in New Orleans and will be transferred to a secure state correctional facility. The May 16 escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has drawn criticism toward the management of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's office. One inmate, Derrick Groves, remains at large, with a $50,000 reward offered for information leading to his arrest. At least 16 other individuals have been arrested for allegedly aiding the inmates' escape.</p>

          <p>The Japanese fruit sandwich, or "furutsu sando," has made its way to UK high streets, with Marks & Spencer launching a limited-edition strawberries and cream version. This sweet sandwich, made with strawberries, whipped cream cheese, and sweetened bread, became the supermarket's top-selling sandwich shortly after its debut. The concept, popular in Japan and a viral sensation on social media, involves serving fruit in soft, crustless white bread, often cut to display the colorful filling. While unusual to some, the offering taps into a British fondness for fruit and bread combinations like jam or banana sandwiches.</p>

          <p>Kat Sadler, the creator and star of the Bafta-winning BBC comedy "Such Brave Girls," reveals that the show's dark humor is inspired by her real-life experiences and the "bleak" modern dating scene. The series, which co-stars her sister Lizzie Davidson, follows two sisters and their mother as they navigate dysfunctional relationships and financial struggles. Sadler explains that the show satirizes the idea that being single is a worst-case scenario, while also tackling taboo subjects like mental health with a twisted, female-centric perspective. The success of the first series has allowed them to push the characters even further in the upcoming season.</p>

          <p>Scientists are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses viruses to kill bacteria, as a potential weapon against antibiotic-resistant superbugs. Phages, or bacteriophages, are viruses that specifically target and destroy bacteria, offering a highly precise alternative to broad-spectrum antibiotics. As the threat of an "antibiotic apocalypse" grows, researchers are collecting and studying these phages from various environments to build a library of potential treatments. While the path to widespread clinical use is still being charted, phage therapy is already available on compassionate grounds and represents a promising frontier in the fight against untreatable infections.</p>

This pioneering technology will allow scientists to create a global 3D map of forests, accurately estimate their carbon storage, and better understand their role in mitigating climate change.

U.S. District Judge Loren AliKhan struck down the order against the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it a "resounding victory for the rule of law." This is the latest in a series of legal defeats for the administration's campaign to punish law firms for representing clients or causes the president opposes. The orders have sought to impose punitive measures like suspending security clearances and ending government contracts, which judges have consistently found to be an unconstitutional assault on the legal system.</p>
