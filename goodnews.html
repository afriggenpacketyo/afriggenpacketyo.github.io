          <p>Tropical Storm Kiko has formed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, approximately 1,045 miles from the southern tip of Baja California, posing no immediate threat to land. With maximum sustained winds of 40 mph, the storm is moving west at 9 mph. The U.S. National Hurricane Center predicts it will strengthen over the next few days, likely becoming a hurricane by Tuesday when its winds are expected to exceed 74 mph. Kiko is the eleventh named storm to form in the Eastern North Pacific this year, highlighting an active storm season in the region.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied migrant children to Guatemala without a formal deportation order. The ruling came just as planes were reportedly preparing for takeoff, following an urgent legal challenge from attorneys representing the children. The lawyers argued the deportations would violate U.S. law, which provides protections for minors from speedy removal and allows them to seek humanitarian relief. The administration contended it was repatriating the children at the request of their families, a claim disputed by the plaintiffs' attorneys.</p>

          <p>Celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has revealed he was diagnosed with skin cancer and recently had a basal cell carcinoma surgically removed from his face. He shared the news on social media, posting photos of the bandage and stitches while urging his followers to use sunscreen. Ramsay, who previously advocated for helmet safety after a serious cycling accident, used his platform to raise awareness about the common but treatable form of cancer. Medical experts affirm that early detection and treatment for basal cell carcinoma lead to a very high cure rate, reinforcing the importance of preventative measures and regular skin checks.</p>

          <p>Charlie Woods, the 16-year-old son of golf legend Tiger Woods, recorded his second hole-in-one during the final round of the Junior Players Championship in Florida. The impressive shot occurred on the par-three third hole at TPC Sawgrass from a distance of 177 yards. This marks another significant milestone for the young golfer, whose first ace was achieved just last year at the 2024 PNC Championship while playing alongside his father. The achievement highlights the promising development of the young athlete as he follows in his famous father's footsteps on the golf course.</p>

          <h2>Iran Remains Muted Following European Move to Restore Global Sanctions</h2>

          <p>Iran has yet to retaliate with significant nuclear escalation after Germany, England, and France initiated the "snapback" process to reimpose global sanctions. This lack of a strong response is a departure from Tehran's previous strategy of countering Western pressure by advancing its nuclear program. Analysts suggest that recent Israeli and U.S. strikes, which severely damaged Iran's nuclear infrastructure, have left the regime with limited options for retaliation. While Iran had threatened to withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty, it has so far refrained from doing so, potentially indicating a weakened position in its standoff with the West.</p>

          <p>European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has stated that Europe is developing "pretty precise plans" for a multinational troop deployment to Ukraine as part of post-conflict security guarantees. In an interview, she mentioned that President Trump has reassured European leaders of an American presence to backstop the arrangement. The plan could involve tens of thousands of European-led troops supported by U.S. assets like command systems and intelligence. High-level discussions on the matter are expected to continue among European leaders, signaling a significant step in long-term strategic planning for Ukraine's security after the war.</p>

          <p>The UK has finalized its largest-ever warship export deal by value, a £10 billion agreement to supply the Norwegian navy with at least five new Type 26 frigates. The deal is expected to support thousands of UK jobs, particularly at BAE Systems' shipyards in Glasgow where the anti-submarine warships will be constructed. This strategic partnership strengthens NATO's northern flank by creating a combined UK-Norwegian fleet of 13 similar frigates designed to operate jointly in the North Atlantic. The agreement represents a significant victory for the British defense industry over international competitors from France, Germany, and the United States. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Powerball jackpot has surged to an estimated $1.1 billion after no ticket matched all six numbers in Saturday night's drawing. This marks the fortieth consecutive drawing without a jackpot winner, with the last grand prize being won on May 31. While the top prize remains elusive, several smaller prizes were won, including a $1 million ticket sold in Worcester, Massachusetts, and three other tickets in the state winning $50,000 each.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>European Union foreign ministers held informal talks to brainstorm future support for Ukraine, exploring several new avenues as the war with Russia continues. Among the ideas discussed were the potential for secondary sanctions on Russia's trading partners and establishing "safe haven" arms production for Ukrainian companies on EU soil. Ministers also revisited the contentious issue of seizing frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Kyiv's reconstruction efforts. Another proposal involved shifting the EU's military training mission for Ukrainian troops from Poland and Germany onto Ukrainian territory once a ceasefire is achieved, signaling long-term strategic planning.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A major kelp restoration project off the coast of Southern California has proven highly successful after divers manually removed nearly 5.8 million purple sea urchins from the ocean floor. The voracious urchins, whose population had exploded due to ecological imbalances, had decimated over 80% of the local kelp forests, creating vast underwater "barrens." Led by The Bay Foundation, the 13-year effort has cleared over 80 acres, allowing the vital "sequoias of the sea" to regrow rapidly. This restoration has revived critical habitat for hundreds of marine species and demonstrated a viable method for combating kelp loss elsewhere.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made at the Kultepe site in Turkey, where excavators have unearthed a previously unknown community of private homes. The discovery challenges the long-held belief that the area was solely composed of palatial residences during the period predating the arrival of Assyrian merchants. According to the excavation leader, these more modest dwellings suggest a more complex urban plan and social hierarchy than previously understood, likely housing administrators, craftsmen, and other professionals. This breakthrough, after 77 years of excavation at the site, is expected to provide new insights into the daily lives and social structures of ancient Anatolians.</p>

This retirement deals a significant blow to Norris's title hopes, widening Piastri's lead to 34 points. The chaotic race, which featured three safety cars and multiple incidents, also saw Red Bull's Max Verstappen inherit second place and French rookie Isack Hadjar claim a surprise first-ever podium finish.</p>
