          <p>Florian Wirtz, a 22-year-old German football star, has officially joined Liverpool from Bayer Leverkusen for a record-breaking ‚Ç¨150 million, marking the most expensive transfer in Bundesliga history. Wirtz, considered one of Germany's biggest talents alongside Jamal Musiala, previously played a key role in Leverkusen's double win, scoring 35 goals and providing 47 assists in 140 games. His early football development was nurtured at home with his sister Juliane, also a professional footballer, and his father, who is now his agent. Known for his offensive prowess and defensive contribution, Wirtz's move to Liverpool is expected to significantly boost their midfield, and he will wear the number 10 shirt. The transfer highlights Liverpool's investment in young talent and their ambition to remain competitive in the Premier League and Champions League.</p>

          <p>The UK government is set to unveil a 10-year industrial strategy focused on lowering energy costs for businesses and supporting key industries to boost economic growth. The plan includes the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme, which will cut energy costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour for over 7,000 manufacturing firms starting in 2027. Additionally, about 500 energy-intensive firms will receive a 90% discount on network charges from 2026 through the British Industry Supercharger scheme. Other measures include upskilling Britons, attracting global talent, streamlining planning processes, and increasing research and development spending, particularly in AI, while focusing on eight specific sectors including advanced manufacturing, clean energy, and financial services. The strategy aims to create over one million new well-paid jobs over the next decade and marks a shift from fixing inherited problems to delivering tangible change. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>NATO allies are expected to pledge increased defense spending, potentially reaching 5% of their GDP, as the U.S. pushes for greater financial commitment from its partners. The proposed 5% target includes 3.5% for core defense and 1.5% for security-related infrastructure. While some members are supportive, others are hesitant, particularly those struggling to meet the existing 2% threshold. The summit takes place against a backdrop of ongoing conflict in Ukraine and instability in the Middle East, underscoring the need for collective security efforts. However, the key question remains whether these pledges will translate into concrete action and increased military capabilities, especially amidst competing domestic priorities.</p>

          <p>An NHS Lothian psychiatrist in Scotland is hoping to establish a ketamine clinic by the end of the year to treat severe depression as an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This move follows a private clinic in Lanarkshire that began offering ketamine assisted therapy last summer for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine, while known as a party drug, is being explored for its potential to treat severe depression, though it is not yet licensed for routine treatment. The Royal College of Psychiatrists is expected to release a new report on psychedelics later this year, including updated information on ketamine.</p>

          <p>The upcoming NATO summit in The Hague is expected to set ambitious goals for member states, particularly concerning defense spending, which could heavily impact Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. While Chancellor Friedrich Merz has pledged financial resources to strengthen the Bundeswehr, NATO's target of spending 5% of GDP on defense is contentious, with some coalition members and opposition parties skeptical. To meet these goals, the German military may need to recruit tens of thousands of additional soldiers, potentially requiring a reevaluation of conscription policies, and there is uncertainty about whether Germany can significantly increase its troop numbers in the coming years.</p>

          <p>The Japan Meteorological Agency has reported observing over 180 earthquakes near the Tokara island chain in southwestern Japan over the weekend, urging residents to remain vigilant for a strong tremor. Two earthquakes measuring 4 on the Japanese seismic intensity scale occurred on Akuseki Island, part of the island chain in Kagoshima Prefecture. Jolts with an epicenter near the island chain have been frequently observed since Saturday, according to the agency, prompting heightened awareness among local populations. The agency is continuing to monitor the situation and provide updates to residents.</p>

          <h2>New York City to Use Ranked Choice Voting in Democratic Mayoral Primary</h2>

          <p>New York City is set to use ranked choice voting in its Democratic mayoral primary election, a system that allows voters to rank multiple candidates in order of preference. If no candidate receives more than 50% of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated, and their votes are redistributed to the voters' second choices. The process continues until a candidate receives a majority. The system aims to ensure broad support for the winning candidate, but also presents challenges in transparency and predictability.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory in Chile has released its first images, showcasing its ability to peer into the universe with unprecedented detail. One image reveals vast gas and dust clouds in a star-forming region 9,000 light years from Earth. The observatory, equipped with the world's most powerful digital camera, is set to transform our understanding of the universe, potentially discovering a ninth planet in our solar system and mapping the Milky Way. The project represents a generational endeavor for astronomers, promising new insights into dark matter and the detection of potentially hazardous asteroids.</p>

          <p>The Vera C. Rubin Observatory has unveiled its first images, signaling the start of a decade-long survey of the southern night sky. The observatory is equipped with a large telescope and a car-sized digital camera, and will collect data on about 40 billion stars, galaxies, and celestial objects. It's designed to detect changes and movements in the sky, potentially discovering millions of new objects and transient phenomena. This "discovery machine" will provide astronomers with a vast amount of data for exploring galaxies, stars, and objects in the solar system in new ways.</p>
