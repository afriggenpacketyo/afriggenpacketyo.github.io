          <p>Shares in the gaming platform Roblox surged after the company reported second-quarter net bookings of $1.44 billion, significantly beating analyst expectations. This growth was driven by a 41% year-over-year increase in daily active users, reaching 111.8 million. While the company posted a net loss, it raised its booking guidance for the next quarter, signaling confidence in its continued expansion and creator ecosystem. The platform also recently introduced new age verification tools to improve safety for its younger user base. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>This article cautions homeowners considering home equity loans or HELOCs to avoid costly mistakes in the current economic climate. Key pitfalls include opting for a variable-rate HELOC when predictable payments are needed, as rates could rise. It also warns against borrowing more than necessary and overlooking hidden closing costs and fees that can diminish the loan's value. The advice stresses careful planning and comparing the full Annual Percentage Rate (APR) across different lender offers to understand the true cost. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>As Amazon prepares to report its second-quarter earnings, Wall Street is closely watching the performance of its cloud computing (AWS) and advertising divisions. Key factors influencing the results include the impact of President Trump's tariff policies on the company's e-commerce business and its competition with retailers like Shein and Temu. Investors are also focused on Amazon's planned $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, largely for AI-related investments, and whether these efforts are translating into accelerated growth for AWS.

          <p>A new study published in the journal Cell has solved a long-standing botanical mystery, revealing that the potato evolved from an ancient tomato ancestor. Researchers found that around 9 million years ago, a hybridization event occurred between the tomato ancestor and another wild species. The tomato provided a crucial gene that enables the formation of starch-rich tubers, while the other parent contributed a gene that controls the growth of underground stems, together creating the potato we know today.</p>

          <p>This article explains the "95% rule," a critical consumer protection feature of federally insured reverse mortgages. This rule stipulates that if heirs wish to keep the property after the borrower's death, they only need to pay the lesser of the full loan balance or 95% of the home's current appraised value. This prevents a situation where heirs would have to pay more than the home is worth, especially if the loan balance has grown significantly over time, providing them with a more manageable option to retain the family home.

          <p>President Trump has announced a 90-day extension for reaching a new trade deal with Mexico, keeping the current tariff agreement in place for the interim period. The decision, made after a call with Mexico's president, was attributed to the "complexities" of the cross-border trade relationship. This move provides temporary relief and more time for negotiations, coming just a day before a deadline that would have triggered higher punitive tariffs on goods from dozens of other countries that have not yet secured trade deals with the U.S.</p>
