          <p>A copy of the parenting book "Your Child, His Family, and Friends" was recently returned to the San Antonio Public Library, nearly 82 years after it was checked out in 1943. The book was discovered by a person in Oregon among their late father's belongings and was mailed back with a letter explaining its long journey. The sender speculated their grandmother, who moved to Mexico City for a U.S. Embassy job, had borrowed it. Fortunately for the family, the library stopped charging late fees in 2021, saving them from a potential fine of almost $900.</p>

          <p>The Jeff Bezos-backed startup Slate Automotive is promoting a new, American-made electric pickup truck designed to be highly affordable by simplifying the base model and offering extensive customization options. The company's strategy involves selling a barebones vehicle that owners can upgrade with over 100 accessories, including a kit to convert it into an SUV. However, the vehicle's competitiveness is being questioned, especially after the rollback of federal EV tax credits, which raises its starting price. Analysts are watching to see if consumers will still be attracted to the truck at a higher price point compared to other available models.</p>

          <p>Salesforce shares experienced a rally as the activist hedge fund Starboard Value revealed it had increased its stake in the company by 47% during the second quarter. This move has fueled market speculation that another round of activist pressure could be imminent, similar to a successful campaign in 2022-2023 that pushed for greater efficiency and profitability. Analysts suggest this renewed pressure could force management to refocus on core business growth and margin expansion. The stock had been underperforming recently amid concerns about the impact of AI on its business model and skepticism over recent acquisition strategies. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A DeKalb County judge has dismissed domestic terrorism charges against an activist protesting the Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, known as 'Cop City.' The judge ruled that the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was violated due to significant delays by the state, which failed to secure an indictment nearly two and a half years after the arrest. This decision is viewed as a significant victory for opponents of the controversial training facility. The defendant still faces separate RICO conspiracy charges in Fulton County as part of a broader legal case against the protest movement.</p>

          <p>The common kitchen spice cloves may provide several health benefits beyond their use in cooking, according to various research studies. The antibacterial properties of cloves, stemming from a compound called eugenol, can help control plaque and reduce the risk of gum disease. Studies also suggest that eugenol can help lower blood sugar levels, with one finding that daily clove extract intake significantly reduced post-meal blood sugar. Additionally, cloves are a source of essential minerals like calcium and magnesium and contain antioxidants that can help prevent cell damage, though clove oil should be used with caution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following reports that the Trump administration is considering taking a financial stake in Intel, a D.A. Davidson technology analyst has described the potential intervention as "essential" for U.S. national security. The argument is that government support is necessary to revitalize the struggling chipmaker and reduce American dependence on foreign semiconductor manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC. Intel's stock rose over 6% on the news. This move would align with the administration's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the U.S., potentially using funds from the CHIPS Act to structure the deal.

          <p>An essay in The Atlantic reflects on the literary craft of Scottish author Muriel Spark, focusing on her most famous novel, "The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie." The article highlights Spark's "steely command of omniscience" and her exploration of adolescent moral education through the story of a group of schoolgirls influenced by their unorthodox teacher in 1930s Edinburgh. The essay notes that the novel's central theme is rooted in Spark's Catholic faith, examining how the characters navigate the powerful, god-like influence of their teacher. It concludes that Spark realistically portrays the lasting impact such a magnetic figure can have on a young person's life.</p>
