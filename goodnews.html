          <p>Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 1.8% year-over-year in the second quarter, surpassing economists' expectations of 1.6% and marking the fastest growth rate since September of the previous year. This positive economic data follows the Reserve Bank of Australia's recent decision to cut interest rates, citing a more optimistic outlook despite global uncertainties. While the central bank has slightly lowered its overall growth forecast for the year due to productivity concerns, consumer and business confidence appear to be improving, supported by easier financial conditions.

          <p>An opinion article posits that the success of Chinese brands like Pop Mart's Labubu dolls is just the beginning of a larger trend where Chinese companies are building global trust and brand recognition. The author argues this "branding supercycle" is expanding beyond consumer products into industrial sectors like electric vehicle batteries (CATL), cars (BYD, Xiaomi), and drones. This shift indicates that Chinese firms are now competing on brand advantage and consumer trust, not just cost. This evolution represents a significant change in the Chinese business mindset toward establishing lasting global influence. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A woman in Alhambra, California, successfully escaped a domestic violence incident by using a hand signal popularized on social media to alert a bystander. The witness saw the woman make the gesture—tucking a thumb into her palm and closing her fingers over it—and called 911. Police responded to the 7-Eleven and arrested the suspect, a convicted felon who was found to have an active warrant and a stun gun. The "signal for help" was created by the Canadian Women's Foundation in 2020 as a discreet way for individuals to indicate they are in danger and has been credited with rescues worldwide.</p>

          <p>An Alabama man has been arrested for allegedly making criminal threats against St. Michael's Abbey, a church in Orange County, California. The suspect, identified as Joshua Michael Richardson, reportedly sent threatening emails and later visited the church in person to make further threats, which were reported by a priest. Upon his arrest, deputies discovered body armor, high-capacity magazines, brass knuckles, and knives in his vehicle. The Orange County Sheriff's Department highlighted the incident as an example of the importance of community vigilance, urging the public to report any suspicious activity.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. appeals court has allowed Federal Trade Commissioner Rebecca Slaughter to resume her position, rejecting the Trump administration's attempt to remove her from office. In a 2-1 decision, the court affirmed that FTC commissioners are protected from being fired by a president without cause, upholding nearly a century of legal precedent designed to insulate regulatory agencies from partisan politics. The ruling is a significant check on presidential power over independent agencies and a major test of their independence. Slaughter, a Democrat, was one of two commissioners fired by Trump in March.</p>

          <p>A jury has cleared rapper Cardi B of liability in a $24 million civil lawsuit brought by a security guard who accused her of assault and battery. The plaintiff, Emani Ellis, alleged that the artist spat on her and scratched her with a long fingernail during a 2018 confrontation outside a doctor's office. Cardi B, whose real name is Belcalis Almánzar, testified that while a heated verbal exchange occurred, she never physically touched the guard. After less than an hour of deliberation, the jury sided with the rapper, who stated outside the courthouse that she would deny the accusations "on my deathbed."</p>

          <h2>Scientists Discover Waxworm Caterpillars Can Digest Polyethylene Plastic and Convert It into Body Fat</h2>

          <p>Researchers have made a significant discovery that waxworms can consume and break down polyethylene, the world's most common plastic, in a matter of days. The caterpillars are able to digest the plastic and convert it into lipids, a process one researcher compared to humans storing excess fat after eating steak. While the waxworms cannot survive solely on a plastic diet, scientists are optimistic they can develop a co-supplementation to maintain the creatures' health. This finding presents a potential biological solution to help address the global plastic pollution crisis, with possibilities of using the fattened worms for other purposes like fish food.</p>

          <p>Kilauea, one of the world's most active volcanoes, has resumed erupting from its summit crater, shooting lava fountains up to 330 feet into the air. This marks the 32nd eruptive episode since the current activity began in December 2024, with all lava flows so far contained within Halemaʻumaʻu crater in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, magma is being supplied from deep within the earth, causing pressure to build and periodically release in spectacular fountains. Scientists are monitoring the volcano closely, as past eruption patterns have varied from contained episodes to long-term lava flows from lower-elevation vents.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has issued remedies in the landmark antitrust case against Google, ordering the company to share some search data with rivals but stopping short of the harshest penalties sought by the Department of Justice. The ruling does not require Google to sell its Chrome browser or Android operating system, a decision that investors viewed favorably, causing Alphabet's stock to jump 8% in extended trading. While Google will be barred from entering exclusive default search engine contracts, it can still make payments for placement. The DOJ stated the ruling will help restore competition to the search market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>UK authorities are warning the public about an increase in sophisticated parking scams, including fake text messages and tampered payment machines. Fraudsters are sending texts with urgent language demanding payment for non-existent fines, often linking to convincing clone websites to steal personal information. Another common scam involves attaching "skimming" devices to contactless readers on parking machines, which steal card details while displaying a "card declined" message. To avoid being victimized, experts advise checking that any fine notice includes specific vehicle, time, and location details, and never clicking on unsolicited links.</p>

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bipartisan bill aimed at curbing the flow of fentanyl by imposing sanctions on Chinese officials who fail to act against its trafficking. The legislation targets officials who intentionally avoid preventing the trade of the synthetic opioid and its precursors. It also facilitates sanctions against Chinese manufacturers and distributors who do not implement "know-your-customer" procedures or cooperate with U.S. counter-narcotics efforts. While the bill's sponsor emphasized attacking the source of production, other representatives noted that sanctions alone are not enough and require diplomatic partnership to be effective.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has ruled that the Trump administration's deployment of the National Guard in Los Angeles in June was a violation of the Posse Comitatus Act, a law that restricts the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. The judge's opinion stated that the administration knowingly broke the law in an attempt to establish a military presence to enforce federal laws. The ruling scrutinizes the White House's legal argument for a "constitutional exception," which the judge dismissed as not grounded in history or law. This decision sets a significant legal precedent, though it does not apply nationwide and is expected to be appealed.</p>
