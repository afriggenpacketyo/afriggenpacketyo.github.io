          <p>A leading economist from China International Capital Corporation has asserted that China possesses a significant advantage in the global stablecoin race due to its mature third-party payment systems like WeChat Pay and Alipay. These platforms, which function similarly to stablecoins by being pegged 1:1 with fiat currency, are supported by a well-established regulatory framework. The economist's analysis highlights that these digital money systems are safeguarded by central bank base money, positioning China to lead as stablecoins become more prominent in international economic discussions.

          <p>Harvard University and the University of Toronto have created a contingency plan to support international graduate students who may be barred from re-entering the United States due to potential visa restrictions. The program would allow affected students from Harvard's Kennedy School to continue their studies at Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy. This initiative follows a DHS move to terminate Harvard's ability to enroll international students over data-sharing disputes, providing a safety net for students amid legal and political uncertainty surrounding U.S. immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A research team from China's Nankai University has successfully completed the world's first human trial of a brain-computer interface (BCI) implanted through blood vessels, a minimally invasive alternative to open-skull surgery. The procedure enabled a paralyzed patient to regain some limb movement by inserting a stent electrode into the brain's vascular network via a neck vein. This technological advancement presents a potential competitor to Elon Musk's Neuralink, offering a method that could significantly reduce surgical risks and recovery times for patients with paralysis.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Kansas City Royals 5-4, extending their winning streak even as the team's manager, Dave Roberts, acknowledged they are not playing their best baseball. The victory was characterized by a shaky start from pitcher Dustin May, defensive errors, and inconsistent offense from key players. Despite these struggles, timely home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Max Muncy, combined with a game-ending double play, were enough to secure the win, highlighting the team's ability to grind out victories against struggling opponents.</p>

          <p>A study conducted by the Japan Institute for Health Security has found that working-age individuals who consume a traditional Japanese-style diet show lower rates of depressive symptoms. The research assessed a diet rich in rice, miso soup, fish, soy products, and vegetables among nearly 12,500 employees. While researchers say more study is needed, the findings suggest that certain foods in the diet, such as those containing omega-3 fatty acids and folic acid, may contribute to improved mental well-being by aiding the release of neurotransmitters like serotonin.</p>

          <p>Authorities have captured Antoine Massey, the ninth of ten inmates who escaped from the Orleans Justice Center in a major jailbreak six weeks ago. Massey was arrested peacefully at a New Orleans residence, leaving only one inmate, Derrick Groves, still at large. The escape, which went unnoticed for hours, has been called the worst in recent state history by the governor and has led to criticism of the Orleans Parish Sheriff's management of the facility. At least 16 people have also been arrested for allegedly aiding the escapees.</p>
