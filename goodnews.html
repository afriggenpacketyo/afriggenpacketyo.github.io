          <p>Vietnam veterans in Muscatine, Iowa, received their high school diplomas more than six decades after leaving school to serve in the military. Dennis Snyder, who joined the Navy before his junior year, was among the veterans honored through Operation Recognition, a program by the Iowa Department of Veterans Affairs. Snyder shared the honor with friends who died in the war, expressing gratitude for the recognition. The program allows veterans to close a chapter and receive the diplomas they missed due to their service.</p>

          <p>A Japanese startup, Craif Inc., has developed a urine-based cancer risk screening kit that shows promise in detecting cancer at its earliest stages. The "miSignal" test kit can simultaneously assess the risk of up to seven types of cancer without requiring a blood test. Trials in Hokkaido detected changes in pre-malignant cells, leading to early treatment and successful surgery. The kit detects microRNA, a biomarker linked to early cancer biology, making it valuable in areas with limited medical resources.</p>

          <p>Chinese researchers have used mathematical analysis to decode the metabolic cycle of yeast, revealing parallels with the ancient Chinese philosophy of yin and yang. The study, led by Professor Li Lei, reorganized yeast metabolism into four interconnected phases, mirroring the concept of mutual promotion and restraint in traditional Chinese medicine. Each phase reflects a unique metabolic state, similar to the "four symbols" theory. The research highlights the potential for integrating ancient wisdom with modern scientific understanding.</p>

          <p>Jane Dorotik's conviction for murdering her husband was overturned after she spent two decades in prison fighting for her freedom. New testing of evidence, including blood found in the couple's bedroom, revealed some spots were never tested and others were not blood at all. Working with Loyola Project for the Innocent, the court allowed them to have new DNA testing on items such as the rope found around Bob Dorotik's neck, his fingernails, and clothing. This is a story about a system that made a tragic mistake and how Jane was able to overturn it.</p>
