          <h2>New York Times: JD Vance as Vice President Foreshadowed Trump's Second Term Structure</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-05-04 07:28:06 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ezra Klein argues that Donald Trump's choice of JD Vance as his Vice President signaled a shift from a coalition government to a royal court, where Trump is surrounded by loyalists and enforcers. The article contends that unlike Trump's first term, where advisors sometimes curbed his impulses, his second term is characterized by yes-men, accelerationists, and the absence of dissenting voices. Klein asserts that the selection of Vance, who reportedly assured Trump he would overturn the 2020 election results, demonstrated that Trump's second term would be marked by ferocity and recklessness.</p>

          <p>Warren Buffett announced that he will recommend Greg Abel to succeed him as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway at the end of the year, marking the end of an era for the company. Buffett, 94, stated that Abel's more hands-on managerial style is a better fit for Berkshire's 60-plus subsidiaries. Abel, currently vice chairman of non-insurance operations, has a 25-year tenure at Berkshire and will continue Buffett's patient value investing style. Buffett will remain involved to assist Abel, but the final decisions on operations and capital allocation will be with the new CEO, and Buffett reiterated his commitment to retaining all his Berkshire shares.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Anthony Albanese secured a landslide re-election as Australia's prime minister, partly due to anti-Trump sentiment resulting from the global turmoil caused by President Trump's policies. Despite Albanese's efforts to maintain a neutral stance towards Trump, the conservative opposition leader, Peter Dutton, faced criticism for emulating Trump's ideas and messaging. Australians were alarmed by the impact of Trump's policies on their retirement accounts and his approach to international relations. The election results reflect a rejection of Trump-like politics and a preference for sensible, centrist approaches.</p>

          <p>Native American women are reviving the tradition of facial tattoos, known as inchunwa, as a way to reclaim their cultural heritage. The Inchunwa Project, a community-rooted collective, is working to revitalize these tattoos among south-eastern Indigenous nations. The practice, which faded after colonization, is now being embraced as a commitment to community and a way to honor ancestors. Modern practitioners are adapting traditional methods with sterile equipment and incorporating contemporary designs while maintaining the cultural significance of the inchunwa.</p>

          <p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is expected to resist pressure from President Donald Trump to cut interest rates, prioritizing price stability amid rising inflation concerns. Despite Trump's calls for a rate cut, the Fed is inclined to hold rates steady at its upcoming meeting. Recent government data showing a healthy jump in April payrolls supports the Fed's decision to stand pat. The White House's pursuit of tariff deals introduces uncertainty, complicating the Fed's ability to forecast future economic conditions. (not investment advice)</p>
