          <h2>Bank of England Governor Signals Readiness for Interest Rate Cuts Amid Slowing Labor Market</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:23:01 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has indicated that larger interest rate cuts could be implemented if the UK's job market continues to weaken. Citing an economy growing below its potential, Bailey noted that increasing "slack" would help reduce inflation, creating conditions for lowering the current 4.25% rate. His comments follow a drop in job vacancies to their lowest level since 2021 and concerns from businesses about the impact of increased national insurance contributions on hiring. This suggests a rate cut could come as soon as the Bank's next meeting in August. (not investment advice)</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:07:20 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Singapore successfully averted a technical recession by posting a 1.4% quarter-over-quarter economic growth in the second quarter of 2025, reversing a contraction from the previous quarter. The expansion was primarily driven by strong performance in the manufacturing and construction sectors, with some analysts attributing the boost to businesses front-loading exports ahead of potential tariffs. Despite the positive figures, the Ministry of Trade and Industry warned of significant uncertainty and downside risks for the remainder of the year, particularly concerning U.S. tariff policies. The government has maintained its cautious full-year growth forecast of 0% to 2%. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>China's June Exports Surpass Expectations, Driven by Non-U.S. Markets and Tariff Truce</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-14 03:05:26 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's exports grew by 5.8% in June, exceeding forecasts as a temporary tariff truce with the U.S. slowed the decline in American-bound shipments. Robust demand from Southeast Asian and European markets also significantly contributed to the growth, helping to offset continued weakness in domestic demand, as evidenced by a smaller-than-expected 1.1% rise in imports. The data also revealed a record surge in rare earth exports and strong performance in steel and integrated circuits. However, economists caution this momentum may be short-lived due to ongoing global trade uncertainties. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new all-time high, surging past the $120,000 mark, driven by significant inflows into Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and growing institutional adoption. The rally is also fueled by anticipation of clearer U.S. regulations, as lawmakers prepare for 'Crypto Week' to deliberate on bills that could establish a federal framework for digital assets, including stablecoins. Analysts believe this combination of strong institutional buying and increasing policy clarity is boosting investor confidence. The positive momentum comes despite potential risks from broader economic factors, such as future U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate decisions. (not investment advice)</p>
