          <p>A BBC article delves into the world of talking therapy, following 12 individuals as they undergo six sessions with therapists to address mental health challenges like anxiety, depression, and trauma. The article highlights the transformative power of understanding and managing one's mind, showcasing how therapy can help individuals confront deep-seated issues. One example is Nicole, who overcomes her anxiety and fear of driving by addressing deeper emotional issues, while another is James, who learns to manage his anxiety related to work performance after a stroke. Anjalee processes the trauma of her mother's death during her childhood, allowing her to move forward as a mother herself.</p>

          <p>Journalism, ridden by Umberto Rispoli, surged from behind to win the 150th Preakness Stakes at Pimlico Race Course. Trained by Michael McCarthy, Journalism, the 8-5 favorite, accelerated past the competition in the final stretch, securing Rispoli's first Triple Crown win and McCarthy's second Preakness title. The race, traditionally held at Pimlico, is scheduled to move to Laurel Park for redevelopment before returning to a new Pimlico in 2027. This victory marked redemption for Journalism, who previously finished second in the Kentucky Derby, and connections will now consider entering Journalism in the Belmont Stakes for a potential rematch with Sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A rare dust storm swept through northwest Indiana and north-central Illinois, plunging the Chicago area into near-zero visibility conditions. The National Weather Service issued a dust storm warning for Chicago for the first time, as winds from thunderstorms lifted dry soil from parched farmland. Visibility dropped dramatically, affecting major highways and causing hazardous driving conditions. Meteorologists noted that soil moisture levels in the area were exceptionally low, contributing to the severity of the storm. Such dust storms are more common in the desert Southwest and southern Great Plains, making this event particularly unusual for the region.</p>

          <p>Federal courts have consistently insisted that immigrants facing deportation be afforded due process, pushing back against the Trump administration's aggressive deportation policies. The Supreme Court recently rebuked the administration for providing only a day's warning to Venezuelan immigrants facing deportation under an 18th-century wartime law. Courts have also intervened to ensure immigrants have the opportunity to challenge their removals, particularly under the Alien Enemies Act. These decisions underscore the importance of due process, even as the administration has sought to expedite deportations and limit judicial review.</p>

The Conservative Party has criticized the possible scheme, calling it "free movement through the back door," and Reform UK has echoed these sentiments. An agreement is expected to be announced at an upcoming summit, although it is expected to be an agreement in principle, not the final deal.</p>

This three-eyed creature, about the length of an index finger, had a pencil sharpener-like mouth lined with teeth and intimidating claws extending from its head. The discovery reveals that Mosura was more complex than previously known radiodonts, featuring a multi-segmented abdomen-like region with gills, similar to modern arthropods.
