          <p>Sources indicate that Aaron Rodgers is poised to sign a one-year contract with the Pittsburgh Steelers, potentially resolving one of the NFL's most protracted off-season narratives. Rodgers has been without a team since his stint with the New York Jets concluded, and the Steelers are currently seeking a seasoned quarterback. This move would mark a significant shift for Rodgers, bringing his experience to a team looking to bolster its offense. The full details of the contract and its implications for the Steelers' season are anticipated to be released shortly.</p>

          <p>The government has announced that any child in England whose parents receive Universal Credit will be eligible for free school meals from September 2026, regardless of their income. This change is expected to make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents ¬£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The government has set aside ¬£1bn to fund the change up to 2029 and will review standards to ensure school meals are healthy. The move has been welcomed by some, but others argue that other measures, such as lifting the two-child benefit cap, would be more effective.</p>
