          <p>Yosemite National Park's eastern entrance, via Tioga Road, will reopen on Memorial Day, providing access to a scenic section of Highway 120 after its seasonal closure due to snow and ice. While the reopening is earlier than in previous years, some cyclists have expressed disappointment over the park's decision not to allow early access for cyclists before the road opens to vehicle traffic. Park officials are anticipating a busy season and are requiring reservations for visitors entering between 6 a.m. and 2 p.m. during the holiday weekend, with potential staffing shortages due to cuts at the National Park Service.</p>

          <p>A new study indicates that dog owners who frequently ruminate about work stress may inadvertently pass their anxiety on to their dogs. The research found a correlation between owners' job stress and stress-related behaviors in their pets, such as whining and restlessness. This connection is attributed to "crossover," where stress spills over from one individual to another within a household, and "emotional contagion," where dogs pick up on their owners' moods through subtle cues. The article suggests that employed dog owners could improve their pets' well-being by avoiding work-related thoughts while at home.</p>

This game highlights the Dodgers' reliance on their starting pitchers due to an overworked bullpen.

He was welcomed by cheering fans and Hawaii Governor Josh Green upon arrival at the Waikiki Yacht Club.

The chefs will also be allowed to opt for rented accommodation covered by the government.

          <p>Susan Brownmiller, the feminist author whose book "Against Our Will: Men, Women and Sexual Assault" redefined the understanding of sexual assault, has died at the age of 90. Her book argued that sexual assault was a crime of power and violence, not passion, influencing laws and societal attitudes. While her work was praised for its impact, it also faced criticism for its generalizations about men and its views on women's responsibility in avoiding sexual assault. Brownmiller remained a vocal advocate against pornography and sexual violence throughout her life.</p>
