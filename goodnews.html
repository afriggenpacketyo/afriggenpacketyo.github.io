          <p>The IRS has released updated federal income tax brackets and standard deductions for the 2026 tax year, which will be filed in 2027. Income thresholds for each bracket, including the top 37% rate, have been raised, alongside adjustments to capital gains, estate and gift tax exemptions, and earned income tax credit eligibility. The standard deduction will also increase to $32,200 for married couples and $16,100 for single filers. These announcements come amid a government shutdown, with nearly half of the IRS workforce furloughed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Victims of the UK Post Office Horizon IT scandal, considered one of the nation's worst miscarriages of justice, will now receive free government-funded legal advice for their compensation claims. This change, announced by the Business Secretary, aims to help sub-postmasters secure fair payouts, responding to recommendations from a public inquiry. More than 900 sub-postmasters were wrongly prosecuted due to faulty software, with many forced to use personal savings or accept low offers. The government has accepted most inquiry recommendations, extending the Horizon Shortfall Scheme and committing over £1.2 billion in payouts to date.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Lopez discusses her new musical film, "Kiss of the Spider Woman," emphasizing its timely message of acceptance amidst a world of division. Lopez was "immediately floored" by the script, based on a 1970s novel, which explores an unlikely bond between a transgender character and a political revolutionary. She describes playing three distinct iterations of the same woman as a significant challenge, akin to her experience with "Selena." The article highlights the film's core theme of seeing past differences and the power of art to provide comfort during difficult times.</p>

This article outlines five immediate steps to take, starting with thoroughly reading the summons to understand the creditor, amount, and response deadline.

Exploring debt relief options, including negotiation or professional programs, and consulting a legal professional are also crucial to protect one's rights and potentially mitigate financial consequences.

          <p>Delta Air Lines has exceeded expectations with its profit forecast for late 2025 and early 2026, driven by increasing airfares and sustained demand for luxury travel. The airline projected adjusted earnings between $1.60 and $1.90 per share for the fourth quarter, surpassing analyst estimates. CEO Ed Bastian noted a pickup in cash sales since July, indicating improved demand and reduced flight surpluses. While premium travel revenue surged by 9%, main cabin revenue slightly declined, yet Delta anticipates its upmarket options will soon eclipse main cabin sales. The article also mentions the airline has not yet experienced impacts from the federal government shutdown.</p>

          <p>The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals has issued a stay of execution for Robert Roberson, scheduled for next week, amidst his legal team's claims of innocence. Roberson was convicted in 2002 for the death of his 2-year-old daughter, Nikki, based on a shaken baby syndrome diagnosis that his defense now argues was a misdiagnosis. The court's ruling orders a review of his arguments under Texas' "junk science" law, which allows for relief if evidence used in conviction is no longer credible. This follows similar cases where individuals were exonerated after wrongful shaken baby convictions.</p>

          <p>California is set to become the first U.S. state to gradually eliminate certain ultra-processed foods from school meals over the next decade. Governor Gavin Newsom signed a new law requiring the state's Department of Public Health to define "ultra-processed foods of concern" by mid-2028, with schools beginning to phase them out by July 2029 and a full ban by 2035. This initiative builds on California's history of leading on school nutrition, including free meals and banning synthetic food dyes.

This action follows a temporary pause in IBR forgiveness that caused concern among borrowers, especially as IBR is currently the only plan offering debt erasure after decades of payments.

          <p>The debate over abolishing stamp duty in the UK is intensifying, with both Conservative and Labour parties considering changes. This article examines five potential consequences, including a likely rise in house prices due to increased demand, which could disproportionately benefit wealthier homeowners in southern England. While it could improve mobility for movers and downsizers, freeing up housing stock, its impact on overall transaction costs might be less significant than often perceived. Abolishing stamp duty would also create a substantial revenue gap for the Treasury, potentially leading to tax increases elsewhere. (not investment advice)</p>
