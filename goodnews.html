          <p>Days after trading All-Pro Micah Parsons, the Dallas Cowboys have secured cornerback DaRon Bland with a four-year, $92 million extension, including $50 million guaranteed. This deal places Bland among the NFL's highest-paid cornerbacks, recognizing his exceptional 2023 season where he led the league in interceptions and set a record with five pick-sixes, despite playing only seven games due to injury. The extension allows the Cowboys to allocate resources after Parsons' large contract was taken on by the Packers, aiming to fortify their defense for the future.</p>

          <p>The Oval Invincibles have secured their third consecutive men's title in The Hundred cricket tournament, demonstrating consistent dominance through expert team building and a stable core of players. Their success is attributed to strategic selections, strong leg-spin bowling, and explosive late-innings batting. However, the article suggests this era might be ending due to impending changes in the tournament's ownership and format, potentially transitioning to a T20 event and introducing new auction rules that could dismantle the current successful squads. This creates uncertainty for the future of the Invincibles' dominant run.</p>

Guehi, who scored in a recent victory, has one year left on his contract and does not intend to sign a new deal, creating a dilemma for the club. Glasner stressed the difficulty of finding a suitable replacement before the transfer window closes, emphasizing Guehi's crucial role as a key player and leader. Palace previously rejected a £65m offer for him, highlighting his perceived value.</p>

          <p>Director Chloé Zhao premiered her new film "Hamnet" at Telluride, sharing her personal journey through a "very painful fire" following her previous film, "Eternals." The movie, adapted from Maggie O’Farrell’s novel, explores William Shakespeare’s marriage and the devastating death of his son, Hamnet, portrayed by Paul Mescal and Jessie Buckley. Zhao, known for "Nomadland," discussed how she channeled grief and personal growth into this intimate human drama, moving from chasing horizons to a deeper, more vertical understanding of humanity. She emphasized the importance of confronting grief and staying present in her creative process, finding catharsis through her art.</p>

          <p>A federal judge issued an emergency order blocking the Trump administration from deporting unaccompanied Guatemalan migrant children, some of whom were already on planes preparing for takeoff. The judge's ruling, which will last 14 days, came after lawyers argued the deportations would violate legal protections and expose children to potential abuse. Government lawyers claimed the children were being repatriated at their families' request, a claim disputed by advocates. The decision mandates that children without deportation orders be returned to the custody of the Department of Health and Human Services, providing a temporary reprieve for vulnerable minors.</p>

          <p>Liverpool secured a 1-0 victory over Arsenal at Anfield, with Dominik Szoboszlai scoring a brilliant 83rd-minute free-kick, further cementing Arsenal's long-standing struggles at the stadium. Arsenal's conservative approach under manager Mikel Arteta was criticized as a missed opportunity, failing to challenge a Liverpool defense that had shown vulnerability. Despite significant transfer spending, Arsenal's inability to secure a win or even a goal at Anfield continues, highlighting a psychological barrier for the team against their rivals. Arteta cited injuries as mitigating circumstances, but acknowledged the need for a bolder approach in big matches.</p>
