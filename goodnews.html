        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Star pass rusher Micah Parsons has been traded from the Dallas Cowboys to the Green Bay Packers, ending a contentious contract stalemate. The Packers secured Parsons with a four-year, $188 million contract, making him the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. In exchange, Dallas received two first-round picks and defensive tackle Kenny Clark. Parsons expressed excitement about joining the historic franchise, aiming to build a legacy similar to Packers legends like Reggie White. The move provides Green Bay with a much-needed elite pass rusher but poses future salary cap challenges.</p>

          <p>Despite being one of the world's most sanctioned nations, North Korea has significantly increased its importation of Chinese wine. In the first seven months of 2025, North Korea purchased over 157,000 liters of wine from China, more than double the volume from the previous year, making it the second-largest market for Chinese bottled wine by volume. This trend continues from previous years, as China does not restrict wine sales to its neighbor. While the United Nations has banned luxury goods from entering North Korea since 2006, alcohol is not included on the prohibited items list.</p>

          <p>Ukraine has implemented new regulations allowing men under the age of 22 to leave the country, a change from the previous rule that barred men aged 18 to 60 from departing. The government's stated goal is to provide young Ukrainians with opportunities for education and work abroad, with the hope they will use their experience to aid in the nation's future development. This policy addresses concerns that the previous restrictions were causing a "lost generation" as young men feared returning home. However, some experts worry the move will exacerbate Ukraine's demographic challenges by encouraging more departures rather than returns.</p>

          <p>Novak Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie 6-4, 6-7 (4), 6-2, 6-3 to reach the fourth round of the US Open, becoming the oldest man to do so since 1991. Despite struggling with a lower back issue that required a medical timeout, the 38-year-old delivered his best performance of the tournament so far. Norrie played aggressively and managed to win the second set, but Djokovic's superior serving, which included 18 aces, and relentless play ultimately secured his victory. The win also ties Djokovic with Roger Federer for the most Grand Slam fourth-round appearances in history at 69.</p>

          <h2>Federal Judge Temporarily Halts Trump Administration's Expansion of Expedited Deportations</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A federal judge has issued a temporary block on the Trump administration's plan to expand the use of speedy deportations for undocumented migrants detained within the U.S. interior. U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb ruled that applying the "expedited removal" statute broadly without sufficient due process is unlawful, particularly for individuals who have been in the country for up to two years. The judge's opinion criticized the government's argument that those who entered illegally are entitled to no process, stating it would put everyone at risk. This decision is a setback for the administration's goal of increasing deportations without judicial review for every case.</p>

          <p>Three brothers from Edinburgh—Jamie, Ewan, and Lachlan MacLean—have set a new world record for the fastest non-stop, unsupported row across the Pacific Ocean. They completed the 9,000-mile journey from Peru to Australia in 139 days, five hours, and 52 minutes, beating the previous record by over 20 days. The trio faced severe challenges, including tropical storms that swept one brother overboard temporarily and forced them to make lengthy detours. The journey, completed in a boat named for their late sister, has also raised over £700,000 for clean water projects in Madagascar.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A 10-mile section of the Angeles Crest Highway has reopened just before Labor Day weekend after being closed for years due to extensive damage. The scenic route suffered from slope failures, rock slides, and collapsed pavement caused by severe winter storms in 2022 and 2023, with further damage from the 2024 Bridge fire. The repairs, costing approximately $7.9 million, included new guardrails, retaining walls, and drainage systems. The reopening provides access to popular hiking trails and is expected to reduce overcrowding at other trailheads, though officials have issued heightened fire danger warnings for the holiday weekend.</p>
