          <p>Taiwan's Executive Yuan removed the 'Han Chinese' category from its official demographic information, classifying the majority population as 'other population,' a move criticized by the KMT as a denial of history. The ruling DPP is intensifying efforts to promote Taiwan‚Äôs indigenous identity while distancing the island from mainland China. According to the revised web page, Taiwan's population is now 2.6% indigenous, 1.2% foreign, and 96.2% 'other population,' whereas previously, Han Chinese were identified as the largest ethnic group, comprising 96.4% of the total population. The KMT views this change as an attempt to erode historical and cultural ties with the mainland, while the DPP aims to assert a distinct Taiwanese identity.</p>

          <p>Chinese economist Yao Yang believes the US-China trade war is unsustainable, citing negative impacts on the US economy, including weak economic data and reduced investments. He suggests that both governments recognize the mutual harm caused by the trade war and are willing to negotiate seriously. Yao Yang anticipates a potential rollback of tariffs to around 34%, with the US possibly seeking increased purchases of American goods by China. The economist's analysis suggests a high likelihood of a deal, driven by the realization that the current trade conflict is detrimental to both economies.</p>

          <p>Japan's universal health care system, known for providing affordable medical care, is under strain due to an aging population and shrinking workforce, leading to political maneuvering ahead of key elections. Prime Minister Ishiba's government aims to secure funds for child-rearing by saving from the medical system, initially proposing increased costs for high medical expenses, which sparked backlash. Despite criticism, the government froze the planned hikes, pushing the deadline for a new plan after the upper house election. Analysts warn that turning the health insurance system into a political issue could undermine its stability and public trust, emphasizing the need for measured, long-term debate.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. has halted live cattle, horse, and bison imports from Mexico due to concerns about the spread of the New World screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite detected in southern Mexico. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins emphasized the decision's focus on animal and food safety, rather than politics, to protect the nation's food supply. The screwworm, eradicated in the U.S. and Mexico in the 1960s and '70s, has resurged in parts of Central America and is now detected in remote farms about 700 miles from the U.S. border. The ban will continue on a month-by-month basis until containment is achieved.</p>

The trial, funded by Mounjaro's manufacturer, Eli Lilly, involved obese individuals and found that Mounjaro users lost more weight, had better blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol levels, and experienced similar side effects. While both drugs have a role, Mounjaro may be more beneficial for those needing to lose the most weight. Both drugs work by tricking the brain into feeling full, but Mounjaro flips two appetite switches while Wegovy flips only one.</p>

The statue of the Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva, owned by Kannon Temple on Tsushima Island, was handed over in South Korea and transported back to Japan. South Korean authorities arrested the thieves, but a lawsuit claiming the statue was plundered by Japanese pirates centuries ago delayed its return. South Korea's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Kannon Temple's ownership in 2023, leading to the statue's return.</p>

          <p>The UK government is planning to toughen migration rules, including requiring adult dependents of foreign workers to pass an English language test and restricting care homes from recruiting staff from abroad. Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philip criticized the plans as not being tough enough on criminal migrants. The new rules would prioritize residency rights for those who pay taxes on time, work in the public sector, or volunteer. The government aims to reduce migration numbers and seize the narrative from Reform UK, while Conservatives criticize the plans for lacking a cap on numbers.</p>

While walking is a priority, patients also seek to restore bladder function, sexual function, and blood pressure regulation.
