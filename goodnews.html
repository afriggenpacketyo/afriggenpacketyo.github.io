          <p>New York Giants starting quarterback Russell Wilson has affirmed his commitment to leading the team, even with promising rookie Jaxson Dart positioned as his backup. Wilson, a 14-year NFL veteran, acknowledged Dart's work ethic and successful college career but emphasized that his primary goal is to secure victories for the Giants. This dynamic mirrors Wilson's own rookie season when he famously won the starting job over a veteran. Despite a season-opening loss, Giants head coach Brian Daboll has confirmed that Wilson will remain the starter for their upcoming game against the Dallas Cowboys.</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock surged by an impressive 27% in after-hours trading, driven by optimistic projections for its cloud infrastructure business and major new AI-related contracts. This significant investor enthusiasm came despite the company narrowly missing Wall Street's estimates for both quarterly earnings and overall revenue. CEO Safra Catz highlighted the signing of four multi-billion dollar cloud contracts, signaling strong future growth and a successful pivot to compete in the booming artificial intelligence market. The company also provided a robust forecast for its cloud revenue, expecting it to reach $144 billion annually within five years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Australian regulators have approved the world's first vaccine designed to protect endangered koalas from chlamydia, a disease that has devastated their populations. Developed by scientists at the University of the Sunshine Coast over more than a decade, the single-dose vaccine has been shown to reduce mortality by at least 65%. Chlamydia can cause blindness, infertility, and death in koalas, and is responsible for up to half of all deaths in some wild colonies. This approval marks a significant breakthrough in the effort to save the iconic species, which is also threatened by habitat loss and bushfires.</p>

          <p>Researchers at the Chinese Academy of Sciences have developed a new AI model, SpikingBrain 1.0, that reportedly runs up to 100 times faster on complex, lengthy tasks than conventional systems. The model mimics the human brain by only activating necessary neurons, allowing it to learn from less than 2% of the training data typically required. Significantly, the system operates entirely on China's homegrown MetaX chip platform, rather than relying on dominant Nvidia hardware. This breakthrough is strategically important for China's technological independence as it faces tightening U.S. export controls on advanced AI chips and related technology.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments on an expedited basis to determine the legality of the Trump administration's extensive global tariffs. The case challenges the President's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to impose levies, a move that lower courts have ruled exceeded his authority. This will be the first time the court assesses the legal foundation of one of President Trump's signature economic policies. The outcome could have significant consequences, potentially forcing the U.S. to refund billions of dollars collected and disrupting existing and future trade agreements with international partners.</p>

          <p>Apple has introduced its latest iPhone lineup, highlighted by the new, ultra-thin iPhone Air, which marks the first major redesign since 2017. The event also featured evolutionary updates to the base and Pro models, including better processors, improved cameras, and enhanced durability. While the company has yet to detail its full generative AI strategy, the new hardware and a strategic price increase on several models are expected to sustain investor confidence. The iPhone Air starts at $999, and the Pro model's starting price is now effectively $1,099, a move that should increase the average selling price across the product family.

          <p>OpenAI's Chief Financial Officer, Sarah Friar, issued a stark warning at a Goldman Sachs conference, stating that companies and professionals who fail to adopt artificial intelligence quickly will be left behind. She argued that the biggest competitive threat to established businesses will come from individuals and companies that are deeply integrating AI into their operations to disrupt traditional models. Friar's comments come as OpenAI significantly increases its spending to develop its AI capabilities. She also highlighted the immense demand for computing power as a major constraint, which has prompted the company to seek infrastructure partnerships beyond its primary one with Microsoft.</p>

          <p>The contest to replace Angela Rayner as the UK Labour Party's deputy leader is already creating awkwardness for Keir Starmer's new government. Candidates not currently serving as ministers, such as Emily Thornberry, are using the platform to voice criticisms on sensitive issues like welfare, Gaza, and a wealth tax. Thornberry, who was not offered a cabinet post, has pointedly stated she will not simply "nod along" with the government's agenda. This internal debate provides a public forum for dissent within the ruling party, potentially complicating the government's messaging and policy rollout in the critical months before the November budget.</p>

          <p>Cracker Barrel has announced it is suspending its restaurant remodeling plans, just weeks after reversing a controversial logo change that sparked a significant backlash from customers. The company's attempt to modernize its brand with a minimalist logo and more contemporary interiors was met with accusations of going "woke" and led to a drop in its stock price. In a statement, the chain acknowledged customer feedback, confirming that the "vintage Americana" aesthetic, including its rocking chairs and fireplaces, is here to stay. The company affirmed its commitment to listening to its patrons and maintaining its traditional country-store identity.</p>

          <p>Police in Washington state arrested a 13-year-old boy who allegedly had everything prepared to commit a mass shooting, averting a potential tragedy. Authorities were alerted to threatening online posts and, upon searching the boy's home, discovered 23 firearms, ammunition, and writings indicating an obsession with past school shooters. Many of the guns lacked serial numbers, and some appeared to be homemade with a 3D printer. The boy, who has not been enrolled in school since 2021, has pleaded not guilty to multiple charges. The case highlights the persistent threat of school violence and raises questions about firearm storage laws.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role as Tuco Salamanca in "Breaking Bad," was briefly detained by Los Angeles police following a dispute with three women over a parking spot. Cruz was washing his car when the women parked extremely close to him; he asked them to move to avoid getting their car wet. According to his agent, the women refused and began recording him, at which point Cruz turned with the hose, inadvertently splashing them while telling them to stop. The women reported an assault, leading to his five-hour detention, but his agent expects the case to be dropped as a misunderstanding.</p>
