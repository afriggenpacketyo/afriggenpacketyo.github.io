          <p>The race for the deputy leadership of the UK's Labour Party is now a two-person contest between Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson and former Commons leader Lucy Powell. The only other candidate, Bell Riberio-Addy, failed to secure the necessary nominations from fellow Members of Parliament to advance. The election was triggered by the resignation of Angela Rayner and represents a potentially influential position within the party, as the winner has their own mandate from the membership and cannot be dismissed by the party leader. The outcome will be announced in late October following a ballot of party members.</p>

          <p>Shares of Warner Bros. Discovery saw a significant increase of over 30% following a report that Paramount Skydance is preparing an all-cash takeover offer for the media giant. While no formal bid has been received, the news has generated considerable market excitement amid a period of transformation in the media industry. This potential consolidation follows Warner Bros. Discovery's own plans to separate its TV networks from its streaming and studio businesses. The move signals aggressive expansion by Paramount Skydance since its recent merger, led by David Ellison.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With inflation remaining a concern for consumers, seniors living on fixed incomes are facing significant challenges to their purchasing power. Financial experts suggest that while traditional fixed annuities provide a steady income, their value can be eroded over time by rising costs. The article explores alternatives such as variable and indexed annuities, which are tied to market performance and can potentially act as a hedge against inflation, though they carry greater risk. Another option discussed is adding an inflation protection rider to an annuity contract, which increases payments annually to keep pace with rising costs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Waymond Jordan, currently the star running back for the USC Trojans, has had a challenging journey to the top tier of college football. After receiving no scholarship offers out of high school, he spent several years at a junior college in Kansas, overcoming injuries and self-doubt. Jordan's perseverance and a crucial decision to stay an extra year in junior college paid off, as his explosive performance eventually attracted attention from major programs. His story is one of resilience and self-belief, culminating in his emergence as a key player for one of the nation's top rushing offenses.</p>

          <p>The Federal Trade Commission has launched an inquiry into seven major technology companies, including Alphabet, Meta, OpenAI, and xAI, over the potential negative effects of their AI chatbots on children and teenagers. The agency is seeking information on how these companies evaluate the safety of chatbots that can simulate human-like relationships and what measures are in place to protect young users. This probe follows growing concerns about the ethical and privacy implications of AI companions, particularly after reports of chatbots engaging in inappropriate conversations with minors, which prompted some companies to update their policies.</p>

          <h2>Elon Musk's Wealth Increasingly Tied to Private Ventures like SpaceX and xAI</h2>

          <p>A majority of Elon Musk's vast fortune now stems from his private companies, SpaceX and xAI, rather than his publicly traded electric vehicle company, Tesla. According to a recent Tesla proxy filing, this shift in wealth concentration is the justification for a proposed new pay package aimed at keeping Musk's focus on Tesla. With SpaceX's valuation potentially reaching $400 billion and xAI's at $200 billion, Musk's stakes in these private ventures are now worth nearly twice his Tesla shares. This highlights the surging value of his private enterprises and the competing demands on his time. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A significant drop in mortgage rates has spurred a surge in demand from homebuyers and those looking to refinance. The average interest rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to 6.35%, its lowest level since last October and the largest single-week decline in the past year. In response, mortgage purchase applications rose to their highest level since July, while refinancing applications also saw a substantial increase. The drop in rates is linked to recent economic data suggesting a weakening labor market, which has caused the Treasury yields that influence mortgage rates to move lower. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal judge has extended an order barring federal agents from indiscriminately using 'less-lethal' weapons like rubber bullets and tear gas against journalists and peaceful protesters in Los Angeles. U.S. District Judge Hernán D. Vera rejected arguments that it is difficult to distinguish journalists from others during chaotic demonstrations, stating that federal agents had "unleashed crowd control weapons indiscriminately and with surprising savagery." The ruling is a significant victory for press rights organizations and civil liberties groups who argued that the agents' actions were unconstitutional and had a chilling effect on First Amendment rights.</p>

In the overall race standings, leader Jonas Vingegaard saw his advantage slightly reduced by second-place rider Joao Almeida, who now sits 40 seconds behind. The shortened stage and heightened security presence added an unusual element of tension to the day's racing, with the general classification battle set to intensify in the final mountain stage.</p>

          <p>American golfer Patrick Reed has stated that paying players to participate in the Ryder Cup is "unnecessary," comparing the event to the Olympics where athletes compete for national pride rather than money. His comments come as U.S. players are set to receive a $200,000 stipend for the upcoming competition, a practice European players have traditionally opposed. Reed, a former Ryder Cup star known as "Captain America," believes that any money involved should be directed entirely to charity. He also commented that the European team often has an edge due to a stronger sense of camaraderie and brotherhood.</p>

          <p>Based on recent inflation data, Social Security beneficiaries could see a 2.7% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) in 2026, a slight increase from the 2.5% boost received in 2025. According to an estimate from the Senior Citizens League, this would raise the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $54. The official COLA is calculated by the Social Security Administration using third-quarter inflation data and will be announced in October. While the adjustment is intended to help benefits keep pace with rising costs, some advocates worry it may be insufficient to cover increased expenses like Medicare premiums.
