It has a silver-white-gray finish and is very dense, with a small cube weighing approximately 20 kilograms. Uranium can be enriched for use in nuclear power plants and weapons, or depleted for radiation shielding and armor-piercing projectiles. Exposure to high concentrations of uranium can cause cancer and organ damage, while most of the world's uranium production comes from Kazakhstan, Canada, and Australia.</p>

          <p>After studying over 200 parent-child relationships, it has been discovered that parents who have an easy time getting their children to listen tend to avoid threats, bribes, and harsh consequences. Instead, they use language that encourages cooperation by respecting a child's autonomy while maintaining boundaries. Phrases like "Because I said so" and "If you don't listen, you'll lose [X privilege]" can trigger a child's defense mode. Shifting to language that validates emotions and invites problem-solving can create a more cooperative environment and strengthen the parent-child bond.</p>

          <p>The new live-action version of "How to Train Your Dragon" remained the top-grossing film at the North American box office, earning $37 million in its second weekend. Pixar's "Elio" had a difficult opening weekend, earning only $21 million, marking the worst premiere in Pixar's history. "28 Years Later" marked the return of another franchise, adding $30 million in 59 foreign markets. Next weekend is expected to be competitive with new releases including "F1" and "Megan 2.0".</p>
