          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-10 03:01:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The upcoming "Superman" film, directed by James Gunn, is sparking debate by portraying the hero as a symbol of universal kindness rather than strictly American ideals, a move some conservative commentators have labeled as "woke." The article explores the historical context of Superman's creation by Jewish immigrants as a defender of the weak and his identity as an "undocumented alien." It contrasts the perceived political leanings of DC and Marvel cinematic universes and notes how the character has previously been used to comment on contemporary immigration policies.</p>

          <p>A former official from China's central bank has argued that the yuan possesses the fundamental characteristics to become a safe-haven currency, similar to the U.S. dollar or Japanese yen. The argument is based on China's institutional credibility, low inflation, large foreign reserves, and the currency's recent stability during periods of global stress. To achieve this status, the official called for greater flexibility in capital controls and increased foreign participation in China's financial markets. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Vienna is frequently cited as a "renters' utopia" due to its robust social housing system, which comprises about 43% of the city's housing stock and serves a wide range of income levels. This large-scale public and limited-profit housing keeps rental prices significantly lower than in the private market and helps to moderate private rents as well. While the system's stability and quality are lauded, challenges remain, particularly regarding the complexity of the allocation process, which can be difficult for newcomers to navigate.</p>

          <p>During its annual Han Kuang military drills, Taiwan showcased the firepower of its newly acquired M1A2T Abrams tanks from the United States. President Lai Ching-te observed the exercises, stating the advanced tanks enhance the nation's security and defensive capabilities against a potential conflict with China. Analysts note that while the tanks are powerful, Taiwan will need to integrate counter-drone technologies to protect them, drawing lessons from their vulnerability in the Ukraine war.</p>

          <p>A North Korean defector, Choi Min-kyung, is filing a lawsuit against North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and other officials for sexual abuse and torture she endured after being forcibly repatriated to the country in 2008. The case is the first of its kind brought by a North Korean-born defector and seeks to hold the regime accountable for crimes against humanity. While any ruling would be largely symbolic, human rights groups assisting her believe it is a crucial step for acknowledging the suffering of victims and officially recording their stories.</p>

          <p>The Chinese government is implementing new measures to combat youth unemployment amid a sluggish economy and intense market competition. Authorities will offer a one-time subsidy of up to 1,500 yuan for each unemployed person aged 16 to 24 hired by companies that provide formal contracts and social insurance contributions. This initiative, funded by unemployment insurance reserves, is part of a broader effort to stabilize the labor market and includes an expansion of the "work-for-relief" public works program.
