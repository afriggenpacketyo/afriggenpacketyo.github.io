The layoffs are expected to impact all levels and geographies and are intended to reduce management layers. The company, which had 228,000 employees globally as of June 2024, previously cut 11,000 workers in 2023. The announcement comes despite Microsoft's strong sales and profits, with a recent quarterly earnings report showing a 13% increase from the same period last year.</p>
