          <p>Scientists have helped Yosemite's native Northwestern pond turtles recover by removing invasive American bullfrogs from their habitats. The bullfrogs, which prey on turtle hatchlings and other wildlife, had caused a decline in the turtle population. After a near-complete eradication of bullfrogs from certain areas, the researchers observed a resurgence of the turtle population and other native species. The study offers a potential tool for reversing the decline of certain species and restoring freshwater ecosystems, under certain circumstances.</p>

          <p>George Takei's new graphic memoir, "It Rhymes With Takei," explores his experiences growing up gay during a less accepting time. Takei draws parallels between his past persecution and the current administration's treatment of immigrants. While acknowledging the backsliding of LGBTQ+ rights, Takei remains optimistic about the future and believes democracy will recover once the current administration leaves office. Takei uses the term 'Klingon president' to describe the current administration and his vision for the future.</p>
