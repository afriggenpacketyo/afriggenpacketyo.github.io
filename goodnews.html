          <p>A brutal heat wave is expected to impact the eastern United States, bringing several days of record-high temperatures starting this weekend and continuing into next week. The National Weather Service has termed it "the first significant heat wave this season," with major to extreme heat risk spreading into the Midwest and East Coast. Potential daily record highs are also forecast for parts of the Rockies and Plains, with temperatures well into the 90s reaching the mid-Atlantic and Northeast. The heat is expected to shift into the Midwest and Ohio Valley by the end of the weekend, arriving in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic on Sunday and lasting through the first half of next week. Officials are warning residents to stay indoors with air conditioning and to avoid strenuous outdoor activities. </p>

          <p>Former Indiana Pacers star Jalen Rose made a bold prediction that the Indiana Pacers will win Game 7 against the Oklahoma City Thunder. Rose praised Tyrese Haliburton and expressed his wish for Haliburton to be healthy for the game, claiming that Indiana is going to win if he is ready to go. The Pacers won Game 1 because of Haliburton, and even took a 2-1 series lead after winning the third game of the series. A win for the Pacers on Sunday would give them their first NBA championship since winning three ABA titles in the early 1970s.</p>

          <p>Activist investor Barington Capital is urging Victoria's Secret to revamp its board, reassess its CEO, and refocus on its core brand to enhance shareholder value. Barington, which holds over 1% of Victoria's Secret shares, has a history of successful engagement with L Brands, Victoria Secret's former parent company. The firm has identified declining revenue, shrinking gross margins, and high management turnover as key issues contributing to the company's underperformance. Barington suggests replacing the majority of the board with experienced directors, evaluating the CEO's strategic clarity, and streamlining the operating model to eliminate underperforming initiatives.

          <p>Air conditioning is not merely a luxury, but a necessity that saves lives, maintains productivity, and improves sleep quality. It is essential for mitigating the dangers of extreme heat, which kills more Americans annually than any other form of extreme weather. Air conditioning also supports economic activity by preventing productivity declines in schools and businesses during hot weather. Furthermore, cooling is crucial for a decent night‚Äôs sleep, as humans fall asleep fastest in cooler temperatures, and it has enabled the development of industries like film and microchip production. Air conditioning allows millions to live and travel in otherwise uninhabitable regions.</p>

          <p>Sue Baker, a 58-year-old woman with a history of heart troubles, received a first-of-its-kind heart-liver transplant after her heart started to fail. She had previously received a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) but needed a new heart and faced a high risk of organ rejection due to excessive antibodies. Doctors at the Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Florida, proposed a combined heart-liver transplant to solve the antibody problem, a procedure never before performed on someone with an LVAD. Although Baker recovered from the surgery, she faced tragedy when her husband died shortly after, leaving her with medical bills and unstable housing.</p>

          <p>China has successfully tested a domestically developed operating system in space, marking a significant step toward reducing reliance on foreign software. The OpenHarmony real-time operating system (RTOS), a lightweight version of Huawei‚Äôs open-source platform, was evaluated on the Dalian-1 Lianli CubeSat. The mission demonstrated faster data updates and improved stability compared to earlier setups, achieving a fully home-grown hardware-software solution. Following the mission, national technical standards have been proposed to guide the broader adoption of OpenHarmony in small satellites, with commercial and research satellite missions already underway.</p>

Litt's book, "It's Only Drowning," centers on their relationship and the challenges of connecting across political and cultural divides. The article reflects on America's deep divisions and how shared activities can provide neutral ground for understanding. Litt suggests that Democrats need to find ways to connect with working-class voters and understand their issues, and that the party needs to find common ground, and not to force it.</p>

          <p>Mark Cuban believes that separating formularies from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and forcing Medicare Advantage and Part D plans to buy from any provider offering a lower price than what patients currently pay out of pocket could dramatically improve the U.S. healthcare system. Cuban also proposed requiring providers to honor publicly listed cash prices, banning specialty drug pricing tiers and making provider CEOs personally liable in cases of billing fraud. Cuban‚Äôs Cost Plus Drug Company, launched in 2022, has quickly grown by offering transparent pricing and cutting out middlemen to lower prescription drug costs. (not investment advice)</p>
