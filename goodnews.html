          <p>Amazon is launching a new generative AI initiative, internally named "Starfish," to create the world's most comprehensive source of product information. The project aims to automate the creation of product listings by gathering data from across the web, using AI to generate accurate titles, descriptions, and images. This initiative is designed to improve the shopping experience, save sellers time, and is projected to significantly boost sales. The system is already supporting Amazon's "Buy for Me" feature, which recommends and facilitates purchases from external websites.</p>

          <p>Following a viral incident at a previous show, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin humorously warned concertgoers in Wisconsin that they might appear on the venue's large screens. This comes after Astronomer CEO Andy Byron resigned when a video showed him and a female colleague in an intimate moment during the "Jumbotron Song" segment of a concert. The original incident sparked widespread online discussion and memes, leading to significant professional consequences for the individuals involved. Coldplay has not directly addressed the fallout but has adjusted its on-stage banter.</p>

          <p>The UK's environment secretary, Steve Reed, has pledged to halve the number of sewage discharges by water companies by the year 2030, setting a clear target in response to public anger over water pollution.

Reed stated that the water sector is "broken" and that its regulator, Ofwat, is "clearly failing." The government plans a record £104 billion investment in the sector, which will be funded in part by increased consumer water bills.</p>
