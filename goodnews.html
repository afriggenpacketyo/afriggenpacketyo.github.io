          <p>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's meeting with Donald Trump was marked by a tense but controlled atmosphere, a notable change from their contentious previous encounter. Joined by European leaders, Zelenskyy navigated Trump's boasts about his peacemaking abilities and digressions on U.S. domestic politics. The European presence appeared to serve as a moderating influence, steering the conversation toward substantive issues like security guarantees, even as leaders publicly pushed back on Trump's dismissal of a ceasefire.</p>

          <h2>Retail Inventory Method Accounting May Obscure True Impact of Tariffs on Profitability</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-18 15:38:31 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A specific accounting practice known as the retail inventory method (RIM), used by major retailers like Walmart and Target, could temporarily distort their reported profitability as new tariffs take effect. Because RIM uses an average cost-to-retail ratio rather than actual item costs, it is slow to reflect sudden cost increases, which can make gross margins appear stronger than they truly are in the short term. This accounting nuance could complicate the financial picture for nearly a quarter of U.S. retailers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The new musical "& Juliet" offers a vibrant and empowering alternative to Shakespeare's tragic ending, imagining a new life for Juliet set to the chart-topping hits of Swedish producer Max Martin. The review praises the production for its witty book by David West Read, energetic choreography, and powerful vocal performances, particularly from lead Rachel Webb. Described as a euphoric dance party, the show successfully blends a 21st-century feminist perspective with a catalog of beloved pop anthems.</p>

          <h2>Exploring Age Considerations for Purchasing Annuities in Retirement Planning</h2>

          <p>While there are no federal laws setting an age limit for purchasing annuities, individual insurance companies often impose their own caps, typically between 80 and 85 years old. The timing of an annuity purchase significantly affects its terms and payout rates, as these are calculated based on life expectancy. Financial advisors often suggest considering annuities in one's late 50s or 60s to balance growth potential with favorable rates, though buying later can result in higher monthly payments.
