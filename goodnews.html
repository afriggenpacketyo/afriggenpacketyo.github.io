          <p>Nippon Steel Corp. has finalized a deal to make United States Steel Corp. its wholly owned unit after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed his initial opposition.

          <p>Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball's husband, played a pivotal role in shaping the television industry. He made the decision to film "I Love Lucy" on 35mm black-and-white film, enabling preservation, reruns, and syndication, revolutionizing television economics. Arnaz also insisted on shooting the show in Los Angeles and owning the rights, leading to the creation of Desilu Studios, which became a major television production company. Despite facing personal challenges, including alcoholism and the end of his marriage to Ball, Arnaz's contributions to television remain significant.</p>

Arnaz, known as Ricky Ricardo, played a crucial role in transforming television production methods and business models. He assembled a team of Hollywood technicians to film "I Love Lucy" in front of a live audience with three cameras, a groundbreaking method at the time. His ability to preserve episodes on film led to the invention of reruns and syndication, shifting network television production from New York to Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits decreased to 245,000 last week, remaining near historically low levels, according to the Labor Department. While jobless claims have mostly stayed within a healthy range, recent weeks have seen them at the higher end, suggesting a potential deceleration in the U.S. job market. Economists are concerned about the impact of President Trump's trade policies on the economy, which may be contributing to business uncertainty.

Both the House and Senate versions of the bill aim to prevent tax increases for the majority of Americans.

          <p>A new UCLA study finds that streaming films are more diverse than theatrical releases, with a higher proportion of women and people of color in key entertainment jobs. The study found that a majority of the top 20 streaming-only films released in 2024 featured diverse casts, with actors of color playing one out of two lead roles. The report also notes that while actors with known disabilities gained ground in 2024, they remain underrepresented on screen. The study highlights the importance of diverse storytellers and actors in driving viewership.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>British lawmakers voted to decriminalize abortion in England and Wales, approving an amendment to a crime bill that would prevent women from being criminally punished for ending a pregnancy. The change was prompted by concerns about police investigations into women for suspected illegal abortions, including some who suffered miscarriages. The amendment passed 379-137 and will now go to the House of Lords. Anti-abortion groups opposed the measures, arguing it would open the door to abortion on demand at any stage of pregnancy.</p>
