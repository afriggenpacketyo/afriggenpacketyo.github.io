          <p>Tropical Storm Chantal has been downgraded to a tropical depression after making landfall in South Carolina. The storm's maximum sustained winds have decreased to 35 mph, leading to the discontinuation of all tropical storm warnings. While the immediate threat has lessened, scattered showers, heavy rain, and potential flash flooding remain a concern for inland areas of North and South Carolina. Flood watches are still in effect for several regions, and the system is expected to fully dissipate by Monday, marking the end of the third named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season.</p>

          <p>In a recent interview, National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett defended the administration's major policy bill, asserting it will generate 3% economic growth and reduce the deficit, contrary to estimates from the CBO and other organizations. He dismissed critical analyses, citing the past accuracy of White House models and arguing that not passing the bill would trigger a recession. Hassett also addressed upcoming trade deal deadlines, suggesting several agreements will be finalized this week while others may be extended. He also downplayed concerns about potential Medicaid coverage losses, stating the bill's job creation would increase insurance access. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>McLaren's Lando Norris won his first British Grand Prix in a chaotic, rain-affected race at Silverstone. He benefited from a 10-second penalty given to his teammate Oscar Piastri, who was deemed to have driven erratically during a safety car restart. Piastri had led for much of the race but was passed by Norris after serving his penalty during a late pit stop. In a surprising result, Nico Hulkenberg of Sauber secured his first-ever podium finish in his 239th race, holding off Ferrari's Lewis Hamilton to finish third in front of a record crowd.</p>

          <p>Fifty years after its release, the cast and crew of "Jaws" reflect on the film's notoriously difficult production and its transformation into a cultural phenomenon. Actor Richard Dreyfuss recalls initially turning down the role, fearing a troubled shoot, and describes the on-set friction with co-star Robert Shaw. The film, directed by a young Steven Spielberg, faced major setbacks, including a malfunctioning mechanical shark and a budget that more than doubled. Despite these challenges, its innovative release strategy and terrifying suspense ushered in the era of the summer blockbuster, forever changing Hollywood and audience perceptions of the ocean.</p>

          <p>An ESPN analyst is facing continued backlash for her controversial take that the Indiana Fever are 'more dangerous' without star rookie Caitlin Clark. The criticism intensified after the Fever lost a close game to the Los Angeles Sparks while Clark was sidelined with a groin injury. Critics on social media pointed to the loss against a struggling Sparks team as evidence that the take was misguided. With Clark absent, the Fever's record is now 2-3, and the team missed several crucial shots in the final minute of the game, highlighting her importance to the team's performance.</p>

The partnership will focus on improving farming in semi-arid regions, a significant biome in both nations. A key project will be an AI laboratory to support family farming, established through a collaboration between Brazil's National Semi-arid Institute and the China Agricultural University. This initiative aims to connect AI technologies with common farm machinery to enhance environmental monitoring and soil quality, reflecting what leaders called an "excellent moment in bilateral relations."</p>

          <p>A significant failure of Wimbledon's new electronic line-calling system caused controversy during a fourth-round match between Sonay Kartal and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. The system failed to make an audio call on a crucial point when a Kartal shot went visibly long, forcing the umpire to replay the point instead of awarding it to Pavlyuchenkova. The Russian player expressed frustration, claiming the game was 'stolen' from her, although she ultimately went on to win the match. This incident on Centre Court has intensified scrutiny of the automated technology, which has already faced criticism from several players for perceived inaccuracies.</p>

          <p>Elon Musk has announced on social media that he is forming a new political party called the 'America Party,' aiming to represent the '80% in the middle' and give freedom back to citizens. This move follows a public feud with President Donald Trump over a major spending bill, which Musk has criticized as 'debt slavery.' The announcement drew interest from fellow billionaire Mark Cuban and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci. Musk has suggested the party could gain influence by winning a small number of key seats in Congress, potentially acting as a deciding vote on contentious legislation.</p>

          <p>A significant archaeological discovery has been made in Peru with the unearthing of a 3,500-year-old city named Peñico. Researchers believe the city served as a vital trading hub, connecting ancient communities from the Pacific coast, the Andes, and the Amazon basin. The finding is important for understanding the fate of the Caral, the Americas' oldest known civilization, which was decimated by climate change. Excavations at the site, which began eight years ago, have revealed 18 structures, including temples and residential complexes, along with ceremonial objects and sculptures, shedding new light on this period of ancient history.</p>

          <p>The Statue of Liberty, originally conceived as a tribute to the end of slavery in the United States, has transformed over time into a powerful symbol of immigration. Initially, the statue had no connection to immigration, but poet Emma Lazarus's sonnet 'The New Colossus' reimagined it as a 'mother of exiles.' The opening of the nearby Ellis Island immigration facility in 1892 solidified this new meaning. The article traces how historical events, including restrictive 1920s immigration quotas and their eventual repeal in 1965, have shaped both the country's demographics and the enduring promise embodied by the iconic statue.</p>

While national-level political rhetoric has created concern among potential investors, officials in Midwestern states like Illinois and Wisconsin are reportedly very receptive.

Phrases like 'Why don't you just…' and 'That doesn't make sense' can come across as dismissive or condescending, while prefaces like 'Actually…' and 'To be honest…' can sound corrective or imply prior dishonesty. The article suggests alternative phrasing that promotes curiosity and collaboration, such as asking 'What have you tried so far?' or using 'yes, and...' to build on ideas rather than tear them down, fostering more positive and effective communication.</p>
