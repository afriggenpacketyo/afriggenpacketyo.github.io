        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to purchase 12 new F-35A fighter jets capable of carrying nuclear weapons, joining NATO's airborne nuclear mission in what Downing Street calls "the biggest strengthening of the UK's nuclear posture in a generation." These dual-capability jets can also carry conventional weapons, offering flexibility in defense strategies. While the US would control the release and use of nuclear weapons, the UK will retain the right to participate or not, based on governance arrangements. This decision follows a Strategic Defence Review, which highlighted increasing nuclear risks from other states. The move is seen as a victory for the RAF, supporting 20,000 jobs across the UK supply chain.</p>

          <p>Louisiana is investing heavily to attract Meta's massive $10 billion data center, offering a 20-year sales tax exemption and providing a vast 2,250-acre site. The data center, which will be the largest in the Western Hemisphere, is expected to transform Louisiana's economy, creating 500 permanent jobs and 5,000 construction jobs. The state had previously purchased the land in hopes of attracting an automotive plant, and Entergy, a local utility, is planning to build three gas-fired power plants to meet the data center's energy demands. While the project promises economic growth, it also raises concerns about energy consumption and the long-term benefits for the state.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Mortgage rates and demand are stuck in a holding pattern due to economic uncertainty and military conflicts, with little movement despite significant global events. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages increased slightly to 6.88%, but has remained in a narrow range around 7% since early April. Applications for a mortgage to buy a home dropped 0.4% last week, remaining historically low despite being 11% higher than the same week last year. This lack of incentive for homebuyers is compounded by inflated house prices and low supply, with the average loan size for purchase applications declining to $436,300, the lowest level since January 2025.</p>

          <p>Caitlin Clark struggled with her shooting, scoring only six points as the Indiana Fever relied on Aliyah Boston's career-high 31 points to secure a 94-86 victory over the Seattle Storm. Clark went 3-of-13 from the floor and 0-of-6 from beyond the arc, continuing a recent slump where she's made only 1 of 23 three-point attempts since a loss to the Golden State Valkyries. Despite Clark's struggles, teammates expressed confidence in her abilities, emphasizing that every great player experiences such phases. Boston's performance, along with Kelsey Mitchell's 26 points, helped the Fever improve to a 7-7 record, halting the Storm's three-game winning streak.</p>

More than two-thirds of Coach's new customers in North America are Gen Zers and millennials, with CEO Todd Kahn focusing on what he calls the "timeless Gen Z client." The company's parent, Tapestry, reported a 15% revenue growth for Coach, with hit handbags like the Brooklyn, Tabby, and Rogue driving demand.

          <p>Wraps, once a popular food trend in the 1990s, are experiencing a resurgence in popularity, driven by renewed interest in low-calorie and high-protein options. McDonald's is bringing back its chicken Snack Wrap after a Change.org petition, and Popeyes has introduced new chicken wraps. This revival coincides with a shift back towards thinness and dieting, with low-carb and high-protein diets gaining traction, and the use of weight-loss drugs on the rise. Once seen as a sensible and tidy alternative to traditional sandwiches, wraps are now being embraced by fitness enthusiasts and those seeking functional, low-calorie meal options.</p>
