          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has returned almost all of the 381 books initially removed from its libraries after a new review using standardized Pentagon search terms for DEI titles. This reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms for diversity, race, and gender issues in military educational institutions' libraries. The Navy's initial search identified 381 titles, but the new DOD search terms found only a few requiring removal pending further review. Nearly all books are back in circulation after being deemed compatible with the military's core mission.</p>

          <p>This article examines whether payday loans can be included in debt consolidation, noting their high fees and interest rates that often lead to a cycle of debt. While payday loans can generally be included in debt consolidation through personal loans, it depends on the type of consolidation and the lender's policies. Some debt relief companies offer payday loan-specific consolidation programs, negotiating with lenders to reduce balances or create new payment plans. Before consolidating, borrowers should consider fees, credit impact, and financial habits to ensure long-term stability. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the second consecutive year, the area around the Santa Monica Pier has been listed as one of California‚Äôs 10 dirtiest beaches by Heal the Bay. The pier area ranked second due to persistent water quality issues, including high levels of fecal bacteria. Despite upgrades like storm water capture systems and bird deterrent netting, pollution remains a problem due to urban runoff and activities like the disposal of fish guts, which attract seabirds. Heal the Bay recommends staying at least 100 yards away from storm drains and river outlets and waiting 72 hours after rain before entering the ocean.</p>

          <p>Congressional Democrats have introduced a bill to shift control of the U.S. Marshals Service from the executive branch to the federal judiciary. The goal is to protect judges from political interference and ensure their security, amid concerns that the White House or Justice Department could compromise judicial independence. The legislation would create a special board including the Chief Justice of the United States and the Judicial Conference. The bill's prospects in the Republican-controlled Congress are uncertain.</p>
