The weather agency cautioned about potential transport disruptions, power outages, and damage to buildings, although not all areas will experience the storms. While the storms are expected to ease off in the west by mid-afternoon, other parts of the UK may also experience showers and isolated thunderstorms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Instead of immediately opting for cushioned footwear, start with foot exercises to alleviate sore and achy feet, according to experts. Regular foot and ankle exercises can reduce injury risk, alleviate pain, and improve foot health. Exercises include foot doming to strengthen the foot core, wall stretches for pain relief, toe spreads for flexibility, toe yoga for balance, calf raises for stability, and foot massages for tension release. It is important to consult with a healthcare provider if you experience pain or have preexisting foot conditions.</p>
