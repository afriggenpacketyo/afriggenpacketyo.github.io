          <p>Teachers across the United States are finding new ways to educate a generation of students who have no personal memory of the September 11, 2001 attacks. Educators are participating in programs, such as those hosted by the 9/11 Memorial & Museum in New York, to connect with first-hand accounts from survivors and first responders. The goal is to convey the historical significance, the human trauma, and the sense of national unity that followed the event. By incorporating these lessons into their curriculum, teachers aim to ensure that the profound impact of 9/11 on American society and global affairs is understood by today's youth.</p>

          <p>Dr. Xand van Tulleken offers five practical, science-backed strategies to help manage stress and maintain balance. He advises individuals to stop worrying about being stressed, as this anxiety can worsen the physical effects. Regular physical exercise is highlighted as a key tool, as it trains the body to handle the physiological responses to stress, such as increased heart rate and cortisol levels. Other essential tips include prioritizing a consistent sleep schedule, focusing on self-care through good nutrition and personal time, and practicing mindfulness by planning ahead to mitigate potential daily challenges.</p>

          <p>Markets in the Asia-Pacific region opened with mixed results, following a positive session on Wall Street where major indexes reached new records. The gains in the U.S. were driven by investor optimism after new data from the producer price index indicated that inflation was cooling, raising hopes for a Federal Reserve rate cut. While Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi saw advances, Australia's ASX 200 declined and Hong Kong's Hang Seng was poised for a lower open. Investors are now awaiting a key U.S. consumer inflation report for further signals on the direction of the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is pursuing a more targeted and practical approach to artificial intelligence, contrasting with the massive, broad-based investments seen in the United States. Instead of chasing human-level general AI, Beijing is focusing its resources, including a new $8.42 billion national AI fund, on integrating usable AI into key sectors like industry and energy under its "AI+" initiative. This strategy leverages China's existing infrastructure and talent pool to achieve specific economic and societal goals, even while facing U.S. restrictions on advanced chips. Analysts note this resourceful approach has allowed Chinese companies to produce competitive and often cheaper AI models.</p>

          <p>China's domestically produced C919 passenger jet may be nearing a significant international breakthrough, as the CEO of Malaysian airline group Capital A confirmed active discussions to purchase the aircraft. Tony Fernandes, head of the company that owns AirAsia, stated they are the first foreign airline working with the state-owned manufacturer, COMAC, on a potential deal. The C919 is designed to compete with the Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 and is a key part of China's ambition to become a major player in the global aviation market. Growing interest reflects expanding economic ties between China and Southeast Asian nations.</p>

          <p>Following a strong debut on Wall Street, financial technology company Klarna is still considered a worthwhile investment at its current valuation, according to CNBC's Jim Cramer. The Swedish "buy now, pay later" provider saw its shares climb 14.5% on its first day of trading after pricing its IPO above the expected range. Cramer noted the company's solid growth, improving fundamentals, and strong underwriting standards as positive indicators. While Klarna is not yet profitable, its shrinking losses and the success of competitors like Affirm suggest potential for future growth in the booming IPO market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>State lawmakers in California have introduced a bill to significantly reform Measure ULA, the controversial "mansion tax" in Los Angeles, in an effort to boost housing development. The proposal, negotiated with Mayor Karen Bass, would reduce the tax rate for sellers of newly constructed apartment buildings and commercial properties. Critics of the original measure argued that while it was intended to fund homelessness programs, it had a chilling effect on housing production. The legislative changes are also part of a larger strategy to prevent a statewide tax-cut initiative from appearing on the ballot, which would otherwise nullify Measure ULA entirely.</p>

          <p>Traditional "stand and stir" television cooking shows are experiencing a sharp decline in commissions, with new data showing a 44% drop in food program production across British TV this year. This article explores how the genre is being eclipsed by a boom in food content on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and TikTok. Online creators offer a more authentic, nimble, and direct connection with audiences, able to respond to trends like the "cronut" almost instantly. In contrast, the heavily regulated and slower-paced world of broadcast television is struggling to compete, signaling a major cultural shift in how audiences consume media.</p>

          <p>A top White House official is advocating for the United States to defend its lead in artificial intelligence by exporting "cohesive AI tech stacks" to allied nations. Michael Kratsios, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, warned a Senate subcommittee that the U.S. lead over China has narrowed significantly since 2020. The proposed strategy involves bundling not just advanced chips but also algorithms and applications to create a comprehensive American AI ecosystem abroad. This approach aims to prevent China from gaining global market share and to ensure U.S. technology sets the international standard in this critical field.</p>

          <p>A UK parliamentary committee is criticizing the government for its slow pace in reforming the Lifetime ISA (LISA) savings product, arguing that it is unsuitable for many individuals and may not be a good use of taxpayer money. LISAs, which offer a 25% government bonus on savings for a first home or retirement, are forecast to cost £3 billion over five years. The Treasury Committee raised concerns that the product's dual purpose can lead to poor investment choices and unfairly penalizes benefit claimants. MPs are urging ministers to implement more significant changes in the upcoming November Budget to address these flaws. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are investigating the "dark DNA" of Australia's vibrant peacock spiders to understand their extraordinary diversity, which includes over 100 different species. These non-coding sections of the genetic code, which are far more abundant in the spiders than in humans, may be the key to their rapid evolution and adaptation. By cataloging the unique colors, behaviors, and mating dances of each species and cross-referencing them with their genetic makeup, scientists hope to uncover the fundamental processes that drive variation in the natural world.

          <p>The U.S. House of Representatives has voted with bipartisan support to repeal the legal authorizations for the use of military force against Iraq from 1991 and 2003. The measure, supported by 212 Democrats and 49 Republicans, reflects a growing desire in Congress to reclaim its constitutional authority over matters of war and peace. Proponents argued that leaving the decades-old authorizations in place creates a risk of abuse by presidents seeking to justify new military actions without congressional approval. The amendment is attached to the annual defense bill and follows similar, previously stalled efforts to revoke what lawmakers called obsolete war powers.</p>

          <p>China has officially approved the import of sorghum from Brazil, a move that could see the first shipments arrive later this year and provide a new market for Brazilian farmers. The decision from China's General Administration of Customs follows a visit by a Chinese delegation to Brazil in August. This development offers China an alternative source for the grain at a time when its imports of U.S. sorghum have plummeted by 97% amid ongoing trade tensions. For Brazil, where sorghum production has doubled in recent years, gaining access to the vast Chinese market is seen as a major opportunity to boost its agricultural exports.</p>
