          <p>A small earthquake with a magnitude of 3.0 was reported in the New York City area on Saturday night, with its epicenter near Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey. While the quake was minor, it caused brief shaking that startled residents across the region, though no significant damage or injuries were reported. The event follows a larger, rare 4.8 magnitude earthquake that hit the same area in April 2024. The U.S. Geological Survey noted that while such events are infrequent on the East Coast, a quake of this magnitude is not expected to cause damage.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Florida has quietly become a leader in solar energy, surpassing California in new utility-scale solar capacity last year, primarily driven by large projects from utilities like Florida Power & Light. This growth is facilitated by state rules that streamline the approval process for solar projects under 75 megawatts. Despite this boom, the industry faces headwinds from the federal rollback of solar tax credits, which is expected to significantly reduce rooftop solar installations. The state's progress demonstrates how favorable economics can drive renewable energy adoption even without strong climate policy. (not investment advice)</p>

Authorities noted that such events can cause significant disruption and safety concerns, as well as harm the local environment and wildlife. While most attendees had left by Sunday afternoon, police continued to monitor the area and stated they will investigate any criminal offenses.</p>

          <p>Dr. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, announced that applications for a $50 billion rural hospital stabilization fund will be available in early September. This fund was established as part of President Trump's recent legislative package to support rural hospitals facing financial pressures from Medicaid cuts. Dr. Oz explained the funds are intended for workforce development, system right-sizing, and implementing technology like telehealth. The new law also introduces Medicaid work requirements, which the CBO estimates could cause 10 million people to lose coverage. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 3-0 on Sunday, manufacturing just enough offense to support a strong pitching performance. Yoshinobu Yamamoto delivered 5 ⅔ scoreless innings, and the bullpen completed the shutout to clinch the series win. The Dodgers' struggling lineup produced runs through aggressive baserunning, a double-steal, and a key sacrifice fly, rather than power hitting. The victory capped a winning 5-4 road trip for the team, providing a needed positive result despite ongoing concerns about their offensive slump.</p>

These candidates, many without prior political experience, are campaigning on their records as career prosecutors and are openly critical of the administration's changes, such as reductions in anti-corruption and civil rights divisions. They see state and local elected positions as a new way to uphold the rule of law, which they argue is under threat at the federal level.</p>

          <p>The UK's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is proposing a compensation scheme for victims of car finance mis-selling, with potential payouts estimated to be less than £950 per deal. The move follows a Supreme Court ruling that, while hidden commissions were not broadly unlawful, excessively large commissions could be deemed unfair. The FCA will consult on the details of the scheme, which could cost the industry between £9bn and £18bn and cover agreements dating back to 2007. The regulator is advising affected consumers to contact their lenders directly to make a claim. (not investment advice)</p>
