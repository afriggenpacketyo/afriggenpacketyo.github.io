          <p>Francesco Acerbi's journey to becoming a Champions League hero for Inter Milan is a story of resilience, sacrifice, and perseverance. Acerbi battled alcohol abuse and depression following his father's death, overcame testicular cancer twice, and climbed the footballing pyramid to achieve success at 37. His 93rd-minute equalizer against Barcelona in the semi-final sent the tie to extra time, ultimately leading Inter to victory. His teammates praise his never-give-up attitude and his ability to find strength in crucial moments, making him an inspiration both on and off the pitch.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government's stockpiled rice, released through direct contracts with retailers, has started appearing on store shelves, offering consumers a cheaper alternative. Major supermarket operator Ito-Yokado Co. and home appliance company Iris Ohyama Inc. are among the first to sell the rice at a price of 2,160 yen ($15) for a 5 kilogram-bag. The move aims to alleviate the soaring price of rice, which has been impacting households. Consumers have been eagerly purchasing the rice, with some stores selling out within minutes of opening, providing relief to families facing financial challenges.</p>
