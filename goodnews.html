          <p>A judge has issued a temporary restraining order against the Trump administration's plan to prevent Harvard University from enrolling foreign students, responding to Harvard's lawsuit which claimed the move was retaliatory and unlawful. Harvard argued that the revocation of its access to the Student and Exchange Visitor Program would erase a quarter of its student body and undermine its mission. The White House responded that Harvard should focus on creating a safe campus environment instead of filing lawsuits, referencing concerns about anti-American and anti-Semitic agitators. Harvard relies heavily on international student tuition, and the ruling pauses a move that could have forced thousands of students to return home.</p>

          <p>Wage garnishment by the IRS can be a stressful financial consequence for unpaid tax debt. Tax relief strategies, such as installment agreements, Offers in Compromise, Currently Not Collectible status, and innocent spouse relief, can potentially stop wage garnishment. Immediate action is crucial, including verifying the debt and contacting the IRS or a tax relief specialist to negotiate a resolution. The IRS typically wants to help taxpayers who are proactive and cooperative find a solution, especially those who show a genuine intent to pay. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The House Republican tax bill, dubbed the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act," does not include an extension of the premium tax credits under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which are set to expire at the end of the year. Without the extension, nearly all subsidized ACA enrollees can expect their monthly premiums to rise. For example, a family of four making $85,000 would have to pay an additional $313 in premiums for coverage in 2026. The absence of the credits is notable when the bill includes other proposed changes to the ACA marketplace.</p>

Democrats view the House as their best chance at quickly winning back power in Washington, given the perils an incumbent president's party routinely faces in a midterm election.

          <p>Pacific Coast Highway has reopened to traffic for the first time since the Palisades fire, offering greater access to Malibu and Pacific Palisades. The reopening of an 11-mile stretch of PCH will ease commutes for those traveling to Los Angeles from Ventura County and the west Valley. Authorities opened one lane of traffic in both directions, urging drivers to be cautious due to ongoing road work. The reopening marks an important step forward in recovery efforts in the Palisades.</p>

          <p>The Ditch Weekly, a newspaper written and edited by middle and high schoolers in Long Island, is covering the Hamptons from a new perspective. The paper focuses on local news and events relevant to teenagers, avoiding the typical coverage of celebrities and wealthy tourists. The staff of 20 teenagers aims to distribute 2,000 copies of the paper each week, funded by local advertisements. The teenagers are involved in all aspects of the paper's production, from writing and editing to sales and distribution.</p>

          <p>The Kurdish militant group known as the PKK announced it had ‚Äúfulfilled its historical mission‚Äù and was ending the armed struggle it has waged against the Turkish state since 1984. The PKK‚Äôs decision to disarm came two months after its imprisoned founder and leader, Abdullah √ñcalan, issued a statement suggesting that the war had become obsolete. The Turkish government now has an opportunity to consolidate the peace by offering some kind of amnesty to the PKK‚Äôs fighters and by addressing the grievances that sparked the war in the first place.</p>

          <p>Ukraine and Russia began the exchange of 1,000 prisoners of war, the largest such swap since the beginning of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wrote on social media, after the soldiers had crossed into Ukraine. He said 390 people were included in the first of a three-day exchange. This POW exchange was the only deal made in Istanbul last week during the two countries' first direct negotiations about a ceasefire since the early days of Russia's 2022 invasion.</p>

          <h2>Navy Reverses DEI Book Ban After Pentagon Review</h2>

          <p>The U.S. Naval Academy has returned almost all of the 381 books initially removed from its libraries after a new review using the Pentagon's standardized search terms for diversity, equity and inclusion titles. The new review found only about 20 books that need to be removed pending a future review by a Department of Defense panel. The reversal comes after a May 9 Pentagon memo set Wednesday as the date by which the military services were to submit and remove book titles that touch on diversity, race, and gender issues using the Pentagon's specific search terms.</p>
