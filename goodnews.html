The mission, designated Crew-11, includes astronauts who were rescheduled from a previous flight due to issues with Boeing's Starliner capsule. The crew consists of two NASA astronauts, a Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut flying as part of a seat-swap agreement. The flight will utilize a Crew Dragon capsule making a record sixth trip to space, with liftoff now targeted for the next available window.</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump has announced a 90-day extension of the existing tariff agreement with Mexico, postponing a threatened increase to allow more time for trade negotiations. The current duties, including a 25% tariff on many goods and higher rates on metals, will remain in place. Trump stated that the extension followed a productive call with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum and that Mexico agreed to terminate its non-tariff trade barriers. The goal is to negotiate a comprehensive new trade deal within the 90-day period, providing temporary stability for the two major trading partners.</p>

          <p>Roblox stock increased by 16% after the company reported second-quarter financial results that surpassed analyst expectations. The gaming platform announced net bookings of $1.44 billion, a 51% year-over-year increase, and reported that daily active users grew by 41% to 111.8 million. Despite the strong growth in revenue and engagement, the company still posted a net loss of $279.38 million. The positive results reflect strategic investments in infrastructure and the creator ecosystem, with the company raising its booking guidance for the upcoming quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

The play, created by UC Berkeley vocal instructor Dr. Candace Johnson, chronicles her personal journey with a late ADHD diagnosis, a condition often overlooked in Black women. Timed with Minority Mental Health Awareness Month, the show uses storytelling and music to challenge the stigma surrounding mental health in marginalized communities. Johnson hopes her story will empower other women of color to seek assessment and support, highlighting the potential for growth and success with proper help.</p>

The article notes that both tech giants are continuing to invest billions in AI, fueling market optimism. Looking ahead to Apple and Amazon's earnings, Cramer voiced caution about Apple due to tariff exposure and moderating services revenue. For Amazon, strong performance in its cloud and advertising businesses is anticipated, with e-commerce sales being the key variable factor. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Impostor syndrome, the feeling of being a fraud despite evidence of competence, is a common affliction among high achievers and can be exacerbated by curated social media personas. This article explores its psychological roots, noting its prevalence among perfectionists, introverts, and those in high-trust professions like medicine. While some argue it can motivate improvement, it more often leads to anxiety and burnout. To combat these feelings, the article suggests three strategies: practicing kinder self-talk, tracking personal progress to create an objective record of growth, and building a supportive community of peers to share insecurities.</p>

          <p>A meeting between LeBron James, his business partner Maverick Carter, and Nikola Jokic's prominent agent, Misko Raznatovic, has intensified speculation about a potential new international basketball league. Raznatovic posted a photo of the meeting on a yacht, hinting at "big plans for the fall of 2026." Reports suggest investors are trying to raise $5 billion for a tour-based league, styled after Formula 1, with teams playing in cities outside the U.S. The model may require players to cut ties with the NBA, similar to LIV Golf, posing a potential challenge to the existing global basketball structure.</p>

          <p>The College Sports Commission (CSC), the new agency overseeing name, image, and likeness (NIL) deals, has relaxed its standards for agreements between athletes and third-party collectives. The change came after plaintiff attorneys threatened further legal action over initial guidance that was seen as too restrictive. The new rules broaden the definition of a "valid business purpose" for a collective, focusing on whether it promotes goods or services for profit rather than on the entity's structure. This move provides more clarity and flexibility for NIL collectives, though the CSC will still vet deals for fair market value.</p>
