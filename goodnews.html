          <p>A new study reveals that tiny microchip implants, combined with special glasses, have helped some legally blind patients with geographic atrophy regain the ability to read. The photovoltaic retina implant microarray (PRIMA) involves inserting a hair-thin implant under the retina, with glasses projecting images via infrared light. In trials, 26 out of 32 patients showed meaningful visual acuity improvement, offering hope for the 5 million people worldwide affected by this leading cause of blindness. While promising, the device is not yet licensed, requires significant concentration to use, and the clinical study size is small.</p>

          <p>Atlanta police averted a potential mass shooting at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport after a Georgia man, Billy Joe Cagle, threatened to open fire. Cagle, experiencing a mental health crisis, drove to the airport with an AR-15 assault rifle and 27 rounds of ammunition in his truck. His family alerted Cartersville police, who promptly notified Atlanta authorities. Officers quickly located Cagle inside the terminal, believing he was scouting the area before retrieving his weapon. Mayor Andre Dickens praised the swift collaboration between community and law enforcement for preventing a tragedy.</p>

          <p>LeBron James is no longer facing a small claims lawsuit from a Lakers fan, Andrew Garcia, who sought $865.66 for tickets purchased under the false impression James was retiring. Garcia dropped the case after accepting an offer from PrizePicks fantasy sports app, which deposited the ticket amount in promo funds into his account and offered additional merchandise and game tickets. The lawsuit stemmed from James's social media tease about "The Second Decision," which led to a significant spike in Lakers ticket sales and prices, but ultimately had nothing to do with his NBA career.</p>

          <p>This article explores the history and evolving interpretation of the U.S. Constitution, emphasizing its design for amendment, as seen with the 13th and 19th Amendments. Historian Jill Lepore highlights that the founders expected constant revisions, with over 200 amendments proposed initially, leading to the Bill of Rights. Jeffrey Rosen of the National Constitution Center notes the founders' fear of lost deliberation and debate, and concerns that checks and balances are not currently functioning as intended, with courts becoming overly powerful. Despite challenges, the Constitution is presented as an eternal framework for freedom.</p>

          <p>U.S.-listed rare earth companies saw gains following a U.S.-Australia agreement to establish a critical mineral supply chain independent of China. Prime Minister Trump and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed a deal to invest in joint ventures, aiming to combat China's market dominance and export restrictions. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent indicated the Trump administration would set price floors for industries like rare earths. Investors anticipate further government backing for domestic miners, as the U.S. seeks to reduce its reliance on Beijing for these essential minerals used in technology and defense.

          <p>Cleveland-Cliffs shares surged over 20% after CEO Lourenco Goncalves announced the steelmaker is exploring rare earths mining. Geological surveys at two Michigan and Minnesota sites show potential for commercially viable deposits, aligning with the Trump administration's strategy for critical mineral independence. China's dominance in the global rare earths supply chain and recent export controls have spurred U.S. efforts to develop domestic sources, with the Defense Department already striking a deal with MP Materials. Cleveland-Cliffs aims to be part of the solution, reducing American manufacturing's reliance on foreign nations for essential minerals. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Police announced it will no longer investigate non-crime hate incidents, allowing officers to focus solely on criminal investigations.

The Met Commissioner emphasized that officers should not police "toxic culture war debates," and the new direction aims to reduce ambiguity and provide clearer guidance. Non-crime hate incidents, previously recorded to track potential escalation, do not meet the threshold for criminal offenses.</p>

          <p>This article introduces "Reparteras," women making inroads in Cuba's urban music scene, reparto, a fusion of reggaetón, timba, and Afro-Cuban rhythms. While the genre often objectifies women and reflects machismo, artists like Seidy La Niña, Melanie Santiler, and Ozunaje are challenging norms and carving out space. They face resistance, double standards, and pressure to conform to beauty ideals, but reclaim derogatory terms and demand to be judged against male counterparts. The article highlights their efforts to evolve reparto's often explicit vocabulary and themes, pushing for fresh perspectives beyond bedroom conquests.</p>

Effective January 2026, the law strengthens the California Equal Pay Act by updating the definition of "wages" to include non-traditional compensation, requiring "good faith estimates" for job pay, and extending the statute of limitations for wage claims to six years. Championed by State Sen.
