          <p>Existing home sales in April decreased by 0.5% from March, reaching the slowest April pace since 2009, signaling continued struggles in the spring housing market. Inventory jumped 9% month-to-month, reaching the highest level in five years, providing consumers with more negotiation power. The median price of an existing home sold in April was $414,000, a modest 1.8% increase year-over-year, marking the slowest appreciation since July 2023. Cancellation rates are also rising, hitting 7% of sales in April, up from a recent average of 3% to 4%. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Treasury Department plans to discontinue the manufacturing of pennies due to the rising cost of production, which now exceeds the coin's value. The penny, dating back to the early days of the U.S. Mint, costs approximately 3.7 cents to produce, resulting in an annual savings of $56 million by ending its production. Pennies are primarily made of zinc with a copper overlay, and the cost of zinc has more than doubled since 2000, contributing to the increased production expenses. The final order for penny blanks has been placed, with manufacturing expected to cease in early 2026.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to reinstate over 1,300 U.S. Department of Education employees who were set to be laid off. The judge emphasized the Department's need to carry out its functions and obligations mandated by Congress.
