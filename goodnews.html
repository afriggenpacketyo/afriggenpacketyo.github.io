          <p>Comcast has exceeded Wall Street's second-quarter expectations for both revenue and earnings, driven by the sale of its Hulu stake and strong performance from its film studios and theme parks. Despite this, the company continues to struggle with a declining broadband customer base, losing 226,000 subscribers in the quarter. To offset these losses, Comcast is focusing on its mobile services, which added a record 378,000 new lines. The streaming service Peacock saw its subscriber numbers hold steady at 41 million while its financial losses narrowed significantly compared to the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Once united by their pioneering mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, Moderna and BioNTech are now pursuing distinctly different business strategies, leading to a stark divergence in their stock performance. Moderna has doubled down on its mRNA pipeline, investing its pandemic earnings into developing more vaccines, but faces a 72% stock slide over the past year. In contrast, BioNTech has used its windfall to diversify through acquisitions, notably in the promising field of cancer treatments, resulting in a 29% stock gain. This strategic split highlights differing visions for the future, with Moderna focusing on its core technology while BioNTech broadens its portfolio to mitigate risk beyond vaccines.

          <p>CVS Health reported second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed analyst estimates, leading to a more than 9% jump in its premarket share price. The company raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast, citing strong performance in its retail pharmacy business and operational improvements in its Aetna insurance division. While the insurance unit is still managing higher medical costs, particularly in Medicare Advantage plans, its medical benefit ratio was better than anticipated. The positive results mark a successful quarter under CEO David Joyner, who is leading a multi-year turnaround plan that includes significant cost-cutting measures and strategic investments.

          <p>A scientific expedition led by China has discovered extensive and thriving colonies of tubeworms and molluscs at depths of up to 9,500 meters in the northwest Pacific Ocean. This finding represents the deepest known habitat for life on Earth. These unique organisms survive in complete darkness through chemosynthesis, a process where they derive energy from chemical reactions involving methane and hydrogen sulphide seeping from tectonic plate faults. The discovery challenges existing models of deep-ocean carbon cycling and suggests that such chemosynthesis-based communities may be more common in the planet's hadal zones than previously believed, pushing the known limits of life.</p>

          <h2>Kamala Harris Announces She Will Not Run for Governor of California</h2>

          <p>Kamala Harris has decided against entering the race for governor of California, instead signaling a focus on reshaping the Democratic party from outside of elected office for now. In her announcement, she acknowledged that the party's traditional playbook has often failed, culminating in a "moment of crisis" and necessitating new methods and fresh thinking. This decision throws the gubernatorial race wide open and allows Harris to engage in national policy debates without the constraints of a campaign. Allies suggest she will likely focus on helping Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections and continue her work on engaging young voters, a key priority from her time as vice president.</p>

          <p>Recent legislation, including a major tax and spending package signed by President Trump, is set to enhance Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts for individuals with disabilities. A key change, effective in 2026, will raise the age of disability onset for eligibility from 26 to 46, allowing millions more Americans to qualify. The new laws also make permanent several tax advantages, such as allowing tax-free rollovers from 529 college savings plans and expanding eligibility for the saver's credit. These tax-advantaged accounts enable people with disabilities to save and invest without risking their eligibility for crucial government benefits like Medicaid and Social Security.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As summers become progressively hotter due to climate change, experts advise on how to manage the negative effects of extreme heat on both physical and mental well-being. Soaring temperatures can increase health risks like heat stroke and also contribute to irritability and anxiety, a condition known as summertime seasonal affective disorder. To cope, psychologists recommend adjusting mindsets to accept staying indoors, maintaining social connections, and being mindful of mood changes. For physical activity, experts suggest exercising in the early morning, adapting workout intensity, and staying hydrated, emphasizing that protecting one's health is paramount even if it means altering summer plans.</p>

          <p>In a head-to-head clinical trial, Eli Lilly's diabetes drug Mounjaro was shown to be at least as effective as its older treatment, Trulicity, in reducing cardiovascular risks for patients with Type 2 diabetes. The study found Mounjaro reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by 8% compared to Trulicity, though this did not meet the threshold for statistical superiority. However, Mounjaro demonstrated other significant benefits, including a 16% lower rate of death from any cause and superior kidney protection. Eli Lilly believes these results strengthen the case for Mounjaro as a first-choice treatment, especially as Trulicity's patent is set to expire in 2027. (not investment advice)</p>
