        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FTSE 100 in London is on track for record-breaking gains, driven by the UK's perceived safe-haven status amid global market volatility caused by U.S. tariffs. The index has risen significantly, attracting investors seeking refuge in defensive stocks with high dividend yields. Analysts suggest that the FTSE 100's upward momentum could continue if defensive stocks remain favored and the Bank of England cuts interest rates. However, geopolitical tensions and a stronger pound could pose risks to further gains. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Trump announced a cabinet shuffle, nominating Michael Waltz as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and appointing Secretary of State Marco Rubio as interim National Security Advisor. This decision follows increasing frustration with Waltz after a Signal chat mishap involving a reporter. Vance stated that Waltz would be a better UN ambassador and that the decision was not a firing over the Signal incident. Rubio will continue his role as Secretary of State while serving as National Security Advisor.</p>

          <p>U.S. payroll growth totaled 177,000 in April, surpassing expectations despite worries over the impact of President Trump's tariffs. The unemployment rate remained stable at 4.2%, indicating a relatively stable labor market. Health care and transportation sectors led job creation, while the federal government saw a slight decrease. The strong report led traders to delay expectations for an interest rate cut, suggesting the economy showed resilience before the tariff shock.</p>

          <p>Archaeologists in Barcelona have discovered the stern of a large vessel dating back to the 15th or 16th centuries during an excavation of a former fish market. The fragment, measuring 10 meters long and 3 meters wide, is in good condition and offers insights into Mediterranean-style ship construction with Atlantic influences. The timbers of the vessel were preserved by damp sand, and the team is working to ensure the wreck is protected from drying out. This discovery is considered significant due to the rarity of underwater archaeological finds.</p>

          <p>Prince Harry has lost his bid to reinstate automatic, taxpayer-funded police protection during visits to the UK. The judge's ruling upholds a 2020 decision that denied his family automatic security after he and Meghan stepped down as senior royals. Harry will be provided state-funded police protection on a case-by-case basis. Harry's lawyers argued that he faces security risks, including threats from al-Qaeda, making it difficult for him to bring his family to the UK.</p>
