          <p>Onosato, a 24-year-old sumo wrestler, has become the first Japanese competitor in seven years to achieve the top rank of yokozuna, or grand champion. Weighing 421 pounds, Onosato's promotion follows his victory at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament, and he has pledged to devote himself to training and not disgrace the title. His achievement is particularly significant for Ishikawa prefecture, which was devastated by an earthquake and tsunami earlier in 2024, and Onosato aims to bring encouragement to the region. This promotion sets up a rivalry with Mongolia-born Hoshoryu, who also holds the yokozuna title.</p>

          <p>Former Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Terry Bradshaw has dismissed the idea of the team pursuing Aaron Rodgers, calling it "a joke." Bradshaw alluded to Rodgers's alternative beliefs and suggested he should "chew on bark and whisper to the gods" in California. He also criticized the Steelers' handling of Kenny Pickett, the quarterback they drafted in 2022, stating they failed to provide him with adequate protection and weapons. Bradshaw emphasized that the Steelers' failures, not Pickett's, were the reason for his struggles, highlighting the lack of an effective offensive line and wide receivers.</p>

          <p>The government is reviewing Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG) requirements to make it easier to build homes on smaller sites, potentially easing environmental rules for developers in England. These rules currently require developers to compensate for any loss of nature on housing developments, and the government is considering how to reduce costs for smaller housebuilders while still delivering habitats for wildlife. The proposals, part of a package of housing reforms, include easing BNG requirements for minor developments and giving planning officers more power to approve them. Ministers hope these changes will help reach the government's target of building 1.5 million new homes in England by 2030.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has invalidated President Donald Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale, deeming it unconstitutional. Judge Richard Leon criticized the order, which targeted the firm for hiring Robert Mueller, who oversaw the investigation into possible coordination between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia. Leon emphasized the importance of an independent judiciary and bar, stating that allowing the order to stand would be unfaithful to the Founding Fathers. The judge dismissed the administration's arguments, asserting that the order had caused WilmerHale to lose clients.</p>

The first step is reviewing spending and reassessing financial plans to regain control. For those who have accumulated credit card debt, prioritizing repayment through methods like the avalanche or snowball strategy is recommended. Automating savings by setting up recurring transfers to emergency funds or savings accounts is another key strategy. Additionally, scaling back on discretionary spending, finding free events, and exploring side gigs can help turbocharge debt repayment.</p>
