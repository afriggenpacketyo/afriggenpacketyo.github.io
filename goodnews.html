          <p>China has passed a new law designed to bolster the private economy, setting a test for Beijing's rhetorical support for businesses. The Private Economy Promotion Law, set to take effect on May 20, aims to protect firms from arbitrary fines and asset seizures. Observers are closely watching how the law will impact firms' ability to take local governments to court, and whether it will effectively curb administrative powers, as the government attempts to revitalize the non-state economy.</p>
