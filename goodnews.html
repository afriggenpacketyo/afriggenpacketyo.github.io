          <p>UFC CEO Dana White confirmed plans for a historic professional mixed martial arts event at the White House on July 4, 2026, marking America's 250th birthday. This unprecedented event, the first of its kind at the presidential residence, is being finalized in discussions with President Donald Trump and Ivanka Trump. The announcement follows UFC's groundbreaking seven-year streaming deal with Paramount, valued at $1.1 billion annually, which signifies a major shift from its traditional pay-per-view model. This strategic move aims to broaden UFC's reach and capitalize on the growing demand for live sports content on streaming platforms.</p>

          <p>Liverpool is reportedly intensifying its efforts to acquire Crystal Palace and England center-back Marc Guehi, who has only one year remaining on his contract. Crystal Palace chairman Steve Parish has indicated a willingness to sell Guehi this summer to avoid losing him on a free transfer next year. While Liverpool is seeking to secure the player for less than the reported £40 million valuation, the article highlights the club's substantial summer spending, which has already surpassed £270 million. This potential transfer underscores Liverpool's strategic moves to bolster its squad and the financial complexities involved in high-profile football transfers.</p>

          <p>Cosmetics company E.l.f. Beauty experienced a 30% decline in net income following new tariffs, yet its CEO, Tarang Amin, remains confident, emphasizing 26 consecutive quarters of net sales growth. The article details the company's strategic $1 billion acquisition of Hailey Bieber's popular skincare brand, Rhode, which is set to expand E.l.f.'s presence into Sephora stores. E.l.f.'s success is attributed to its affordable yet premium products and effective social media marketing, particularly on platforms like TikTok. Despite financing the deal with $600 million of debt, experts express cautious optimism about the acquisition's potential to significantly boost the company's future earnings.

          <p>The U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI) recorded a 0.2% increase in July and a 2.7% rise on an annual basis, coming in slightly below economists' forecasts, despite ongoing concerns about President Donald Trump's tariffs. The core CPI, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, increased 0.3% monthly and 3.1% year-over-year, reaching its highest annual rate since February. While some tariff-sensitive categories showed price increases, their broader impact on inflation has been limited to date. The article suggests that this inflation data may encourage the Federal Reserve to consider a September rate cut, shifting focus towards potential labor market weakness. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Circle Internet Group's shares experienced a significant jump after the company reported a robust 53% increase in its second-quarter revenue, primarily driven by the substantial growth in its USDC stablecoin circulation. CEO Jeremy Allaire attributed this success to the ongoing convergence of the internet and financial systems, positioning stablecoins and blockchains as foundational elements for the future of finance. The article highlights the company's impressive stock performance since its June IPO and its upcoming launch of Arc, a new blockchain designed for stablecoin payments. This positive momentum is also linked to increased interest from major financial institutions, partly spurred by the Trump administration's more supportive cryptocurrency legislation.

          <h2>Experts Predict Mortgage Rates May Fall Below 6% by Mid-2026</h2>

          <p>Mortgage rates, currently averaging around 6.75%, are anticipated to drop below 6%, though experts suggest this is unlikely to occur before mid-to-end of 2026. A more rapid decline would necessitate a significant economic downturn or a major geopolitical crisis, as market trends indicate that adverse economic news often leads to lower mortgage rates. The article advises that bond market yields will serve as a more reliable indicator for future rate movements than Federal Reserve policy alone. Despite the elevated rates, the article also highlights potential advantages for current homebuyers, including the possibility of lower sales prices and immediate equity building, with the flexibility to refinance later.

          <p>As the year-end approaches, older Americans obligated to take required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their retirement accounts have several strategic options if they do not immediately need the funds. The article suggests reinvesting RMD proceeds into a brokerage account, recommending exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for their tax efficiency and ease of tax-loss harvesting. Another advantageous option is a qualified charitable distribution (QCD), which allows direct, tax-free transfers from an individual retirement account to an eligible non-profit, satisfying RMDs without increasing adjusted gross income. Additionally, for legacy planning, contributing RMDs to a 529 college savings plan for family members is highlighted as a prudent financial move. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Europe's 2025 Ryder Cup team is largely forming with a familiar core, closely resembling its victorious 2023 lineup, with only minor adjustments such as Rasmus Højgaard potentially stepping in for his twin brother, Nicolai. This strong continuity is considered a significant asset for captain Luke Donald, facilitating the recreation of a proven winning environment with a cohesive group of players. The article highlights prominent automatic qualifiers like Rory McIlroy and Justin Rose, and indicates that even LIV Tour players, such as Jon Rahm, are anticipated to be part of the team.
