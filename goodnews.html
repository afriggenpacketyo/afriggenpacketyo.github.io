        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, Senator Tim Kaine refutes the argument that fundamental rights originate solely from a divine creator rather than from laws and government. Drawing on his experience as a civil rights lawyer and his time in Honduras under a military dictatorship, Kaine asserts that rights are meaningless unless they are legally codified and protected by a democratic government. He warns that relying on divine decree opens the door to tyranny, as dictators can claim to be acting on God's will, and emphasizes that foundational American rights like trial by jury are secured through the Constitution.</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced a new policy requiring employees to work from an office at least three days per week, beginning in February for those near its Washington headquarters and expanding thereafter. The company stated the change is not about reducing headcount but is intended to foster the "energy and momentum" that comes from in-person collaboration, particularly as it develops new AI products. This move marks a shift from Microsoft's more flexible pandemic-era policy, which allowed most employees to work from home up to half the time.</p>

          <p>A year after CEO Brian Niccol took charge, Starbucks is undergoing a significant transformation aimed at revitalizing its brand and customer experience, though with mixed success. Niccol's strategy involves returning to the company's "third place" roots with cozier stores and improved service, but changes like mandating handwritten messages on cups have drawn criticism from some baristas. While same-store sales are still shrinking and the company's stock has fallen, there are positive signs, such as a record-breaking sales week driven by the return of fall beverages.</p>

          <p>Chester-based artist Hayden Richard has created a large painting of a bald eagle to celebrate the Philadelphia Eagles football team ahead of their home opener. The artwork, which depicts the eagle without players or a stadium, is meant to embody the strength and pride of the team and its fanbase, known as "Bird Nation." After losing his job as a chef, Richard returned to his passion for art, creating pieces that celebrate American landscapes and promote unity. He hopes the painting will be purchased by someone affiliated with the Eagles organization.</p>

          <p>Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is executing a portfolio adjustment by selling a small number of Goldman Sachs shares, which recently hit a record high, to lock in profits. The proceeds from this sale are being reinvested into Texas Roadhouse, a steakhouse chain whose stock has declined approximately 10% following its latest earnings report. The rationale is to capitalize on Goldman's strong performance while buying into Texas Roadhouse at a lower price, based on the belief that pressures from high beef prices, which affected its margins, will eventually ease.
