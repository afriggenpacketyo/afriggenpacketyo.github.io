          <p>iPhone shipments from India to the U.S. significantly increased, while those from China decreased, reflecting Apple's adaptation to tariffs. According to Omdia, shipments from India reached roughly 3,000,000 in April, surpassing China's 900,000. While this growth demonstrates the adaptability of Apple's supply chains, analysts expect it to plateau as India's manufacturing capacity needs to expand to meet U.S. demand; Trump has also threatened tariffs on iPhones made in India. The article suggests Apple is playing a "dangerous game" as it navigates trade tensions between Washington and Beijing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>King Charles addressed Canada's Parliament, a rare move amid trade disputes and annexation threats from President Trump, in what is viewed as a sign of solidarity. The King delivered a "Speech from the Throne," outlining the government's agenda after the Liberal Party's election victory, with the speech written by Prime Minister Carney's office. Experts suggest the visit is a reminder of Canada's independence and a rallying point for Canadians, especially given Trump's comments on annexing Canada. Carney has criticized Trump's gestures and affirmed Canada's sovereignty.</p>
