          <h2>Scientific Research Increasingly Focuses on Unique Aspects of Female Athletes' Bodies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 19:55:30 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A scientific revolution is underway in women's sports, shifting away from treating female athletes as mere variations of men. Researchers are now intensely studying the unique ways the female body is affected by elite competition, providing new insights into performance and health. Topics include how breast biomechanics and proper sports bras can impact running efficiency, the nuanced effects of the menstrual cycle on performance and anxiety, and why female athletes face a higher risk of certain injuries like ACL tears. This growing body of knowledge is not only enhancing elite performance but also helping to address issues like body image and period-related concerns, which cause many young girls to drop out of sports, fostering greater participation and well-being.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-25 19:31:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In a modern twist on civic duty, the U.S. Treasury Department is now allowing Americans to make contributions toward paying down the national debt using the popular payment app Venmo. This new, youth-friendly option is an addition to the long-standing "Gifts to Reduce the Public Debt" program, which also accepts payments via PayPal, credit cards, and traditional methods. The national debt currently stands at over $36 trillion and has grown annually since 2001 under both Democratic and Republican administrations. While the gesture is largely symbolic, as public donations since 1996 have amounted to a fraction of government spending, it offers a novel way for citizens to contribute directly to the nation's finances.</p>

          <h2>Pitcher Walker Buehler Reflects on Dodgers Legacy Ahead of First Game Against Former Team</h2>

          <p>Pitcher Walker Buehler, now with the Boston Red Sox, is preparing to face his former team, the Los Angeles Dodgers, for the first time since his departure, prompting reflection on his impactful tenure in L.A. Buehler is best remembered for his postseason heroics, particularly his crucial role in the Dodgers' 2024 World Series victory, which cemented his legacy with the team and its fans. Despite a career marked by high expectations and a significant Tommy John surgery, his clutch performances in high-stakes games defined his time there. Before Friday's game, Buehler received his World Series ring from his former team, a moment he described as really cool, acknowledging the deep connection he still feels with the city.</p>

          <p>Twenty-five years after "Big Brother" first captivated UK audiences, some psychologists and social experts are suggesting that reality television may have a more positive impact than its critics believe. The article posits that the genre, by casting a diverse range of ordinary people, can foster social understanding and offer viewers a glimpse into perspectives outside their own experiences. Shows have been credited with raising awareness about health conditions, disabilities like Tourette's syndrome, and complex social issues such as coercive control. While acknowledging the serious negative impacts on some participants, which have led to industry changes, the analysis argues that reality TV can spark important national conversations and even positively influence viewer behavior.</p>

          <h2>Global 'Matcha Mania' Leads to Surging Demand and Supply Shortages</h2>

          <p>A worldwide craze for matcha, the powdered Japanese green tea, is causing a significant supply shortage and driving up prices. Fueled by social media trends and a tourism boom in Japan, demand for matcha has soared, with some cafes reporting that a month's supply now lasts only a few days. However, production is struggling to keep pace due to factors like record-breaking heatwaves damaging tea crops, an aging farmer population, and new U.S. tariffs on Japanese goods. In response, some retailers in Japan are limiting purchases, and tea masters are promoting more mindful consumption to preserve the highly-prized beverage and the centuries-old culture surrounding it.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the first time, multiple Christian Contemporary Music (CCM) artists are simultaneously charting on the Billboard Hot 100, signaling a significant crossover into the mainstream. Experts suggest this trend is driven by a multi-million dollar industry ecosystem that mirrors mainstream music styles but with faith-based lyrics, often produced by megachurches like Hillsong and Bethel. The current wave is characterized by what one reporter calls "Barstool conversion rock," a blend of masculinity, conservative politics, and country music influences, primarily from male artists. This boom is prompting discussions about its connection to the current political climate and what it reveals about the search for faith in modern American culture.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Skydance Media is poised to finalize its $8-billion merger with Paramount Global, a deal that will bring significant changes to iconic media brands like CBS, MTV, and Paramount Pictures. With the deal expected to close on August 7, the new ownership, led by David and Larry Ellison, has promised $2 billion in cost savings, signaling impending layoffs and major restructuring. Key questions remain about the future of the streaming service Paramount+, which has struggled to compete with giants like Netflix, and the fate of traditional broadcast and cable assets in a declining market. The merger will also test creative freedom, particularly for shows like "The Late Show" and "South Park," known for their pointed political satire.</p>

          <p>The White House has reversed its decision and will release $5.5 billion in education funds that it had abruptly frozen just before they were due to be distributed to states. The congressionally approved funds are designated for the 2025-26 school year and support programs such as educator training, arts education, and support for English language learners. The initial decision to withhold the money, based on claims of misuse for a "radical left-wing agenda," sparked widespread outrage from educators and bipartisan pushback from lawmakers, including ten Republican senators. Following the reversal, lawmakers and education groups praised the announcement, emphasizing the importance of the funds for local schools and communities.</p>

          <p>World champion Luke Littler has secured his spot in the World Matchplay semi-finals after a tense 16-14 victory over Andrew Gilding at Blackpool's Winter Gardens. The 18-year-old phenom held off a late comeback from Gilding to set up a highly anticipated semi-final clash with Northern Irishman Josh Rock. Rock earned his place by defeating 2023 runner-up Gerwyn Price 16-11 in a high-quality match where both players averaged over 100. Littler, who hit 18 maximums in his quarter-final, acknowledged the tough match and his focus on getting over the line, while Rock expressed excitement for what he expects will be a "cracking game" against his friend.</p>

          <p>Despite rising U.S.-China tensions, Chinese students continue to pursue higher education in America, but they are becoming more discerning in their choices. Applicants and university officials note that students are now placing a greater emphasis on well-known schools, highly-ranked programs, and flexible financial aid packages. While parents express anxiety about instability in the U.S. and students have concerns about the political climate, the appeal of academic freedom and the cultural experience remains strong. The trend indicates that while the flow of students continues, their decision-making process has become more calculated, weighing the significant risks against the perceived opportunities of a U.S. degree.</p>

While an estimated 16,000 people have already come forward to claim their pensions, the union is urging thousands more who may be eligible to contact their former employers.
