          <p>While in England for The Hundred cricket tournament, retired Australian cricketer David Warner has offered a critical assessment of English batter Joe Root's prospects in the upcoming Ashes series. Warner pointed out Root's historical struggle to score a century in Australia, attributing it to a technical flaw in his front-leg positioning. He suggested that England's success hinges on their bowlers making an impact on Australia's top order. The comments add a layer of psychological gamesmanship to the rivalry ahead of the highly anticipated series, which begins in late November.</p>

          <p>Two major Chinese state-owned companies, SinoHydro Group and Citic, have signed deals to invest a combined $350 million in large-scale agricultural development in Angola. The investment aims to develop tens of thousands of hectares for grain, soybean, and corn production as part of China's drive to enhance its food security. Under the agreements, a significant portion of the output, around 60 percent from one project, will be shipped directly to China. The initiative also includes plans for a seed research center to improve crop yields. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kemi Badenoch, leader of the UK's Conservative Party, has stated that she no longer identifies as Nigerian, despite her ancestry and having grown up partially in the country. In a podcast interview, Badenoch, who was born in the UK, explained that she considers herself Nigerian by ancestry but not by identity, as most of her life has been in the UK. She revealed she has not renewed her Nigerian passport since the early 2000s and said her early experiences in Nigeria shaped her political outlook, including her aversion to socialism.</p>

          <h2>Chinese-Led Study Reveals Potato's Origins in Ancient Hybridization with Tomato Ancestor</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new study led by Chinese researchers has traced the evolutionary origins of the potato, revealing a surprising link to an ancestor of the tomato. By analyzing the genomes of various potato species, scientists found that the modern potato emerged from a hybridization event around nine million years ago between a tomato forerunner and a tuberless, potato-like plant. This ancient cross-breeding was a key driver in the development of the tuber, the edible part that has made the potato a global staple food. The findings shed new light on the plant's complex genetic history.</p>

          <p>Los Angeles FC defeated Mexican club Pachuca 4-2 in a penalty shootout after a 1-1 draw in their Leagues Cup match, but the result leaves them on the verge of elimination from the tournament. LAFC's Dennis Bouanga opened the scoring before Elías Montiel equalized for Pachuca, with both teams seeing a player sent off during the match. Despite securing two points for the shootout victory, LAFC's total of three points from two games is likely insufficient to advance from their 18-team MLS group, where only the top four qualify.</p>

          <p>The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld a temporary restraining order preventing federal immigration agents from conducting "roving patrols" in Southern California without reasonable suspicion. The ruling affirms that factors like race, language, or location alone are insufficient grounds for a stop. The court's opinion rebuked the administration's arguments, stating they would not be harmed by an injunction that simply enforces constitutional standards. This decision is a significant development in the ongoing legal battles over the Trump administration's aggressive deportation tactics in the region.</p>
