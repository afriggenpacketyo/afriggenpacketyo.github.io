          <p>Dozens of White South Africans arrived in the U.S. after the Trump administration granted them refugee status, citing "egregious discrimination." The South African government denies these claims, arguing that the land seizure law respects private property rights and isn't racially targeted. The Trump administration has clashed with South Africa over foreign policy, including its criticism of Israel. One refugee group declined to assist with resettlement, citing racial justice concerns, while others remain committed to serving all eligible refugees. The unusual speed of the process and preferential treatment compared to other refugees have drawn criticism. Optimism for this article is based on the potential for safety for the people in question.</p>
