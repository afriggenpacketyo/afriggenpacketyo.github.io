          <p>Jin, the eldest member of the global music group BTS, recently performed a solo concert at the Honda Center, showcasing his unique brand of humor and suave energy.

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating a near-miss incident in which a SkyWest regional jet had to perform an "aggressive maneuver" to avoid a B-52 military aircraft near Minot, North Dakota. The commercial pilot informed passengers that the military plane was on a converging course and that he had not been warned by air traffic control. The Air Force stated the B-52 was conducting a pre-approved flyover and that its crew had communicated with the airport tower, which did not advise them of the inbound commercial flight. The flight landed safely with no injuries reported.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: Trump's Tariffs May Inadvertently Push Nations Toward Freer Economies</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-21 21:00:13 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article argues that while widely criticized, President Trump's universal tariffs have a potential silver lining. The economic pressure from these tariffs is compelling countries and trading blocs like Canada, China, and the European Union to confront and dismantle their own long-standing internal trade barriers. By exposing the hypocrisy of their protectionist policies, the tariffs may inadvertently spur domestic reforms that could boost their own economies. The author suggests this self-reflection on internal commerce could lead to significant long-term economic benefits. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Following a presidential directive, the U.S. National Archives has released a massive trove of documents related to the 1968 assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. The release includes over 230,000 files from the FBI's investigation, containing memos, details on leads, and information about the convicted assassin, James Earl Ray. In response, King's family urged the public to view the files in the context of the FBI's historical campaign to discredit their father. They also reiterated their long-held belief that Ray was not solely responsible for the murder.</p>

          <p>Texas officials have successfully accounted for the vast majority of over 160 people who were reported missing after the catastrophic July Fourth floods. The top executive in Kerr County, the hardest-hit area, confirmed that only three individuals remain unaccounted for. Many of those initially reported missing were tourists who had left the area and returned home without checking in. The article notes that such sharp revisions in missing person counts are common in the chaotic aftermath of large-scale disasters, as initial reports are often unverified.</p>

          <p>CNBC's Jim Cramer has identified a group of four stocks—Palantir, AppLovin, Robinhood, and Coinbase—which he has dubbed "PARC." He suggests these companies are being relentlessly pushed higher by excitement from retail investors and are likely to continue their run despite occasional pullbacks. Cramer noted that these companies have solid earnings and analyst attention, distinguishing them from more speculative trendy stocks. He advised that while there is money to be made, investors should exercise discipline and take profits when they see significant gains. (not investment advice)</p>
