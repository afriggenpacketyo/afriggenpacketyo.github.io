        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The aviation industry is banking on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) to achieve its net-zero emissions goal by 2050, with new mandates in the UK and EU requiring a gradual increase in their use. However, significant challenges remain, including concerns about supply availability, high costs, and wavering political commitment, as seen in the US. While some industry leaders like Ryanair's CEO express deep skepticism about meeting targets, others, including Heathrow Airport officials, point to current progress as a sign of a viable, albeit difficult, transition. The debate also includes environmental concerns that SAF may not be a comprehensive solution and could divert resources from other green initiatives.</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has completed an audacious endurance project, climbing the 73 highest peaks in the contiguous United States in just over a month. The project, titled "States of Elevation," involved Jornet cycling between the mountains and running up each one, covering over 3,000 miles across six states. The article chronicles his journey, highlighting not just the physical feat but also Jornet's artistic and minimalist approach to mountaineering, choosing aesthetically pleasing but more difficult routes. It portrays his deep connection with nature, his motivation beyond records, and his appreciation for the American wilderness.</p>

It highlights the Curie family's remarkable legacy, with five prizes across two generations, and notes that Albert Einstein gave his prize money to his ex-wife as part of their divorce settlement. The piece also explores historical oversights, such as the exclusion of a mathematics prize and the failure to recognize key female scientists like Lise Meitner and Rosalind Franklin for their groundbreaking discoveries. Furthermore, it touches upon prizes awarded for since-debunked or harmful scientific work, like the lobotomy, underscoring the complexities behind the prestigious award.</p>

Despite this historic milestone for women in Japanese politics, she is not seen as a progressive advocate, as she opposes same-sex marriage and legislation allowing women to retain their maiden names. She faces significant challenges, including a struggling economy, internal party divisions, and navigating complex international relations.</p>

          <p>The 1998 BBC documentary "Premier Passions" offered an unprecedented, raw look into Sunderland AFC's dramatic 1996-97 season, which ended in relegation on the final day. The article revisits the series with key figures like former manager Peter Reid and chairman Sir Bob Murray, reflecting on its fly-on-the-wall access to the dressing room and boardroom. It captured the changing commercial landscape of football as the club prepared to leave its historic Roker Park home for the new Stadium of Light. The documentary, famous for Reid's expletive-laden team talks, is remembered as a poignant and honest chronicle of the emotional highs and lows of football.</p>

          <p>Stargazers can look forward to the first supermoon of 2025, which will be the full Harvest Moon appearing on the night of October 7th. This celestial event will be the largest and brightest full moon of the year so far, kicking off a series of three consecutive supermoons. A supermoon occurs when a full moon coincides with its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, making it appear up to 14% larger and 30% brighter. This year's Harvest Moon is notably late, as it is the full moon closest to the autumn equinox, traditionally providing extra light for farmers.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores the diplomatic strategy behind President Trump's decision to accept Hamas's conditional response to his Gaza peace plan as a full acceptance. Despite Hamas's statement falling short of agreeing to key demands like disarmament, Trump has publicly declared it a breakthrough and called on Israel to immediately halt its military operations. The move is seen as a pragmatic, deal-making tactic to corner Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and force an end to the two-year conflict. Trump's motivation is likely driven by a desire to advance his Abraham Accords, secure a foreign policy win, and respond to shifting public opinion, rather than ideological alignment with Israel's leadership.</p>

Phoenix had a chance to take the lead with 24 seconds left, but Alyssa Thomas missed two crucial free throws, allowing Las Vegas to seal the victory. The game took place amid tensions between the players' union and WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert over issues of pay and officiating.</p>

          <p>North Carolina Governor Josh Stein has signed into law a bill known as "Iryna's Law," which increases judicial oversight on bail for potentially dangerous criminals and prohibits cashless bail for certain violent crimes. The legislation was prompted by the murder of Iryna Zarutska, a 23-year-old Ukrainian refugee, allegedly by a man with a long criminal history who had been recently released on a misdemeanor charge. While signing the bill, the Democratic governor expressed criticism of some of its provisions, particularly a last-minute amendment he claims is aimed at restarting executions, which he called "barbaric." The law aims to prevent similar tragedies by making it harder for high-risk individuals to be released pretrial.</p>

In response, President Trump stated he believes Hamas is "ready for a lasting PEACE" and urged Israel to immediately halt its bombing of Gaza to facilitate the safe return of hostages. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office confirmed that Israel is now preparing to implement the first phase of the plan, signaling a potentially significant step toward ending the conflict.</p>

          <p>China's biopharmaceutical industry is experiencing a renaissance, drawing international notice for its growing ability to develop innovative new drugs. A key example is ivonescimab, a cancer drug from a Guangzhou-based firm that showed superior results in a clinical trial compared to Merck's blockbuster drug, Keytruda. This success is highlighted as evidence of the sector's rapid development, with China now having the second-largest number of novel drugs in development globally. Despite these strides, analysts remain cautious, questioning whether the industry can consistently produce major breakthroughs in a complex and highly regulated field, especially compared to more established global pharmaceutical giants.

          <p>A small but growing field of research known as biocomputing is exploring the creation of computers powered by living human cells. Scientists, such as those at the Swiss lab FinalSpark, are growing mini-brains, or "organoids," from stem cells and connecting them to electrodes to process information. The ultimate goal is to create "wetware" that could replicate aspects of AI learning while using significantly less energy than current silicon-based systems. While the technology is still in its early stages, with challenges like keeping the organoids alive, it represents a frontier in computing. Researchers believe biocomputing could eventually complement traditional AI and advance disease modeling.</p>

          <p>This opinion article provides a personal account of the dramatic changes in China's education system over two generations. The author, born in rural China in the 1980s, recalls how education was a clear path out of poverty, funded by family sacrifices like selling livestock. In contrast, she now faces the immense financial and competitive pressures of securing a good education for her own daughter in Beijing, where the value of an apartment can be dictated by its proximity to a top-tier school district. The piece reflects on how the pursuit of education has transformed from a straightforward goal of social mobility into a complex and costly competition among the urban middle class.</p>

          <p>A humorous contest was held in London's Soho Square to find the city's best "performative male," a viral online trope describing men who overtly display traits and interests to signal their empathy and progressive values to women. Contestants competed by showcasing stereotypical accessories like tote bags with feminist literature, playing ukulele songs popularized on TikTok, and carrying sanitary pads. The event satirizes a specific subculture of modern masculinity where men's presentation is seen as a performance for the "female gaze." Participants and attendees noted that the trend might also be a reaction against the rise of online misogyny, as some men seek to physically demonstrate their rejection of those ideologies.</p>
