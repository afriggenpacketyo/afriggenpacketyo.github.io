          <p>Venmo is gaining traction in the peer-to-peer payment market, while Cash App is facing challenges, according to recent quarterly results from their parent companies. PayPal, which owns Venmo, reported strong earnings and maintained its financial outlook for the year, with Venmo's revenue increasing by 20% due to the growing adoption of features like debit cards and instant transfers. Block, the parent company of Cash App, experienced a decline in its stock value after missing revenue expectations and providing a disappointing forecast. Venmo's monetization per user is improving, and its role in e-commerce is expanding, as evidenced by the surge in Venmo debit card payment volume and Pay with Venmo volume.</p>

          <h2>New York Times: Antibodies Identified for Universal Snake Antivenom</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New York Times reports that scientists have identified antibodies capable of neutralizing the venom of multiple deadly snake species, marking a significant step toward creating a universal antivenom. This breakthrough stems from the work of Tim Friede, who over 18 years injected himself with escalating doses of venom from 16 snake species, building immunity and allowing scientists to isolate powerful antibodies from his blood. These antibodies, combined with a drug that blocks neurotoxins, protected mice from the venom of 19 deadly snake species from various regions. This research offers hope for treating snakebites, which affect millions globally, particularly in poor rural areas with limited access to treatment, where current antivenoms are often species-specific and can cause severe allergic reactions.</p>

          <p>Reform UK has made significant gains in the 2025 local elections in England, securing control of ten councils and winning a by-election and two mayoralties. The party gained control of several councils from the Conservatives and one from Labour, while the Liberal Democrats also gained council seats and took control of three councils. The Conservatives lost control of 12 councils but managed to win the race for mayor in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough from Labour. These results indicate a shift in the political landscape, with Reform UK emerging as a notable force in local governance.</p>

          <p>Jack Draper has reached the Madrid Open final after defeating Lorenzo Musetti in a closely contested match, marking his third ATP final appearance this year. The British number one will face Casper Ruud in the final, aiming for his second ATP title of the year following his victory at Indian Wells in March. Draper overcame an early break in the first set, securing a double break to win comfortably, and maintained his composure in a tense second-set tie-break to secure the victory. This achievement makes Draper the first Englishman to reach the final of the Madrid Open and the second Briton overall after Andy Murray.</p>

          <p>Tim Friede, fascinated by snakes since childhood, has willingly been bitten by venomous snakes approximately 200 times over nearly a quarter of a century, in an effort to develop immunity and contribute to the creation of a broad antivenom. In a new paper in the journal Cell, researchers say they've done just that, thanks in large part to the antibodies that Friede has developed over nearly a quarter century of self-envenomation. Researchers have identified antibodies in his blood that neutralize neurotoxins from multiple snake species, leading to a new antivenom cocktail that offers mice complete protection against 13 species and partial protection against six more. This research represents a significant step forward in addressing the global health problem of venomous snake bites, which cause tens of thousands of deaths and disabilities annually, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Gun training courses are experiencing a surge in sign-ups as more Americans seek to learn how to properly use firearms, driven by concerns about crime, defunding of police, and uncertainty following natural disasters or pandemics. More than 40% of US households own a gun, but experts emphasize that owning a gun is not the same as knowing how to use it, and proper training is essential. Training courses cover a range of skills, including shooting at targets, navigating simulated scenarios, and understanding the responsibility that comes with owning a firearm. The increased interest in gun training reflects a shift in attitudes towards firearms, with more people, especially women, feeling comfortable being associated with them.</p>

          <p>Boaz Barak, a computer science professor at Harvard University, argues that academics should prioritize professionalism over activism to restore public trust in higher education. He believes that blurring the lines between scholarship and politics has contributed to a decline in confidence in universities, as evidenced by a significant drop in Republican support for higher education. Barak emphasizes the importance of maintaining boundaries between academic and political spheres, even in fields like computer science that intersect with policy. He advocates for presenting multiple perspectives and fostering collaboration with people of diverse backgrounds, rather than injecting personal ideologies into the classroom, to develop critical thinking skills and promote better citizenship.</p>

          <p>James Harden delivered a standout performance in Game 6 against the Denver Nuggets, scoring 28 points and helping the Los Angeles Clippers secure a 111-105 victory to force a Game 7. Harden's performance was a stark contrast to his previous struggles in the series, and coach Tyronn Lue adjusted the team's strategy to create more space for him on the court. With the Nuggets focused on Harden, other players like Norman Powell and Kawhi Leonard were able to capitalize on open opportunities, but the Clippers' opportunity to advance now depends on Harden maintaining his elevated play. Despite playing 47 minutes in Game 6, Harden expressed his willingness to do whatever it takes to win the decisive Game 7 in Denver.</p>

          <p>Netflix's stock has been trading at all-time-high levels, marking an unprecedented 11-day winning streak. This surge follows the company's recent earnings report, which revealed a 13% revenue growth in the first quarter of 2025, driven by higher subscription and advertising revenue. Netflix has been a top-performing stock during President Donald Trump's second term, largely unaffected by Trump's tariffs and trade war with China. While traditional media stocks have struggled, Netflix continues to forecast strong full-year revenue, and analysts see further upside for the company's shares, citing its leadership in global streaming and potential catalysts from advertising upfronts.</p>

          <p>The New York Times reports that Wall Street has recovered from the sharp sell-off in April following President Trump's tariff announcements, buoyed by hopes for trade talks and a positive jobs report. The S&P 500 has climbed back above its pre-tariff levels, but questions remain about the potential economic fallout from the Trump administration's policies. Many companies are struggling to forecast their performance due to the uncertainty surrounding trade policy, and some consumer companies have indicated they may need to raise prices, potentially impacting consumer spending. Despite the recent recovery, the S&P 500 remains below its February high, highlighting the ongoing concerns about the economic impact of tariffs.</p>
