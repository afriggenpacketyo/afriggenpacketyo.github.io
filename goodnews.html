          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-17 02:22:47 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump signed an executive order to reduce tariffs on UK cars being shipped to the US, implementing parts of a tariff deal agreed upon last month. The deal includes a 10% levy on most UK goods, including cars, and does not address the removal of charges on steel imports. The agreement allows up to 100,000 cars into the US at a 10% tariff, instead of the 25% import tax imposed earlier this year, with a similar system planned for steel and aluminum. UK officials expressed optimism about the deal's potential to shield British businesses from Trump's tariffs and are working towards 0% tariffs on core steel products. The optimism score is 65.</p>

          <p>After a juror was dismissed from Sean "Diddy" Combs' federal trial, concerns arose about another juror's potential communications with a former colleague. An attorney suggested the jury should have been sequestered to avoid such issues, as jurors are instructed not to discuss the case outside the jury. Another legal expert agreed that jurors are supposed to follow court rules, and violating their oath could lead to removal. Despite the jury issues, legal experts believe Diddy's defense team has done a "great job" so far. The optimism score is 55.</p>

          <p>The Bank of Japan (BOJ) decided to further reduce its monthly government bond purchases beyond April next year, but at a slower pace, while maintaining its interest rate at 0.5%. The BOJ will scale back its debt buying by 200 billion yen per quarter, down from the current 400 billion yen, with the total amount of purchases declining to about 2 trillion yen in early 2027.

          <p>Gold has emerged as the ultimate safe haven asset, with spot prices surging 30% in 2025, outpacing traditional safe havens like the Japanese yen, Swiss franc, and U.S. Treasurys. Experts attribute gold's appeal to its independence from government liabilities, providing investors with a hedge against fiscal sustainability concerns and geopolitical instability. Demand for gold has been fueled by uncertainty, especially in the Middle East, and waning confidence in U.S. assets.
