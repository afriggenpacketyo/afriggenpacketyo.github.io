        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In the second Test at Edgbaston, Indian captain Shubman Gill scored a remarkable 161, following his first-innings 269, to set England a near-impossible target of 608 for victory. His performance makes him the first player to score over 250 and 150 in the same Test match. In response, England's top order crumbled, leaving them at 72-3 by the close of day four. With India in a commanding position, England faces the difficult choice of attempting a record-breaking chase or playing for a draw to maintain their series lead, a tactic contrary to their aggressive style under Ben Stokes.</p>

          <p>Red Bull's Max Verstappen claimed pole position for the British Grand Prix with his final lap, narrowly beating McLaren's Oscar Piastri by just over a tenth of a second. The qualifying session at Silverstone was intensely competitive, with McLaren's Lando Norris finishing third and Mercedes' George Russell in fourth, all separated by fractions of a second. Verstappen noted the windy conditions made the high-speed corners challenging, but his final effort was enough to top a session that promises an exciting and close race. Lewis Hamilton will start from fifth on the grid for his home race.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an interview, documentary filmmaker Ken Burns described the American Revolution as the most important event in world history since the birth of Christ, arguing it created the concept of a "citizen." He emphasized that the revolution was a bloody and divisive civil war, not a sanitized event, and that understanding the deep flaws of the founders, like Thomas Jefferson's ownership of slaves, makes their achievements more profound. Burns asserted that America is held together by the words of its founding documents, and that embracing the nation's complex, gritty history is essential for navigating current divisions and fulfilling the responsibilities of citizenship.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Bogota, Colombia, have arrested Elder José Arteaga Hernández, the alleged mastermind behind the June 7 shooting of conservative senator and presidential candidate Miguel Uribe Turbay. Arteaga, who has a criminal history spanning over 20 years, was apprehended nearly a month after the attack that left Uribe in intensive care. The shooting, which also injured two others, occurred while Uribe was giving a speech in a park and has been widely condemned as a threat to Colombia's democracy. The motive remains under investigation, but Uribe was a vocal critic of the current president.</p>

          <h2>AI Analysis Suggests Taxing Billionaire Wealth Growth Could Generate Substantial Revenue</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An inquiry posed to ChatGPT explored the fiscal consequences of taxing billionaires at the same rate as the middle class. The AI's analysis clarified that the primary disparity is not in income tax rates but in how wealth is taxed versus labor; wages are taxed immediately, while asset appreciation is often deferred or avoided. Using the "buy-borrow-die" strategy, the ultra-wealthy minimize their tax burden on massive wealth growth. The AI calculated that taxing the wealth growth of the top 25 billionaires at a 20% rate could have generated an additional $66 billion, suggesting that a broader application could fund major public services.

          <p>Actress Charlize Theron recently explained her decision to remain single and raise her two children alone, stating she realized she "was not somebody who should be having kids with another person." She attributed this choice to her experience with a tumultuous family dynamic growing up and a personal tendency to lose herself in relationships with narcissistic partners. Relationship experts quoted in the article support her decision, framing it as a sign of strength, self-awareness, and an alignment with her true capabilities, rather than a rejection of love or partnership.</p>

          <p>A so-called "cortisol cocktail" has gone viral on TikTok, with users claiming the alcohol-free drink can lower the stress hormone cortisol. The beverage typically combines coconut water, orange juice, lemon, magnesium powder, and sea salt. However, medical experts interviewed for this article state there is no scientific evidence that the drink or its ingredients can lower cortisol levels. They suggest any perceived benefits are likely due to improved hydration and the relaxing effects of magnesium, while cautioning that the drink may be harmful for individuals with kidney disease or diabetes.</p>

          <p>A long-lost prototype of the MingKwai, a revolutionary Chinese typewriter from the 1940s, has been discovered and acquired by Stanford University. Invented by linguist Lin Yutang, the machine was a groundbreaking attempt to manage the tens of thousands of characters in written Chinese. Its ingenious system, which broke down characters by shape rather than sound, is now seen as a conceptual forerunner to modern Chinese, Japanese, and Korean computer input methods. The discovery is celebrated by scholars as finding a key artifact in the origin story of East Asian computing.</p>

          <p>Scientists at Oregon State University's Chapple Big Fish Lab are studying sharks in Washington's Willapa Bay to better understand the health of the marine ecosystem. Led by Dr. Taylor Chapple, the team catches sharks, examines their stomach contents to assess their diet and water quality, and then releases them. Researchers believe that the health of these apex predators is a key indicator of the overall health of the ocean. A significant part of their mission is also to change the public's negative perception of sharks to garner more support for crucial conservation research.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Happiness researcher Mo Gawdat promotes a "90-second rule" to better handle anger and stress. The concept, based on neuroscience, is that the physiological rush of hormones like cortisol and adrenaline from an emotional trigger lasts for only about 90 seconds. After that initial period, any continued feeling of upset is a choice made by mentally replaying the negative thought. By recognizing this, individuals can use the moment after the 90 seconds to consciously shift their focus, accept the situation, and decide on a more constructive response, leading to a more fulfilled life.</p>

          <p>Inspired by the central role of hobbies in Danish culture, a business school professor undertook a year-long experiment of trying 17 different activities, from woodworking to mahjong. She found that engaging in hobbies fundamentally changed her life for the better, helping her kick a doomscrolling habit and feel less lonely by connecting with new communities. The author argues that hobbies are the secret to achieving work-life balance, as they force individuals to define boundaries and pursue joy outside of their professional and family obligations, ultimately boosting confidence and well-being.</p>
