          <p>Paris has reopened the Seine River for public swimming, a historic first since the 1920s, fulfilling a long-standing promise to clean up the waterway. This achievement was facilitated by the construction of massive overflow tanks designed to contain sewage during heavy rains, a development spurred by the recent Olympic Games. Designated swimming areas, complete with docks, are now drawing both locals and tourists, providing a welcome respite during successive heat waves. The initiative revives a century-old tradition, allowing Parisians to cool off in their iconic river, reminiscent of scenes depicted in classic Impressionist paintings.</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly in advanced negotiations with Aston Villa for the transfer of midfielder Jacob Ramsey, with an agreement between the clubs nearing completion. The 24-year-old, a former England U21 international, is scheduled to hold pivotal discussions with Aston Villa within the next 24 hours to determine his future. Should the clubs finalize a deal and Ramsey decide to depart, he is expected to enter into talks with Newcastle regarding personal terms, as St James' Park is understood to be his preferred destination over other interested clubs like West Ham. Ramsey has scored 17 goals in 167 appearances for Villa since his 2019 senior debut.</p>

          <p>Rolls-Royce CEO Tufan Erginbilgic envisions the company becoming the UK's most valuable firm by leveraging its nuclear reactor technology to power artificial intelligence. He highlights Rolls-Royce's unique global capability in small modular reactors (SMRs), which are crucial for the energy-intensive AI sector. The company has secured deals to develop SMRs for the UK and Czech governments, with an estimated global demand for 400 SMRs by 2050, representing a trillion-dollar market. Despite SMRs being an unproven technology, Erginbilgic expresses confidence in their future potential, noting the company's significant financial turnaround and tenfold share price increase since his tenure began in January 2023.

          <p>New guidance from the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) will encourage UK police forces to disclose the ethnicity and nationality of suspects charged in high-profile and sensitive investigations. This measure aims to combat misinformation, enhance public trust, and ensure greater transparency, particularly in cases of significant public interest, such as the alleged sexual assault of a 12-year-old in Warwickshire. Policing Minister Dame Diana Johnson welcomed the change, indicating the government's expectation for such details to be released in "most cases." The guidance, effective immediately, seeks to bring consistency to police media relations, though former police officials caution about potential "unintended consequences," including increased online speculation if information is not consistently released across all cases.</p>

          <p>New research is exploring whether robots and AI with personalities beyond the typical extraverted, confident, and cheerful programming could be more relatable to humans. NPR's science correspondent Nell Greenfieldboyce examines experiments with different robot temperaments, including those that might exhibit traits like neuroticism or anxiety, akin to fictional characters such as C-3P0. This exploration challenges the conventional approach to AI personality design, suggesting that a broader range of emotional expressions and temperaments could foster deeper and more nuanced human-robot interactions. The article delves into the potential for these less conventional personalities to enhance human connection and understanding with artificial intelligence.</p>

          <p>China's "durian diplomacy" has advanced with the inaugural direct air shipments of Cambodian durians to China, establishing a new air corridor for fresh fruit trade. A two-tonne consignment reached China's central Henan province in just four hours via cold chain logistics, ensuring the fruit's freshness for Chinese consumers. This makes durian the fifth fresh fruit, following bananas, mangoes, longans, and coconuts, to gain direct market access from Cambodia to China, highlighting enhanced agricultural trade and customs efficiency. Despite these positive developments, some industry experts express caution regarding the long-term commercial competitiveness of Cambodian durians within the Chinese market.</p>
