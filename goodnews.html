          <h2>UK Paternity Leave System Criticized as Outdated and Unequal by MPs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 21:00:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A cross-party group of MPs has criticized the UK's statutory parental leave system as one of the worst in the developed world, citing "fundamental flaws" and outdated gender stereotypes. The report by the Women and Equalities Committee calls for bold action and significant investment to improve paternity leave rules. Currently, statutory paternity leave allows new fathers to take up to two weeks off work, receiving a low weekly payment that is out of sync with the cost of living. The report suggests increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and extending paternity leave to six weeks. The findings highlight the need for modernization and greater support for fathers and non-birthing parents.</p>

          <p>A research project by four high school students from New Mexico is gaining attention at the National History Day contest for its investigation into Unit 731, a secret Japanese military unit that conducted inhumane experiments during World War II. The students' documentary not only revisits a dark corner of wartime history but also questions how that history is taught in US schools today. Their project highlights America's role in keeping the unit's war crimes quiet, adding a layer of complexity to the narrative. The students' work underscores the importance of critical thinking and a deeper understanding of the past.</p>

          <h2>New Guidance Allows Teachers to Use AI for Marking and Administrative Tasks</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-09 20:51:53 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New government guidance in England permits teachers to use artificial intelligence to expedite marking and write letters to parents, aiming to free up time for face-to-face teaching. The training materials emphasize transparency and the need for teachers to check AI-generated results. AI should only be used for low-stakes marking, such as quizzes and homework, and teachers must oversee its outcomes. The move is intended to help automate routine tasks and allow educators to focus on more meaningful interactions with students. While welcomed by some, concerns remain about data breaches and the potential for errors.</p>

          <p>Apple's annual developer conference (WWDC) featured a significant software update but lacked the expected splashy AI announcements. The company unveiled "Liquid Glass," a new design language for all its operating systems, marking the first major redesign of the iPhone operating system since 2013. The update includes a glass-like lock screen, fluid animations, and pill-shaped buttons. Despite the software revamp, Wall Street was underwhelmed, sending Apple's stock down, as investors seek more aggressive AI strategies to compete with rivals. The delay of Apple Intelligence, its response to ChatGPT, further contributed to the muted response.</p>

          <p>JPMorgan Asset Management suggests that Chinese equities are not as cheap as they appear due to weakened corporate earnings from the nation's economic slowdown. Investors need to carefully screen stocks and sectors to pick winners. While Chinese stocks trade at 14 times historic earnings, the return on equity is faltering due to weaker profitability. JPMorgan notes that Chinese stocks have rallied this year, but global investors remain underweight on them. The article highlights the need for improved profitability for Chinese companies to justify a re-rating of their stocks.</p>
