          <p>President Trump announced new initiatives to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF), including a deal with EMD Serono to significantly slash prices of fertility medicines like Gonal-f. The administration also encourages employers to offer fertility benefits, similar to vision or dental coverage, though it's not mandated. Trump stated these actions would lead to "many more beautiful American children" and dramatically reduce IVF costs, a procedure often not fully covered by insurance. The plan comes as Trump works to rein in prescription drug costs and addresses a key campaign promise.</p>

          <p>Demand for protein powders is soaring, driven by influencers and a growing consumer focus on protein intake, yet dietitians advise caution, emphasizing whole foods over supplements. While protein is an essential nutrient for various bodily functions, current wellness culture often overestimates individual needs. Consumer Reports found some protein powders contain unsafe lead levels, raising health concerns. Dietitians recommend limiting powder intake to occasional use, as whole foods offer more comprehensive nutrients and sustained fullness, and most adults can meet their protein needs through diet alone.</p>
