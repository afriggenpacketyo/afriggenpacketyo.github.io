          <p>Bill Gates has announced his intention to donate 99% of his remaining wealth to the Gates Foundation, with plans to spend the funds over the next 20 years and close the foundation by 2045. This philanthropic pledge, estimated at $107 billion, aims to significantly impact global health and education initiatives. Gates emphasized that spending down his fortune now will help save and improve lives, creating positive long-term effects. The Gates Foundation, established in 2000, has been instrumental in shaping global health policy and driving down the costs of medical treatments in low- and middle-income countries.</p>

          <p>The British government has reportedly reached a trade deal with the United States, offering relief amid growing global trade uncertainty. President Trump announced the 'full and comprehensive' agreement, which is expected to benefit sectors like the British auto industry, particularly luxury car manufacturers. The agreement is anticipated to boost consumer and business confidence, although its overall impact on the British economy may be limited due to the focus on services, which were not heavily affected by the tariffs. The Bank of England recently cut interest rates, citing concerns about the global economic outlook amid trade uncertainties.</p>

The decision balances Kohberger's Sixth Amendment right to a public trial with the state's interest in obtaining unbiased testimony. The judge noted that the family's testimony is expected to be narrow in scope and that prior recorded interviews would help prevent alterations. Kohberger is charged with the stabbing deaths of four University of Idaho students and faces the possibility of the death penalty if convicted.</p>
