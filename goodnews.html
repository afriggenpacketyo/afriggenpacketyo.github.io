This decision comes shortly after the Trump administration canceled funding for Moderna's flu vaccine development and the CDC changed its recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination in children.

          <p>Lewis Hamilton has criticized a new FIA rule imposing stiffer load tests on front wings in Formula 1, calling it a "waste of money." The rule, intended to limit the aerodynamic advantage gained from front wing flexibility, has reportedly changed nothing. Hamilton said the wings still bend, just less, and teams had to spend money on new wings, adding that the change could have been given to charity. The FIA delayed the rule's introduction, expecting teams to introduce new wings anyway as part of their development programs.</p>
