          <p>A boiler room explosion caused a partial collapse of a 20-story New York City Housing Authority building in the Bronx, leaving a gaping hole in its side. Miraculously, no injuries were reported despite the extensive damage. Officials believe the blast occurred as an individual was turning on the heating system for the season. New York City Mayor Eric Adams praised the rapid response, calling it a avoided major disaster.

          <p>Elon Musk has achieved a historic milestone, becoming the first individual to amass a net worth exceeding $500 billion, according to the Forbes billionaires index. This unprecedented wealth surge was driven by a recovery in Tesla stock and soaring valuations of his other ventures, including xAI and SpaceX. Tesla shares gained over 14% year-to-date, partly due to Musk refocusing on his businesses after a period in the Trump administration. His substantial stake in Tesla, combined with significant growth in his AI and rocket companies, solidified his position as the world's richest person.</p>

Despite the increase, demand for wedding jewelry, a cultural staple, remains strong, compelling couples to purchase items like gold dragon and phoenix bracelets. Gold prices in Hong Kong have risen in parallel, hitting HK$35,370 per tael for raw gold and HK$42,840 for jewelry. Industry observers note that consumers have gradually adapted to this new pricing level following last year's 26% annual gain.</p>

          <p>Actor Raymond Cruz, known for his role in 'Breaking Bad,' will not be charged following a parking dispute last month. Prosecutors in Los Angeles declined to file criminal charges against Cruz, who was briefly held after three women accused him of intentionally spraying them with water. Cruz's agent stated that the actor was washing his car when the women parked too close and began recording him. While some water may have splashed incidentally, the agent denied any intentional wrongdoing on Cruz's part during the confrontation.</p>

          <p>Maxwell House coffee has launched a viral marketing campaign, humorously rebranding itself as "Maxwell Apartment Coffee" to highlight the U.S. housing affordability crisis. The campaign acknowledges that many consumers, particularly first-time homebuyers whose median age has risen to 38, struggle to afford housing. The company offers a year's supply of coffee as a "12-month lease" for under $40, a nod to the financial challenges faced by renters. This tongue-in-cheek approach aims to connect with a growing population of coffee-loving renters across the country.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit against Nirvana, alleging child sexual assault over the iconic 'Nevermind' album cover featuring a naked baby, has been dismissed for the second time. Judge Fernando Olguin ruled that no reasonable jury would consider the image pornographic, likening it to a "family photo of a nude child bathing." The plaintiff, Spencer Elden, who was the baby in the 1991 photo, had claimed ongoing personal harm. Nirvana's legal team expressed delight, stating the court ended a meritless case and freed their clients from false allegations.</p>
