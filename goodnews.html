          <p>Polish and allied planes were briefly scrambled in Polish airspace early Monday as Russia targeted Ukraine with aerial strikes, according to the Polish armed forces. The Ukrainian air force issued alerts about Russian drones targeting various areas within Ukraine. Poland's military launched available forces, scrambling fighter pairs and elevating ground-based air defense and radar reconnaissance systems to the highest readiness level as a preventative measure. The threat of Russian strikes later diminished, and the Polish and allied warplanes returned to normal activity, with no airspace violations observed. Optimism score is based on the fact that no airspace violations were observed and Polish and allied warplanes returned to normal activity.</p>

          <p>The UK government is proposing to expand the ban on bottom trawling, a destructive fishing method, from 18,000km2 to 30,000km2 of UK's offshore protected areas.

Sir David Attenborough has warned about the damaging effects of bottom trawling on the seabed and marine life. The proposal, subject to a 12-week industry consultation, aims to protect rare marine animals and the seabed they inhabit.</p>
