          <p>Maria Foscarinis' book, *And Housing for All: The Fight to End Homelessness in America*, argues that housing should be recognized as a human right to effectively address homelessness. The book examines the origins and perpetuation of the homelessness crisis, highlighting policy failures rather than personal shortcomings. It emphasizes that both Republican and Democratic administrations have contributed to systemic inequality through cuts to housing assistance and treating housing as a commodity. The book advocates for the "Housing First" model, prioritizing stable housing followed by support services, and asserts that acknowledging housing as a human right is essential for lasting change, arguing that homelessness is a societal choice. This perspective emphasizes the need for political will and systemic solutions.</p>

          <p>Chancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed that more people will be eligible for the next winter fuel payment following a widely-expected reversal of the previous policy. The government faced criticism for limiting the payment to those receiving pension credit or another means-tested benefit in 2024, and Reeves is expected to set out some details about who will qualify in winter 2025. The winter fuel payment is currently worth ¬£200-¬£300 for those on certain benefits and born before specific dates. The article provides details about the payment and the changes in eligibility. The article focuses on the changes in the policy and how they will affect pensioners.</p>
