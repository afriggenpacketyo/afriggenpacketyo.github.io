They spent nearly two days sheltering in a barn before the son managed to use the boat's marine radio to send a mayday call. A relative had reported them missing when they didn't return as expected. One family member was in critical condition, while the other two were stable after being flown to an area hospital.</p>

          <p>From next year, NHS health checks in England will officially include questions about menopause and its symptoms for women aged 40 to 74. This initiative aims to identify individuals who could benefit from advice and support, including hormone replacement therapy or counseling. Health Secretary Wes Streeting hopes the move will reduce suffering and stigma, bringing menopause into mainstream health discussions. While campaigners welcome the measure, concerns remain about the low uptake of health checks in some communities and the need for staff training.</p>

          <p>Tesla CEO Elon Musk announced that the company's new AI5 chip will be manufactured by Samsung and TSMC in the U.S., aiming for an oversupply to be used in cars, robots, and data centers. Tesla, which previously switched from Nvidia's chips to its own in 2019, will continue to use Nvidia GPUs for model training, with Musk clarifying they are not replacing Nvidia. The AI5 chip, designed solely for Tesla's needs, is expected to offer superior performance per dollar for AI. This development highlights Tesla's continued investment in custom silicon for its autonomous driving technology.</p>

          <p>Former Love Island and Big Brother contestants, Ellie Jackson and Jenkin Edwards, shared their experiences of returning to regular employment after their time in the spotlight. Jackson, who appeared on Love Island, initially struggled with the pressure to become a successful influencer, leading to mental health issues and financial instability before rejoining her accountancy firm. Edwards, from Big Brother, also found it difficult to readjust to social settings and the perception of failure for returning to his barman job. This article highlights the often-unrealistic expectations associated with reality television fame and the importance of authenticity.</p>

The Department for Education acknowledges the "vicious cycle" of the inherited system.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A University of Turku study, analyzing data from English and Welsh youth, found that maternal grandmothers have the biggest protective impact on children facing adverse early-life experiences. Their support, such as childcare or financial aid, helps buffer the negative effects of trauma, though it doesn't erase them entirely. This finding aligns with the "grandmother hypothesis," an evolutionary theory suggesting grandmothers increase their daughters' fertility by helping with child-rearing. Experts emphasize the importance of a strong, consistent adult support system for children facing hardship, with grandparents often playing a crucial role in providing stability and cultural connection.</p>

          <p>The UK's September inflation rate remained static at 3.8%, below the expected 4%, providing Chancellor Rachel Reeves with potential economic flexibility. Economists anticipate further declines in inflation next spring. While still high compared to other G7 nations, the International Monetary Fund projects a return to the 2% target by late next year. Crucially, retail experts believe food price inflation has peaked, reducing the risk of self-fulfilling wage-price spirals. This outlook may enable earlier interest rate cuts and save billions in budget calculations, suggesting a potential break from negative economic cycles. (not investment advice)</p>
