          <p>A recent study by SmartAsset has identified the best job markets in the United States, ranking cities on factors like unemployment, income growth, and work-life balance. Bend, Oregon, claimed the top spot due to its low unemployment rate and significant income growth, alongside a short median commute time. For those prioritizing health benefits, Santa Clara, California, leads with over 88% of its population covered by private employer plans. The analysis also highlights cities in Texas and California for having some of the shortest commutes and highest rates of remote work, offering valuable insights for individuals navigating the current job market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The spending package passed by Senate Republicans includes a provision to permanently increase the maximum child tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200 starting in 2025 and index it to inflation thereafter. This proposal differs from the House version, which suggests a temporary increase to $2,500. Policy experts note that due to the credit's partial refundability, the lowest-income families may still not receive the full benefit, as it is contingent on earnings. The final structure of the tax credit remains uncertain as the House must still approve the Senate's version of the legislation before it can become law.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With credit card balances and interest rates at record highs, many consumers are considering debt consolidation. Before pursuing this option, financial experts recommend three crucial steps to ensure it is a beneficial move. Borrowers should first calculate a complete picture of their total debt, including all balances, interest rates, and fees. It is also vital to shop around and understand all available options, such as personal loans and balance transfer cards, comparing their respective terms and costs. Finally, individuals should consider what a debt consolidation program can offer to provide structure and support. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The United Kingdom experienced its hottest day of 2025 on Tuesday, with temperatures in London's St James's Park reaching 34.7C (94.4F). The peak of the heatwave primarily affected England, while conditions remained cooler in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. This record heat follows what the Met Office has provisionally declared as the warmest June on record for England. While temperatures are expected to cool, amber heat health alerts remain in effect for several English regions. The heatwave in the UK is part of a broader, intense period of scorching temperatures across much of Europe.</p>

          <p>To truly understand a company's culture beyond corporate platitudes, NYU professor and author Suzy Welch advises job candidates to ask one specific question: "What kind of person should not work at this company?" The article suggests this question often elicits more honest and unrehearsed answers, revealing the company's true operational values regarding work-life balance, collaboration, and workplace environment. By catching managers off guard, candidates can gain genuine insights that help them determine if the company is a good personal fit. This approach empowers applicants to make more informed career decisions aligned with their own core values.</p>

          <p>Commuters in the San Francisco Bay Area received free rides on public transit Tuesday morning following a widespread outage of the Clipper card payment system. The system, which handles payments for BART trains, buses, and ferries, went down, prompting many agencies to open faregates and wave passengers on without payment. The Clipper system is used by hundreds of thousands of people daily across the nine-county region. The outage occurred as the regional Metropolitan Transportation Commission has been facing scrutiny over repeated delays in rolling out an updated system, known as Clipper 2.0.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) become a more attractive borrowing option due to falling interest rates, homeowners are advised to avoid several common mistakes. Experts warn against overborrowing just because rates are lower than alternatives like personal loans, as the home serves as collateral. Homeowners should also actively monitor the rate climate rather than assuming their rate will directly mirror Federal Reserve actions. Finally, it's recommended to use a HELOC for strategic purposes, like value-adding home renovations, rather than for discretionary spending like vacations, to protect one's most valuable financial asset.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For savers whose certificates of deposit (CDs) are maturing this July, the current interest rate environment is significantly different from that of recent years when rates were much higher. Financial experts advise against letting the CD automatically roll over, as the new rate will likely be lower. Instead, savers should take time to shop around for the best available rates, particularly at online banks, before an anticipated Federal Reserve rate cut in September potentially lowers them further. Considering a long-term CD, even at a slightly lower rate, could be a strategic move to lock in today's relatively high rates for several years. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Ford Motor Company announced that its new vehicle sales jumped 14.2% in the second quarter compared to the previous year, a figure that significantly outpaces the estimated industry-wide increase of just 1.4%. The automaker sold 612,095 vehicles, with strong performance from its F-Series trucks, which had their best second quarter since 2019. Sales of electrified vehicles, which include both hybrids and full EVs, also grew, though the increase was driven entirely by a 23.5% surge in hybrid sales while pure EV sales saw a decline.
