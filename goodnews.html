        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to a Morgan Stanley analysis, China's major property developers are poised for a business upswing in the second half of 2025, moving past a challenging first half of the year. The report predicts that the decline in sales and profitability will slow, with an anticipated overall sales decrease of 10% for the full year, potentially seeing a recovery in the fourth quarter. This optimistic outlook contrasts with the weak interim results recently reported by developers, who have been struggling with a multi-year slump in the sector. The bank notes that developers themselves have provided positive guidance, expecting margin recovery and growth in rental income. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Department store chain Macy's reported second-quarter earnings that significantly surpassed Wall Street expectations, causing its stock to rise by 10% in pre-market trading. The company attributed the positive results to successful strategies in its revamped stores and saw its best comparable sales growth in a year. Consequently, Macy's has raised its full-year guidance for both earnings and sales, signaling confidence despite potential headwinds from tariffs. CEO Tony Spring expressed cautious optimism, stating that the company is well-positioned to gain market share by focusing on growing segments like denim and women's contemporary apparel.

The new rule, introduced by the governing body WSL Football, is described as ensuring a "full-time wage" for all players, though the specific amount has not yet been disclosed. This development is part of a broader effort to professionalize the sport, which also includes increased criteria for high-performance environments and enhanced safeguarding measures. The move aims to address wage disparities and allow more players to focus on football without needing part-time jobs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>An opinion column in the Los Angeles Times makes a bold prediction that the Rams are destined for the Super Bowl this season, citing several key factors for this optimistic outlook. The article points to the team's strong finish last season, key offseason acquisitions like receiver Davante Adams and center Coleman Shelton, and the signing of lineman Poona Ford to bolster the run defense. The author expresses confidence in quarterback Matthew Stafford's health and the leadership of coach Sean McVay. The piece argues that with a talented roster, a relatively easy schedule, and a weakened division, the Rams have all the necessary components for a deep playoff run.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Contrary to a prevalent narrative that women are happier without spouses or children, a new survey indicates that married mothers report the highest levels of happiness among American women. The study found 19% of married mothers described themselves as "very happy," compared to smaller percentages for married women without children, unmarried mothers, and unmarried women without children. The article posits that while motherhood presents challenges like feeling overwhelmed, it also provides a profound sense of purpose and meaning that contributes significantly to overall life satisfaction. Additionally, the benefits of marriage, such as reduced loneliness and more frequent physical affection, are also linked to greater happiness.</p>

          <h2>California Plans $2.1 Billion Tunnel to Bypass Perilous Stretch of Highway 101</h2>

          <p>After decades of costly temporary repairs, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has proposed a $2.1 billion tunnel as a long-term solution for Last Chance Grade, a treacherous three-mile section of Highway 101. This portion of the highway, which is the only viable route connecting communities in California's remote northwest corner, is built atop active landslides and is constantly eroding into the Pacific Ocean. The proposed 6,000-foot tunnel would bypass the unstable cliffs, providing a secure and reliable transportation lifeline for the region. While funding for the massive project is still being sought, officials and residents see it as a critical investment to prevent economic devastation from a potential full road closure.</p>

          <p>Pop icon Debbie Gibson discusses her new memoir, "Eternally Electric," which chronicles her journey from a teenage prodigy writing and producing her own platinum albums to her enduring career in music and theater. Gibson reflects on the crucial role of her late mother and manager, Diane, who fiercely advocated for her to maintain creative control at a time when young female artists were rarely afforded such autonomy. She credits her mother's efforts with helping to pave the way for today's generation of powerful female singer-songwriters like Taylor Swift. The book delves into the pressures of fame, including death threats and panic attacks, while celebrating a career that has found a vibrant second act.</p>

          <p>Blondie frontwoman Debbie Harry reflects on her career, her influential androgynous style, and the creative process behind the band's upcoming album, titled "High Noon." In an interview, she emphasizes the importance of experimentation and doing the "wrong" thing, a philosophy that has guided both her fashion choices and Blondie's genre-blending music. Harry discusses how the band's urban New York roots led them to incorporate diverse influences like rap and reggae, which was unconventional at the time. She expresses excitement for the new record, which will feature contributions from original Sex Pistols bassist Glen Matlock, and asserts that passion remains the driving force behind her continued creativity.</p>

The Sid the Cat Auditorium aims to become a permanent home for the promoter after years of booking shows across various Los Angeles locations. The opening is seen as a sign of renewal for the area's arts community, which was deeply affected by the recent Eaton fire that destroyed the nearby artist hub of Altadena. The self-funded venue has been meticulously restored, preserving historical details while adding modern amenities, with the goal of creating a unique and supportive space for both artists and audiences.</p>

          <p>Greg Gutfeld's Fox News show, "Gutfeld!," has become the most-watched program in its 10 p.m. time slot, drawing over 3 million nightly viewers with its irreverent and conservative-leaning humor. The article profiles Gutfeld's journey from magazine editor to a dominant force in late-night television, arguing that he has successfully filled a void left by mainstream hosts who alienated a large portion of the country. Gutfeld attributes his success to creating an unpredictable and fun atmosphere, similar to his earlier cult show "Red Eye," where teasing and roasting are central. He contends that he simply capitalized on an opportunity to cater to an audience that felt ignored by the established late-night culture.</p>

          <h2>The Field of Space Medicine Addresses Health Challenges of Mars Travel</h2>

          <p>As humanity considers missions to Mars, the nascent field of space medicine is working to overcome the significant health challenges that long-duration spaceflight poses to the human body. Currently, astronauts are selected for their peak physical condition, but travel to Mars would expose even them to heightened risks like radiation-induced cancer, bone density loss, and psychological stress from extreme isolation. Researchers are studying these effects through analogs like NASA's twins study and exploring solutions such as AI-guided diagnostics and creating organoids from astronauts' stem cells to test countermeasures. Advances in space medicine are expected to not only make space travel safer but also yield medical breakthroughs for health on Earth.</p>
