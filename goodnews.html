CEO Todd McKinnon stated that economic conditions were "much better than we thought," leading the company to raise its fiscal 2026 forecast. Despite some caution from U.S. government customers due to new efficiency initiatives, renewals across federal agencies remained strong. Okta also announced the acquisition of Axiom Security and anticipates future growth from managing AI agent identities and selling software suites.

          <p>Cracker Barrel's stock experienced a significant jump after President Donald Trump weighed in on the controversial rebranding of the company's logo. Trump advised the company to revert to its old design, acknowledge customer feedback, and capitalize on the "Billion Dollars worth of free publicity" as a "great opportunity." His comments, shared on Truth Social, came after the stock had dropped following the new logo's unveiling and criticism from conservative circles. The White House's official X account further amplified the sentiment with a "Go woke, go broke" tweet and a modified Cracker Barrel logo featuring Trump. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>U.S. financial markets remained largely steady, with investors seemingly shrugging off President Trump's unprecedented attempt to remove Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, an action that could challenge the central bank's independence. Trump cited allegations of mortgage fraud, which Cook denies, vowing not to resign and to contest the firing legally. Despite the potential for market unease, traders continue to anticipate a September rate cut, with a high probability of a 0.25% reduction. Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent remarks at Jackson Hole also hinted at potential policy adjustments, suggesting a rate cut could be on the horizon. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>AI startup Anthropic has settled a class action copyright infringement lawsuit filed by authors who accused the company of training its AI models on their copyrighted works without permission. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A U.S. District Judge had previously ruled that AI models could learn from copyrighted books under "fair use" doctrine but noted Anthropic might have illegally pirated source material. The company, backed by Amazon, was accused of pirating millions of books from online libraries and physically scanning print copies, with potential damages reaching billions if the case had gone to trial.</p>

          <p>Conservative MP George Freeman will not face a parliamentary standards investigation regarding "cash for questions" allegations, after referring himself to the commissioner in June. Claims had emerged that a company he advised helped him draft parliamentary questions, despite previous advice against lobbying the government. Freeman expressed delight with the decision, calling the claims "unfounded," and noted that lobbying rules permit MPs to advocate for sectors as long as declaration rules are followed. The commissioner found insufficient grounds for a formal investigation, concluding that Freeman's actions did not violate the rules on registration and declaration.</p>

          <p>EchoStar's stock soared over 70% after AT&T agreed to acquire certain wireless spectrum licenses from the telecom company for approximately $23 billion in an all-cash deal.

EchoStar stated the sale is part of its efforts to address the Federal Communications Commission's inquiries into its compliance with 5G network buildout requirements, following complaints from SpaceX about underused spectrum. The deal also includes an expanded network services agreement, enabling EchoStar to operate as a hybrid mobile network operator under the Boost Mobile brand. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Reverse Mortgages Present Timely Financial Opportunities for Seniors This September</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For seniors aged 62 or older, a reverse mortgage could be a particularly smart financial move this September, offering a way to access home equity without immediate repayments. With average home equity levels at a record high, many older homeowners have substantial funds to tap into. This option eliminates concerns over fluctuating interest rates, as monthly repayments are not required, allowing borrowers to focus on their financial needs. Furthermore, a reverse mortgage can be an effective tool for paying down high-rate debt, such as credit card balances, which currently carry high interest rates. (not investment advice)</p>
