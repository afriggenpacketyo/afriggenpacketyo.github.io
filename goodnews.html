          <p>Beyond Meat's stock saw an extraordinary surge, climbing nearly 130% following its inclusion in the Roundhill Meme Stock ETF and the announcement of an expanded distribution agreement with Walmart. This significant rally represents a notable reversal for the plant-based meat company, whose shares had recently experienced a sharp decline. The article indicates that a substantial short squeeze contributed to this rapid ascent, forcing many investors who had bet against the stock to purchase shares to cover their positions. Despite this impressive rebound, the stock is still considerably below its peak valuation from its 2019 initial public offering. Some market analysts view this renewed investor enthusiasm for speculative names as a potential sign of an overheated market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has directly addressed what he termed "inaccurate claims" regarding the artificial intelligence startup's policy positions, specifically countering criticisms from venture capitalist David Sacks, who serves as President Donald Trump's AI and crypto czar. Amodei stated that Anthropic shares common objectives with the Trump administration across key areas of AI policy, underscoring the company's dedication to advancing AI technology for the benefit of the American populace and securing the nation's leadership in AI development. The article highlights Sacks' previous accusations that Anthropic was pursuing a "regulatory capture strategy" and pushing "Woke AI" through state-level regulations. Amodei clarified the company's long-standing preference for a consistent federal regulatory framework over a fragmented approach of state laws, reiterating its mission as a public benefit corporation.</p>

          <p>Retirees are increasingly exploring reverse mortgages as a viable option to tap into their home equity without incurring new monthly loan payments, a particularly appealing prospect amid persistent high borrowing costs and rising household expenses. This article details three primary reverse mortgage options available: the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM), which is federally insured by the FHA and provides various flexible payout choices; proprietary reverse mortgages, designed for homeowners with higher-value properties, offering larger loan amounts but lacking the same government protections; and single-purpose reverse mortgages, which are the most affordable and offered by state/local governments or non-profits for specific needs like property taxes or home repairs. The article emphasizes that comprehending the distinct features, benefits, and risks of each type is essential for retirees aiming to leverage their home equity for financial peace of mind.

          <h2>Early Peanut Exposure Guidelines Significantly Reduce Allergy Cases</h2>

          <p>New research published in Pediatrics indicates that reversing long-standing advice against early peanut exposure has prevented at least 40,000 peanut allergy cases in children over the past decade. Previously, parents were advised to avoid peanuts, but a landmark 2015 study found that early introduction significantly reduced allergy risk. Health experts subsequently changed pediatric guidance, leading to a 43% reduction in peanut allergy prevalence and a 36% reduction in any food allergy prevalence among children under three. The article highlights this as a major breakthrough in combating the food allergy epidemic, though some experts caution about data interpretation and family adherence to the new guidelines.</p>
