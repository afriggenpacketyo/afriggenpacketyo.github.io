This change is also evident in Germany's policies towards Ukraine and Israel, where Merz has taken more decisive stances. This new approach could signal a significant shift in German politics.

          <p>Olympic gymnast Simone Biles publicly criticized former competitive swimmer Riley Gaines for her repeated attacks on transgender athletes, labeling Gaines a "sore loser" and "sick" on social media. The exchange stemmed from Gaines' mockery of a high school league for turning off comments on a post celebrating a softball team with a transgender player. Biles defended the transgender community and suggested creating a separate transgender category in all sports. Gaines, who has become a vocal opponent of transgender inclusion in women's sports, responded by reiterating her stance that "men don't belong in women's sports."</p>

          <p>After the removal of four hydroelectric dams, the Klamath River is experiencing a rebirth, marked by the return of natural flows and the renewal of ecosystems. The dam removal, a culmination of decades of advocacy by tribes and environmental groups, has opened up new opportunities for recreation and cultural reconnection. As the river finds its way back to itself, stakeholders are working to balance public access with ecological and cultural preservation. The restoration efforts are also focused on returning ancestral lands to the Shasta Indian Nation, allowing them to reconnect with their heritage.

The company is currently producing beta vehicles at a facility in Michigan, with plans to begin full production at a plant in Indiana by the end of next year. Slate is focusing on a back-to-basics approach, using off-the-shelf parts and a composite body to lower costs and simplify manufacturing. The company has attracted significant interest, with over 100,000 reservations for its unnamed vehicle, which has a targeted starting price of under $20,000.

However, the massive totals hide internal disputes over departmental allocations, with the Home Office reportedly arguing for more cash to meet policing promises. The review prioritizes long-term projects and favored departments like the NHS, potentially leaving other public services feeling the pain.
