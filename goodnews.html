          <p>Delta Air Lines has reinstated its 2025 profit forecast, signaling confidence in a stronger summer travel season than previously anticipated by Wall Street. CEO Ed Bastian stated that although booking levels are lower than at the start of the year, they have stabilized after a recent dip, leading to a more than 12% surge in the airline's stock price. The company now expects full-year adjusted earnings between $5.25 and $6.25 per share. Strong revenue from premium seating and its American Express partnership are offsetting lower overall fares and slightly weaker corporate travel growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Bitcoin achieved a new record high, climbing above $113,000 as investors embraced riskier assets and short sellers were forced to liquidate their positions. The rally was fueled by over $318 million in short liquidations, creating upward price pressure. This surge coincided with a broader positive sentiment in the market, with the Nasdaq also hitting a record and other cryptocurrencies like Ether and Solana seeing gains. The momentum is supported by significant institutional purchases and optimism regarding potential stablecoin legislation from the U.S. Congress, bolstering investor confidence for the second half of the year.

          <p>Varda, a startup focused on manufacturing pharmaceuticals in orbit, has successfully raised $187 million in a Series C funding round. The company aims to leverage the unique microgravity environment of space to crystallize drugs that are difficult to produce on Earth. This new capital will enable Varda to increase its flight frequency and expand its biologics lab to identify more drug molecules suitable for space-based production. Having already completed three launches and with a fourth mission in orbit, Varda is pioneering commercial manufacturing beyond the International Space Station.</p>
