          <h2>FTSE 100 Achieves Record Winning Streak Amid Global Market Turbulence</h2>

          <p>The UK's FTSE 100 index has achieved a record-breaking fifteen-day winning streak, gaining over 5% since the start of the year, even as global markets face turbulence due to U.S. tariff policies. The UK's neutral trade status and robust corporate results, particularly from defensive sectors like healthcare and energy, have attracted investors seeking refuge from volatility. While technical indicators suggest a potential pullback, analysts anticipate further gains, potentially reaching 8,900 points by the end of next month, driven by expectations of interest rate cuts from the Bank of England. However, geopolitical risks and a stronger pound could pose challenges to continued growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>In this article, Jonathan Eig reflects on the relevance of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "Letter From Birmingham Jail" in today's political climate, where cruelty and injustice prevail. Eig argues that King's message of love and nonviolent action provides a roadmap for those who disapprove of current tactics and wish to fight back. King believed in the power of love to overcome cruelty and reform unjust systems, advocating for confrontation while maintaining faith in the goodness of others. The article emphasizes the importance of individual action and the renewal of the democratic contract in the face of division and resentment.</p>

          <p>Mark Carney's Liberal Party has secured enough seats to form a minority government in Canada, falling short of a majority. Key figures such as Conservative leader Pierre Poilievre and NDP leader Jagmeet Singh lost their seats. The Liberals gained 168 seats, needing 172 for a majority, while the Conservatives remain the second-largest party with 144 seats. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois secured 23 seats, and the NDP was reduced to seven. The shift occurred after Justin Trudeau's resignation, Mark Carney's appointment, and tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump.</p>

          <p>Despite widespread criticism of President Trump's first 100 days in office, his core supporters express unwavering faith and enthusiasm for his leadership. At a rally in Michigan, Trump fans praised his economic policies, immigration stance, and commitment to fulfilling campaign promises. Supporters admire Trump's ally Elon Musk and his efforts to streamline government efficiency. Despite concerns about due process and deportations, they overwhelmingly support Trump's approach to border security and immigration, viewing him as a leader who loves America and is working to restore its greatness.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As discussions intensify regarding President Trump's policy agenda, potential changes to the state and local tax (SALT) deduction could benefit higher earners. The $10,000 limit on the federal SALT deduction, enacted in 2017, is set to expire after 2025 unless Congress takes action. Lawmakers from high-tax states are advocating for raising or repealing the cap. While Trump previously enacted the $10,000 SALT cap, he has since expressed support for reform. Experts suggest that a higher SALT deduction limit is possible as part of a broader tax package.</p>
