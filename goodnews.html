          <p>Andrea Kimi Antonelli became the youngest driver to secure a Formula 1 pole position during the sprint race at the Miami Grand Prix, outperforming seasoned drivers like George Russell and Max Verstappen. Antonelli's impressive performance included a significant 0.309-second lead over Russell, despite Russell and Verstappen using two sets of tires. Lewis Hamilton, who previously won a sprint in China, finished seventh, trailing his teammate Charles Leclerc. Alex Albon and Fernando Alonso rounded out the top ten, while Carlos Sainz missed the top ten due to a mistake on his final lap, and Yuki Tsunoda was knocked out in the first session.</p>

          <p>United Airlines is cutting 35 roundtrip flights daily from Newark Liberty International Airport, representing about 10% of its Newark schedule, due to ongoing air traffic controller staffing shortages and FAA technology problems. CEO Scott Kirby stated that 20% of Newark's air traffic controllers had recently stopped working after technology failures, exacerbating existing understaffing issues. The FAA acknowledged staffing delays at Newark, prompting United to request flight restrictions similar to those at LaGuardia and Reagan National. Kirby mentioned speaking with Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy and commended the Trump administration's commitment to upgrading air traffic control infrastructure.</p>

          <p>Former National Security Advisor Mike Waltz was seen using a modified version of the Signal app to communicate with other Trump administration officials, including Vice President JD Vance, prior to his ouster. The app appeared to be a version of Signal with modifications from TeleMessage, a company that adds archiving capabilities, raising concerns about the security of the messages. While the White House stated that Signal is an approved app for government use, the altered PIN verification message suggested the use of TeleMessage, which could potentially undermine Signal's end-to-end encryption. The use of Signal by top Trump officials to discuss military strikes earlier in the year had already triggered controversy.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American consumers are set to experience the direct impact of President Trump's tariff policies as a loophole on small, imported shipments from China closes. The de minimis provision, which allowed shipments under $800 to enter the U.S. duty-free, has been eliminated, potentially raising prices on online retail sites like Shein and Temu. This change is part of Trump's efforts to counter illegal drugs and address unfair trade practices, but it may disproportionately affect college students and others who rely on affordable goods from China. This change is not investment advice.</p>
