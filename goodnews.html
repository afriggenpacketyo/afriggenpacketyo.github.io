          <p>Conservative energy leaders are celebrating President Trump's initiative to reverse Biden-era restrictions on oil and gas development in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum stated that the 2024 BLM rule undermined the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act of 1976. Industry figures like Frank Lasee and Sterling Burnett praised the move for prioritizing energy security and economic growth over climate ideology. Trump vowed to unleash American energy during his campaign, and this action aligns with his broader efforts to roll back Biden's climate policies, though legal challenges from climate activists are anticipated.</p>

          <p>The Trump administration has reversed its decision to revoke the legal status of a four-year-old girl, identified as Sofia, and her family, who came to the US from Mexico in 2023 seeking medical treatment for a rare condition. The federal government had previously ended their humanitarian parole and ordered them to self-deport, prompting warnings from Sofia's doctors that she would likely die if forced to return. The reversal came after a national outcry and significant pressure from Democratic lawmakers, who argued that the family's situation warranted humanitarian aid. The administration restored their legal status, granting them humanitarian parole for one year, allowing Sofia to continue receiving life-saving treatment.</p>

          <p>The UK has been temporarily spared from President Trump's executive order doubling steel and aluminum tariffs from 25% to 50%. The order raises import taxes for US firms buying from other countries, but the levy remains at 25% for the UK. The exemption depends on the UK and US tariff pact signed in May, which would axe steel and aluminum tariffs but has yet to come into force. Trump indicated the US might increase the tariff on the UK "on or after July 9 2025" if it determines the UK has not complied with the Economic Prosperity Deal.</p>
