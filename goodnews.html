          <p>Most Asia-Pacific markets saw gains as investors evaluated the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, though sentiment was tempered by tariff concerns. The uncertainty follows a U.S. federal appeals court ruling that deemed many of President Trump's global tariffs illegal. Japan's Nikkei 225 and South Korea's Kospi both rose, while Australia's S&P/ASX 200 declined, reflecting a cautious but generally positive trading session across the region.

          <p>Labour MP Marie Tidball, who has a congenital disability, is raising awareness about the significant accessibility issues within the historic Houses of Parliament. From difficult-to-use door handles to the long distances between committee rooms and accessible toilets, the building presents numerous barriers for disabled individuals. While a modernization committee is reviewing these issues and some changes have been made, Tidball emphasizes the need for Parliament to better reflect the 22% of the voting-age population with disabilities and become a more inclusive space.</p>

          <p>The Old Faithful Inn, located in Yellowstone National Park, is celebrated as a benchmark of national park architecture and the world's largest log cabin. Built in 1904 using gnarled, twisted wood pieces described as "freaks of the forest," the lodge has hosted presidents and millions of travelers for over a century. Its unique design, which includes features like wiring run through bored-out logs to simulate candlelight, popularized the rustic architectural style that influenced other grand lodges in national parks across the United States.</p>

          <p>Singer-songwriter Tom Odell shared a moving story about how a 2016 concert he considered a personal failure profoundly inspired a young Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell. Finneas later credited that specific show as the reason he wanted to start releasing his own music, a revelation that Odell found deeply touching. The experience served as a powerful lesson for Odell on the unpredictable impact one's art can have, reinforcing that even on difficult days, a performance can resonate in unexpected ways.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A confluence of factors led to Liverpool's record-breaking £415 million summer transfer spending, a stark contrast to previous, more conservative windows. After a successful title-winning season under new manager Arne Slot, the club decided to capitalize on its strong position and a built-up "war chest" from commercial growth and limited prior spending. Key signings like Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak were driven by a desire to evolve the team's style, while the tragic death of Diogo Jota also necessitated reinforcing the team's forward line.</p>

          <p>A comprehensive new study has determined that the famous Petralona cranium, a human fossil discovered in a Greek cave, is at least 286,000 years old. This precise dating, achieved using advanced uranium-series techniques, places the skull firmly in the Middle Pleistocene era and helps resolve decades of conflicting estimates. The finding strengthens the theory that the skull belonged to Homo heidelbergensis, a species that likely coexisted with early Neanderthals, providing a crucial piece of the complex, branching puzzle of European human prehistory.</p>

While visibility is dependent on clear, dark skies away from light pollution, the phenomenon could offer a memorable display for sky-watchers, with the best viewing chances expected on Monday and Tuesday nights.</p>

The 38-year-old has reached the quarter-finals of all four Grand Slams this year but has been visibly hampered by various physical issues, including in his previous major tournaments. While his serving has been excellent, his path to a potential 25th Grand Slam title will depend heavily on whether his aging body can withstand the strain of best-of-five-set matches against top-tier opponents like his next challenger, Taylor Fritz.</p>
