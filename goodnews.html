          <h2>SpaceX Starship Experiences Uncontrolled Reentry After Reaching Space</h2>

          <p>SpaceX's Starship, the largest and most powerful rocket ever built, achieved a significant milestone by reaching space during its ninth test flight, but it ultimately experienced an uncontrolled reentry. The spacecraft successfully lifted off from Starbase, Texas, and surpassed previous flights that ended in explosions. However, a propellant leak during its journey caused it to spin out of control, preventing the collection of crucial heat shield data. Despite the setback, SpaceX considers the flight a valuable learning experience, with Elon Musk planning to accelerate the pace of future tests. The mission also flew a booster that had been used for an earlier test flight, but it was lost as three engines lit up to simulate a landing over the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

The Guardians briefly closed the gap with a three-run homer, but the Dodgers extended their lead with runs in the sixth and eighth innings, capped by Max Muncy's three-run homer in the ninth. Ohtani finished the game with one hit, two RBIs, two walks, and two strikeouts, contributing to the Dodgers' series lead.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Chinese scientists claim to have found a solution to a major challenge facing hyperloop technology: turbulence and vibrations at high speeds. Researchers at China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation (CASIC) found that minor imperfections in the track could cause violent vibrations in maglev cars traveling at 1,000km/h. Through supercomputer simulations and prototype tests, they developed a method to reduce turbulence intensity by nearly half, transforming "extremely severe bumps" to levels deemed "pronounced, but not unpleasant." This advancement could potentially salvage vacuum-tube maglev technology and addresses concerns about ride comfort in high-speed transportation systems.</p>

          <p>SpaceX conducted the ninth test flight of its Starship rocket, which launched successfully from Starbase, Texas, but encountered issues after reaching its suborbital trajectory. An apparent propellant leak led to a loss of attitude control, causing the spacecraft to spin and re-enter Earth's atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner. SpaceX confirmed that the Starship experienced a "rapid unscheduled disassembly" and is expected to have mostly burned up over the Indian Ocean. Despite the failure to complete the mission's objectives, the flight provided valuable data for future improvements, with the company planning to continue its iterative engineering approach.</p>

Kennedy cited a lack of data supporting the need for additional shots in healthy children, though some experts disagree, noting the risk of severe illness and hospitalization in infants.
