        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China is investing heavily in the digitalization of its museums and cultural heritage sites, aiming to engage new generations and enhance its soft power. This initiative involves using advanced technologies like 3D scanning, AI, and VR to bring ancient history to life, exemplified by the digital Tangut princess Yun Zhuo at Dafo Temple. Despite economic challenges, Beijing continues to prioritize cultural initiatives to preserve history, strengthen national pride, and promote technological progress. This push contrasts with Western countries that are cutting funding for cultural heritage and museums, showcasing China's commitment to becoming a cultural superpower.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has indicated that a youth mobility scheme could be included in a new agreement with the EU, allowing young people to work abroad for up to two years. Starmer insists this would not be a return to pre-Brexit freedom of movement, emphasizing that it would be a "reciprocal" arrangement. Conservative Party leader Kemi Badenoch has criticized the potential scheme as "free movement through the back door," but Starmer denies these accusations. An agreement is expected to be announced at a summit in London, though it may only be an agreement in principle.</p>

Nelson, despite a reported cold, delivered a set that included spectral country-jazz renditions of "Angel Flying Too Close to the Ground" and "Always on My Mind." Dylan, influenced by the upcoming biopic "A Complete Unknown," revived "Don‚Äôt Think Twice, It‚Äôs All Right" with a rockabilly twist. The concert also featured performances by Billy Strings and Sierra Hull, adding to the celebration of roots music.</p>

          <p>The Pakistan Air Force reportedly deployed the Chinese-made J-10C fighter jets during an aerial clash with India, marking the first combat success for Chinese aircraft using domestic systems. The J-10C fighter jets, equipped with Chinese PL-15 missiles, allegedly shot down at least two Indian jets, including one French-made Rafale. This event signifies a shift from imitation to innovation in Chinese air power, demonstrating a doctrinal shift toward ecosystem-centric warfare. This approach prioritizes information dominance, situational awareness, and the coordination of multiple assets, mirroring strategies pioneered by the United States.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Home Depot is entering its critical sales period, with the Memorial Day outdoor sales event expected to drive significant revenue. Gardening and outdoor sales are major contributors, accounting for about 13% of Home Depot's total 2024 sales. However, the company faces headwinds from tariff uncertainty and elevated mortgage rates, impacting housing turnover. Analysts predict a challenging first quarter, but they anticipate stronger outdoor sales and a potential recovery in the latter half of the year, coinciding with expected Federal Reserve rate cuts. The article also notes that the tariff impact is a concern, though de-escalation between the U.S. and China could ease those pressures. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Paleontologists have discovered the fossilized remains of Mosura fentoni, a 500-million-year-old, three-eyed predator with a unique mouth and claws. The creature, nicknamed the "sea moth," provides new insights into animal life during the Cambrian period. Researchers found that Mosura's body included 16 segments lined with gills, similar to modern arthropods. The discovery of Mosura helps scientists better understand the diversity of life on Earth even before the Cambrian explosion, when complex life began to take shape.</p>
