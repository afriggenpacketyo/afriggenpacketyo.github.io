          <p>A Treasury Inspector General report reveals that the IRS has lost nearly one-third of its tax auditors due to budget cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency. As of March 2025, the IRS workforce decreased by 11%, including a significant reduction in revenue agents who conduct audits. Treasury Secretary defended the reduced spending, stating that $2 billion was cut from the IT budget without operational disruptions. This report coincides with President Trump's budget request calling for further IRS budget cuts to end what he terms 'weaponization of IRS enforcement'.</p>

          <p>Senator John Fetterman dismissed a New York Magazine article questioning his fitness for office due to health issues as a 'dumb hit piece.' He likened the attacks in the story to being 'in ‚ÄòGoodfellas,' claiming a former staffer Adam Jentleson must hold a 'bizarre grudge' to speak critically of him. The article raised questions about his health regimen, his stance on Israel, and alleged tensions with his wife. Fetterman stated he has moved on and is focused on his work in the Senate, despite the controversy sparked by the report.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A key indicator of used vehicle prices, the Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index, jumped to its highest level since October 2023, increasing by 4.9% year-over-year. This surge is attributed to consumers rushing to purchase used vehicles amid concerns of price increases due to new auto tariffs. While the tariffs don't directly impact used car sales, they affect new vehicle prices, production, and demand, which subsequently influence the used car market. Retail used-vehicle sales have seen a slight decrease compared to March, but are up year-over-year, with average listing prices exceeding $25,000.</p>

          <p>China's central bank and financial regulators have announced a series of policy measures, including interest rate cuts and a reduction in the reserve requirement ratio, to bolster economic growth amid trade tensions. The People's Bank of China will cut the seven-day reverse repurchase rates and lower the reserve requirement ratio by 50 basis points. These measures aim to support financing for key sectors like technology and real estate, but some analysts suggest they may have limited impact on boosting domestic credit demand.
