          <p>The Senate has unanimously passed the IRS MATH Act, which aims to make "math error" notices sent to taxpayers easier to understand. These notices are issued for simple clerical mistakes on tax returns, but critics argue they are often unclear about the error and the 60-day response deadline. The legislation, now awaiting the president's signature, is intended to help taxpayers correct mistakes without needing professional assistance, thereby improving communication and reducing stress for filers.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reversed his plan to send the National Guard to San Francisco, a decision he announced after conversations with tech leaders including Nvidia's Jensen Huang and Salesforce's Marc Benioff. The president stated on social media that he was also influenced by reports of "substantial progress" on crime from the city's mayor, Daniel Lurie. This move is seen as a significant political development, de-escalating a potential federal intervention into the city's local affairs.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that cancer patients receiving an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine around the time they start immunotherapy may experience significantly better survival rates. Researchers found that patients with non-small cell lung cancer and metastatic melanoma who were vaccinated lived nearly twice as long on average compared to those who were not. The effect was particularly pronounced in patients with tumors typically resistant to immunotherapy, prompting plans for a larger clinical trial to confirm these promising findings.</p>

          <p>For individuals facing a substantial $30,000 in credit card debt, paying it off in one year requires an aggressive financial strategy beyond typical monthly payments. This article outlines several approaches, including debt settlement, which involves negotiating a lower payoff amount but can damage one's credit score. Other options include using 0% APR balance transfer cards to eliminate interest, consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan, or, in severe cases, considering bankruptcy for a financial reset.
