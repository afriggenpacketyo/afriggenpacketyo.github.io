          <p>A federal judge has once again denied Donald Trump's motion to dismiss a defamation lawsuit filed against him by the men known as the 'Exonerated Five.' The men, who were wrongfully convicted in the 1989 Central Park jogger case, are suing Trump for statements he made suggesting their guilt long after they were exonerated. The judge rejected Trump's argument, ruling that a Pennsylvania state law designed to protect against strategic lawsuits does not apply in federal court, allowing the case to proceed.</p>

          <p>Gita Deane and Lisa Polyak, a pioneering couple who were lead plaintiffs in a 2004 lawsuit challenging Maryland's ban on same-sex marriage, are reflecting on the 10th anniversary of its nationwide legalization. Although their initial court battle was unsuccessful, they believe their public fight helped educate the public and build momentum for the cause, which culminated in Maryland legalizing marriage equality in 2012. While celebrating the progress, they also express concern over recent legal and political efforts to roll back LGBTQ+ rights across the country.</p>

          <p>A team of engineering students from Johns Hopkins University has invented a specialized printer capable of adding braille to plastic beer labels for a Maryland brewery. The project was a collaboration with the nonprofit Blind Industries & Services of Maryland (BISM), which needed a way to make the labels accessible. The students designed the machine to be easily operated by BISM's low-vision employees and successfully printed 400 labels for a special edition beer that supports an annual fundraiser for visually impaired individuals.</p>

          <p>A new genetic study of skeletons from √áatalh√∂y√ºk, a well-preserved 9,000-year-old city in Turkey, suggests it may have been a matrilineal society where lineage was traced through women. Researchers found that when biological relatives were buried together under houses, the connection was almost always through the female line, indicating that men likely moved to their wives' households upon marriage. This evidence, combined with findings of more elaborate grave goods for females, points to a social structure where women held a central and respected role.</p>

          <p>A call to the California Highway Patrol about a stranded baby tiger on a rural highway led to an unexpected discovery: a dead hawk. A concerned driver reported seeing what they believed to be a tiger cub on the side of Highway 166, prompting an officer to investigate. Instead of a large feline, the officer found the deceased bird of prey. The incident provided a moment of levity and a reminder that private ownership of exotic animals like tigers is illegal in California.</p>
