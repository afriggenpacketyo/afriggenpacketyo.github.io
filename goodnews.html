          <p>Kate Forbes, the Deputy First Minister of Scotland, has announced she will not seek re-election in the 2026 Holyrood election, citing a desire to spend more time with her young family. Forbes, who has served as the MSP for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch since 2016, will continue in her role until the election. She rose quickly through the ranks of the Scottish National Party, becoming the first female finance secretary in 2020 and narrowly losing the 2023 leadership contest. First Minister John Swinney praised her significant contributions to public life and expressed regret over her decision to leave frontline politics.</p>

          <p>A recent survey of 1,000 Americans, prompted by a viral TikTok trend, reveals a deep emotional connection between people and their pets, with 31% saying they would date an AI-human version of their animal companion. The study highlights that many owners, particularly Gen Z, find more reliable emotional support from their pets than from human partners, with 77% stating their pet provides better support than an ex. This bond significantly influences life decisions, as a majority of respondents prioritize their pet's needs in housing, dating, and budgeting. The findings underscore the evolving role of pets as central figures in their owners' lives.</p>

          <p>A pit bull is being hailed as a hero in Pittsburgh after it persistently sought help for its two owners, who had become unresponsive in a tent encampment. The dog approached a local resident, Gary Thynes, at a park and led him across a busy street to the secluded location where it found the man and woman unconscious. Thynes immediately called 911, and the pair were transported to a hospital for emergency care. While the owners recover, Thynes has agreed to foster the dog, praising the animal's intelligence and loyalty for saving their lives in a remarkable display of persistence.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent federal report from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health has revealed a promising decrease in depression and suicidal behaviors among teenagers between 2021 and 2024. The analysis showed that serious suicidal thoughts in adolescents aged 12-17 dropped from nearly 13% to 10%, with a corresponding decline in suicide attempts. Experts suggest this positive trend may be linked to increased openness among teens about their struggles and better access to specialized treatment. However, the report also highlights ongoing challenges, as millions of teens still experience suicidal thoughts and many with depression do not receive care.</p>

          <p>A new book, "Tonight in Jungleland," reveals the intense pressure and creative struggles Bruce Springsteen faced while making his landmark 1975 album, "Born to Run." At risk of being dropped by his label, Springsteen meticulously crafted the album, a process marked by his perfectionism and conflicts with Columbia Records. The book highlights the pivotal role of Jon Landau, who joined as a co-producer and helped streamline the album's sound, notably transforming the song "Wings for Wheels" into the iconic "Thunder Road." Despite the album's eventual success, Springsteen initially disliked the final product, famously throwing a test pressing into a hotel pool.</p>

          <p>Construction on the new $9.5 billion Terminal 1 at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport is advancing, with the first phase scheduled to open in mid-2026. The terminal, which will be JFK's largest and dedicated solely to international flights, is now weather-tight, and key infrastructure like baggage systems is being installed. As part of a larger $19 billion overhaul of the airport, the new facility is designed to be flooded with natural light and will feature a modern, efficient layout.

          <p>In a significant move to bolster maritime cooperation, India and the Philippines have conducted their first joint naval exercises in the disputed South China Sea. The two-day patrol, involving vessels from both navies, took place as Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos departed for a state visit to India. The exercises are likely to be viewed as a challenge by China, which claims nearly the entirety of the sea and has had numerous confrontations with the Philippines. A Filipino military official confirmed they were shadowed by Chinese vessels during the patrol but reported no untoward incidents.</p>

          <p>Beyond its homegrown C919 airliner, China is making significant advancements in developing its domestic aviation supply chain to reduce reliance on foreign technology. A key project is the CJ-1000A jet engine, which is reportedly progressing on schedule and aims to match the performance of the current foreign-made engines used on the C919. This effort is part of a broader national strategy to close technological gaps and establish China as a self-sufficient, major player in all aspects of the global civil aviation industry. A successful rollout of the domestic engine would mark a major milestone in this campaign for aviation independence.</p>

          <p>The public library in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has created a massively popular "Summer Game" that engages thousands of residents, more than half of whom are adults. Originally a simple reading challenge, the library transformed it into a library-using game inspired by corporate loyalty programs, where players earn points by solving puzzles, exploring local history, and discovering the library's diverse offerings. With 16,000 active players in a city of 150,000, the game has been a huge success, raising awareness of library services beyond books and fostering a strong sense of community. The library has made the game's code open-access for other institutions to use.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Despite the multi-billion dollar market for sports drinks and electrolyte powders, medical experts and sports scientists assert that most people do not need them for daily hydration. While electrolytes like sodium and potassium are lost in sweat, a balanced diet typically provides more than enough to replenish them, and the body, particularly the kidneys, is adept at regulating its own levels. For the average person, drinking plain water and eating fruits and vegetables is sufficient. These products are primarily useful for elite athletes, those sweating heavily for over an hour, or in cases of severe medical dehydration.</p>

          <p>The appearance of senior Communist Party official Cai Qi at a meeting with technology experts in the seaside resort of Beidaihe signals the beginning of the Chinese leadership's annual summer retreat. During this unofficial break, which typically lasts around two weeks in August, top political leaders reduce their public appearances while discussing important state matters away from Beijing. The city of Beidaihe has implemented heightened security measures, including a ban on drones and other low-altitude aircraft for July and August. The gathering provides a rare glimpse into the informal workings of China's opaque political system.</p>
