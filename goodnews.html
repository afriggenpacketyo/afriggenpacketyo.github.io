          <p>New York lawmakers ratified a $254 billion state budget that includes benefits for themselves and residents. The budget delays enforcement of an outside income cap for legislators and alters the state's campaign finance matching system. It also includes an inflation rebate for New Yorkers, raises the per-day pay rate for jurors, and provides assistance for online shoppers. Furthermore, the budget addresses staffing shortages in corrections by allowing younger people to become officers and raising the maximum age for State Police recruits, while also cracking down on artificial intelligence.</p>

This initiative contrasts with the administration's ban on most other refugees from entering the U.S. The processing of Afrikaners granted refugee status has been unusually fast, and resettlement officials have been instructed to use Department of Health and Human Services funds to aid them.</p>

Cork camogie player Ashling Thompson said her team would wear shorts in the Munster final and refuse to change. The Camogie Association has called a Special Congress for May 22 to vote on the issue.</p>
