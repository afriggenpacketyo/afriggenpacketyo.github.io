          <p>Zimbabwe has been chosen as one of ten countries globally to roll out Lenacapavir, the world's first twice-yearly injectable HIV prophylactic, a development hailed as a major breakthrough. With 1.3 million people living with HIV, Zimbabwe has a robust HIV response infrastructure and recently met UNAIDS' 95-95-95 targets. Experts like Dr. Ponesai Nyika emphasize the drug's over 99% efficacy in trials for preventing infections, particularly due to its infrequent administration, which is expected to improve adherence. While excitement is high, concerns about cost, safety, and accessibility persist, though efforts are underway to make it widely available.</p>

          <p>Jennifer Lopez confessed on "The Howard Stern Show" that turning down the lead role in the 2002 film "Unfaithful" remains a decision that "haunts" her. She initially found the script unappealing, but director Adrian Lyne's execution led to Diane Lane receiving an Oscar nomination for the part. Lopez expressed bewilderment over her reasoning at the time, acknowledging the significant missed opportunity. In a lighter segment on "Watch What Happens Live," she also disclosed that her favorite on-screen kiss was with Brett Goldstein in their upcoming film, "Office Romance," amidst a list of esteemed co-stars.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The global shipping industry, a major contributor to carbon emissions, is reconsidering nuclear power as a solution to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Although early nuclear merchant ships like the NS Savannah faced commercial and safety hurdles, new "Generation IV" reactor designs are being developed, promising inherent safety and greater efficiency. Proponents emphasize the environmental benefit of zero emissions and the operational advantage of extended range without refueling, with some estimates suggesting significant fuel cost savings. However, substantial obstacles persist, including the need for updated international regulations, waste management solutions, and overcoming historical safety perceptions before widespread adoption.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's largest advanced chip manufacturer, reported a robust third quarter with a 39% profit increase and raised its 2025 revenue growth forecast. This strong performance, driven by strengthening "AI mega trend" conviction, bodes well for CNBC Investing Club portfolio chip stocks Nvidia and Broadcom, as TSMC is a primary producer of their chips. The positive report shifts Wall Street's focus from escalating U.S.-China trade tensions, including President Trump's threats of tariffs over rare earth restrictions. Other portfolio gainers included Starbucks and Salesforce, indicating broader market strength. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Captain Alyssa Healy scored her second consecutive century, leading Australia to a dominant 10-wicket victory over Bangladesh and securing their place in the Women's World Cup semi-finals. Healy's unbeaten 113, combined with Phoebe Litchfield's 84, formed a formidable 202-run opening partnership, allowing the defending champions to chase down their target of 199 inside 25 overs. This exceptional performance, building on Healy's earlier 142 against India, demonstrated Australia's powerful batting. Despite Sobhana Mostary's efforts for Bangladesh, their total of 198-9 was ultimately insufficient against the top-tier Australian side.</p>

Both comets, believed to originate from the outer reaches of our solar system, are making their closest approaches to Earth this week. Comet Lemmon is due around Tuesday, while Comet SWAN's flyby on Monday will see it gradually dim. It is a rare occurrence to spot two comets simultaneously without specialized equipment. Their distinctive green hue is caused by gases emanating from their surfaces, appearing as fuzzy patches near the northern and southwestern horizons after sunset.</p>

Physically, she showed improved robustness, though her back remains a concern. Raducanu and coach Francisco Roig plan a pre-season training block, aiming to enhance her serve and post-serve game. She is expected to finish as British number one, positioning her for the 2026 Australian Open seeding.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Many seniors opt for Medigap over Medicare Advantage plans, despite Medicare Advantage's lower premiums and bundled perks, due to several key advantages. Medigap, which supplements Original Medicare, offers broader access to any doctor or specialist accepting Medicare nationwide, without restrictive networks or referral requirements. It also provides more predictable out-of-pocket costs, covering deductibles and copayments, which is crucial for managing chronic conditions. Furthermore, Medigap plans offer stable benefits year after year, unlike Medicare Advantage plans which can change annually. The choice depends on individual health needs, financial situation, and lifestyle preferences. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Tobacco consumption in Southeast Asia has seen a dramatic per capita decline over the past two decades, with smoking prevalence dropping from 54% to 23% between 2000 and 2020, attributed to robust public health policies. These measures include increased taxation, plain packaging, advertising bans, and public smoking restrictions. However, the region faces ongoing challenges, notably the rise of e-cigarettes, which are increasingly popular among adolescents. While some countries have banned vaping, others encounter political resistance to regulation. Additionally, inconsistencies in WHO's regional definitions complicate data comparison, and the absolute number of smokers has risen due to population growth.</p>
