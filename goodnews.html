        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Following their victory in the Euro 2025 final, England's Under-21 football team has drawn attention to the potential of its young stars. The article analyzes which players, such as Tino Livramento and Harvey Elliott, might transition to the senior squad for the upcoming World Cup. It contrasts this potential with historical trends, noting that many past U21 champions did not go on to have significant senior careers. The piece reflects on the Football Association's development strategy since 2012, which has yielded consistent success at youth levels, building an expectation of winning for England's emerging talent.</p>

          <p>In their first interview since being released from federal prison, Todd and Julie Chrisley discussed their experiences and the presidential pardon they received from Donald Trump. The couple, convicted of bank fraud and tax evasion, described harsh prison conditions, including mold and asbestos, which they claim led to health issues. Their daughter, Savannah, campaigned for their release and became the guardian of her younger siblings. The Chrisleys defended their pardon against criticism and announced plans for a new television show, stating they are now focused on advocating for prison reform.</p>

          <p>A century after a devastating earthquake ruined downtown Santa Barbara, experts say the event holds crucial lessons for California's readiness for the next "Big One." The 1925 quake highlighted the extreme vulnerability of unreinforced brick buildings, a danger that took decades for many cities to address through mandatory retrofitting laws. The article notes that significant structural risks, such as soft-story apartment buildings, remain unaddressed in Santa Barbara and other areas. The event also shaped the city's distinctive Spanish Colonial Revival architecture, as officials mandated the style during the rebuilding effort, fundamentally changing its appearance while displacing its historic Chinatown.</p>

          <p>Financial education startups like Dow Janes are seeing a surge in popularity among Gen Z and millennial women who are seeking to improve their financial literacy. The trend is driven by a desire for guidance amid economic volatility and a historical gap in financial education for women. These social media-savvy platforms use accessible content to teach concepts from budgeting to investing, aiming to empower women to build wealth. While these "finfluencers" are making financial topics less intimidating, their rise also prompts regulatory questions, as they are not held to the same standards as certified financial planners.

          <p>Recent U.S. and Israeli military strikes against Iran have exposed potential weaknesses in the supposed alliance between Iran, China, and Russia. Despite shared anti-American sentiment, the reactions from Beijing and Moscow to the attacks were surprisingly muted, focusing on de-escalation rather than strong condemnation or material support for Iran. The article argues that when global stability is at risk, China prioritizes its economic and diplomatic ties with the West over its partnership with Iran. This cautious approach suggests the "no limits" partnership between China and Russia may also be less robust than advertised, revealing the pragmatic limits of alliances built solely on opposition to the U.S.</p>

          <p>B√§rbel Bas has been elected as the new co-leader of Germany's center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), bringing what some hope is a new direction for the ailing party. Coming from a working-class background in Duisburg, Bas's career represents a story of upward mobility through vocational training and continued education. As a member of the SPD's left wing, she is expected to provide a counterbalance to her reelected co-chair, Lars Klingbeil. In her new dual role as party co-leader and Germany's labor minister, Bas faces the significant challenges of reforming unemployment benefits and the pension system.</p>

          <p>British and Irish Lions winger James Lowe humorously dismissed attempts by a stadium announcer in Perth to troll players born in the southern hemisphere. Before the match against Western Force, the announcer pointedly identified Lowe as a "Kiwi now Irishman," along with other players of Australian and South African origin. The issue of player ancestry has been a talking point, fueled by comments from Australia's coach. Lowe, who previously played for the Maori All Blacks against the Lions, took the jibe in stride, joking that he hopes the gag continues if it leads to more victories.</p>

Senior editors must approve any use of anonymity after vetting the source's credibility and the importance of their information. When an unnamed source is used, NPR commits to explaining the reason for the anonymity to its audience as transparently as possible without revealing the source's identity, and never uses pseudonyms.</p>

          <p>Influencer-turned-boxer Jake Paul defeated former world champion Julio C√©sar Ch√°vez Jr. by a unanimous decision in a cruiserweight bout in California. Paul controlled the fight from the outset, as Ch√°vez Jr. appeared hesitant and threw very few punches for most of the contest, frustrating his legendary father at ringside. Despite being booed by the crowd, Paul showcased an improved jab and work-rate against the aging and unmotivated Ch√°vez. After the victory, Paul called out current champions, signaling his ambition to pursue a title shot in the sport.</p>

          <p>The French government has led a major investment in satellite operator Eutelsat, aiming to build a European alternative to Elon Musk's Starlink. The move is part of Europe's push for technological sovereignty in the space sector, where it lags behind the U.S. However, experts are skeptical about Eutelsat's ability to compete directly with Starlink's massive satellite constellation and launch capabilities. Eutelsat's OneWeb arm has far fewer satellites and will need significant further investment to scale up. Analysts believe Eutelsat is better positioned to serve specialized government and enterprise markets that prioritize sovereignty over raw capacity. (not investment advice)</p>
