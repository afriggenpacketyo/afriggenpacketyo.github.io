          <p>Margot Friedl√§nder, a German-born Holocaust survivor and activist, has died at the age of 103. Friedl√§nder survived the Theresienstadt concentration camp and emigrated to the United States before returning to Germany in 2010, and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier expressed condolences, noting Friedl√§nder's contribution to reconciliation. After returning to Germany, she dedicated herself to speaking at schools and sharing her experiences with young people, and she discussed the complex emotions she felt toward Berliners of her generation, who had supported the Nazi regime. Friedl√§nder emphasized the importance of remembering the past and acting according to one's conscience.</p>

          <p>Mexico is pursuing legal action against Google for its decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico as the Gulf of America for U.S. users on Google Maps. President Claudia Sheinbaum argues that this change disregards Mexico's repeated requests and violates international norms. The Mexican government contends that a U.S. executive order does not grant the U.S. authority to rename the entire gulf, but Google maintains that it is following a longstanding practice of reflecting name changes updated by official government sources. This dispute reflects broader tensions over geographical naming conventions and national sovereignty.</p>

          <p>A lawsuit has been filed to reverse the designation of the 624,000-acre Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California, arguing that President Biden exceeded his authority under the Antiquities Act. The plaintiffs, represented by a conservative think tank, claim the monument designation infringes on mining claims and recreational access, and supporters of the monument argue that it protects sacred tribal lands, wildlife habitat, and military sites. The Interior Department has not yet responded to the suit, but the case raises questions about the scope of presidential power in designating national monuments and could potentially reach the Supreme Court.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has ordered the immediate release of Rumeysa Ozturk, a Tufts doctoral candidate, on bail as she challenges her detention following the Trump administration's revocation of her student visa. The judge cited concerns that her First Amendment and due process rights were violated, stating that her detention cannot stand, and the Trump administration has said the justification for revoking Ozturk's visa rested on an opinion piece she co-authored about Israel's war with Hamas. Tufts University has defended Ozturk, and her lawyers have argued that she faces significant health risks if she remains in detention.</p>

          <p>As Americans worry about maintaining their standard of living due to renewed cost concerns after President Trump implemented his tariff agenda, many are considering cutting back on non-essential spending. A study found that 83% of consumers would strongly consider this if their financial situation worsens, and money-saving trends like "no buy," "low buy," and "slow buy" are gaining popularity on TikTok. While these trends can provide a short-term boost to savings, financial experts emphasize the importance of practicing good long-term habits, and a separate report found that 43% of adults said money negatively affects their mental health.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of three color additives from natural sources for manufacturers to safely use in food, including Galdieria extract blue, Butterfly pea flower extract, and Calcium phosphate. The move comes amid growing concerns about the health effects of food dyes, which has led to action at state and national levels, and HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. has called on companies to phase out all petroleum-based dyes by the end of next year. The FDA has stopped short of an outright ban, but will accelerate the review and approval of some new natural color additives.</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) reported strong April sales, suggesting that the AI infrastructure ramp remains robust. The company's sales were up 22.2% month-over-month and 48.1% year-over-year, and TSMC is Nvidia's primary chip supplier, so an increase in its sales is generally seen as a positive indicator for Nvidia as well. Nvidia plans to release a downgraded version of its H20 AI chips for China in the next two months to comply with U.S. export restrictions, but it remains unclear how these chips will compete with local alternatives.</p>

The film is a true Looney Tune with a shocking amount of digital blood, but the film almost entirely squanders whatever appeal it may have churned up, except it all happens so fast.</p>
