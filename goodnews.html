The parade will showcase advanced combat capabilities, including unmanned intelligent systems, underwater combat units, cyber and electronic forces, and hypersonic weapons. Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to attend the event, which is part of a series of ceremonies marking the war anniversary. China will also hold ceremonies on July 7 to commemorate the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and on December 13 to mourn victims of the Nanjing massacre.

          <p>Oil prices experienced a decline as an Iran-Israel ceasefire eased concerns regarding supply disruptions in the Middle East. The Ice Brent contract decreased by 2.41% to $69.76 per barrel, while the front-month August Nymex WTI contract fell by 2.42% to $66.85 per barrel. The potential closure of the Strait of Hormuz, a vital route for oil shipments, remains a risk, though analysts suggest oil prices could surge past $100 per barrel in such a scenario. The International Energy Agency has reassured markets that it possesses 1.2 billion barrels of emergency stockpiles to mitigate supply disruptions, and OPEC+ producers have been increasing output.

          <p>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced a ceasefire agreement with Iran, potentially halting recent aerial attacks that have heightened regional instability. An Iranian diplomatic source also confirmed the agreement, with Qatar, Russia, and Turkey mediating the deal. The ceasefire followed confusion after U.S. President Donald Trump claimed a "complete and total" cessation of hostilities. The conflict began after Israel attacked Iran on June 13, leading to retaliatory missile strikes by Tehran, which resulted in casualties on both sides; Trump also announced that U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear facilities had "completely and totally obliterated" them. </p>

          <p>As global temperatures rise and heatwaves worsen, cities are appointing "heat officers" to build resilience through urban greening and cool zone creation. These officers analyze local conditions, develop plans, and implement protective measures, including heat-repellent sidewalks and roofs. The Atlantic Council initiated the concept in 2021, recognizing the impact of extreme heat on billions by 2050. Cities are incorporating heat resilience into planning for streets, squares, and buildings, with some countries passing laws mandating the appointment of heat officers. </p>

          <p>The NATO summit in The Hague has set ambitious goals that place heavy demands on Germany's military, the Bundeswehr. The alliance plans for member states to spend 5% of their economic output on defense by 2035, a significant increase from the current 2%. This move requires Germany to provide substantial financial resources to strengthen its armed forces, with discussions ongoing regarding the feasibility and implications of such high spending. In addition to financial commitments, NATO seeks to increase troop numbers in Europe, posing recruitment challenges for the German army. </p>

Approximately 60 scouts, ranging from elementary to middle school age, participated in plucking the plums. The plums, once pickled and dried, are used to make tea that is consumed on New Year's Day for good health and to ward off illness. The shrine has about 1,500 plum trees, and the scouts hand-picked plums that were between three and four centimeters in diameter. </p>

The market is potentially getting jaded at Trump policy changes, with each successive change resulting in less significant market movement.

          <p>Western airlines face greater disruption than their Chinese counterparts due to the escalating conflict between Iran and Israel, which forces most carriers to avoid dangerous airspace on China-Europe routes. Western firms are barred from Russian airspace, while Chinese companies can still use it, giving them a competitive advantage. Flight diversions and cancellations increased after Tehran‚Äôs missile assault on an American military base in Qatar. Both Western and Chinese carriers have avoided Iranian skies due to concerns that aircraft could be misidentified by air defense systems. </p>
