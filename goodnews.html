          <p>Artificial intelligence is being used to decipher carbonized papyrus scrolls from an ancient library buried during the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in A.D. 79. Computer scientist Brent Seales is using a particle accelerator to produce light 10 billion times brighter than the sun, much like an X-ray, to identify ink within the scrolls. A global competition, the Vesuvius Challenge, offered $700,000 in prize money, and three college students made history by extracting words from a 2,000-year-old scroll. Seales believes more scrolls could be discovered as archaeologists continue to excavate the Villa of the Papyri.</p>

          <p>A group of 40 former presidents and prime ministers warned of a looming crisis of inequality, potentially leading to the emergence of the first trillionaires while nearly half of humanity remains in poverty. They issued a joint appeal for a "new economic coalition of the willing" to address inequality, poverty, and environmental breakdown. The leaders condemned "narrow unilateralism" and urged comprehensive debt relief, international tax cooperation, and reform of institutions like the IMF. Despite the grim assessment, they expressed optimism that a "powerful shift is possible" and advocated for a coalition founded upon values of solidarity and sovereignty.</p>

The vote is one order of business for the panel, which is set to consider thimerosal in influenza vaccines. In the 2024-2025 respiratory disease season, 57% of infants were either born to a vaccinated mother or received monoclonal antibodies at birth, resulting in hospitalizations from RSV being reduced by 30%-40%, according to CDC data.</p>

          <p>A majority (86%) of CFOs surveyed by CNBC expect President Trump's 'One Big Beautiful Bill' to pass, despite potential changes and concerns about the deficit. The CFOs anticipate the corporate tax breaks from Trump's 2017 tax act will remain in place, providing certainty for businesses. Most CFOs (64%) believe tariffs will negatively impact the economy, and policy uncertainty is affecting business decisions. The survey also indicates expectations for elevated bond yields and concerns about inflation.</p>
