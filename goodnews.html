          <p>Slovenian cyclist Tadej Pogačar has won his fourth Tour de France title, solidifying his place among the sport's legends. Despite having the overall victory virtually guaranteed, Pogačar characteristically launched an attack on the final stage in Paris, even amid treacherous rainy conditions. Although he didn't win the stage itself, his aggressive style was a hallmark of his dominant performance throughout the three-week race. Pogačar finished more than four minutes ahead of his main rival, Jonas Vingegaard, capping a season where he also became the first rider since 1998 to win both the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France.

          <p>Japanese baseball icon Ichiro Suzuki, alongside dominant pitcher CC Sabathia and closer Billy Wagner, were officially inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. Suzuki, the first Japanese player to be enshrined, fell just one vote short of a unanimous selection, a fact he humorously referenced in his speech. The ceremony celebrated the careers of these influential players, with Sabathia reflecting on his journey to becoming a New York Yankee and Wagner expressing gratitude for his election on his final ballot. The induction coincided with a new Hall of Fame exhibit celebrating the deep connection between Japanese and American baseball.</p>

          <h2>Caribbean Nations See Surge in Demand for Citizenship-by-Investment Programs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-27 19:46:06 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Several Eastern Caribbean island nations are experiencing a significant increase in applications for their citizenship-by-investment programs, largely driven by wealthy Americans seeking a "plan B" amid domestic political and social volatility. Countries like Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, and Dominica offer a passport, and the associated visa-free travel, in exchange for real estate purchases or donations starting around $200,000. While these programs are a crucial source of revenue for the small island economies, they face scrutiny from the EU and US over concerns about security and financial crime, prompting the nations to bolster their oversight and due diligence processes.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have reached a significant trade deal, averting a potential trade war. The agreement establishes a 15% baseline tariff on most EU exports to the US, a rate higher than pre-Trump levels but lower than the threatened 30%. As part of the deal, the EU has committed to purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars in US energy products and investing heavily in the American economy. While European leaders expressed relief at the newfound stability, some details, particularly concerning pharmaceuticals and steel tariffs, remained points of discussion. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice has successfully shut down four major dark web sites dedicated to the trade of child sexual abuse material, leading to the conviction of at least 18 individuals.

One of the main administrators, an Alabama man known as "Boss," was sentenced to life in prison.

          <p>McLaren's Oscar Piastri claimed victory at the Belgian Grand Prix, skillfully managing his race to finish ahead of teammate Lando Norris in a tense battle. Piastri took the lead from Norris on the first lap, using the slipstream to his advantage, a move that proved decisive. The race then became a strategic contest of tire management, with Piastri holding off a charging Norris, who was on more durable hard-compound tires. While Norris showed superior pace at times, a few minor errors and the difficulty of overtaking at the Spa-Francorchamps circuit meant he couldn't close the final gap, highlighting the fine margins in the intra-team rivalry.</p>

Wallace skillfully held off a hard-charging Kyle Larson in the final laps, a challenge made more intense by concerns his car was low on fuel.

She contrasts that with the current decline in expertise, which she sees as a significant issue.

The deal, brokered personally by the leaders, highlights President Trump's strategy of renegotiating global trade relationships.
