          <p>A bull moose was successfully rescued after falling into a 9-foot-deep abandoned well on private property in Pembroke, Maine. The landowner discovered the animal with only its antlers visible and immediately alerted wildlife authorities. A team from the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries & Wildlife sedated the moose, used straps and an excavator to carefully lift it out, and confirmed it ran off unharmed after the sedative wore off, concluding a five-hour operation.</p>

          <p>England has announced its squad for the 2025 Ashes tour in Australia, featuring a formidable pace attack with bowlers like Mark Wood, Jofra Archer, and Ben Stokes. The article suggests this is England's most aggressive group of fast bowlers since the victorious 1970-71 tour, signaling a clear strategy to counter Australia's traditional strengths on home soil. Key challenges remain, including the fitness of captain Ben Stokes, but the selection reflects a plan to fight fire with fire.</p>

          <p>MLB's competition committee has officially approved the use of an Automated Ball/Strike (ABS) system, often called "robot umpires," for the 2026 season. The system will function as a challenge mechanism, with human umpires still calling balls and strikes but allowing teams two challenges per game, with an extra one in extra innings. This move, which follows extensive testing in the minor leagues, aims to improve accuracy and is expected to reduce on-field arguments over calls.</p>

          <p>This article details the "Medigap birthday rule," a provision available in about 18 states that allows Medicare beneficiaries to switch their supplemental insurance plans around their birthday without medical underwriting. This rule provides a crucial annual opportunity for seniors to change to a potentially more affordable or suitable plan with equal or lesser benefits, even if they have developed pre-existing conditions. Understanding this state-specific rule can lead to significant financial savings.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve recently cutting interest rates, the cost of borrowing through a Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) has become slightly more affordable. For a $60,000 HELOC at the current average rate of 8.05%, monthly payments would be approximately $730 for a 10-year term or $575 for a 15-year term. The article suggests that with potential for further rate cuts, the variable-rate nature of a HELOC could offer additional savings for homeowners. (not investment advice)</p>
