This pattern is atypical for early September, which is usually one of the warmer periods of the year for the region, though a brief warm-up may occur over the weekend.</p>

          <h2>New Research Explores Using Plants to Detect and Remove 'Forever Chemicals' from Soil</h2>

          <p>Scientists are developing an innovative method to combat soil contamination from PFAS, also known as "forever chemicals," by using plants. Early findings suggest that hemp can effectively draw these toxic substances out of the ground. The research also includes creating a cost-effective microbial biosensor that glows in the presence of PFAS, which could lead to engineering sentinel plants that visually indicate contamination. The long-term goal is to create a biological system that can not only absorb but also destroy the harmful chemicals.</p>
