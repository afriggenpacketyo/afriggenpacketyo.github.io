          <p>Recovery efforts are ongoing across the UK after Storm Floris caused significant travel disruption and power outages. Scottish and Southern Electricity Networks (SSEN) is working to restore power to approximately 50,000 homes, describing the event as the most damaging summer storm in recent memory. Network Rail reported 119 incidents on train lines in Scotland, with teams working to clear debris and fallen trees. While some disruption is expected to continue, emergency meetings have been held and support, including free hot food, is being provided to affected communities.</p>

          <p>As the new Fantasy Premier League season approaches, several FPL experts have shared their top strategies for managers aiming for a high rank. Key advice includes planning transfers in blocks of fixtures, balancing premium players across positions, and quickly rectifying mistakes. Experts also recommend saving free transfers to allow for significant team changes without point deductions and watching full matches to gain context beyond statistics. The guidance emphasizes a long-term, strategic approach over reactive, week-to-week decisions to navigate the increasingly competitive fantasy game.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As England looks ahead to the Ashes series in Australia, their chances of success are seen as heavily dependent on the fitness and performance of captain Ben Stokes. The team has a poor recent record in Australia, having not won a Test there in 14 years, and Stokes is central to reversing this trend with his all-around contributions and leadership. The article highlights that much of the current squad lacks experience playing in Australia, making Stokes's presence even more critical. A potential victory down under is framed as what would be his greatest achievement, given the historical challenges and his own recent injury struggles.</p>

          <p>Thirty years after Croatia's Operation Storm, which ended its war of independence, the event is remembered with starkly different perspectives in Croatia and Serbia. In Croatia, it is celebrated as a heroic military victory that reclaimed occupied territory and is marked with a national holiday and military parades. Conversely, Serbia views it as a tragic pogrom that led to the mass expulsion of approximately 200,000 ethnic Serbs and numerous unprosecuted war crimes. The divergent narratives highlight the deep-seated historical grievances that continue to define relations between the two nations three decades after the conflict.</p>

          <p>Representatives from over 170 nations are meeting in Geneva for a UN conference to negotiate a legally binding global treaty aimed at addressing the plastic pollution crisis. With plastic production soaring and an estimated 200 trillion pieces floating in the oceans, the talks aim to establish targets for cutting single-use plastics and banning harmful chemicals. A key point of contention is between countries advocating for production limits and oil-producing nations that favor focusing on recycling. The negotiations follow a two-year period where no agreement was reached, increasing pressure for a decisive international accord.</p>

          <p>U.S. border agents have reportedly been directed to cease deportations carried out under President Trump's recent asylum ban. This instruction follows a federal appeals court ruling that partially limited the ban, stating it could not be used to completely suspend humanitarian protections for asylum seekers. According to Department of Homeland Security officials, Customs and Border Protection was told to stop enforcing the ban and instead process migrants under existing U.S. immigration law. The original ban, which was challenged by the ACLU, had set aside established legal processes for seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border.</p>

          <p>United Parcel Service (UPS) will pay $1.7 million to settle a lawsuit from 45 California counties alleging the company improperly disposed of hazardous waste. The lawsuit claimed that UPS sent corrosive, ignitable, and toxic materials from 140 of its locations to local landfills not equipped to handle such waste. According to the Riverside County District Attorney's office, UPS was cooperative during the investigation and has already implemented new waste management systems and employee training programs across its California facilities. The settlement includes civil penalties, cost reimbursement, and funding for environmental projects.</p>

          <h2>Officials Warn of Tarantula Sightings as Mating Season Begins in California</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 21:29:42 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wildlife experts are advising California residents that tarantula sightings will become more common as the spiders' mating season begins, lasting from August through December. During this period, male tarantulas leave their burrows in search of mates, often traveling long distances and becoming more visible, especially at dusk. While their appearance can be startling, officials note that native tarantulas are generally harmless to humans and reluctant to bite unless provoked. Common sighting locations include Joshua Tree National Park, the Santa Monica Mountains, and various state parks in the Southern California region.</p>

          <p>Researchers have discovered the remains of an auroch, an extinct species of large wild cattle, in a cave near Ingleborough in the Yorkshire Dales. The discovery, part of the Ingleborough Cave Archaeology Project, sheds new light on the area's prehistoric life during the Bronze Age. The team, working with local cavers, also found evidence of the cave system being used for human burials during the Neolithic period. This project, funded by the National Lottery Heritage Fund, highlights the crucial role of experienced cavers in uncovering archaeological finds in inaccessible underground locations.</p>

          <p>A hiker was rescued by helicopter after falling 25 feet from a waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains and landing in a rocky pool below. The man's screams for help were heard, leading to a 911 call and a rapid response from the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department. A specialized rescue helicopter hoisted the injured hiker to safety from the base of Big Falls, a notoriously dangerous spot where several accidents have occurred.

          <h2>Increased Screenings Credited for Rise in Early-Stage Colon Cancer Diagnoses in 45-49 Age Group</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-04 20:21:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates that increased screening for colorectal cancer among people aged 45-49 is leading to more early-stage diagnoses. Following recommendations to lower the screening age to 45, screening rates in this demographic rose 62% from 2019 to 2023. This correlated with a sharp rise in the detection of localized, earlier-stage cancers, which are more treatable. While researchers called the findings promising, they noted that screening rates among younger adults remain suboptimal and that significant disparities exist based on education and insurance status.</p>
