          <p>Defending champion and world number one Jannik Sinner secured his spot in the US Open third round by defeating Alexei Popyrin in straight sets, 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. Sinner, 24, continued his dominant hard-court Grand Slam form, extending his winning streak to 23 matches across the US Open and Australian Open, and having won Wimbledon in July. Despite a lower first-serve percentage, the Italian's strong returning and crucial break point saves demonstrated his ruthlessness. He is now set to face Canada's Denis Shapovalov in the next round, aiming to further his impressive year.</p>

          <p>Intel's CFO, David Zinser, announced the semiconductor giant received $5.7 billion from the U.S. government, part of a deal where the White House will take a 10% stake in the company. This investment aims to fund growth in Intel's foundry unit, which manufactures chips for other firms, with Zinser signaling potential for outside investors in this business. The deal, still being finalized by the Department of Commerce, has prompted warnings from Intel about possible "adverse reactions" from investors and increased scrutiny. This initiative underscores government efforts to bolster domestic semiconductor manufacturing. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Newcastle United is reportedly close to signing Stuttgart striker Nick Woltemade, a move that could significantly influence Liverpool's pursuit of Alexander Isak. The 23-year-old Germany international is expected to undergo a medical, with the fee potentially setting a new club record. Woltemade, described as a "two-metre Messi-Musiala" for his unique blend of size and technical skill, scored 17 goals last season and was top scorer at the Under-21 Euros. His arrival could provide Newcastle with the depth needed to consider Isak's departure, a player Liverpool has actively pursued.</p>

However, concerns persist regarding the Trump administration's block on H20 chip sales to China and the finalization of a deal allowing sales with a government stake. CEO Jensen Huang remains optimistic about the $50 billion Chinese market and projected $3 trillion to $4 trillion in AI infrastructure spend by decade's end, emphasizing the early stages of the AI revolution.

Pure began recognizing revenue from Meta deployments in Q2 and is increasingly confident about exceeding initial exabyte deployment targets. CEO Charles Giancarlo highlighted the company's efficient management of space, power, and cooling as a key advantage, attracting interest from other hyperscalers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Home equity loan interest rates have reached their lowest point in 2025, averaging 8.22%, making them a more attractive borrowing option. This decline comes as home equity levels hit a record high, providing homeowners with substantial funds to tap into. Home equity loans offer fixed rates, protecting borrowers from market fluctuations, unlike variable-rate HELOCs. Additionally, funds used for eligible home repairs or renovations may qualify for tax deductions, further enhancing their appeal. While using one's home as collateral carries risks, the current low rates and other benefits make these loans a compelling choice for many seeking financing. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Reverse mortgages generally do not directly impact Social Security retirement benefits or Medicare eligibility, offering a financial tool for seniors without jeopardizing these vital lifelines. Social Security payments are based on earnings history, not assets, and Medicare is not means-tested. However, seniors should be aware that large lump-sum withdrawals could affect eligibility for need-based programs like Supplemental Security Income (SSI) or Medicaid, which have strict income and asset limits. Financial advisors recommend careful planning of payout structures to avoid unintended consequences for these specific benefits. (not investment advice)</p>
