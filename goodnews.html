          <p>Air Canada plans to restart its flight schedule after the Canadian government intervened to end a strike by its 10,000 flight attendants. The work stoppage, which stranded over 100,000 travelers globally, was halted when the Jobs Minister referred the dispute to the Canada Industrial Relations Board, forcing both parties into arbitration. While initial flights will resume Sunday evening, the airline anticipates it will take seven to ten days to fully stabilize its schedule, with some cancellations expected. The core of the dispute remains unresolved issues over pay and unpaid work, with the union rejecting the airline's latest offer.</p>

          <p>Thorne Island, a derelict 19th-century Napoleonic fort off the Pembrokeshire coast, has been renovated into a luxury party space and is now on the market for £3 million. The new owner, Mike Conner, purchased the abandoned property in 2017 and spent nearly five years and a significant investment to make it habitable, overcoming challenges like having no running water or electricity. The historic fort, originally built to defend against French naval attacks, is now equipped with 40 beds, modern amenities, and its own nightclub. The renovation has revived the island's former life as a unique venue for events and parties.</p>

          <p>Hurricane Erin, the first of the 2025 Atlantic season, has been downgraded to a Category 3 storm after briefly reaching Category 5 intensity. The storm is currently churning over the Atlantic north of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, bringing heavy rain and strong winds to the region, with a tropical storm warning in effect for the Turks and Caicos Islands. Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center noted the storm is undergoing an "eyewall replacement cycle," which can cause temporary weakening before potential re-intensification. Current projections show Erin is not expected to make landfall in the United States.</p>

          <p>A 46-year-old man, Ryan Wardwell, was successfully rescued after spending two days trapped behind a powerful waterfall in Tulare County, California. Wardwell was rappelling down a series of waterfalls known as the Seven Teacups when the "extreme hydraulics" of the water pushed him off his lines and into a cave behind the cascade. A search operation was launched after he failed to return, and rescuers located him using a drone. A California Highway Patrol helicopter crew then performed a hoist rescue, bringing him to safety with only minor injuries and dehydration.</p>

          <p>As the cost of higher education approaches $100,000 per year at some institutions, a select group of nine U.S. colleges offers a tuition-free education to all admitted students. These schools, which include institutions like Berea College, College of the Ozarks, and all five U.S. military service academies, typically have high academic standards and unique requirements. In exchange for free tuition, students may participate in mandatory work programs or commit to several years of military service after graduation. These colleges provide an alternative for students concerned about affordability, though admission is highly competitive and often involves significant post-graduation obligations.</p>

          <p>The widespread adoption of generative AI tools like ChatGPT has completed its transformation of higher education within a single undergraduate cohort's time on campus. What began as a tool for cheating has become a ubiquitous habit for students managing heavy workloads, summarizing readings, and polishing assignments, with surveys showing near-universal use. This shift is forcing a reckoning among faculty, many of whom are reverting to in-class, handwritten assignments to ensure academic integrity, while students desire more practical, project-based learning that AI cannot easily replicate. The article argues that universities must fundamentally redesign classroom practices to adapt to this new technological reality.</p>

          <p>Through a novel program organized by officials in the Mexican state of Zacatecas, José Antonio Rodríguez was reunited with his elderly parents in East Los Angeles after 24 years of separation. Rodríguez had left his family in Mexico at age 20 to find work in California and, due to his undocumented status, had not seen them since. The program helps elderly parents of undocumented workers obtain temporary visitor visas to the U.S. The emotional reunion highlights the profound personal cost of long-term family separation caused by immigration policies, as well as the deep community ties that sustain immigrants abroad.</p>

          <p>Australia has granted political asylum to Ted Hui, a prominent pro-democracy activist and former lawmaker from Hong Kong. Hui fled the city in 2020 after facing criminal charges related to the 2019 pro-democracy protests and was among several activists targeted with police bounties. In a social media post, Hui expressed gratitude to the Australian government for its protection but also conveyed the sadness of being a political refugee unable to return to his hometown. He urged Australia to do more to help other Hong Kong activists who remain imprisoned for their political beliefs.</p>

          <p>Phoenix cold case detectives successfully captured Bryan Patrick Miller, the notorious "canal killer" responsible for two murders in the early 1990s, through an elaborate undercover sting. In 2015, a detective met Miller, a local "Zombie Hunter" character, at a Chili's restaurant under the pretense of an interview. The goal was to covertly obtain his DNA from a water glass. The DNA was a match to evidence found on victims Angela Brosso and Melanie Bernas, who were both killed while biking along city canals. After an eight-year legal process, Miller was convicted and sentenced to death in 2023.</p>

          <p>New Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim is tasked with reviving the club after a self-described "disaster season," promising that "the good days are coming." Amorim is implementing a new tactical system based on a three-defender formation and has made significant summer signings to fit this style, costing around £200 million. He has also established a new six-player leadership group to manage the dressing room and has reduced his media commitments to focus more on coaching. With a challenging opening set of fixtures, there is immense pressure on Amorim to deliver immediate improvement and achieve European qualification.</p>
