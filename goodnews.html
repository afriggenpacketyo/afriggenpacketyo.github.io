          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-04 16:37:31 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) has processed 2.5 million retroactive payments for public pension holders who were previously restricted from receiving full benefits due to the Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP) and Government Pension Offset (GPO). The Social Security Fairness Act, signed into law in January 2025, eliminated these provisions, allowing the SSA to adjust benefits for 3.2 million people. Beneficiaries should have received a one-time retroactive payment by the end of March 2025, with increased monthly benefits starting in April. The SSA expects to update all beneficiary records by November 2025, and those who haven't received payments should verify their information with the agency. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Amazon has formed a new group within its consumer product-development arm, Lab126, focused on agentic artificial intelligence. This team will develop an agentic AI framework for use in robotics operations, often referred to as "physical AI". Agentic AI differs from chatbots by completing multistep, complex actions on a user's behalf. Amazon's AI lab released a web browser-based agent earlier this year, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group, indicating a significant push into this technology.</p>

She also made the unusual decision to step away from power after leading New Zealand through numerous crises. Ardern emphasized the need to lead with kindness and empathy, rejecting traditional leadership approaches.</p>
