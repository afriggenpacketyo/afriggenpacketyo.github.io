          <p>New York Attorney General Letitia James has filed a lawsuit against Capital One, accusing the bank of deceiving customers by failing to inform them about a new savings product with substantially higher interest rates. The lawsuit alleges that Capital One marketed its "360 Savings" account as a high-yield option but did not notify customers about the "360 Performance Savings" account, which offered significantly better rates as interest rates rose in 2022. The Attorney General's office claims that Capital One instructed employees not to proactively inform customers about the new product, leading to New York customers missing out on millions of dollars in potential interest. Capital One disputes the claims and intends to defend itself in court.</p>

          <p>With inflation declining and interest rate cuts looking likely, a home equity line of credit (HELOC) may be a sensible option for homeowners seeking to borrow money. HELOCs offer relatively low interest rates compared to other borrowing options like personal loans and credit cards, making them attractive for financing large expenses. Elevated home equity levels provide homeowners with substantial funds to utilize. Borrowers should carefully consider their financial situation and potential payment scenarios before taking out a HELOC, as their home serves as collateral.</p>

          <p>Joseph Nye, the international affairs scholar who coined the term "soft power," has died at the age of 88.

He served in the State Department and the Pentagon under Presidents Carter and Clinton and was the dean of Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. Nye's ideas had a significant impact on U.S. foreign policy and were antithetical to the approach of Donald Trump, who Nye criticized for undermining institutions essential to soft power.</p>
