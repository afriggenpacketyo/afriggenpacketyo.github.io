        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A new parenting framework called "emotionally safe parenting" emphasizes creating a secure environment for children to thrive by focusing on emotional attunement, self-awareness, and inner healing. This approach encourages parents to accept their child's emotions, view misbehavior as a signal for support, set boundaries with empathy, and prevent shame through healthy repair. Emotionally safe parents prioritize open and honest conversations, respond without shaming, and take responsibility after conflicts. The article suggests that by doing their own inner work, parents can become less reactive and create a space where children feel safe expressing their authentic selves.</p>

          <p>Johann Strauss II's "Blue Danube" waltz will be beamed into space to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the composer's birth, performed by the Vienna Symphony Orchestra. The celestial send-off will be livestreamed and also commemorate the European Space Agency's 50th anniversary. ESA will relay a pre-recorded version of the music from its big radio antenna in Spain, pointed towards Voyager 1, to avoid technical issues. This follows similar transmissions of music into deep space by NASA and other organizations, and aims to correct the "cosmic mistake" of Strauss' exclusion from the Voyager Golden Records.</p>

          <p>The story of Julie Moore, an Army wife who transformed the way the U.S. military notifies families of service member deaths, is remembered. Outraged by the impersonal telegrams used during the Vietnam War, Moore lobbied for in-person notifications and support for grieving families. Working with other Army wives, Moore convinced the Army to take responsibility for delivering casualty notifications and providing personal care to spouses. Today, service members carry out this solemn duty, offering comfort and assistance to families during their time of loss, a practice that stands as a testament to Moore's lasting impact.</p>
