          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-07 13:26:10 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Block CEO and Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has launched a beta version of Bitchat, a new decentralized messaging app that functions without an internet connection. The app operates on a peer-to-peer basis, using Bluetooth mesh networks to relay encrypted messages between nearby devices, ensuring communication remains possible during internet outages or shutdowns. Designed for privacy and censorship resistance, Bitchat requires no personal data like phone numbers or emails and stores messages only on user devices. This project aligns with Dorsey's broader vision for user-owned, decentralized technology and communication platforms.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Justice and the FBI have officially concluded that convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein did not possess a so-called "client list" that could incriminate high-profile associates. In a memo, investigators stated there was no credible evidence of such a list or that Epstein was blackmailing prominent individuals, contradicting widespread conspiracy theories. The report also reaffirmed the official finding that Epstein died by suicide in his jail cell. This conclusion comes after President Trump had promised to release Epstein-related files, a move some supporters felt did not deliver the expected revelations.</p>

          <p>In his daily market analysis, Jim Cramer suggested that Nvidia could see a future win in China if Washington eases certain export restrictions on chip design firms, potentially allowing Nvidia to sell specific AI chips there. Meanwhile, cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike received a downgrade from Piper Sandler, which cited the stock's high valuation after a significant run-up in price. Cramer noted that his investment club has been periodically taking profits on CrowdStrike due to its valuation. The broader market saw a downturn amid new tariff announcements and profit-taking after recent highs. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Belgian cyclist Tim Merlier secured a narrow victory in the third stage of the Tour de France, edging out Italy's Jonathan Milan in a dramatic sprint finish. The stage was marked by several crashes, including one that forced stage one winner Jasper Philipsen to abandon the race after a collision. Despite the chaotic finish, overall race leader Mathieu van der Poel successfully retained the yellow jersey. The main general classification contenders, Tadej Pogacar and Jonas Vingegaard, also managed to avoid the incidents and finished safely within the main group, maintaining their high rankings.</p>

          <h2>Scientists Develop Micro-Robots for Targeted Sinus Infection Treatment</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Researchers have developed microscopic robots that could offer a new, targeted way to treat sinus infections without traditional antibiotics. These tiny robots, made of magnetic particles, can be guided through the nasal cavity directly to the site of an infection. Once there, they are heated with a fiber optic light, triggering a reaction that breaks through mucus and destroys bacteria locally. This innovative approach could reduce side effects and combat antibiotic resistance. While animal trials have been promising, further research is needed to ensure safety before human application.</p>

          <p>The film "F1," starring Brad Pitt, has become Apple's most successful theatrical release ever, speeding past $293 million at the global box office. This surpasses the company's previous top earner, "Napoleon," and marks a significant achievement for Apple's growing entertainment division. The film's success has been bolstered by a strong partnership with IMAX, which accounted for over 20% of its total gross. Despite its high ticket sales, the movie's large production and marketing budget, reportedly totaling up to $400 million, means it still has a considerable way to go to achieve profitability.</p>

          <p>Authorities in Pakistan's Punjab province have confiscated 18 lions that were being kept illegally as pets in a densely populated area. The crackdown was initiated after a lion escaped from a home in Lahore and attacked a woman and two children. Keeping exotic animals like lions is seen as a status symbol among some wealthy Pakistanis, despite legal requirements and safety risks. Officials have also raided dozens of breeding farms and made several arrests as part of a broader effort to enforce regulations on the ownership of big cats.</p>

          <p>Wimbledon officials have modified their electronic line-calling system to prevent a repeat of a controversial incident caused by human error. During a fourth-round match, an operator accidentally deactivated the Hawk-Eye ball-tracking technology for a critical game, leading to a missed call and a replayed point. In response, the All England Club has removed the ability for operators to manually turn off the system. The incident has also sparked a debate about implementing a video review system, similar to those used in other major tournaments, which officials will consider after the championships.</p>

          <p>South African cricket captain Wiaan Mulder made the decision to declare his team's innings, leaving himself at 367 not out and just 33 runs shy of Brian Lara's all-time Test record of 400. Mulder explained that he prioritized the team's need to start bowling and also felt it was right to let a "legend" like Lara retain the iconic record. The 27-year-old's selfless act was made at lunch on the second day of a Test match against Zimbabwe. His score of 367 is now the fifth-highest individual score in Test history and the highest ever by a South African.</p>
