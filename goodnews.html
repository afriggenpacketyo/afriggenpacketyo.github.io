          <p>President Trump has announced that a deal has been reached with China to prevent a ban on TikTok in the United States, with a buyer for the app's U.S. operations to be named soon. The social media platform, owned by Chinese company ByteDance, faced a shutdown over national security concerns regarding user data. As part of the agreement, U.S. tech company Oracle will continue to host TikTok's services within the U.S. to address these concerns. The deal comes after months of negotiations and multiple delays of the ban, signaling a potential resolution to the high-stakes technology dispute.</p>

          <p>President Trump has reignited a debate by proposing that the SEC change its requirement for public companies to report earnings from quarterly to semi-annually. Supporters of the change, including some business leaders, argue that it would reduce costs and encourage companies to focus on long-term growth rather than short-term market expectations. Conversely, opponents worry that less frequent reporting would decrease transparency and disadvantage individual investors who rely on regular updates. The SEC has indicated it is reviewing the proposal, which could fundamentally alter corporate disclosure standards in the U.S. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Microsoft has announced a plan to invest $30 billion in the United Kingdom's artificial intelligence infrastructure by 2028, a move that includes building the nation's largest supercomputer. The investment, split between capital expenditures and operational costs, was announced during President Trump's state visit to the UK. Microsoft President Brad Smith noted that the government's recent steps have created a more favorable regulatory climate for such large-scale AI investments. The commitment is part of a broader push for collaboration between the U.S. and UK on AI, quantum computing, and nuclear technologies.</p>

          <p>A Republican-led House committee has removed a controversial provision from a bill that would have granted the Secretary of State sweeping authority to revoke the passports of U.S. citizens. The measure would have allowed for passport denial or revocation for individuals determined to have provided "material support" to designated terrorist organizations. The proposal drew significant criticism from civil liberties advocates, who warned it could be used to target political activists, particularly those supporting Palestinian causes. The provision was withdrawn to ensure it did not overshadow the broader State Department reform legislation.</p>

          <p>An Eritrean man who arrived in the UK via a small boat has successfully obtained a last-minute legal injunction to block his removal to France. The case represents the first legal challenge to the new "one in, one out" returns agreement between the UK and France. The man's lawyers argued that the decision to remove him was rushed and that he needed more time to present evidence that he was a victim of modern slavery. A High Court judge agreed there was a serious issue to be tried regarding the trafficking claim, temporarily halting his departure.</p>

          <h2>Navigating Home Equity Options While Awaiting Lower Refinancing Rates</h2>

          <p>For homeowners looking to tap into their property's equity, current mortgage refinance rates may be prohibitively high. This article outlines two primary alternatives to a cash-out refinance that allow owners to borrow money without giving up their existing low-rate mortgage. Homeowners can consider a home equity line of credit (HELOC), which functions like a revolving credit line with a variable interest rate. Another option is a home equity loan, which provides a lump-sum payment with a predictable fixed interest rate, offering different benefits depending on the borrower's financial needs.

          <h2>Trump's Threat to Shut Down TikTok Was Key to Securing Deal, Says Treasury Secretary</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>According to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the turning point in negotiations over TikTok's U.S. operations was President Trump's credible willingness to let the app "go dark." Bessent explained that while the commercial terms of a deal had been largely agreed upon for months, China paused negotiations following new U.S. tariff announcements. It was only when President Trump made it clear that he prioritized national security over a deal and was prepared to enforce a ban that China was motivated to finalize the framework for the app's divestiture.</p>

          <p>A notable shift in consumer behavior shows that a growing number of affluent households are shopping at discount stores like Walmart, Aldi, and Dollar General. Data indicates this trend has accelerated since 2021, primarily driven by persistent inflation that has diminished the financial cushion even for higher earners. These consumers are seeking better value on groceries and household essentials to stretch their budgets. In response, discount chains are upgrading their store experiences and product assortments to cater to this new, more financially comfortable demographic. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates, this article offers timely advice for prospective homebuyers navigating the volatile mortgage market. A key recommendation is to lock in a rate that fits one's budget now, as there's no certainty that rates will continue to fall and they could rise again unexpectedly. It also emphasizes the importance of shopping around with multiple lenders, as their responses to a Fed cut will vary. Homebuyers are encouraged to explore all financing options, including adjustable-rate mortgages and buying down the rate with mortgage points. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>For the fourth time, President Trump has issued an executive order delaying the enforcement of a bipartisan law requiring TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, to divest its U.S. operations or face a ban. The new deadline is now December 16, a move that comes as U.S. and Chinese officials are reportedly close to finalizing a deal to resolve the national security dispute. The administration's repeated non-enforcement of the law has raised legal questions about presidential authority and drawn criticism from some lawmakers who argue the statute is unambiguous and should be implemented.</p>

          <p>Europe is heading into winter with its natural gas reserves at over 80% capacity, a level lower than the past few years but still considered a solid buffer against shortages. The continent has significantly diversified its energy sources away from Russia since the 2022 invasion of Ukraine, relying more on LNG from the U.S. and Norway. However, new geopolitical uncertainties, including potential U.S. tariffs on nations buying Russian energy, could create market volatility. While a major crisis is not expected, unpredictable weather and political pressures could still lead to temporary price spikes. (not investment advice)</p>

Ahead of shows at the Hollywood Bowl, surviving members Pete Townshend and Roger Daltrey reflected on their storied sixty-year career, from their first trip to America during the British Invasion to their enduring, often contentious partnership. While both members agree that the grueling nature of touring has become too difficult, they remain divided on the band's future, with Daltrey keen to continue and Townshend preferring to focus on other projects.</p>
