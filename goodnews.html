          <p>Representative Andrew Garbarino, a Republican from New York, missed a crucial vote on President Trump's domestic policy bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, because he fell asleep. The bill passed by a single vote, with Garbarino's support potentially changing the outcome. The bill includes a provision to lift the cap on federal deductions for state and local taxes (SALT) from $10,000 to $40,000 for households earning up to $500,000, which was a key point of negotiation for blue-state Republicans like Garbarino. Despite missing the vote, Speaker Mike Johnson praised Garbarino's role in the bill's negotiations.</p>

          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to remove 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) titles. The new review identified only about 20 books for removal pending further assessment by a Department of Defense panel. The initial ban, based on the Navy's own search terms, included titles such as "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". The reversal follows a Pentagon memo standardizing search terms to comply with a Trump executive order to eliminate DEI programs.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>American Airlines' chief financial officer, Devon May, has stated that some travelers are avoiding Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions. These disruptions are related to a shortage of air traffic controllers, equipment outages, runway construction, and bad weather. As a result, passengers are opting for alternative airports in the area, such as LaGuardia, JFK, and Philadelphia, although the impact is "modest" according to May.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Bitcoin continued its rally, reaching a new record high near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Factors such as easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China and the Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt have contributed to the rally. The price rise is occurring despite a drop in U.S. equities, potentially due to investors seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from President Trump and his administration have also supported the market.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl exports to the U.S. led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. Beijing imposed a strict drug control policy in May 2019, adding all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that absent China‚Äôs restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>
