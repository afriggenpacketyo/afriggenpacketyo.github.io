          <p>The Navy has reversed its decision to ban 381 books from its libraries after a Pentagon review using standardized search terms for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) issues. The initial ban, based on the Navy's own search terms, included titles like "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" and "How to Be an Antiracist". However, the new review identified only about 20 books needing removal pending further assessment by the Department of Defense. This reversal ensures nearly all originally pulled books are back in circulation at the Nimitz Library and other Navy educational institutions, aligning with directives issued by the President and Department of Defense.</p>

          <p>American Airlines' chief financial officer stated that some travelers are avoiding Newark Liberty International Airport due to recent disruptions, though the impact is "modest." The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has ordered airlines to temporarily cut flights at Newark to relieve congestion, which has been exacerbated by air traffic controller shortages, equipment outages, and runway construction. Bad weather has also contributed to the disruptions, prompting some travelers to opt for alternative airports in the New York area.</p>

          <p>Bitcoin has reached a new record high, trading near $112,000, driven by increasing institutional ownership and corporate adoption. Easing trade tensions between the U.S. and China, as well as Moody's downgrade of U.S. sovereign debt, have acted as key catalysts. The price rise is taking place despite a drop in U.S. equities, suggesting investors are seeking alternative stores of value. Pro-crypto policies from the Trump administration have also helped support the market.</p>

          <p>A study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics found that China's 2019 embargo on fentanyl and precursor chemicals led to a temporary spike in the drug's street price in the US, deterring its use and reducing fentanyl-related overdose deaths by up to 25% over a period of three to five months. Beijing imposed a strict drug control policy in May 2019, adding all fentanyl-related substances to its list of controlled substances, restricting their export. The study estimates that without China's restrictions, as many as 947 more Americans would have died from a fentanyl overdose.</p>

          <p>A recent study published in JAMA Network Open found that children's breakfast cereals have been getting sweeter, fattier, and less nutritious between 2010 and 2023. The study analyzed 1,200 cereals and found that total fat and sodium content increased significantly, while protein and dietary fiber decreased. Researchers suggest that these trends make it harder for parents to ensure their children are getting a healthy start to the day and hope the research sparks a conversation on how food industry stakeholders can create healthier options for kids.</p>

          <p>Some U.S. homeowners may soon get a sizable tax break thanks to the massive budget package that was passed by the House early Thursday. The legislation includes a provision that would lift the tax deduction cap for state and local taxes, or SALT, to $40,000 from its current $10,000 limit. The full $40,000 deduction would only be available to filers with household incomes below $500,000. Those who earn above that amount would face a phaseout, although the deduction wouldn't go lower than $10,000. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Annuities are pitched as a way to ensure you won't outlive your money during retirement, but the reality is that these retirement products can also be quite confusing. Whether or not an annuity can run out of money depends heavily on the type of annuity you have. In general, immediate and lifetime annuities are designed not to run out of money as long as the issuing insurer remains solvent. Fixed-term annuities, variable or indexed annuities, and annuities with a withdrawal rider can all run out of money.</p>
