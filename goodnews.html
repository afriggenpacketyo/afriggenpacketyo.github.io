          <p>The Supreme Court is set to debate the legality of President Trump's restrictions on birthright citizenship and the use of nationwide injunctions by federal judges. The case, fast-tracked for a ruling, will address whether individual judges can halt temporary enforcement of executive actions across the country. Conservative justices have expressed concerns over the use of universal injunctions, arguing they disrupt the federal court system. The outcome could significantly impact numerous lawsuits against White House actions filed since January 20, testing ideological divides within the court's conservative majority.</p>

          <p>Mariangela Hungria, a microbiologist in Brazil, has been awarded the World Food Prize for her decades-long work on soil bacteria that act like fertilizer. She spent decades looking for bacteria in the soil that could act like fertilizer, boosting farmers' harvests. She isolated useful strains of bacteria called rhizobia which inhabit nodules on soybean roots, capture nitrogen from the air and convert it into a form that feeds the plant. In Brazil, at least, studies have shown that the microbes allow farmers to get by with using less chemical fertilizer, saving money and reducing burdens on the environment.</p>

          <p>Dana Walden, co-chair of Disney Entertainment, laid out the media company's business strategy in a Tuesday interview with CNBC's Jim Cramer. She highlighted how Disney bundles streaming services in connection with leveraging its linear television arm. Disney posted earnings last week that beat expectations, and it recorded better-than-expected subscriber growth for its Disney+ streaming service. The company announced Tuesday it would offer a stand-alone ESPN streaming service for $29.99 per month. The new service is heavily discounted when bundled with Disney's other streaming brands, Disney+ and Hulu.</p>

          <p>President Trump often takes maximalist positions, only to back down and declare a win. His opponents are catching on. The dynamic has played out repeatedly in recent weeks as Mr. Trump backed off, to varying degrees, on his plans to transform Gaza into the ‚ÄúRiviera of the Middle East,‚Äù turn Canada into the 51st state and beat China into submission with tariffs. Russia and Iran appear to be honing their strategies after watching Mr. Trump in action.</p>

          <p>Jose "Pepe" Mujica, a guerrilla fighter who became Uruguay's president, has died. He became known as the "World's Poorest President" for his humble lifestyle. He often appeared at Cabinet meetings wearing a cardigan, sandals and an old pair of trousers. As president, Mujica, an avowed atheist, turned the country upside down. He legalized gay marriage and abortion, a move that was well ahead of the prevailing times in Latin America. Under his leadership, unemployment, poverty and infant mortality all decreased.</p>

          <p>Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., is requesting that the Department of Defense's Office of Inspector General launch an inquiry on the department's role in "facilitating and serving as a pass-through" for the Trump administration to accept a luxury jet donated by the Qatari government to use as Air Force One. Schiff raised to acting Inspector General Steven Stebbins a number of constitutional, legal and national security concerns related to the possible gift from Qatar. They also asserted that the Trump administration is sidestepping constitutionally provided congressional guardrails by accepting the foreign gift.</p>

          <p>The Department of Health and Human Services on Tuesday reversed the firings of more than 100 federal employees with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the federal institute that helps protect coal miners from black lung, according to Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito. The move comes after public pressure from Capito, and follows a series of ABC News reports detailing the impact the firings would have on black lung health care programs for coal miners. In a statement to ABC News, plaintiffs attorney Sam Petsonk said, "This opinion gives life to our foundational principles of judicial review, empowering ordinary citizens like these coal miners to defend their rights."</p>
