        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This opinion article posits that the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO), led by China, serves as a crucial remedy for the deficiencies in the current global order. The author argues that the post-World War II multilateral system, symbolized by the United Nations, is weakening due to unilateral actions, trade disputes, and the marginalization of the Global South. The SCO is presented as a platform that embodies principles of cooperation and allows countries with diverse cultures and political systems to work together. The organization is framed as a necessary alternative in a world where some nations undermine global institutions while others fail to enact meaningful reforms.</p>

          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-11 20:19:23 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Fussy eating is a normal developmental phase for more than half of all children, and parents should not blame themselves for it, according to child nutritionist Charlotte Stirling-Reed. To make mealtimes less stressful, she recommends allowing children autonomy by letting them choose whether to eat, which can paradoxically encourage them to try more foods. Other tips include avoiding labeling foods as "good" or "bad," focusing on making the dinner table an enjoyable place, and being mindful of natural fluctuations in a child's appetite. Involving children in food preparation and consistently exposing them to a variety of foods can also help them become more adventurous eaters over time.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ed Sheeran's eighth studio album, titled "Play," marks a strategic return to mainstream pop after his last two introspective records saw lower commercial success. The album is described as a response to a difficult period in his life, aiming to create joy while exploring cultural influences from his international tours, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. While the record incorporates instruments like the sitar and tabla, some critics find that these elements are assimilated into his familiar pop formula rather than pushing new musical boundaries. The album balances upbeat, radio-friendly tracks with personal ballads, representing an effort to satisfy his massive global fanbase while potentially missing an opportunity for greater artistic risk.</p>

The initiative, described as a book club for the modern worker, provides a platform for colleagues to share diverse life experiences and practice skills essential for effective collaboration. Research suggests a direct link between empathy and commercial success, with the most empathetic companies significantly outperforming their peers.

          <p>Gemini, the cryptocurrency company founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, has priced its initial public offering at $28 per share, exceeding its expected range and valuing the exchange at $3.3 billion. The offering saw high demand, with the company selling 15.2 million shares to raise up to $425 million. The successful pricing comes despite Gemini reporting widening financial losses, signaling strong investor interest in the crypto sector. The company recently received a significant vote of confidence with a $50 million strategic investment from Nasdaq, which aims to offer its clients access to Gemini's custodial services. The stock will trade under the ticker symbol "GEMI."</p>

          <p>The UK's National Health Service is looking to Denmark as a model for improving cancer survival rates, after the Scandinavian country transformed its approach over the past 25 years. Denmark invested heavily in diagnostic equipment like CT scanners, established rapid treatment timelines, and empowered patients with the right to seek care elsewhere if targets aren't met. This comprehensive strategy elevated Denmark's cancer outcomes from among the lowest in wealthy nations to near the top. UK policymakers, noting the similarities between the two state-run health systems, are considering adopting aspects of the Danish model, which emphasizes political consensus, long-term planning, and accountability to drive improvements in patient care.</p>

          <p>The fictional British rock band Spinal Tap is returning for a sequel to the iconic 1984 mockumentary, "This Is Spinal Tap." Titled "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues," the new film reunites the original cast and director Rob Reiner, who reprises his role as filmmaker Marty DiBergi. The plot centers on the band's reunion for one last contractually obligated gig, forcing them to once again confront their hilariously disastrous history, including their infamous string of deceased drummers. The sequel features cameo appearances from real-life rock legends Sir Paul McCartney and Sir Elton John, continuing the franchise's blend of satire and genuine affection for the excesses of rock and roll.</p>

          <p>South Africa's Constitutional Court has overturned an apartheid-era law that prevented husbands from taking their wives' last names, ruling that it was discriminatory on the basis of gender. The decision upholds a lower court's ruling and gives the government two years to amend the Births and Deaths Registration Act. The court noted that the practice of women taking their husband's surname was a "colonial import," as many African cultures traditionally saw women retain their birth names. The case was brought by two couples who challenged the Department of Home Affairs, with one couple seeking a hyphenated name and the other wanting the husband to adopt his wife's surname.</p>

          <p>Recent significant gains in China's $12 trillion stock market are testing the ability of regulators to manage a sustainable bull run without repeating the wild boom-and-bust cycles of the past. Beijing aims to establish the equity market as a reliable source of household wealth, which could help shift assets away from the volatile property sector and boost consumer spending. After a period of nonstop gains, a recent pullback may indicate a transition to a more measured "slow bull" market, which could reduce the risk of speculative trading by retail investors. The challenge for regulators is to guide this growth in a way that supports long-term economic stability. (not investment advice)</p>

The company posted adjusted earnings of $5.31 per share on $5.99 billion in revenue, reflecting an 11% increase from the same period last year. Adobe also provided an optimistic forecast for the fourth quarter, with revenue guidance slightly above expectations. The positive results are partly attributed to the successful integration of artificial intelligence across its product portfolio, with CEO Shantanu Narayen noting that AI-influenced annualized recurring revenue has now surpassed $5 billion.</p>

          <p>The Original Pantry, a landmark Los Angeles diner that closed earlier this year after over 100 years of operation, is set to reopen following its acquisition by real estate developer Leo Pustilnikov.

The restaurant, known for its 24-hour service, was abruptly shuttered by its former owner, the Richard J. Riordan Trust, amid a labor dispute. Pustilnikov purchased the building for $5.5 million and aims to reopen the historic eatery by New Year's Eve, preserving a piece of L.A. history.</p>

          <p>Following a record-setting day for major stock indexes, market analyst Jim Cramer is pushing back against bearish investors, arguing that the market is positioned for continued growth. He suggests that many "cynics" are overlooking positive economic signals, such as data that might prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, and are instead focusing on broader issues like national debt and geopolitical tensions. Cramer points to the strong performance of individual stocks, a booming IPO market, and major corporate rallies as evidence that bullishness is warranted, warning that bearish money managers risk losing clients if they don't adapt.

          <p>Shares of Warner Brothers Discovery and Paramount Skydance saw significant gains following reports that Paramount Skydance is preparing a buyout offer for its rival studio. A potential deal would unite major media assets, including CNN, HBO, and the Paramount film studio, marking further consolidation in an industry being reshaped by the rise of streaming. The move comes shortly after the completion of Paramount Skydance's own merger and as media firms face increased scrutiny from the Trump administration. While no official bid has been submitted, the speculation alone was enough to drive Warner Brothers Discovery shares up by 29% and Paramount Skydance by 16%.</p>
