          <p>Veteran character actor Clifton Powell has publicly named Jeff Witjas as the agent who he claims fired him for accepting a role in the 2005 film "The Gospel." Powell recounted that the agent disparagingly referred to the project as "another one of those little Black movies," to which Powell responded that he had a family to feed. The actor, known for roles in "Ray" and "Rush Hour," emphasized his career strategy of staying connected to his community, advice he received from Jamie Foxx. He stated that this approach has paid off, as the director of "The Gospel" later cast him in a recent critically acclaimed series.</p>

          <p>Terence Crawford, who is moving up two weight classes, weighed in at the same weight as champion Saul "Canelo" Alvarez for their highly anticipated super-middleweight title fight in Las Vegas. The undefeated Crawford appeared in exceptional physical condition, dispelling concerns about carrying the extra weight for his attempt to become a three-division undisputed champion. Alvarez is set to defend his four major world titles in what is considered a legacy-defining bout. While Alvarez's natural power at the 168-pound limit could be a deciding factor, many analysts are tipping the adaptable Crawford to make history.</p>

          <p>Two identical twin brothers in Southern California have been federally charged with tax evasion and running an illegal tee time brokering business that generated over $1.1 million in income. Prosecutors allege that Se Youn and Hee Youn Kim used online platforms to monopolize and resell desirable reservation slots at public golf courses, charging customers fees paid through mobile apps. The scheme allegedly netted them nearly $700,000 from 2021 to 2023, which they failed to report to the IRS while making lavish purchases. The case addresses a long-standing frustration among local golfers.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture is organizing a trip for American agricultural growers and exporters to meet with officials in Beijing and attend a major import expo in Shanghai this fall. This marks the third annual trip of its kind, but it carries extra significance as both nations attempt to stabilize relations while trade disputes continue to impact agricultural purchases. The U.S. delegation will feature about 20 participants, including state representatives and trade associations. The visit aims to foster dialogue and promote American agricultural products in China, which remains their largest overseas market.</p>

          <p>The Federal Aviation Administration is launching a new pilot program to speed up the safe integration of electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, commonly known as air taxis. Key industry players Archer Aviation and Joby Aviation announced their participation, which will involve public-private partnerships to establish at least five projects for testing and deployment. This initiative could allow for supervised trials to begin as early as next year. The program is seen as a critical step toward establishing commercial air taxi services and cementing U.S. leadership in advanced aviation technology.</p>

          <p>In a landmark decision for Brazilian democracy, former president Jair Bolsonaro has been sentenced to 27 years in prison by the country's supreme court for leading a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2022 election results. The court found him guilty of orchestrating a coup plot that included a widespread disinformation campaign and culminated in the January 2023 riots in Brasília. Seven of his close allies, including former ministers and military officials, were also convicted. The verdict challenges Brazil's history of impunity and has been hailed as a major victory for the rule of law.</p>

          <p>The latest film in the "Downton Abbey" saga, subtitled "The Grand Finale," offers a satisfying conclusion by focusing on the small-scale social and family dramas that fans love. Set in 1930, the story explores contemporary themes through a historical lens, such as the tabloid scandal surrounding Lady Mary's divorce and the generational struggle over managing the estate. The movie brings back familiar faces and introduces new characters, including a playful Noël Coward, who adds a mischievous energy. While not breaking new ground, the film successfully delivers the charm and social commentary that have long been the series' hallmark.</p>

          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to begin cutting interest rates, market watchers are focused on the record $7.6 trillion held in high-yield money market funds. While some predict this "wall of cash" will flow into riskier assets like stocks, some experts are skeptical, arguing that most funds are held by institutional investors unlikely to shift strategy. Historically, significant outflows from money market funds have only occurred when interest rates approached zero. This suggests that modest rate cuts may not trigger a major reallocation of assets from these popular cash-equivalent accounts. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Cameron Norrie gave Great Britain a 1-0 lead in its Davis Cup World Group 1 tie against Poland by defeating Tomasz Berkieta in Gdynia. Despite being ranked over 500 places higher, Norrie had to save set points in a tense first-set tiebreak before securing a 7-6 (11-9), 6-4 victory. Great Britain is heavily favored in the tie, as Poland is missing its top two players. A win for the British team will ensure they advance to the first round of the main tournament next February, keeping them among the elite nations competing for the 2026 title.</p>

          <p>Forty-eight years after his death in police custody, a new inquest has begun into the killing of celebrated South African anti-apartheid activist Steve Biko. Biko, a founder of the Black Consciousness Movement, died from a brain injury in 1977, with police at the time claiming he hit his head against a wall. Although former officers later admitted to assaulting him during the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, no one was ever prosecuted. Biko's family expressed confidence that the new legal proceedings will finally lead to accountability and address a painful chapter of the nation's history.</p>

          <p>This article revisits the 1985 congressional hearing that pitted musicians like Dee Snider and Frank Zappa against the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC), co-founded by Tipper Gore. The PMRC campaigned for warning labels on music with explicit content, arguing it was a matter of "truth in packaging" to help parents. Musicians argued it was a form of censorship. The debate culminated in a deal with the recording industry to introduce the now-iconic "Parental Advisory: Explicit Lyrics" sticker, which some artists claimed paradoxically boosted their sales. The voluntary labels remain in use today, a lasting legacy of that cultural clash.</p>
