          <p>Samsung is narrowing the gap with Apple in the U.S. smartphone market, increasing its share from 23% to 31% in the second quarter while Apple's declined from 56% to 49%. This shift is largely attributed to the growing popularity of Samsung's innovative foldable phones, like the Z Fold 7, which offer new form factors compared to the standard iPhone design. While Apple remains the market leader, Samsung's wider range of price points and new designs are creating renewed competition, prompting speculation that Apple may release its own foldable device by 2026.

          <p>Manchester City began their Premier League season with a commanding 4-0 win against Wolves, showcasing an impressive performance from new signing Tijjani Reijnders. The Dutch midfielder made an immediate impact on his debut, contributing both a goal and an assist. His dynamic, box-to-box style of play was lauded by manager Pep Guardiola, who highlighted his potential as a key player for the team in the coming years. The victory provides a strong start for City as they look to rebound from a disappointing previous season and reassert their dominance in the league.</p>

          <p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer has stated that President Trump's recent diplomatic efforts have brought the world "closer than ever before" to ending the war in Ukraine. This statement came after the Alaska summit where Trump and Putin did not reach a ceasefire but shifted focus towards a comprehensive peace deal. Starmer emphasized that any path to peace must involve Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and reaffirmed the UK's unwavering support for Ukraine. He also noted the importance of the U.S. being open to providing robust security guarantees as part of any potential agreement.</p>

          <p>Topshop, the once-dominant British fashion brand, is planning a major comeback with the confirmed return of standalone physical stores. After its parent company collapsed in 2020, the brand was sold to online retailer Asos, but it now aims to recapture its former glory, recently hosting its first catwalk show in seven years. Industry experts note that while nostalgia for the brand is high among millennials, Topshop will face challenges in attracting a new generation of shoppers and competing with fast-fashion giants. The brand's leadership is confident they can fill a gap in the market with their distinct "London girl" aesthetic.</p>

          <p>The S&P 500 and Nasdaq both reached several new record highs this week, driven by investor optimism following a cooler-than-expected July consumer price index report. This initially boosted expectations for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. However, the momentum slowed later in the week after the producer price index showed wholesale inflation rose more than anticipated. Despite the mixed signals, market odds for a rate cut remain relatively high, and major companies like Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, and Nvidia also hit all-time highs during the week.

          <p>The Prince and Princess of Wales are set to move to Forest Lodge, an eight-bedroom home in Windsor Great Park, with their three children. The family has been living in the smaller Adelaide Cottage since 2022, but have reportedly decided on a "fresh start" following a challenging period that included the princess's cancer diagnosis. The move is seen as a long-term plan, with Forest Lodge intended to be their "forever home," even after they become King and Queen. The couple will fund the move and any renovations privately, and they plan to continue without live-in staff to maintain family privacy.</p>

          <p>An architecture startup in Phoenix, Steel + Spark, is repurposing old shipping containers to create sustainable and rapidly deployable shelters for the city's unhoused population. The "X-WING" units consist of four containers arranged in an 'X' shape, creating five individual, air-conditioned rooms and shared courtyard spaces. The design is cost-effective, environmentally friendly by using existing materials, and can be constructed in just one week. The project aims to provide a dignified and stable living environment, with plans to expand the concept to build a larger apartment complex for low-income senior citizens.</p>

          <p>A profile on Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old billionaire CEO of healthcare software giant Epic Systems, details her unique and fiercely independent leadership style. Since founding the company in 1979, she has avoided venture capital and acquisitions, refusing to take the company public to prevent what she calls the "tyranny of the quarter." Epic now dominates the electronic health record market, with its software used in a majority of U.S. hospitals. Faulkner has established a complex trust to ensure the company remains private and true to her vision long after she is gone.</p>
