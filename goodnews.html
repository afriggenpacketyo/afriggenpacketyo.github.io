        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Department of Commerce has lifted export controls on chip-design software for China, a move announced by major industry players Siemens, Synopsys, and Cadence. These companies, which dominate the electronic design automation (EDA) market, can now resume full sales and support to Chinese customers. The reversal follows a tightening of controls in May and comes amid signs of a broader trade truce between the two nations. The news was met with a positive market reaction, as shares for Synopsys and Cadence saw significant gains following the announcement. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>For the upcoming 2025-26 school year, students face a choice between federal and private loans, each with distinct interest rates and terms. Federal undergraduate loans for the fall semester are set at a fixed 6.39%, available to all borrowers regardless of credit. In contrast, private lenders are offering variable rates starting as low as 3.2% for borrowers with excellent credit or a qualified co-signer. While private loans can offer significant savings, they lack the robust protections of federal loans, such as income-driven repayment plans and forgiveness programs, making the decision a trade-off between cost and security.

          <p>Universal is advancing its plans to build a major new theme park in Bedford, UK, by seeking direct government approval through a special development order. Planning documents reveal the resort could feature structures up to 377 feet high, which would make its rides the tallest in Europe, surpassing the current record holder in Spain. The company projects 8.5 million annual visitors and aims to open by 2031, creating over 8,500 jobs.

          <p>The UK government has released a 10-year plan to reform the NHS in England, focusing on shifting care from hospitals to new neighborhood health hubs. The strategy also emphasizes prevention, with initiatives to combat obesity and add new warning labels to alcohol. Other key changes include expanding access to dental care, creating dedicated mental health A&E departments, and enhancing the functionality of the NHS app to create a "doctor in your pocket." Critics have raised concerns about funding, staffing for the new hubs, and the plan's lack of focus on the interconnected social care sector.</p>

          <p>The UK's Labour government plans to further curtail the 'Right to Buy' scheme in England to protect the country's social housing stock. Under the new proposals, newly-built social homes will be exempt from the scheme for 35 years, and tenants will have to live in their properties for ten years, up from three, before they can purchase them. The maximum purchase discount will also be significantly reduced. The government argues these changes are necessary to ensure councils can recover building costs and prevent the depletion of affordable housing, a move praised by housing associations but criticized by Conservatives as an "attack on aspiration."</p>

          <p>The U.S. economy added 147,000 jobs in June, exceeding economists' expectations and signaling continued labor market resilience despite ongoing trade tensions. The unemployment rate decreased slightly to 4.1%, with notable job gains in state government and healthcare. The strong report comes amid concerns that President Trump's tariff policies would slow hiring, and it contrasts with other data suggesting a private sector slowdown. The White House has consistently downplayed the negative economic impact of its trade policies, while the Federal Reserve has cited tariff-related uncertainty as a reason for holding interest rates steady.

Despite these successes, the country still faces challenges, including a 2.3% extreme poverty rate and significant youth emigration due to unemployment.
