          <p>Police forces from multiple countries have dismantled an international drug trafficking ring that used high-speed "narco boats" to smuggle cocaine from South America to Spain's Canary Islands. The ring allegedly used 11 speedboats to pick up drugs from larger "mother ships" in the Atlantic, using an abandoned shipwreck as a refueling platform. Authorities arrested 48 people and seized nearly 3,800 kilos of cocaine, 19 boats, and around 100,000 euros. Spain is a major gateway for drug trafficking networks due to its ties to Latin America and proximity to Morocco.</p>

Some analysts speculated that Trump and Musk might reconcile, but a White House official stated Trump is "not interested" in a call with Musk. The dispute arose after Musk criticized Trump's tax and spending bill, calling it a "disgusting abomination."</p>
