          <p>The U.S. Army's Caisson Detachment, responsible for horse-drawn funerals at Arlington National Cemetery, has resumed its duties after a two-year hiatus and a $28 million overhaul. The program was suspended in May 2023 following the deaths of several horses due to poor living conditions and neglect. An Army investigation revealed inadequate stables, low-quality feed, and a lack of expertise in horse care, leading to the complete renovation of the unit. The Army has implemented better training, improved living conditions, and brought in equine experts to ensure the well-being of the horses.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Annuities can provide predictable income during retirement by converting a lump sum into guaranteed monthly payments, with payouts varying based on factors like age, gender, and investment amount. A single-life immediate fixed annuity provides payments that start immediately and continue for the rest of your life, with older buyers receiving larger monthly payments due to a shorter anticipated payout period. Men generally receive higher monthly payouts than women because of their shorter life expectancy, and adding features like joint-life annuities or inflation protection can also affect the monthly payout. While annuities are not suitable for everyone, they can be a valuable tool for those seeking guaranteed income and peace of mind in retirement (not investment advice).</p>

          <p>Alex Warren's hit song "Ordinary" has achieved its 12th week at number one in the UK, marking the longest chart reign since Ed Sheeran's "Shape of You" in 2017. The song, written for Warren's wife, has garnered over 107 million streams in the UK and has surpassed Slim Whitman's record for the most consecutive weeks at number one by a US artist. James Masterton notes the song's crossover appeal and its popularity as a wedding song, comparing it to other long-running romantic tracks. Despite its success, the fragmented media landscape means the song has not achieved the same level of ubiquity as past chart-toppers.</p>

          <p>Tesla's stock price experienced a rebound in morning trading following a significant drop triggered by a public dispute between CEO Elon Musk and former President Trump. The online spat had caused Tesla shares to close down 14% on Thursday, but the stock recovered, rising more than 5% to $299.90. Wedbush analyst Dan Ives remains optimistic about Tesla's future, suggesting the stock was oversold and predicting a rebound. Despite the recent volatility, Ives maintains a bullish outlook on Tesla's autonomous vehicle initiatives, valuing them at $1 trillion.</p>

The report suggests that the labor market is stable, which is crucial for the consumption-based U.S. economy, and the jobs data was neither too weak to suggest a recession nor too strong to hinder Federal Reserve rate cuts (not investment advice).
