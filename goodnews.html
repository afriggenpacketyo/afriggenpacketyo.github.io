          <p>Ozeki Onosato has secured his promotion to yokozuna, the highest rank in sumo wrestling, after winning consecutive championships at the Summer Grand Sumo Tournament. The 24-year-old wrestler achieved a 13-0 record, defeating fellow ozeki Kotozakura. Onosato's promotion is a formality since the Japan Sumo Association's Yokozuna Deliberation Council has never denied promotion to an ozeki winning consecutive tournaments. He will be the first Japanese-born yokozuna since his stablemaster, the former Kisenosato, retired in 2019, and will join Mongolian Hoshoryu at the sport's highest rank.</p>

          <p>In this New York Times article, Steven Pinker, a Harvard professor, defends the university against what he calls "Harvard Derangement Syndrome," arguing that the extreme invective aimed at the institution is unhinged. He acknowledges Harvard's serious ailments, including the erosion of academic freedom and a lack of viewpoint diversity, but cautions against punitive measures that could cripple the university. Pinker calls for a balanced approach that recognizes Harvard's contributions to knowledge and innovation while addressing its genuine shortcomings, urging critics to diagnose and remedy specific issues rather than resorting to destructive, all-out assaults.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK's energy regulator, Ofgem, has confirmed a fall in the energy price cap, leading to a typical household saving of ¬£11 per month starting in July. Ofgem encourages consumers to shop around for cheaper fixed-rate deals, potentially saving up to ¬£200 annually, but notes that those currently on fixed deals will not benefit from the immediate price drop. Despite the decrease, energy prices remain high, and many households are still struggling with debt to suppliers. The announcement follows recent debates over winter fuel payments and standing charges, highlighting ongoing concerns about energy affordability.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Army will implement a new Army Fitness Test (AFT) on June 1, 2025, replacing the current Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) with updated scoring standards focused on readiness and combat effectiveness. The AFT includes five events: the three-repetition maximum deadlift, hand-release push-ups, sprint-drag-carry, plank, and a two-mile run. Scoring requirements are more demanding, especially for soldiers in combat roles, with sex-neutral combat standards to ensure fairness and operational readiness. Experts note the test is challenging but achievable for those with a basic fitness foundation, emphasizing the importance of progressive training to avoid injury.</p>
