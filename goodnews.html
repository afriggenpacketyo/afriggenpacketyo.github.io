          <p>A recent study from the Japan Institute for Health Security indicates a lower rate of depressive symptoms among working-age individuals who follow a traditional Japanese diet. This diet, which includes rice, miso soup, fish, and soy products, was assessed in a self-reported study involving nearly 12,500 employees. Researchers theorize that key nutrients, such as folic acid and omega-3 fatty acids, may contribute to improved mental well-being by positively influencing neurotransmitters and reducing inflammation, though they emphasize that further research is necessary.</p>

          <p>As the threat of antibiotic resistance grows, scientists are revisiting phage therapy, a century-old medical concept that uses bacteria-eating viruses, known as bacteriophages, to combat infections. A BBC correspondent demonstrated the concept's potential by finding a phage in his home that, in a lab setting, successfully killed bacteria from a patient with a persistent infection. Once overshadowed by the success of antibiotics, phage research is experiencing a resurgence. Experts are hopeful that phages can become a crucial alternative for treating infections that modern drugs can no longer defeat.</p>

The judge found that the order, which sought to punish the firm, violated the First and Fifth Amendments and was an assault on the American legal system. The ruling is a significant victory for firms challenging what they describe as punitive presidential overreach.</p>

          <p>Despite Apple's stock performance lagging in the market, CNBC's Jim Cramer told investors he remains optimistic about the company's future. He acknowledged current challenges, such as potential tariffs related to the trade war with China and a perceived lack of groundbreaking AI announcements. However, Cramer emphasized his faith in CEO Tim Cook's leadership and pointed to the company's history of rebounding strongly from downturns. He argued that Apple's robust earnings growth rate makes it a worthwhile investment for the long term. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>NASA has informed the public that two of its research planes will be flying at unusually low altitudes over Southern California as part of a student research program. The aircraft, a P-3 Orion and a King Air B200, will be flying between 1,000 and 10,000 feet to collect atmospheric data. The flights will involve peculiar maneuvers, including vertical spirals and simulated missed landings at local airports, to sample gasses and measure surfaces. NASA issued the advisory to ensure residents are not alarmed by the low-flying aircraft.</p>
