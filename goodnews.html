          <h2>Judge Temporarily Blocks Trump's Ban on Foreign Harvard Students</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A U.S. judge issued a temporary restraining order, preventing the Trump administration from enforcing a ban that would bar Harvard University from accepting international students. Judge Allison Burroughs stated that Harvard would face "immediate and irreparable injury" if the ban were to take effect. The order responds to a lawsuit filed by Harvard, accusing President Trump of a "government vendetta" intended to stifle free speech. Trump has argued the ban is necessary for national security and has accused Harvard of not doing enough to stop antisemitism on campus.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Driven by concerns about ultra-processed foods, retailers and food brands are offering more items with fewer ingredients. For individuals with food allergies, this shift simplifies shopping and cooking, though these items can be more expensive. While some nutritionists worry about the exclusion of fortified nutrients, others emphasize that processed foods remain essential for feeding a growing population. Food brands are advised to simplify formulas and use processing technologies that maintain nutritional value while minimizing ingredients.</p>

          <p>China has tested core components of quantum-based network in space flight, as part of efforts to build an integrated space-ground system for ultra-secure communications that do not need encryption keys. A laser module and a phase encoding device were tested on a rocket that reached 2.5km. The test is a key step in China‚Äôs transition to constructing a quantum secure direct communication network. This is considered complementary to quantum key distribution.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The California Department of Motor Vehicles is warning social media users about a fake online advertisement offering discounted vehicle registration renewals. The deceptive ad requests personal information and payment through unofficial channels like Cash App. The DMV emphasizes that it never asks for personal information or payment through social media sites or transaction applications. The safest way to renew vehicle registration is directly through the official DMV website, at a DMV kiosk, or by appointment at a DMV office.</p>

          <p>Handwritten notes reveal Winston Churchill's concern over securing penicillin supplies before D-Day. Official papers show the prime minister's frustration with slow progress in obtaining the "wonder drug." Despite penicillin's discovery in Britain, the US was ahead in production, prompting Churchill to demand proposals for a more abundant supply from Great Britain. Sufficient supplies were obtained, mostly from the US, but only for battle casualties.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Labour government is set to mandate solar panel installation on most new build homes in England. The regulations, part of the Future Homes Standard, aim to improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. Developers will be required to add panels unless specific exemptions apply, such as buildings covered by shade. The government says it will be published in autumn but there will be a transitional period for developers to adjust to the regulation changes.</p>
