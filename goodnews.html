          <p>"Sesame Street" has partnered with Netflix following the Trump administration's decision to block federal funding for PBS. Netflix will offer a new season of the show and 90 hours of previous episodes to its subscribers, while PBS will retain access to episodes on the same day they are released on Netflix. The deal ensures the continuation of the educational program, which has been a cornerstone of children's media since 1969, known for its innovative approach to teaching children and addressing social issues through its characters and segments.</p>

Additionally, In-N-Out will switch from high fructose corn syrup to real sugar in its ketchup and introduce Stevia Leaf Extract as a healthier sweetener option.

          <p>Contemporary Amperex Technology (CATL), the world's largest EV battery maker, saw its shares jump as much as 14% during its Hong Kong debut, reflecting the strong demand for EV-related stocks. The IPO raised HK$35.7 billion, reportedly making it the largest global listing in 2025. CATL plans to use the funds to build a factory in Hungary, aiming to supply batteries to European automotive clients including Stellantis, BMW, and Volkswagen, capitalizing on Europe's growing EV market penetration. The company's global expansion coincides with similar moves from Chinese EV makers, despite facing trade tensions and scrutiny from the U.S.</p>

          <p>Despite ongoing trade tensions with the U.S. under President Trump, China experienced a net capital inflow of US$17.3 billion in April into its bond and equities markets. This contrasts with concerns over rising Treasury yields and a recent downgrade of the U.S. sovereign credit rating. Analysts suggest this shift reflects changing global investment dynamics, with investors moving away from U.S. dollar assets. The Bank of America noted the attractiveness of emerging markets due to a weaker U.S. dollar and China's economic recovery.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to initiate offshore "blue carbon" research, aiming to capture carbon dioxide through cultivated sea plants and store it in the deep sea. The goal is to accelerate decarbonization efforts, leveraging the high CO2 solubility in water and the carbon-absorbing properties of marine vegetation like mangroves and kelp. The Environment Ministry will commission the Japan Agency for Marine-Earth Science and Technology and Eneos Corp. to study the behavior of seaweed at considerable depths and assess the environmental impact. Japan aims to capture 1 million tons of CO2 by fiscal 2035 and 2 million tons by fiscal 2040 through blue carbon initiatives.</p>

          <p>China's central bank has reduced its key lending rates for the first time in seven months, lowering the 1-year loan prime rate to 3.0% and the 5-year LPR to 3.5%.

This decision follows a series of measures, including deposit rate reductions by state-backed lenders and lowered mortgage rates, and is part of a broader stimulus package.

Some Brexiteers criticize the acceptance of "dynamic alignment" with EU rules, while others view the deal as unambitious.

However, Senator Elizabeth Warren remains opposed, arguing the bill still poses risks to consumers and enables corruption. The measure advanced with a 66-32 vote, signaling progress towards establishing federal oversight of the stablecoin market.</p>
