        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ncuti Gatwa has departed from his role as the Doctor in 'Doctor Who' after two series, regenerating into Billie Piper, who previously played the Doctor's companion, Rose Tyler. The BBC's press release acknowledges the regeneration but teases the mystery surrounding Piper's return. Piper initially appeared in the show in 2005 alongside Christopher Eccleston and David Tennant, and has since enjoyed a successful acting career on TV and stage. Gatwa's 18-month tenure as the Doctor is the shortest since Christopher Eccleston's departure after one series in 2005, marking a surprising turn for the beloved science fiction series. The circumstances surrounding this regeneration remain unclear to fans.</p>

Betts is currently having a down year relative to his career numbers, with a .254 batting average, eight home runs, and 31 RBIs, but the team hopes for a speedy recovery.</p>

          <p>Approximately 14 million bees escaped after a tractor-trailer carrying pollinator hives overturned in Whatcom County, Washington. Authorities advised the public to avoid the area, and beekeepers assisted in re-hiving the bees. The road was closed for about 24 hours to allow the bees to return to their hives. The incident initially reported a much higher number of escaped bees, but officials later corrected the figure.</p>

          <p>As the nation's top health official, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has declared autism an "epidemic" and launched a federal effort to find environmental toxins responsible for its rise. However, many autism scientists argue that Kennedy is misdirected, as genetics are the most significant driver of autism's development, not a single environmental toxin. Experts say the increase in US autism rates is mostly explained by expanding definitions, more awareness, and better screening. Researchers fear Kennedy's fixation on outside toxins could distract from genetic research that has facilitated the development of exciting new therapies for those with profound autism.</p>

          <p>This article humorously critiques the overuse of corporate buzzwords, arguing that they impede trust and create a culture of exclusion. Studies have shown that employees who feel lower-status tend to use more jargon. The author suggests speaking in real-human-people words and reading poetry instead of relying on buzzwords to distract from the primary goal of making money. The article encourages readers to compare their boss to a summer's day rather than using corporate jargon to improve communication and foster genuine connections in the workplace.</p>
