          <p>Japanese police have apprehended four individuals, including an executive from Daigo Ivory Co., for allegedly selling elephant tusks online labeled as mammoth tusks to circumvent trade restrictions. The suspects, based in Saitama Prefecture, are accused of violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act by misleading customers. Tokyo's Metropolitan Police Department suspects the company made approximately $695,000 annually through this practice. The case emerged following a tip from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, highlighting efforts to enforce the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.</p>

          <p>China is actively seeking to attract talented scientists, benefiting from recent U.S. policies.

This initiative underscores China's ambition to become a global leader in scientific research and innovation.

          <p>China's Tiandu-1 satellite has achieved a fuel-efficient orbit synchronized with the Earth and moon, but its claim as the first spacecraft to do so is disputed by US and Canadian experts. The 3:1 resonant orbit is considered a breakthrough for lunar infrastructure, including a BeiDou-like guidance system for interplanetary exploration. However, experts point to NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) probe, which entered a similar orbit in 2011, as a prior achievement. The debate centers on whether Tiandu-1 can definitively claim the title of the first spacecraft in this type of orbit.</p>

The center has aided over 200 seals since its establishment in the 1980s, initially aimed at mitigating fishery damage caused by a seal population surge. While the center strives to return seals to their natural habitat, many die during care, and those unable to return remain in captivity for public exhibitions.</p>

          <p>The narrative that China has stolen millions of American jobs, causing a manufacturing labor market collapse, is a long-standing anti-Chinese sentiment in US politics. However, some research suggests that the 'China shock' may not be entirely negative.

          <p>Following CrowdStrike's quarterly earnings report, analysts are raising their price target for the stock, citing strong performance and positive guidance.
