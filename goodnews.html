          <p>House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries stated he is hopeful that a government shutdown can be prevented as the deadline for a spending agreement approaches. He emphasized the Democratic goal of finding bipartisan common ground to fund the government and address the needs of the American people, particularly regarding health and economic well-being. A key point of contention remains the extension of Affordable Care Act tax credits, which Democrats are pushing to secure before notices of their expiration are sent out. Both Democratic and Republican leaders, including House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, have expressed a desire to avoid a shutdown, with a meeting scheduled at the White House to continue negotiations.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>As national chain stores close, rising vacancy rates in shopping centers are creating rare opportunities for small and local businesses to secure prime real estate. The national shopping center vacancy rate increased to 5.8% in the second quarter of 2025, leading to a softening of rent growth and allowing entrepreneurs like wellness practitioners and boutique owners to negotiate more favorable lease terms. Landlords are becoming more open to non-traditional tenants to keep their properties active, offering flexible leases and other incentives. While this trend provides a lifeline for small businesses, experts note that the opportunities vary geographically and landlords still weigh the risks associated with less established tenants.

          <p>David Kaczynski, who identified his brother Ted Kaczynski as the Unabomber, has formed a deep friendship with Gary Wright, a man severely injured by one of Ted's bombs in 1987. The article explores the complex history of Ted Kaczynski, from his traumatic childhood hospitalization to his participation in a controversial Harvard psychological study, which may have contributed to his anti-social behavior. After turning his brother in, a guilt-ridden David began reaching out to victims to apologize, leading to his connection with Wright. Their shared journey of healing and forgiveness offers a powerful narrative of compassion emerging from profound tragedy, demonstrating that reconciliation is possible even in the most extreme circumstances.</p>

          <p>Self-made millionaire Ramit Sethi argues that certain mindsets prevent people from increasing their earnings, even when they desire to do so. He identifies three limiting beliefs: feeling that one should already know how to manage money, expecting that talent alone should make success easy, and procrastinating by telling oneself they will start later. Sethi emphasizes that financial management is a learned skill and that achieving goals requires patience, systems, and consistent action rather than waiting for an effortless or perfect moment. Overcoming these mental blocks is the crucial first step toward taking practical actions like negotiating a raise or starting a side business to improve financial security.

          <p>The UK's Labour Party has committed to starting the construction of three new towns in England before the next general election as part of its strategy to boost economic growth and address the housing crisis. Housing Secretary Steve Reed announced the plan, identifying Tempsford in Bedfordshire, Leeds South Bank, and Crews Hill in north London as the most promising initial sites. The initiative aims to build 1.5 million new homes by 2029, drawing inspiration from the post-war Labour government's successful new town developments. However, the plan faces challenges, including rising costs for housebuilders and concerns from local communities who feel they have not been consulted on the large-scale developments.</p>

          <h2>Experts Question Social Media Trend Touting Magnesium Lotion for Better Sleep</h2>

          <p>A viral social media trend suggests that applying magnesium lotion to the feet before bed can improve sleep quality and balance hormone levels, but health experts remain skeptical. Dermatologists and sleep psychologists point to a lack of scientific evidence supporting the claim that magnesium can be effectively absorbed through the skin, especially the thick skin on the soles of the feet, to produce systemic effects. Experts suggest any perceived benefits are more likely due to the relaxing effects of a nightly foot massage routine rather than the magnesium itself. They recommend focusing on evidence-based sleep hygiene practices, such as maintaining a consistent schedule and creating a dark, quiet environment, for more reliable results.</p>

Goodwin, who dropped out of college to pursue his mission of creating healthier drink alternatives, believes that those who feel more alive when facing complex problems are well-suited for the entrepreneurial path.

This grassroots effort, supported by organizations like the Hispanic Access Foundation, aims to address the disproportionate impact of poor air quality on communities of color and fill data gaps left by official government monitoring. The collected data on harmful pollutants like PM2.5 can be used to advocate for stronger regulations and better enforcement, especially as the current administration moves to roll back environmental protections. Participants are motivated by health concerns, such as high asthma rates, and a desire to protect their families and create healthier living environments.</p>

She cautions that living in other countries is not as inexpensive as many believe, with housing costs rising globally. Tabibian also refutes the idea that Americans are unwelcome, suggesting that anti-tourism sentiment is often about housing affordability, not individuals. Other myths she tackles include the fear of loneliness, the belief that life abroad is perfect, the pressure to choose a forever home on the first try, and the notion that it's too late in life to make such a significant move.

          <p>China is furthering its influence in Africa by promoting Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), recently opening a new facility at a university hospital in Tunisia. This initiative is part of a broader strategy of health diplomacy that has seen Beijing establish numerous TCM centers across the continent in countries like South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Morocco. For decades, China has sent medical teams to Africa, using healthcare cooperation to build goodwill and cultural ties. The opening of another TCM training facility in Chad, attended by a provincial vice-governor, underscores the official importance placed on this form of soft power to strengthen relationships and expand China's presence in the region.</p>

          <p>Despite the persistent threat of fires in cities, the United States has seen remarkable progress in fire safety over the past 40 years. Since 1980, the per-capita civilian fire death rate has been reduced by approximately two-thirds, and the total number of reported fires has been cut in half. This success is attributed to an accumulation of small but significant improvements in public safety measures and building codes. Key factors include the widespread adoption of working smoke alarms, the increased use of automatic sprinkler systems, safer furniture materials, a dramatic decrease in smoking, and enhanced electrical and heating safety standards, all of which have collectively saved countless lives.</p>

Following a deal to support rare earth miner MP Materials, the administration is now looking at similar arrangements for other key resources like lithium, with Lithium Americas being a potential target. Industry leaders argue that federal support, particularly price guarantees, is essential to de-risk private investment in a market historically manipulated by Chinese price suppression.

          <p>An ancient wooden canoe discovered in Fort Myers during the cleanup after Hurricane Ian in 2022 has been preserved by state archeologists. The 9-foot vessel is unique among the 450 historic canoes found in Florida because it is made of mahogany, suggesting it may have originated outside the state, possibly in the Caribbean. Tool marks indicate it was crafted with iron tools, placing its creation in the historical period after European contact. While radiocarbon dating has so far been inconclusive, investigators are exploring the theory that it could be a dugout cayuco made by Spanish settlers in the 16th century, adding another layer to Florida's rich maritime history.</p>
