This move is seen as a major vote of confidence in the company, which has been struggling with public backlash over healthcare costs and a Justice Department investigation, leading to a nearly 50% stock decline earlier in the year.

          <p>Carrie Wheeler has resigned as CEO of the online real estate company Opendoor, following a period of intense pressure from investors and a lagging stock price. The move comes after activist investors, including hedge fund manager Eric Jackson, publicly called for a change in leadership to revive the company's fortunes. Opendoor, which uses technology to buy and sell homes, has struggled in the high-interest-rate environment, and its stock has seen extreme volatility. The company has named a technology chief as interim leader while it searches for a permanent CEO.</p>

This move would align with President Trump's goal of bringing more high-end technology manufacturing back to the U.S., ensuring domestic control over critical components for defense and AI.

The judge ruled that the state violated the defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial by failing to issue an indictment more than two years after the initial arrest. This decision is seen as a significant victory for opponents of the training center, as the judge noted the state appeared to be purposefully delaying the case, a tactic activists have described as "process is the punishment."</p>
