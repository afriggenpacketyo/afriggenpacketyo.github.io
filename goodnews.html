          <p>Jim Lovell, the celebrated astronaut who commanded the perilous Apollo 13 mission and safely guided its crew back to Earth after an in-flight explosion, has passed away at the age of 97. Remembered for his "unshakeable optimism," Lovell was a key figure in the space race, becoming the first person to fly to the Moon twice, though he never landed. NASA praised him for turning a potential catastrophe into one of its most triumphant successes, a story immortalized in the film "Apollo 13." His life was marked by a lifelong passion for rocketry and distinguished service as a US Navy pilot and astronaut.</p>

          <p>Welsh winger Louis Rees-Zammit has decided to end his venture into American football and return to rugby union, cutting short his time with the NFL's Jacksonville Jaguars. Despite making progress, a recent back injury and coaching changes reportedly influenced his decision to leave a potential £712,000 salary. Experts suggest that while athletically gifted, the transition to the NFL's technical demands was a significant challenge. His return is seen as a major boost for Welsh rugby, with coaches and former players believing his experience will make him a more mature and skilled player.</p>

          <p>The England women's rugby team, known as the Red Roses, is preparing for a crucial match against France as a key step in their journey towards the World Cup final. Wing Abby Dow described their ambition as climbing "Everest," a metaphor reinforced by a motivational speech from an actual Everest climber. The team is focused on learning from their narrow Six Nations victory over France, aiming to maintain intensity and not "put the handbrake back on." Head coach John Mitchell is prioritizing a strong performance over simply extending their winning streak, viewing the tough match as essential preparation for the greater challenges ahead.</p>

          <p>In a highly anticipated matchup between two of baseball's most decorated pitchers, Clayton Kershaw led the Los Angeles Dodgers to a 5-1 victory over Max Scherzer and the Toronto Blue Jays. Both veteran aces, who have a combined 6,500 strikeouts and six Cy Young Awards, delivered strong six-inning performances in what felt like a pivotal late-season game. The key moment came when Dodgers' Mookie Betts hit a two-run homer off Scherzer in the fifth inning. The game celebrated the enduring excellence and competitive spirit of two players who have defined a generation of pitching.</p>

          <p>A team of Chinese scientists has successfully synthesized a high-purity hexagonal diamond in a laboratory, a breakthrough that recreates a rare material first discovered in a meteorite in 1967. This form of diamond, known as lonsdaleite, has a different atomic structure from common cubic diamonds and is believed to form under immense heat and pressure. While other teams have attempted to create it, the Chinese researchers from the Centre for High Pressure Science and Technology Advanced Research published in 'Nature' that they produced macroscopic crystals. This achievement provides definitive proof of the material's existence and opens new possibilities for materials science.</p>

          <p>Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback Shedeur Sanders delivered a standout performance in his NFL preseason debut, earning praise from figures like LeBron James. Sanders, who was a fifth-round draft pick, started the game due to injuries and led the team on three touchdown drives, completing 14 of 23 passes for 138 yards and two touchdowns. He displayed significant poise and awareness, potentially improving his position on the team's depth chart. Despite the strong showing, Sanders and his coach remained focused on the process of earning a role on the team.</p>

The crew, consisting of two US astronauts, one Japanese astronaut, and a Russian cosmonaut, is expected to splash down in the Pacific Ocean. Their return concludes a successful 146-day mission during which they conducted over 200 scientific experiments, including studies on plant growth and cell behavior in microgravity.

          <p>A 30-year-old London entrepreneur, Lucy Rout, has launched Haystack Dating, a company that hosts in-person events to help people make meaningful connections outside of dating apps. After experiencing "dating burnout" from the cycle of ghosting and bad behavior online, she developed a model where attendees are matched into small groups based on an algorithm of similar interests. The events, which center around an activity, have proven popular, with hundreds attending and a high rate of return users. This trend reflects a broader shift away from dating apps, as users seek more accountable and positive social interactions.</p>

          <p>Actor Chris Hemsworth has described learning he has a significantly higher genetic predisposition for Alzheimer's disease as a "gear shift" in his life's motivations. The discovery was made during a genetic test for his show "Limitless," revealing he carries two copies of the APOE4 gene, which increases his likelihood of developing the disorder by eight to ten times. The 41-year-old star said the news prompted a deeper reflection on his purpose and a greater focus on living well. It also influenced the second season of his show, making him more personally invested in exploring health and wellness topics.</p>

          <p>A consumer trend dubbed "treatonomics" is on the rise, as people spend on everything from small 'pick-me-ups' like lipstick to larger experiences like concert tickets to boost their mood during uncertain economic times. This phenomenon, an evolution of the "lipstick effect," reflects a shift in consumer priorities, where everyday sacrifices are made to afford memorable, life-affirming events. Analysts note that with traditional life milestones like home ownership becoming less attainable for many, consumers are instead celebrating smaller "inch-stones." This behavior is expected to persist as global economic uncertainty continues. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Firefighters in Córdoba, Spain, have successfully extinguished a fire that broke out inside the city's historic Mosque-Cathedral, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city's mayor praised the "rapid and magnificent intervention" of the fire crews for averting a potential catastrophe. The blaze reportedly started in one of the chapels, possibly due to a short circuit in an electric sweeper, and was brought under control quickly. The incident evoked memories of the 2019 fire at Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris, but fortunately, this event resulted in a much better outcome.</p>
