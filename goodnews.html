        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>In an opinion piece, legal scholar Jonathan Turley contrasts the views of academic and media elites, who increasingly label the U.S. Constitution as "broken," with the patriotism he observed in Grand Lake, Colorado. He argues that while some prominent professors describe the system as a crisis rooted in authoritarianism, most Americans see the Constitution as a unifying gift. Turley suggests this disconnect is not a constitutional crisis but rather a crisis of faith among a specific establishment class. He concludes that the document remains a shared covenant that defines the nation.</p>

          <p>NASA's James Webb Space Telescope has captured highly detailed images of Sagittarius B2, the most active star-forming region in the Milky Way galaxy. Located near the galactic center's supermassive black hole, the region is densely packed with stars and cosmic dust. The telescope's infrared instruments pierced through the clouds to reveal young stars and molecularly rich areas, providing new insights into the star formation process. Researchers hope these observations will help explain why star formation is relatively low in the galactic center despite the abundance of gas.</p>

          <p>Recent U.S. economic reports indicate unexpected strength, potentially easing concerns about a labor market slowdown. Initial jobless claims for the week ended September 20 fell to 218,000, significantly below forecasts, suggesting companies are hesitant to lay off workers. Additionally, the Commerce Department revised second-quarter GDP growth upward to 3.8%, driven by stronger consumer spending. This robust data comes just after the Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate, citing rising downside risks to employment, creating a complex picture for future monetary policy.

          <p>The French navy has successfully intercepted a fishing vessel off the coast of West Africa, seizing 9.6 tons of cocaine with an estimated market value of over $600 million. The operation was conducted by two naval ships following intelligence from anti-drug authorities and British police. This significant seizure is part of France's long-standing Corymbe naval mission, which aims to enhance security in the Gulf of Guinea. The incident underscores the region's role as a major transit route for international drug trafficking operations heading towards Europe.</p>

          <p>A new article delves into the evolving landscape of dating and relationships among Gen Z, highlighting a complex lexicon that includes terms like "situationships," "sneaky links," and "breadcrumbing." Unlike previous generations who followed more linear relationship paths, many Zoomers navigate a wider, more fluid array of casual entanglements, often prioritizing emotional detachment to avoid vulnerability. This cultural shift is influenced by online life, a desire for autonomy, and a world perceived as unstable. While this provides more personal freedom, it can also lead to confusion and stress in forming intimate connections.</p>

          <p>FIFA is set to discuss a proposal from South America's governing body, Conmebol, to expand the 2030 World Cup to 64 teams. The tournament is already set to grow from 32 to 48 teams for the 2026 edition. Proponents argue a 64-team format would be a fitting way to mark the tournament's centenary and would be more inclusive, while critics, including UEFA's president, worry it would dilute the competition's quality and strain logistics. If approved, the tournament would double in size in just eight years, significantly altering the landscape of international football.</p>

This article provides an overview of current national average CD rates for various terms, while also highlighting that top rates from online banks are significantly higher. It explains that short-term CDs currently offer better yields than long-term ones due to an inverted yield curve. To maximize returns, consumers are advised to compare offers from online banks, consider short-term CDs, and potentially use a laddering strategy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The U.S. Department of Education has launched the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) form a week ahead of its expected October 1st date. Experts view this early opening as a significant benefit for students and families, as it provides more time to apply for federal aid like loans, grants, and work-study programs. An earlier start is crucial because some financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis. The timely release is a welcome development after the previous cycle was plagued by glitches and delays that led to lower completion rates.</p>
