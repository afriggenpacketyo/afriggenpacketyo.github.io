          <p>Marks and Spencer (M&S) has resumed taking online orders after halting purchases through its website in April due to a significant cyber attack. Shoppers can now buy fashion items for home delivery in England, Scotland, and Wales, with beauty and homeware products to follow soon. Click and collect and delivery services to Northern Ireland are expected to resume in the coming weeks. The cyber attack, which occurred over the Easter weekend, initially affected click and collect and contactless payments, leading to an estimated ¬£300 million hit to this year's profits. The company is working to fully restore services by July, though some customers report limited stock availability. </p>

          <p>Gen Z has been showing an increasing interest in religion, reversing recent trends of declining religious attendance in America. Experts are exploring the reasons behind this phenomenon, with hypotheses ranging from rebellion against atheist parents to the search for community and answers in a chaotic world. Catholicism is seeing a rise in young men. Some suggest that in a society where men feel overlooked, the church provides a place where they have a privileged position in that hierarchy. The phenomenon has been noticed by political scientists and religious leaders alike, with many seeing it as a reaction to the current social and political climate. </p>

          <p>President Trump is deploying hundreds of active-duty Marines to Los Angeles, along with an additional 2,000 National Guard troops, in response to ongoing protests against ICE immigration raids. This decision has been criticized by California's Governor Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as an unnecessary escalation. In other news, U.S. drug-related deaths among young people are declining after a decade of increases, with provisional CDC data showing a significant drop in fatal overdoses last year. Experts attribute this decline to factors such as better healthcare and increased caution among young people regarding drug use, though concerns remain about potential budget cuts to addiction programs. The deployment of troops has caused many to be concerned. </p>

          <p>David Bull, a TalkTV host, has been named the new chairman of Reform UK, succeeding Zia Yusuf, who resigned after disagreements over a burka ban. Bull's role will focus on inspiring the party's base and providing leadership to volunteers, while Yusuf will lead the party's "Doge team," aimed at cutting wasteful spending in Reform-controlled councils. Nigel Farage, the party leader, credited Yusuf with building Reform's infrastructure and stated that the reshuffle has made the party stronger. The party is splitting Yusuf's role into multiple posts, including a new head of operations and head of treasury, with further leadership changes expected in the coming weeks. The leadership believes that the party is in a better place. </p>

The estimated travel time between London and Frankfurt will be approximately five hours, and around five hours and 20 minutes to Geneva. Eurostar's chief executive, Gwendoline Cazenave, cited strong demand for train travel across Europe despite higher operational costs and inflation. The firm is also considering direct lines to Geneva from Amsterdam and Brussels and reported a 5% increase in passengers in 2024 compared to the previous year. </p>

Gay journeyed to Northern Ireland to chart the sacrifices McIlroy's parents made and documented the impact of the Troubles on McIlroy's family.

          <p>Anduril, a defense tech company, has topped the 2025 CNBC Disruptor 50 list, reflecting a growing trend of interest and investment in the defense technology sector. This marks the first time a defense tech company has led the list, with other companies like Flock Safety, Saronic Technologies, and Shield AI also included. The sector's growth is driven by increased funding, with President Trump proposing an increase in defense spending focused on modernizing military capabilities. The surge also reflects the increasing focus on dual-use technologies, as seen with Anduril taking over Microsoft's augmented reality headset program for the military. </p>

          <p>Missouri GOP Senator Josh Hawley plans to introduce legislation to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, aligning himself with some of the most liberal members of Congress. The "Higher Wages for American Workers Act" would raise the federal standard starting in 2026 and adjust for inflation in subsequent years. Vermont Democratic Senator Peter Welch is co-sponsoring the bill. This move puts Hawley at odds with conservative party orthodoxy, which has traditionally opposed a federal minimum wage increase. The legislation is part of Hawley's "Pro-Worker Framework for the 119th Congress," which includes proposals to strengthen protections for union jobs. (not investment advice)</p>
