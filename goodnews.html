          <p>This Fox News article reports that despite President Trump's decision to bypass Israel during his Middle East tour, experts believe his visit advanced policies aligning with Israeli interests. Trump emphasized key points reflecting Israeli priorities, such as condemning Hamas, calling for Saudi Arabia to join the Abraham Accords, and warning Iran. While some Israeli commentators expressed discomfort at being excluded from the tour, others emphasized that Trump's "America First" approach ultimately supports Israel. Experts also highlighted the opportunity for Israel to leverage developments in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Syria to advance its interests, particularly regarding normalization with Saudi Arabia and ensuring Syria follows a non-jihadist path.</p>

          <p>This article from The Guardian discusses how US cancer researchers are looking to fecal waste for treatment clues, with the Mayo Clinic biobank at the forefront of this effort. The biobank is part of a years-long effort to personalize medicine by understanding how the microbiome changes how patients respond to cancer medications. Researchers are experimenting with colonizing patients' guts with new bacteria through fecal transplants and investigating "crapsules" and "crispr-ing" the gut microbiome. The work comes as scientific institutions are under attack by the Trump administration, which has proposed large cuts to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>

          <p>This Los Angeles Times opinion piece suggests that the Lakers should focus on drafting a more mature, experienced player in the upcoming NBA draft. The author argues that the league's economic shifts and the NCAA's NIL policy have made older players who have proven their ability to handle money and fame more valuable. With the Lakers in need of a big man, the columnist suggests they consider a 24-year-old college graduate with a good head on his shoulders, rather than chasing a "high ceiling" prospect.</p>

          <p>This BBC article reports that two drug smugglers have been jailed after being caught with ¬£37m of cocaine in an inflatable boat off the Suffolk coast. Bruce Knowles and Ferhat Gumrukguoglu were arrested by the National Crime Agency (NCA) after being found with the haul near Benacre Broad. The court heard how the pair had trialled a "dry run" of the operation in April before attempting the real thing two months later. Judge Benson took the pair's previous guilty pleas into consideration, but said their "substantial and important" role meant their sentences would be significant.</p>
