          <p>Taco Bell is expanding its "Live Más Café," a beverage-focused concept integrated into existing restaurants, to attract younger customers and grow its drink business. The initiative features a menu of specialty coffees, chillers, and refrescas, aiming to capitalize on the "little treat" culture popular among Gen Z and millennials. Unlike standalone spinoffs from competitors, this sub-brand operates within Taco Bell locations, with plans to open 30 cafés by year-end. This strategy is part of the company's goal to generate $5 billion in beverage sales by 2030 and maintain its strong performance.</p>

          <p>Spotify is expanding its "managed accounts" feature to the U.S. and other major markets, giving parents on its Premium Family plan greater control over their children's listening experience. These accounts, designed for users under 13, operate within the main Spotify app but allow parents to filter explicit content, block specific songs or artists, and disable video features. Unlike the separate Spotify Kids app, this integration provides a more familiar interface for children while ensuring their listening habits do not affect their parents' personalized recommendations. The update aims to create a safer environment for young users.</p>

          <p>The Social Security Administration has announced a 2.8% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2026, which will increase the average monthly retirement benefit by approximately $56 starting in January. This annual adjustment is intended to help benefits for around 75 million recipients keep pace with inflation. The 2026 increase is slightly higher than the 2.5% adjustment in 2025 but remains in line with the 20-year average, reflecting a moderation of inflation from its recent peaks. Beneficiaries will be notified of their new payment amounts in December. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Despite recent attention on mortgage rates hitting three-year lows, they have actually been on a downward trend for most of 2025, falling from around 7% at the start of the year to near 6%. A common misconception is that mortgage rates move in lockstep with Federal Reserve rate cuts, but this is not always the case, as lenders often price in expected changes in advance. The article also notes that multiple factors influence mortgage rates, including the 10-year Treasury yield and an individual borrower's financial profile. Understanding these nuances can help consumers make more informed decisions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Procter & Gamble exceeded fiscal first-quarter earnings and revenue expectations, driven by strong performance in its beauty and grooming divisions. However, the company reported flat overall sales volume, indicating that while higher prices boosted revenue, consumer demand is waning in some categories like health and home care. P&G's CFO noted a "K-shaped" consumer behavior, with higher-income shoppers buying in bulk while others are stretching product use. Despite this challenging environment and competition from rivals, the company reiterated its full-year sales and earnings forecast. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>With average credit card APRs at a multi-decade high of over 22%, consumers can take proactive steps to reduce their interest rates. The article suggests several methods, including directly asking the card issuer for a lower rate, which can be effective for customers with a good payment history. Other options involve transferring balances to a card with a 0% introductory APR or consolidating debt with a lower-interest personal loan. For those with lower credit scores, enrolling in a debt management program or applying for a temporary hardship program can also provide significant financial relief. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Police in Bavaria have seized millions of euros worth of forged artworks in a large-scale operation targeting a criminal ring that produced fake paintings attributed to masters like Picasso, Rembrandt, and Frida Kahlo. The investigation, which spanned Germany, Switzerland, and Liechtenstein, centers on a 77-year-old German man and ten alleged accomplices. The scheme was uncovered when the main suspect attempted to sell a counterfeit version of Rembrandt's "De Staalmeesters" for over £100 million, despite the original being displayed in Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum. A large number of suspected forgeries were confiscated during coordinated raids.</p>

          <p>The U.S. consumer price index rose at a 3.0% annual rate in September, a figure slightly cooler than economists' expectations of 3.1%. On a monthly basis, prices increased by 0.3%, largely driven by a 4.1% jump in gasoline prices, while core inflation, which excludes food and energy, also showed moderation. This long-awaited report, released late due to the government shutdown, keeps the door open for the Federal Reserve to implement another interest rate cut at its upcoming meeting. The Fed is weighing the risk of persistent inflation against signs of a softening labor market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A new study analyzing a decade of data from the Murchison Widefield Array telescope in Australia challenges the theory that the universe had a "cold start" to its "Epoch of Reionization." Researchers found no evidence of the signal that would be present if the universe was extremely cold just before the first stars formed. Instead, their findings suggest that some form of heating occurred around 800 million years after the Big Bang, likely caused by X-rays from early black holes and stellar remnants. This discovery provides new insights into the conditions that prevailed at the end of the cosmic dark ages.</p>

          <p>A cold snap is forecast for the UK this weekend, with temperatures expected to drop below average, potentially bringing the first snowfall of the season to some areas. The change in weather, driven by a cold Arctic airflow from Storm Benjamin in the North Sea, will coincide with the end of British Summer Time. Strong, gusty northerly winds will make conditions feel particularly raw, especially along eastern coasts. While some sunshine is expected, daytime highs will only range between 8 and 11°C, feeling up to 5°C colder due to the wind chill.</p>

          <p>The Welsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru has won the Caerphilly by-election, ending a 100-year period of Labour Party dominance in the constituency. Plaid's candidate, Lindsay Whittle, secured 47% of the vote, marking a significant 27% swing from Labour. The result is a major blow to the ruling Labour party in Wales and a historic victory for Plaid Cymru, whose leader stated the party can now "win in any part of Wales." The by-election was triggered by the death of the previous Member of the Senedd, and the high turnout suggests strong voter engagement.</p>
