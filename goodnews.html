A report published by the Women and Equalities Committee states that paternity leave rules "entrench outdated gender stereotypes". The report recommends increasing paternity pay to 90% or more and paternity leave to six weeks. The report also looked at shared parental leave, which was introduced in 2014 and allows parents to share up to 50 weeks of leave and up to 37 weeks of pay after the birth or adoption of a child.</p>

          <p>Brookfield Renewable (NYSE: BEPC)(NYSE: BEP), a leading renewable energy dividend stock, is predicted to crush the S&P 500's returns over the next decade. The company has a strong investment-grade balance sheet and estimates that inflation escalation clauses within its existing power purchase agreements (PPAs) will power 2% to 3% annual growth in its funds from operations (FFO) per share. The company expects to grow its earnings per share at a rate of more than 10% annually for the next several years. Given the lackluster returns of many high-yielding dividend stocks, investors seeking market-crushing returns will probably overlook Brookfield Renewable because of its more than 5% yield (not investment advice).</p>
