          <h2>Decision Coach Explains How Overthinking Can Hinder Effective Decision-Making</h2>

          <p>A decision coach who has worked with over 500 clients explains that people often take too long to make decisions, which paradoxically makes the process harder. Lengthy deliberations lead to an overwhelming amount of details and an acute awareness of what one would give up by choosing one option over another. This over-analysis drains energy and mental space, making life demonstrably worse. Instead, the coach recommends making decisions more quickly to avoid exhausting oneself with endless pros and cons lists. The article suggests that sometimes a faster decision, though potentially imperfect, can be more beneficial than prolonged indecision.</p>

          <p>The Supreme Court has declined to hear a challenge to Maryland's ban on assault weapons, leaving the state's law intact. The decision was split, with three conservative justices dissenting and expressing their view that the court should address the constitutionality of such bans. Justice Kavanaugh indicated skepticism about the bans and suggested the court would likely take up the issue in the near future. The Maryland law was enacted after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting and bans dozens of firearms, including the AR-15 and AK-47, while also limiting magazine capacity. The case highlights ongoing debates over gun control and Second Amendment rights.</p>

          <p>A new study suggests that following the MIND diet, which combines elements of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, can significantly reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, even when adopted later in life. Participants who closely adhered to the MIND diet had a 9% lower risk of dementia, while those who improved their adherence over a 10-year period saw a 25% reduction in risk. The MIND diet emphasizes brain-healthy foods like leafy greens, berries, nuts, and olive oil. This research reinforces previous findings highlighting the benefits of plant-focused diets in preventing cognitive decline and promoting brain health as people age.</p>

          <p>The U.S. office market is undergoing a significant shift, with more office space being removed through demolitions and conversions than added through new construction for the first time in at least 25 years. CBRE Group data indicates that 23.3 million square feet of office space is slated for demolition or conversion by the end of the year, while only 12.7 million square feet of new space is expected to be completed. This trend is driven by the rise of remote work, which has led to record-high office vacancies. The reduction in office space is expected to contribute to lowering vacancy rates and stabilizing rents.</p>

          <p>A $300,000 annuity can provide a substantial stream of monthly income during retirement, but its suitability varies depending on individual financial goals and risk tolerance. Immediate fixed annuities can offer predictable monthly payments, with amounts varying based on age and gender. For example, a 70-year-old man could receive approximately $2,192 per month, while a 70-year-old woman could receive around $2,072 per month. While annuities offer protection against outliving savings and can supplement Social Security, they are not liquid and may have tax implications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The world's increasing demand for clean energy technologies is driving a surge in the need for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and copper. These minerals are essential for producing solar panels, batteries, and electric motors. However, the uneven distribution of these resources and potential supply chain disruptions pose challenges. Countries are redoubling their efforts to find more of these materials, leading to increased mining activities and research into alternative materials and more efficient extraction methods. Securing a stable supply of critical minerals is crucial for the transition to a cleaner energy future.</p>

          <p>A veterans group in Guam is concerned about potential cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and how they may impact the services they provide. The group, "GOT YOUR 671," offers therapy and support for veterans dealing with physical and psychological wounds sustained in combat. They rely on VA-issued grants to keep their doors open, and the group worries that their funding could be at risk. Despite a proposed increase in discretionary funding for the VA in 2026, the agency's cuts to contractors remain a concern for the group and the veterans they serve.</p>
