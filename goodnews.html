          <p>The FDA has outlined stricter regulatory guidance for future Covid-19 vaccine boosters, requiring clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness for healthy adults and children. This new approach differentiates approval standards based on patient risk, with less stringent evidence required for high-risk individuals like older adults and those with underlying conditions. The FDA will now demand robust data from randomized, controlled trials for healthy individuals, showing actual clinical outcomes before granting full approval. The change comes as HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. overhauls health agencies and U.S. immunization policy.</p>

          <p>A new study using machine learning casts doubt on the presence of flowing water on Mars, which scientists previously believed was indicated by dark streaks on cliff sides and crater walls. The analysis of over 86,000 high-resolution satellite images found that these streaks, known as recurring slope lineae (RSLs), are not associated with factors suggesting a liquid or frost origin. Instead, the study suggests a dry origin, linking the streaks to above-average wind speeds and dust deposition, particularly near recent-impact craters.</p>

By empowering children to embrace healthy eating habits early on, they are more likely to carry these positive behaviors into adulthood.

While parents often focus on vegetables and limiting added sugar, beans provide essential nutrients and promote long-term health.</p>
