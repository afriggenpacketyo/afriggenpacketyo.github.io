          <p>This New York Times Op-Doc presents a short documentary about Kim Lalonde, a carnival worker in Quebec who dreams of pursuing other passions but hesitates to leave the close-knit carnival community and his best friend. The documentary explores the tension between Lalonde's desire for freedom and his deep-rooted connections to the carnival world. Director Isabelle Grignon-Francke captures the lives of individuals seeking escape and hope within the vibrant, yet transient, environment of amusement parks and fairgrounds. The piece delves into the complexities of kinship, new possibilities, and the universal human experience of dreaming of a different life.</p>

          <p>Jafar Panahi, an Iranian director previously imprisoned and banned from filmmaking, won the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival for his film *It Was Just an Accident*, a revenge thriller critical of oppressive regimes. Panahi, who was cheered as he urged fellow Iranians to set aside their differences and problems, called for freedom in Iran and for an end to restrictions on personal expression. The film, shot in secret and based on Panahi's prison experiences, tells the story of ordinary Iranians confronting a man they believe tortured them. Despite the risk of prosecution, Panahi vowed to return to Tehran after the festival.</p>
