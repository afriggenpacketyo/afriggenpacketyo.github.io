          <h2>Exxon Mobil's Earnings Surpass Expectations Despite Profit Decline Due to Lower Oil Prices</h2>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Exxon Mobil's first-quarter earnings exceeded Wall Street forecasts, although profits decreased compared to the previous year due to falling crude oil prices driven by concerns over President Trump's tariffs impacting global demand. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana, along with cost-cutting efforts, helped offset the negative impact of lower oil prices. The company reported earnings per share of $1.76 versus the expected $1.73, with revenues at $83.13 billion, falling short of the $86.72 billion expectation. Exxon returned $9.1 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The Scottish government has decided to postpone plans for a new misogyny law until after next year's Holyrood election, citing insufficient time to draft a law that aligns with the recent Supreme Court judgement on the definition of a woman. Instead, ministers will amend existing hate crime legislation to include protections based on sex. Additionally, the government will not be bringing forward legislation to end conversion therapy during this term, hoping for a UK-wide solution instead.</p>

          <p>Christina Li's "The Manor of Dreams" is a Gothic haunted house novel featuring two families brought together by the will of a deceased Oscar-winning actress. The story unfolds in a crumbling mansion in Altadena, where secrets and ghostly occurrences affect each character differently. The novel delves into themes of family, exploitation, and identity, with a surprising queer romance woven throughout the narrative.
