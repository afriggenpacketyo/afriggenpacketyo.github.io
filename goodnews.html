          <p>Reform UK leader Nigel Farage stated that he forgave Zia Yusuf after Yusuf criticized MP Sarah Pochin's call for a burka ban, which led to Yusuf's brief resignation as chairman. Yusuf regretted his social media post, attributing it to exhaustion, and will now lead the party's Doge unit focused on cutting wasteful spending. The controversy began when Pochin questioned the Prime Minister about banning the burka, prompting Yusuf, who is Muslim, to call her action "dumb" since it wasn't party policy. Yusuf clarified that he would consider banning face coverings in public but believes assimilation is a challenge in the UK, and Farage seems willing to move past the disagreement.</p>

          <p>Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is set to begin, with expectations centered on updates to artificial intelligence technology and refinements to Apple Intelligence. Analysts anticipate improvements to Siri and its integration with AI platforms like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT, along with a more straightforward nomenclature for its operating systems. The company is also expected to unveil a redesign of its operating system interface, called "Liquid Glass," featuring a glassy visual aesthetic. While some analysts are underwhelmed by the slower rollout of Apple Intelligence, others believe this event marks the start of AI monetization for the Apple ecosystem. Apple Intelligence has been slow to roll out, but the company is working hard to make it worth the wait.</p>

          <p>Tropical Storm Barbara strengthened into a hurricane off the coast of western Mexico, becoming the first hurricane of the eastern Pacific season. The National Hurricane Center reported maximum sustained winds of 75 mph and a northwestward movement, issuing no coastal watches or warnings but cautioning about life-threatening surf and rip currents. Heavy rainfall is expected in coastal areas of Guerrero, Michoacan, Colima, and Jalisco states, with potential localized flooding. A second storm, Tropical Storm Cosme, is also strengthening off the coast, and is expected to reach near-hurricane strength before turning to the northeast. The hurricane season is off to an active start, and there is a need to be prepared for potential impacts.</p>

          <p>Vantage Data Centers has raised 720 million euros ($820 million) in an asset-backed securitization deal to fund its cloud and AI data center expansion in Europe, marking the first deal of its kind in the region. The funds will primarily be used to pay off existing construction loans for four data centers in Germany, and the company will pay an average coupon of 4.3% on the issued bonds. Investor demand exceeded the amount raised, indicating strong confidence in the data center market, and the four facilities are fully leased to hyperscale customers. This deal reflects the growing demand for data centers driven by Big Tech's increasing AI usage and positions Vantage as a key player in the European data center market. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Experts are questioning Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s emphasis on environmental toxins as the primary cause of autism, arguing that genetic research has made significant strides in understanding the condition. Kennedy launched a federal effort to investigate environmental factors, but scientists contend that genetics play a more significant role, with hundreds of genes linked to autism. They fear his focus on toxins could divert resources from genetic research, which has led to promising new therapies. Scientists are concerned that Kennedy's approach may distract from the progress being made in understanding the genetic basis of autism.</p>
