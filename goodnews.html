          <p>Chelsea's Enzo Maresca is set to face his former mentor, Manuel Pellegrini, in the Uefa Conference League final. Maresca credits Pellegrini with inspiring him to become a coach during their time together at Malaga. The two managers maintain regular contact, and Pellegrini recognizes Maresca's coaching abilities, which were further honed during his time with Pep Guardiola. Maresca's tactical evolution, particularly his push for central defenders to play inverted full-back roles, was influential in Manchester City's historic treble win in 2023.</p>

          <p>The Japanese government is set to deliver lower-priced stockpiled rice to consumers in rural areas to combat surging rice prices. This decision follows the suspension of orders from major retailers to prioritize smaller shops.

          <p>China has patented a next-generation self-cooling turbine blade that could significantly enhance the performance of jet engines for both military and civilian aircraft. The new alloy turbine blades can withstand temperatures up to 15% higher than existing versions, leading to greater engine thrust, better fuel efficiency, and longer service life. The Beijing Institute of Aeronautical Materials under Aero Engine Corporation of China (AECC) received the patent, solidifying its leadership in high-performance propulsion technologies. The innovation addresses the degradation of conventional turbine blades due to extreme heat exposure.</p>

          <p>A report backed by London Mayor Sadiq Khan has concluded that the possession of small quantities of cannabis for personal use should be decriminalized. The report, by the London Drugs Commission, recommends removing natural cannabis from the Misuse of Drugs Act. Sadiq Khan stated that current rules "cannot be justified" and that the report provides a "compelling, evidence-based case" for decriminalization. Critics argue that reducing legal consequences would wrongly signal that cannabis is less harmful, while supporters claim it would create a more equitable and just system.</p>

The Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales (WTSWW) counted 43,626 puffins on Skomer Island this year, a new record high. Conservationists believe the thriving puffin population is due to the abundance of food and lack of predators on the island. While the puffin population is thriving in Pembrokeshire, the species is still listed as vulnerable to extinction on the global International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list.</p>
