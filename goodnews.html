        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with record high rice prices due to a poor harvest in 2023, Japanese supermarket chains like Aeon, Ito-Yokado, and Seiyu are expanding their offerings of foreign-grown rice, including rice from California and Taiwan, to provide more affordable options for consumers. Aeon plans to sell California-sourced rice at approximately 15% less than the average price of Japanese-grown rice, aiming to increase overall rice consumption by giving customers a choice. The U.S. Ambassador to Japan hailed Aeon's commitment to American rice farmers as "historic," acknowledging Japan's discerning standards for food quality. The average price of rice at Japanese supermarkets reached a record 4,268 yen per 5 kg in early May, prompting the government to consider measures to stabilize prices.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the UK set to ban disposable vapes starting June 1st, many vapers are panic-buying to stockpile their preferred devices. Concerns over environmental impact and youth vaping have driven the ban, but some ex-smokers like Baroness Claire Fox credit disposable vapes with helping them quit smoking, finding rechargeable alternatives less appealing due to taste issues. Retailers are seeing sales surge as customers stock up, while some worry about the ban's impact on their businesses and the potential return to traditional cigarettes for some vapers. A Censuswide poll indicates that while many disposable vape users will switch to rechargeable devices or quit vaping, a significant percentage plan to stockpile or revert to smoking.</p>

          <p>Japan's chief tariff negotiator, Ryosei Akazawa, reported that the United States is increasingly recognizing Japan's economic importance during recent trade talks with U.S. officials.

In a related development, Trump approved Nippon Steel's plan to buy U.S. Steel, signaling potential progress in trade relations. While Japan maintains its stance that all additional tariffs should be eliminated, there are indications that they may be willing to compromise to secure an early deal.</p>

          <p>A water leak has caused damage to all seven floors of Ginsburg Hall, the newest computer science building at USC's Viterbi School of Engineering. The leak originated from the attic of the building, which houses high-tech labs and equipment. The building, which opened in September, is known for its advanced technology and sustainable design. Researchers have been notified to check their equipment, and the building has been closed for repairs.</p>

          <h2>Study: Backyard Feeders Changed Hummingbird Beak Shape</h2>

          <p>A new study suggests that the prevalence of hummingbird feeders has altered the size and shape of Anna's Hummingbirds' beaks in the western United States. The study found that beaks have become longer and more slender to better access nectar from feeders. Male beaks also grew pointier, potentially to fight off competition at feeders. The range of the hummingbird has expanded northward, following the growing popularity of bird feeders.</p>

          <p>Eight people have been convicted in a French court in connection with the 2016 armed robbery of Kim Kardashian in Paris. The robbers, dubbed the "grandpa robbers" due to their ages, stole jewelry worth $10 million. Kardashian testified earlier this month, stating she feared for her life during the ordeal. The defendants received prison sentences ranging from three to eight years, with some sentences suspended.</p>

          <p>King Charles is preparing for a historic visit to Canada, where he will become the first monarch to open Canada's Parliament in nearly 70 years. The visit comes amid pressure from US President Trump, who has suggested that Canada should be part of the US. The King is expected to deliver a speech emphasizing Canadian sovereignty and independence. The speech will balance a message of solidarity with Canada without jeopardizing the UK's relationship with the US.</p>
