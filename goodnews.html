        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Manus AI, a general-purpose artificial intelligence agent developed by a Chinese team, is now offering free public registration after securing new funding and amidst increasing competition. Launched in early March, Manus AI quickly gained attention for its ability to handle complex tasks, becoming a prominent AI startup in China. The decision to open registrations follows a $75 million funding round led by Benchmark Capital, a U.S. venture capital firm, which values Manus at $500 million. The U.S. Treasury Department is reportedly reviewing Benchmark's investment, and Manus is providing users with initial and daily credits to encourage service use.</p>

Bessent noted the skilled negotiating style of Chinese Vice-Premier He Lifeng, contrasting it with previous tense negotiations led by former vice-premier Liu He during the Trump administration. The talks signal a potential shift towards more stable and productive trade relations between the two countries. Vice-Minister of Commerce Li Chenggang also debuted as a trade representative, adding to the positive dynamics of the meeting.</p>

          <p>House Republicans are facing a crucial week as they aim to finalize President Trump's "big beautiful bill," encompassing significant changes to tax, immigration, and energy policy. Speaker Mike Johnson is navigating competing demands within the party, balancing concerns from swing district Republicans and conservative members. Key committees are working to define policies with far-reaching impacts, particularly regarding Medicaid, Trump's tax cuts, and the state and local tax (SALT) deduction. The goal is to pass the bill through the House by Memorial Day and have it signed by President Trump by July 4, coinciding with the need to increase the country's borrowing authority by mid-July to avoid a potential government default.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Financial technology firms, initially impacted by interest rate hikes, saw profits rise as higher rates boosted net interest income; however, they now face a key test as interest rates decline. Fintechs like Robinhood, Revolut, and Monzo benefited from higher net interest income in 2024, but the sustainability of this income is now in question. A broad decline in interest rates raises doubts about the long-term viability of relying on heightened income, potentially exposing vulnerabilities in some fintechs' business models. Some fintechs are diversifying their revenue streams to reduce reliance on interest and card fees, offering services like crypto trading and mobile plans.</p>

          <p>This article addresses the question of how to fairly divide an estate in a second marriage scenario where each spouse has children from previous relationships. The expert advises that a spouse's inheritance is considered separate property and can be left to their own biological children. Community property, acquired during the marriage, typically goes to the surviving spouse, who can then decide how to distribute it. The article suggests exploring trust agreements, such as QTIP or A-B trusts, to ensure both spouses' wishes are honored and to minimize tax implications for the heirs. (not investment advice)</p>
