        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Trump administration has delayed by one month a plan to cut off access to a key satellite data program essential for hurricane forecasting, following alarm from the scientific community. The data, collected by Department of Defense satellites, was set to be suspended, a move some scientists warned could set forecasting back decades. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) cited a "significant cybersecurity risk" as the reason for the initial decision but postponed the cutoff at NASA's request. The delay provides a temporary reprieve while concerns over the impact on public safety and climate tracking persist.</p>

          <p>A coalition of major Democratic groups, including the DNC, is launching a new "Organizing Summer" program to rebuild voter support and engagement following losses in the 2024 elections. The initiative, backed by a significant financial investment, aims to mobilize thousands of volunteers to connect with voters in non-traditional settings and gather feedback to shape party strategy. The effort comes as the party seeks to present a united front after recent internal disputes and to counter the Republican agenda, particularly President Trump's major legislative bill. This program is seen as crucial for the upcoming 2026 midterm elections.</p>

          <p>Robinhood's stock surged to an all-time high after the company announced it will offer tokenized shares of private companies OpenAI and SpaceX to its European users. This initiative, part of a broader crypto expansion in the EU, makes equity in these high-demand, unlisted companies accessible to a wider audience through its blockchain-based platform. The move is possible due to Europe's more flexible regulatory environment, which lacks the "accredited investor" rules present in the U.S. To promote the launch, Robinhood is giving away tokens to new eligible users in the European Union.

          <p>After a dismal start to the season, Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Max Muncy has transformed into one of baseball's top hitters, a turnaround he attributes to a key swing adjustment and new glasses. Struggling with a low batting average and no home runs through the first month, Muncy discovered he had astigmatism and began wearing glasses. The crucial change, however, came from a "lightbulb moment" during a May 9 at-bat, where he rediscovered a swing mechanic that allowed him to handle high fastballs effectively. Since that game, he has been on a tear, leading the league in RBIs and re-establishing himself as a vital part of the Dodgers' lineup.</p>

          <p>Lululemon has filed a lawsuit against Costco, accusing the warehouse retailer of selling "confusingly similar" copies of its popular apparel, including its Scuba hoodies and Define jackets. The lawsuit claims that Costco's products constitute "trade dress" infringement by mimicking Lululemon's designs so closely that they confuse consumers, with some social media users even referring to the items as "#luludupe." Lululemon is seeking damages for lost profits and demanding that Costco stop manufacturing and selling the contested products.

          <p>The Canadian government has canceled its planned digital services tax (DST) just as it was set to take effect, a move designed to restart trade talks with the United States. The 3% tax would have affected large digital companies, many of which are American, and was labeled a "blatant attack" by President Trump, who had suspended negotiations in response. By shelving the tax, Canada has potentially averted retaliatory U.S. tariffs and brought the administration back to the negotiating table. The decision highlights the economic pressure the U.S. can exert and raises questions about whether other nations with similar taxes will follow suit.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>England's victory over India in the first Test was significantly aided by fast bowler Josh Tongue's effectiveness in dismissing India's lower-order batsmen, a skill often referred to as "mopping up the tail." India's last four wickets contributed very few runs in both innings, with Tongue taking three wickets each time using an aggressive and intimidating style. This ability to prevent the "tail from wagging" is seen as a crucial, though sometimes overlooked, aspect of Test cricket. It provides a psychological lift and prevents the opposition from gaining late-game momentum, a weakness England has previously struggled with.</p>

The case, one of the longest-running cold cases ever solved in the U.K., was cracked after modern forensic testing in 2023 found Headley's DNA on the victim's clothing. This evidence, along with a palm print from the scene, linked him to the crime committed 58 years ago.
