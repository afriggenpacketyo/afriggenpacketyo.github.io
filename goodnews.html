        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A study published in Scientific Reports reveals that radiologists, unlike most people, are less susceptible to optical illusions.  This suggests that years of training can improve perceptual accuracy, which has implications for medical image interpretation.  The study challenges previous theories about the immutability of size perception, and the research may lead to better training methods for medical professionals. The article concludes that illusions demonstrate our perceptual limitations.</p>
