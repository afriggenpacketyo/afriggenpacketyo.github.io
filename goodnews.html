          <p>Tom Lehrer, the celebrated musical satirist known for his witty and often controversial songs in the 1950s and 60s, has passed away at the age of 97. After a successful but relatively short-lived music career, where he tackled subjects like nuclear war and pollution, he returned to his other passion, teaching mathematics. His unique style of satirical songwriting, which often involved embracing the very things he detested to highlight their absurdity, influenced generations of comedians and musicians.</p>

          <p>The United States and the European Union have established a framework for a new trade deal, averting a potential trade war by setting a 15% tariff on all EU goods exported to the US. The agreement, announced after negotiations between President Trump and European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, also includes commitments for the EU to invest $600 billion in the US and purchase $750 billion in American energy. While both sides hailed the deal as a victory, it represents a significant step in rebalancing the transatlantic trade relationship. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>An investigation led by journalist Miriam Lewin and photographer Giancarlo Ceraudo successfully located a Skyvan aircraft used for "death flights" during Argentina's military dictatorship. The plane, which was used to drop political prisoners into the Atlantic Ocean, was found in the U.S. being used for skydiving excursions. Its flight logs provided irrefutable evidence of its sinister past, proving instrumental in the 2017 conviction of 48 former officials for crimes against humanity. The aircraft has since been returned to Argentina and is now displayed at the former ESMA detention center as a powerful symbol of state terrorism.</p>

          <p>The U.S. Justice Department has successfully dismantled a vast child sexual abuse material network through an investigation dubbed "Operation Grayskull." The operation resulted in the shutdown of four dark web sites that collectively had over 120,000 members and hosted millions of illicit files. At least 18 individuals who led or utilized the network have been convicted, including a key administrator whose devices contained enormous quantities of material depicting the sexual assault and abuse of children. Officials described the bust as one of the most successful prosecutions of its kind.</p>
