          <p>Actor and musician Johnny Depp made a surprise appearance at an Alice Cooper concert in London to pay tribute to the late Ozzy Osbourne.

Cooper, a longtime friend and bandmate of Depp in The Hollywood Vampires, dedicated the performance to Osbourne's memory. The tribute was well-received by the audience, highlighting the deep respect and camaraderie within the rock music community following the loss of a legend.</p>

          <p>Boston Red Sox pitcher Garrett Crochet delivered a stellar performance, effectively shutting down the Los Angeles Dodgers' offense in a 4-2 victory. While Dodgers starter Clayton Kershaw struggled, allowing four runs in under five innings, Crochet consistently worked out of trouble, striking out ten batters. The Dodgers' offense was limited to two first-inning solo home runs from Shohei Ohtani and Teoscar Hernández. Despite some late opportunities, the Dodgers could not overcome Crochet's consistency, setting up a rubber match for the series finale.</p>

          <p>Following the death of Ozzy Osbourne, many are remembering him not just as the "Prince of Darkness" but also as a beloved reality TV icon from the early 2000s. His MTV show, "The Osbournes," co-starring his wife Sharon and children Kelly and Jack, pioneered the "reality sitcom" format. The show offered an unprecedented, humorous, and often mundane look into the life of a rock star's family, predating hits like "Keeping Up With the Kardashians."

          <p>San Francisco is currently experiencing its coldest summer in 20 to 30 years, with average July temperatures running below normal. Meteorologists attribute the chilly, gray weather to a misplaced seasonal high-pressure system and increased coastal upwelling, which brings cold ocean water to the surface. While not record-breaking, the persistent cool temperatures have been a notable feature of the season in the Bay Area. Forecasters expect the cool, drizzly conditions to continue, warning that the region's hottest weather often arrives later in August and September.</p>
