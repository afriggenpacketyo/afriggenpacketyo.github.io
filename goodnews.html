        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Newspaper headlines reflect the mixed reactions to the historic Commons vote on the assisted dying bill, with some emphasizing the 'victory' for campaigners and others highlighting the 'uphill battle' it faces in the House of Lords. The bill, which would give some terminally ill adults in England and Wales the right to end their own lives, passed narrowly, signaling concerns about its potential impact. Other news includes the government's move to ban the Palestine Action group, branding them a 'terror group,' and plans to map the DNA of every baby under an 'NHS revolution.' The FT Weekend reports on a US private capital group's support for Somerset's Hinkley Point C nuclear power station. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that a Louisiana law requiring the Ten Commandments to be posted in public school classrooms is unconstitutional, backing a lower court's decision. The ruling is a victory for civil liberties groups who argued the law violates the separation of church and state, isolating non-Christian students. The state's attorney general disagreed and plans to appeal, believing the ruling only applies to specific districts. Legal experts anticipate the case will reach the Supreme Court, testing the conservative court's stance on religion and government. The optimism score is 60.</p>

          <p>Oil prices decreased by approximately 2% after President Trump decided to postpone aiding Israel in destroying Iran's nuclear program, an OPEC member. Trump indicated that he would decide on striking Iran within two weeks, allowing for potential negotiations regarding the Islamic Republic's nuclear program. Despite Trump's restraint, Israel is intensifying its attacks on Iran following eight days of conflict.

          <p>Jia Zhangke's film, ‚ÄúCaught by the Tides,‚Äù uses nearly 25 years of footage, including images from his acclaimed films, to create a poignant story about globalization and alienation in China. The film follows Qiaoqiao (Zhao Tao) and Bin (Li Zhubin) through three chapters, showcasing their struggles with love and purpose amid China's rapid technological and economic evolution. The film serves as a primer on Jia's fascination with China's political, cultural, and economic evolution, amplifying themes with the benefit of working across a quarter-century. The inevitable reunion results in a moving resolution, one that suggests the ebb and flow of desire but, also, the passage of time‚Äôs inexorable erosion of individuals and nations.
