          <p>Jordan Maynard, chair of the Massachusetts gaming commission, is urging federal lawmakers to consider nationwide rules for the rapidly expanding U.S. gambling industry. He argues for federal action on advertising regulations and nationwide exclusion lists to protect gamblers facing addiction, noting that current state-focused policies are easily circumvented. Maynard emphasizes the need for regulators to ensure responsible practices and protect citizens from harm, and he expressed frustration with the industry's resistance to proposed regulations. He believes that artificial intelligence could be used to promote healthy betting behaviors, but also recognizes the uphill battle regulators face in balancing economic benefits with social impact. </p>
