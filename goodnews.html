          <p>Marcus Fakana, a British teenager sentenced to a year in a Dubai prison, has been released and returned to the UK after receiving a royal pardon. Fakana, now 19, was convicted for having a consensual relationship with a 17-year-old girl while on holiday, as the age of consent in the UAE is 18. The case drew attention from the campaign group Detained in Dubai, which highlighted the strictness of UAE laws and the potential dangers for tourists unaware of local customs. His family expressed immense relief at his early release after six months of imprisonment.</p>

          <p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have paid tribute to Janet Bennett, the 96-year-old designer of the iconic colorful tile mosaics at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). For decades, credit for the 1961 murals was mistakenly given to her boss. The Dodgers, seeking to install a similar design in their clubhouse, tracked down Bennett for her blessing and advice, ultimately creating a sign that credits her as the inspiration. This act provides public recognition that the airport itself has not, resolving a long-standing issue for the artist who designed a signature visual element of Los Angeles.</p>

          <p>For the first time, Taiwan will participate in the memorial ceremonies for the 80th anniversary of the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The city of Nagasaki initially excluded Taiwan, as it was not a country with a diplomatic mission in Japan, but reversed its decision after Taiwan expressed a desire to attend. This move is politically sensitive, particularly concerning Beijing's view of Taiwan's sovereignty. The decision follows controversy from the previous year when Nagasaki excluded Israel from the event due to its military actions in Gaza.</p>

          <p>President Trump has signed a major tax and spending bill that introduces significant changes to American finances. The legislation, referred to as the "one big beautiful bill," makes the 2017 tax cuts permanent and introduces several new provisions. Key changes include a "senior bonus," an increased state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and a higher exemption for estate and gift taxes. The bill also creates new tax breaks for tip income, overtime pay, and auto loans, and establishes a new type of tax-advantaged savings account for children. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A long-haired Chihuahua is being credited with saving its owner's life after he fell 26 feet into a crevasse on a glacier in Switzerland. The hiker managed to make a distress call on a walkie-talkie, but rescuers were unable to pinpoint his location on the vast glacier. A helicopter crew eventually spotted the tiny dog perched on a rock, faithfully waiting by the nearly invisible hole its owner had fallen into. The rescue service stated the dog's behavior was decisive in the successful rescue and hailed the "four-legged hero" for its loyalty.</p>

          <h2>Despite Trump's Public Pressure, Economists Say the Federal Reserve's Independence Limits His Influence</h2>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>President Trump has intensified his public attacks on the Federal Reserve and its chair, Jerome Powell, demanding significant interest rate cuts to boost the economy. However, economists argue that the central bank's independent and consensus-driven structure largely insulates it from direct presidential control. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which sets rates, is composed of 12 members, most of whom Trump cannot replace in the short term. While the president's rhetoric is a notable departure from tradition, the Fed's historical nonpartisanship and Powell's public resistance suggest that policy will continue to be based on economic data, not political pressure.

          <p>This article presents Marvell Technology as an attractive growth stock for investors, noting its stock has fallen in 2025 despite strong performance, creating a favorable buying opportunity. The chip designer is trading at a discount compared to the Nasdaq-100 average, yet it is poised for significant expansion, particularly in the data center and custom artificial intelligence (AI) processor markets. Marvell aims to substantially increase its market share in the custom AI sector, which is projected to grow to over $55 billion by 2028. The company's focus on developing more powerful and energy-efficient chips positions it well for long-term growth. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Wiaan Mulder, captaining South Africa for the first time, made the surprising decision to declare his team's innings while he was personally on a score of 367 not out. This left him just 33 runs shy of breaking Brian Lara's iconic 21-year-old Test record of 400 runs in a single innings. The move, made during a match against Zimbabwe, was seen by some as a gesture of respect for Lara's legendary status. Mulder's score is now the fifth-highest in Test history and the highest ever by a South African, surpassing Hashim Amla's previous record.</p>

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The UK government plans to change the law to grant parents the legal right to bereavement leave following a miscarriage at any stage of pregnancy. Currently, leave is only available for pregnancy loss after 24 weeks. Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner stated the change will give people necessary time to grieve without having to use sick leave. Campaigners, including musician Myleene Klass, have praised the move as a long-overdue step that formally recognizes early pregnancy loss as a bereavement, helping to remove the stigma and taboo surrounding the experience.</p>
