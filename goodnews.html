          <p>Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman indicated she would support lowering the policy rate as soon as the July meeting, contingent on inflation pressures remaining contained. Bowman's remarks, delivered in Prague, align with recent comments from fellow Governor Christopher Waller, suggesting a willingness to consider a rate cut next month. She emphasized the importance of monitoring economic conditions as the Administration's policies, the economy, and financial markets evolve. Bowman's stance reflects a cautious approach, balancing the need to sustain a healthy labor market with concerns about potential inflationary impacts from factors like tariffs (not investment advice).</p>

The decision follows acts of vandalism, including a recent incident at RAF Brize Norton, and aims to prevent further criminal damage linked to the group's activities. Cooper emphasized that the ban is specific to Palestine Action and does not affect lawful protest groups campaigning on issues around Palestine or the Middle East.

Mamdani has surged in recent weeks, setting up a contest between a centrist and a progressive that may, or may not, indicate the direction of travel for Democrats nationally.

          <p>Major U.S. health insurers, including CVS Health, UnitedHealthcare, and Cigna, have voluntarily agreed to speed up and reduce prior authorizations.

          <p>With home equity loan interest rates around 8.23% in 2025, more homeowners are considering them, but experts caution against taking on excessive debt. While home equity loans can be attractive, a high debt-to-income ratio, low credit score, low home equity, unstable income, or lack of an emergency fund can make them risky. Experts recommend a debt-to-income ratio below 36%, a credit score above 680, at least 20% equity in the home, stable income, and three to six months of living expenses saved. Assessing one's financial situation and planning for worst-case scenarios is crucial before borrowing (not investment advice).</p>

          <h2>India-US Relations Face Challenges Amid Conflicting Views on Mediation</h2>

          <p>Tensions are rising between India and the US after Washington claimed it helped broker a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, with India denying US mediation. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi told Trump that the ceasefire was achieved through talks between the Indian and Pakistani militaries. Experts suggest Trump's unpredictability and transactional approach to foreign policy matters may be straining the relationship, and that the US has pursued short-term and deal-based diplomacy. Despite the tensions, the US cannot afford to isolate India in countering China's rise in the Indo-Pacific region.</p>

          <h2>Government Announces 10-Year Plan for Industry, Aiming for Lower Energy Costs</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-06-23 09:39:27 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The government has set out plans to lower energy costs for thousands of businesses by exempting them from some green energy levies, as part of its new 10-year industrial strategy. The measures could slash energy bills by up to 25% for more than 7,000 UK businesses, and a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will cut costs by up to ¬£40 per megawatt-hour from 2027 for more than 7,000 manufacturing firms. The prime minister said the industrial strategy gave businesses "the long-term certainty and direction" they need to "invest, innovate and create good jobs that put more money in people's pockets". The plans also include improving UK workers' skills and attracting "elite global talent" to come and work in the UK with visa and migration reforms.</p>
