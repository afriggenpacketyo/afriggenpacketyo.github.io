          <p>Cryptocurrency exchange Bullish has priced its initial public offering at $37 per share, exceeding its anticipated range and valuing the company at $5.4 billion. The offering will raise $1.1 billion, with increased investor demand leading to an expanded number of shares sold. This marks Bullish's second attempt to go public, capitalizing on a favorable regulatory environment for crypto. The successful IPO follows other strong market debuts in the crypto sector, signaling invigorated capital markets and interest from major investors like BlackRock and Cathie Wood's Ark Investment Management.

        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>A recent Gallup poll indicates that only 54% of U.S. adults now consume alcohol, representing the lowest percentage in nearly 90 years. This significant decline is primarily driven by an increasing public perception, especially among young adults, that even moderate alcohol intake is detrimental to health. The shift aligns with a changing scientific consensus, which now emphasizes alcohol's links to various negative health outcomes, including cancer, rather than any perceived benefits. Consequently, federal dietary guidelines are under review, with suggestions for clearer labeling on alcoholic beverages to highlight these health risks, influencing consumption habits across different age groups.</p>

          <p>New guidance for UK police forces suggests they should consider revealing a suspect's ethnicity and nationality in high-profile or sensitive investigations, particularly when charges are laid. This update addresses inconsistencies in past disclosures, which sometimes fueled misinformation and community tensions, as seen in recent incidents. While the aim is to manage public speculation and unrest, concerns exist among some officers that such disclosures could inadvertently promote racism or influence future trials. The decision to release this information will ultimately rest with individual forces, assessing factors like the risk of local trouble and the severity of the offense.</p>

          <p>Apple is reportedly considering integrating Douyin Pay into its mainland App Store, reflecting the growing dominance of mobile payment services in China, currently led by Alipay and WeChat Pay. This potential move could significantly enhance Apple's presence in the world's second-largest economy by adapting to local payment preferences. Concurrently, supposed leaked images of the iPhone 17, particularly a Pro model featuring a large horizontal camera "island," have ignited widespread debate and discussion across Chinese social media platforms. These images, initially posted mistakenly by a case manufacturer, are fueling anticipation and speculation about Apple's next smartphone design.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Homeowners are finding more affordable borrowing options through home equity loans and Home Equity Lines of Credit (HELOCs), with average interest rates significantly lower than personal loans or credit cards. As of August 8, 2025, typical 5-year home equity loans average 8.25%, while HELOCs are around 8.13%, with rates expected to decline further if the Federal Reserve cuts rates. These products, which use home equity as collateral, offer lump sums or revolving credit and may provide tax benefits for eligible home improvements. However, borrowers must carefully assess their needs and budget due to the risk of foreclosure if payments are missed. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Opinion: China's Forward-Looking Approach to Green Transition and Technology Contrasts with U.S. Protectionism</h2>

          <p>This opinion article argues that China, unlike the U.S., is not "shutting out the future" but actively building new systems and industries, particularly in the green energy sector. The author contends that the current "China Shock 2.0" is not about job displacement but about China's leadership in electric vehicles, clean energy, AI, and biotechnology. China's massive investment in solar and wind capacity, significantly outpacing the rest of the world, is driving down global clean energy costs. The article suggests that while the U.S. leans towards protectionism, China is underwriting the global green transition, shaping the 21st century's economic landscape.</p>

          <p>The iconic Barbie doll was inspired by Lilli, a sensual German comic strip character created in 1952 for the Bild tabloid, initially intended for adult male readers. Lilli, described as a "sassy secretary" but interpreted by some as a high-class call girl, became a popular plastic doll in 1955, sold in tobacco shops. Ruth Handler, co-founder of Mattel, discovered Lilli in Switzerland and subsequently launched Barbie in 1959, modeled after Lilli and named after Handler's daughter. Mattel later acquired the rights to Lilli, ceasing its production, while Barbie went on to become a global phenomenon, inspiring one of the highest-grossing films.</p>

          <p>Mortgage refinancing demand significantly increased by 23% last week, driving an overall 10.9% rise in total mortgage applications, as homeowners seek savings amidst declining interest rates. The average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rate fell to 6.67%, while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) also saw a 25% increase in applications due to their comparative attractiveness. This surge marks the strongest week for refinancing since April last year. Despite positive trends for refinancing, applications for home purchases saw only a modest 1% rise, indicating that high home prices continue to impact potential buyers, even with improved rates.

          <p>Chinese scientists from the University of Science and Technology of China have developed the world's largest array of atoms for quantum computing, a significant advancement in the field. Their artificial intelligence system can arrange over 2,000 rubidium atoms, serving as qubits, into perfect patterns in just 60 microseconds. This breakthrough addresses a major challenge in atom-based quantum computing, which is considered a highly promising approach due to the stability and controllability of neutral atoms. The achievement is hailed as a substantial leap in computational efficiency and experimental feasibility, positioning China at the forefront of quantum technology development.</p>
