          <p>The new Kimi K2 artificial intelligence model, developed by Alibaba-backed Moonshot AI, has seen a surge in user adoption since its recent launch. Experts praise its cost-efficient design, which utilizes a mixture-of-experts (MOE) architecture to reduce computational costs while achieving high performance with one trillion total parameters. Unlike competitors such as OpenAI's GPT, Kimi K2 is currently available for free, which has contributed to its rapid growth in the competitive Chinese AI market. The model's success highlights a potential shift in AI development strategy towards more economical training and inference methods.</p>

          <p>Italy's women's national football team is preparing to face defending champions England in the Euro 2025 semi-finals, their first appearance at this stage in 28 years. The article analyzes Italy's success, attributing it to the leadership of captain Cristiana Girelli and the tactical flexibility of coach Andrea Soncin. Experts note Italy's ability to adapt its formation and exploit opponent weaknesses, particularly in wide areas, which could pose a significant challenge to the Lionesses. Having exceeded expectations as "dark horses," the Italian team's performance reflects the positive impact of professionalization in their domestic league.</p>

          <p>Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, the owner of the Los Angeles Times, has announced his intention to take the newspaper public within the next year. In an interview, Soon-Shiong stated the move is aimed at democratizing ownership and allowing the public to have a stake in the institution. This decision comes as The Times, like many in the news industry, navigates significant financial challenges. Soon-Shiong, who acquired the paper in 2018, did not provide specific details on the structure of the public offering but framed it as a way to secure the paper's future.</p>

          <p>The Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District board has voted unanimously to release investigative records related to the 2022 Robb Elementary School mass shooting. This decision follows a recent court ruling in favor of news outlets and comes after more than three years of resistance from officials. Families of the 19 children and two teachers killed in the massacre have been demanding transparency, calling the release a long-overdue step toward healing and accountability. During the meeting, several board members apologized to the families for the delay and their previous inaction, acknowledging the need to rebuild community trust.</p>

The decision reflects the deepening economic and diplomatic relationship between the two nations, as China is a key trading partner and investor for Argentina.</p>

          <p>The race to commercialize solid-state batteries for electric vehicles is intensifying, with major automakers like Volkswagen, Toyota, and Stellantis setting ambitious production timelines for before the end of the decade. These batteries promise higher energy density, improved safety, and faster charging compared to current lithium-ion technology. While some companies are targeting full solid-state cells, many are initially focusing on semi-solid-state versions as a practical bridge technology. Despite renewed optimism, challenges such as high production costs remain, and some analysts note that rapid improvements in existing battery technology are weakening the investment case.

          <p>In a personal essay, Slovenian writer Ana Schnabl reflects on the narrow expectations faced by authors from the Balkans when seeking publication in the US and UK. She argues that publishers often demand stories centered on regional conflict, historical trauma, or political problems, effectively requiring writers to "self-exoticise." This expectation, she contends, implies that the region is primarily a source of tragedy and overlooks a diverse range of universal human stories that don't fit this mold. The author calls for a broader appreciation of literature from the region, beyond narratives that simply reinforce preconceived notions of the Balkans.</p>

          <p>The UK government has announced "substantial changes" to the compensation scheme for victims of the infected blood scandal, which saw thousands infected with HIV and hepatitis in the 1970s-90s. The revisions follow a highly critical report from the public inquiry chair, who described the scheme's implementation as "profoundly unsatisfactory." Key changes include allowing compensation to be passed to a family member's estate if they die before their claim is settled. While victims' groups cautiously welcomed the news, they expressed disappointment that some issues remain subject to further consultation.</p>
