          <p>Emergency crews in the San Bernardino Mountains successfully rescued a hiker who fell approximately 25 feet onto rocks at Big Falls. The rescue was initiated after another person heard cries for help from the popular but treacherous waterfall area. Due to the serious injuries and difficult terrain, a helicopter was used to hoist the victim to safety and transport him to a trauma center. Officials have reminded the public to exercise caution and stay on designated trails, noting that rescues are common at this location.</p>

          <p>New research from the American Cancer Society indicates a significant rise in early-stage colorectal cancer diagnoses among people aged 45 to 49. This increase is directly linked to a 62% jump in screenings for this age group from 2019 to 2023, following updated recommendations to lower the screening age from 50 to 45. While experts view this as promising news for early detection and treatment, they caution that screening rates remain suboptimal.

          <p>Fire crews on Maui responded to a brush fire burning above the Ka'anapali resort area, near the location of the catastrophic Lahaina wildfires from two years ago. The fire prompted the closure of a major highway as smoke impacted the area, but officials reported that the blaze was slowly being contained. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing fire risk in the region, which is still recovering from one of the deadliest wildfires in U.S. history. No major damage or injuries were immediately reported from this new fire.</p>

          <p>John Edward Bruce, a prominent Black journalist and Pan-Africanist pioneer born into slavery, will finally receive a proper headstone at his unmarked grave in Yonkers, New York. Despite his international renown and association with figures like Marcus Garvey, Bruce was buried without a marker in 1924, an oversight attributed to his modest finances and the subsequent Great Depression. A community effort using private and public funds has now commissioned a black granite headstone to honor his legacy. The tribute aims to correct a historical oversight and recognize his significant contributions to Black history and culture.</p>

          <p>Joshua Taylor, a Michigan resident living with a disability, is leading an advocacy effort to make adult-sized changing tables more common in public restrooms. For teenagers and adults with disabilities and their caregivers, the lack of these facilities often means using unsanitary floors or forgoing public outings altogether. Taylor, who personally experiences these challenges, argues that these tables are a necessity, not a convenience, for millions of people. He is working with officials and the national organization Changing Spaces USA to promote installation and improve accessibility for all.</p>

          <p>Following a market dip, CNBC's Jim Cramer suggested that the subsequent rebound was primarily driven by the strong performance and positive earnings reports from the "Magnificent Seven" tech stocks. He highlighted flawless quarters from companies like Microsoft and impressive user engagement at Meta as key factors bolstering investor confidence. Cramer noted that despite concerns over a weaker labor report and the firing of the BLS Commissioner, the market's resilience is rooted in the financial strength of these tech giants. He expressed optimism for the sector's continued dominance and innovation. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>New, stricter gun licensing regulations have come into effect in the UK, a move welcomed by Emma Ambler, who has campaigned for change since her twin sister and two nieces were murdered with a legally held weapon. The updated laws require more character references for shotgun applicants and mandate that police investigate signs of domestic abuse or dishonesty in an applicant's history. The changes were prompted by several recent mass shootings. Ambler stated that the new rules make her feel hopeful that other families can be prevented from experiencing similar tragedies.</p>
