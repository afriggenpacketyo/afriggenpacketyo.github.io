        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The Premier League has announced the 2025-26 season fixtures, acknowledging the increased likelihood of games being moved with little warning due to the participation of nine English teams in European competitions, including six in the Champions League. This scheduling complexity may cause headaches for managers as they juggle domestic and European commitments, especially with midweek away trips impacting weekend fixtures. England's national team manager will also need to consider Liverpool's challenging pre-international window schedule. Manchester City's new player Rayan Cherki will face Manchester United early in the season, and Arsenal has a tough matchday five with a north London derby and a trip to Chelsea.</p>

          <p>The Federal Reserve is anticipated to maintain its benchmark interest rate at its current range of 4.25% to 4.5% during its meeting, signaling a continuation of its cautious approach. This decision reflects ongoing uncertainty surrounding the economic impact of President Trump's tariffs, despite some improvement in consumer sentiment. While the labor market remains relatively strong, with payroll gains exceeding expectations, inflation ticked up slightly in May. The Fed's decision will be announced at 2 p.m. EST, followed by a press conference with Chairman Jerome Powell, where economic forecasts and potential future interest rate changes will be discussed.

These celebrations often include traditional foods, libations, singing, dancing, and a focus on family reunification, education, and political empowerment. The article highlights the historical and ongoing significance of these commemorations in the U.S. and across the African diaspora.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Faced with rising tariffs, businesses are increasingly resorting to "tariff engineering" to reduce their duty liabilities by strategically altering product materials, dimensions, or compositions. This practice, which predates Trump's tariffs, involves reclassifying items under different harmonized system codes to incur lower rates. While most new tariffs are broad-based, exemptions for certain products provide opportunities for companies to benefit through tariff engineering. Companies must carefully navigate the line between redesigning products and misrepresenting classifications to avoid legal repercussions. (not investment advice)</p>

Despite leading the majors in runs, home runs, and OPS, the Dodgers' president of baseball operations, Andrew Friedman, has stated his preference not to make trades in July due to high prospect costs. However, the team's annual expectation of winning the World Series may override this preference, particularly if vulnerabilities such as the performance of left fielder Michael Conforto persist. The Dodgers are currently in a strong position, leading their division, but the possibility of acquiring a left fielder or addressing pitching concerns remains open.</p>

          <p>A year-long battle of sounds along the inter-Korean border has come to an end, with both South Korea and North Korea ceasing their propaganda broadcasts. The decision follows South Korea's new president, Lee Jae Myung, ordering a stop to the broadcasts in an effort to alleviate military tension and restore trust. The loudspeaker campaigns, which included unnerving noises from North Korea, had disrupted the lives of villagers in border towns. While some argue that the broadcasts were effective in conveying information to North Koreans, others see the cessation as a positive step towards dialogue.</p>
