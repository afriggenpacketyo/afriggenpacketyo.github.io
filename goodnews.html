          <p>Wisconsin's Democratic Governor, Tony Evers, has announced he will not run for a third term, setting up the state's first open gubernatorial race in 16 years. In his announcement, Evers cited a desire to focus on his family after five decades in public service. His tenure has been defined by frequent clashes with the Republican-controlled legislature, where he used his veto power extensively, but also by recent bipartisan success on the state budget. This decision opens a key contest in a major battleground state, with Democrats hopeful that newly redrawn electoral maps will give them an advantage in upcoming elections.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The U.S. Supreme Court has extended a pause on a lower court ruling that could significantly weaken the Voting Rights Act. The case originates from North Dakota, where two tribal nations successfully challenged a state legislative map for diluting Native American voting power. An 8th Circuit Court of Appeals panel later ruled that private individuals and groups, like the tribes, do not have the right to sue under Section 2 of the act, a departure from decades of precedent. This temporary hold keeps the current protections in place while the Supreme Court decides whether to take up a full review of the case.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Industrial manufacturer Dover reported better-than-expected second-quarter results and raised its full-year outlook, yet its shares fell following the announcement. The company beat consensus estimates on both revenue and earnings per share, driven by strong performance in its clean energy and biopharma segments. Analysts suggest the market may have misjudged the report, overlooking positive indicators like a 7% increase in bookings, which signals future growth, and record-high profit margins. The analysis posits that the sell-off presents a buying opportunity, as the company's strategic portfolio changes are setting it up for accelerated growth. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social to deny claims that he plans to undermine Elon Musk's companies by cutting their government subsidies. The statement aims to quell speculation that has arisen from the public feud between the two, which has included clashes over policy and personal attacks. Trump asserted that he wants all U.S. businesses, including Musk's ventures like Tesla and SpaceX which receive significant federal contracts and credits, to "THRIVE like never before." This public reassurance comes as Musk's companies face financial pressures from tariffs and the potential expiration of federal benefits.</p>

          <p>Demand for workers with artificial intelligence skills is surging, according to a report from the Brookings Institution. The number of U.S. job postings that mention AI has climbed dramatically, increasing by over 100% in the past year alone. This growth reflects the increasing adoption of AI by companies across various sectors, not just in traditional tech hubs. While AI-related jobs still constitute a small fraction of the total labor market, they are expanding into fields like marketing, finance, and human resources, and typically command significantly higher salaries than comparable non-AI roles.</p>

          <p>This article analyzes whether a $25,000 investment would earn more in a 6-month certificate of deposit (CD) or a high-yield savings account. Based on current rates, a CD offers a slightly higher and, crucially, a guaranteed return, making it the winner in pure numbers. However, the choice depends on individual financial needs; the high-yield savings account provides essential liquidity for those who might need access to their funds for emergencies or short-term expenses. The article advises savers to weigh the certainty of a CD's fixed rate against the flexibility of a savings account. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A Dutch couple, Erik and Karin Vonk, have transformed a retirement hobby into Richland Rum, one of Georgia's most acclaimed craft distilleries. What sets their product apart is their method: they are among a small percentage of global producers who make rum directly from fresh sugarcane juice grown on their own estate, rather than the more common byproduct of molasses. This dedication to process has earned their spirits numerous awards and turned their rural distillery into a major tourist destination. The business has thrived following changes in Georgia law that now permit distilleries to sell products directly to consumers.</p>

          <p>As the MLB trade deadline nears, the Los Angeles Dodgers are facing decisions on how to address flaws in their roster despite high preseason expectations. The team's most undeniable weakness is its bullpen, and it is widely expected they will acquire a high-leverage relief pitcher. Beyond that, their strategy is less clear; the front office may choose to bet on their underperforming star players to improve rather than pursuing major external upgrades for the lineup or rotation. The team's recent struggles have fueled speculation, but internally, the belief in the existing talent remains strong.</p>
