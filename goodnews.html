          <p>The United States, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Egypt have issued a joint call for a three-month humanitarian truce in Sudan, to be followed by a permanent ceasefire and a nine-month transitional process towards civilian rule. This initiative, put forth by the "Quad" countries, aims to end the devastating conflict between the Sudanese army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) which has resulted in numerous deaths and a severe humanitarian crisis. The statement also explicitly rejected any role for violent extremist groups in Sudan's future governance and was accompanied by US sanctions on Sudanese Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim and an Islamist militia. The warring factions have yet to publicly respond to this international effort to restore peace and stability.</p>

          <p>A powerful 7.4 magnitude earthquake occurred early Saturday near the east coast of Russia’s Kamchatka region, as reported by the U.S. Geological Survey. The seismic event's epicenter was situated 111.7 kilometers east of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, with a depth of 39 kilometers. This incident follows a series of five powerful quakes, including another 7.4 magnitude tremor, that impacted the Kamchatka Peninsula in July 2025. While the article notes the region's history of seismic activity, there were no immediate reports of significant damage or casualties from this latest powerful earthquake, suggesting a relatively stable immediate aftermath despite the intensity.</p>
