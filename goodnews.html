        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The article recounts the life of former MMA heavyweight champion Mark Kerr, whose journey from the top of the sport to battles with opioid addiction and alcoholism is the subject of the new film "The Smashing Machine." It details Kerr's initial encounter with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in 1997 and how, decades later, Johnson championed the project to bring his story to the screen. The piece highlights Kerr's difficult path, his eventual sobriety, and his collaboration on the biographical film directed by Benny Safdie, which has been met with critical acclaim. This represents a remarkable second act for Kerr, bringing his story of struggle and redemption to a global audience.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The aviation industry is grappling with the feasibility of achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, with a heavy reliance on sustainable aviation fuels (SAF). While the UK and EU have mandated that 2% of jet fuel be sustainable this year, rising to 10% in Britain by 2030, some industry leaders like Ryanair's Michael O'Leary are skeptical that production can meet these targets. The article discusses the significant challenges, including insufficient supply, high costs, and wavering political support, such as the US scaling back incentives. Despite these hurdles, proponents insist SAF is the only viable path and that progress is being made, albeit in a "lumpy transition."</p>

          <p>Renowned mountain athlete Kilian Jornet has successfully summited the 73 highest mountains in the contiguous United States, all peaks above 14,000 feet, within a 31-day period. His project, "States of Elevation," involved cycling over 3,000 miles between the mountains and then running up each one. The article describes Jornet's minimalist and artistic approach, choosing "the most aesthetic line" rather than the easiest path, exemplified by his traverse of demanding technical routes like Colorado's Elks Traverse. The feat is portrayed not just as a physical challenge but as an expression of Jornet's deep connection with nature and his desire to explore and appreciate remote wilderness areas.</p>

          <p>This article reveals several intriguing and controversial facts about the history of the Nobel Prize. It highlights the Curie family's five-prize dynasty and Albert Einstein's pre-win promise to give his prize money to his ex-wife, Mileva Maric. The piece also delves into the prize's historical omissions, noting that Einstein never won for his theory of relativity and that there is no prize for mathematics. Furthermore, it discusses cases where deserving female scientists like Lise Meitner and Jocelyn Bell Burnell were overlooked, and instances where prizes were awarded for now-debunked or harmful science, such as the lobotomy.</p>

          <p>Japan's governing Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has elected Sanae Takaichi as its new leader, positioning her to become the nation's first female prime minister. A staunch conservative and protégé of former leader Shinzo Abe, Takaichi faces the challenges of uniting a fractured party and addressing a sluggish economy. Despite being a woman, she is not seen as a champion of progressive gender policies, having opposed measures like allowing married women to retain their maiden names and same-sex marriage. Her policy platform is hawkish on security, includes revising Japan's pacifist constitution, and aims to revive the "Abenomics" economic strategy.</p>

          <p>This article looks back at the 1998 BBC documentary "Premier Passions," which provided an unprecedented behind-the-scenes look at Sunderland A.F.C.'s dramatic 1996-97 season. Former manager Peter Reid recalls his infamous, expletive-laden team talks and the initial wariness of allowing cameras into the dressing room. The series documented a pivotal year as the club prepared to leave its historic Roker Park stadium while fighting a relegation battle that ultimately ended in heartbreak on the final day. Despite the painful outcome, those involved, including former chairman Sir Bob Murray, reflect on the series as a valuable document of a transformative era for both the club and English football.</p>

          <h2>Analysis: Trump's Pragmatic Acceptance of Hamas's Response Puts Pressure on Israel</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 23:20:00 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>This analysis explores why President Donald Trump chose to interpret Hamas's conditional response to his Gaza peace plan as a full acceptance, a move that has cornered Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The article suggests Trump's decision is driven by pragmatism and a desire for a diplomatic victory rather than ideological alignment with Israel. Key factors include the unanimous international support for his plan, rising unfavorable views of Israel's Gaza policy among Americans, and Trump's own anger over a recent Israeli attack on Hamas negotiators in Qatar. By demanding Israel halt its bombing, Trump has seized control of the endgame, prioritizing the release of hostages to secure a deal.</p>

          <p>The Las Vegas Aces rallied in the fourth quarter to defeat the Phoenix Mercury 89-86 in a dramatic Game 1 of the WNBA finals. Trailing for much of the game, the Aces launched a decisive 17-6 run late in the final period, sparked by key plays from MVP A’ja Wilson and reserve guard Dana Evans, who both scored 21 points. The game also took place amid tensions between the players' union and WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert over issues of pay and respect, which Engelbert addressed prior to the game. The narrow victory gives the Aces a 1-0 lead in the first-ever best-of-seven finals series.</p>

          <h2>China's Biopharmaceutical Sector Gains Global Attention with Advances in Drug Development</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-10-03 22:00:09 EDT</div>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>China's biopharmaceutical industry is experiencing a renaissance, marked by a growing ability to create innovative drugs that are attracting international notice. A key example is a cancer drug from Guangzhou-based Akeso, which clinical trials showed was more effective at delaying lung cancer progression than Merck's blockbuster drug, Keytruda. This success is cited as evidence of the sector's rapid development, with China now having the world's second-largest number of novel drugs in development. While this progress is significant, analysts remain cautious about whether the industry can consistently produce major breakthroughs in a highly complex and regulated field.
