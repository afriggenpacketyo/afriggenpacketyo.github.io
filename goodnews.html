          <p>PepsiCo announced second-quarter earnings and revenue that surpassed Wall Street's expectations, leading to a modest rise in its stock price. The company's net sales increased by 1% to $22.73 billion, driven by international performance, as it continues to face softer consumer demand in North America. Despite the positive results, overall worldwide volume for its food products declined and remained flat for beverages, indicating ongoing challenges. PepsiCo maintained its full-year forecast, anticipating low-single-digit organic revenue growth and largely unchanged core earnings per share from the previous year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) announced a record-breaking second-quarter profit, surging nearly 61% year-over-year, far exceeding analyst expectations. This growth is primarily driven by the sustained, robust demand for advanced artificial intelligence chips from clients like Nvidia and Apple. The company's high-performance computing division, which includes AI applications, accounted for 60% of its revenue. Despite the strong performance, TSMC faces potential headwinds from U.S. tariff policies and global macroeconomic uncertainties, though the company has not yet seen changes in customer behavior.

          <p>Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has appointed State Senator Blaise Ingoglia to the position of state Chief Financial Officer, describing him as "the most conservative senator" in Florida. The appointment fills the vacancy left by Jimmy Patronis, who was elected to the U.S. Congress. In his new role, Ingoglia has pledged to prioritize meaningful property tax relief for Floridians and to act as a fiscal watchdog against waste and fraud. He also vowed to hold insurance companies accountable and ensure Florida remains a fiscally strong and free state, distinct from places like New York or California.</p>

          <p>A growing community in New York's Hudson Valley is embracing "vintage base ball," a version of the sport played according to the rules of 1864. Participants, clad in woolen uniforms and sporting period-appropriate facial hair, play without gloves, and outs can be recorded by catching the ball on a single bounce. This retro-sport attracts history buffs and baseball enthusiasts who enjoy the unique challenges and historical roleplaying aspect of the game. The scene combines athletics with history and humor, offering a live, unscripted performance that connects the past with the present in a uniquely American way.</p>

          <p>Researchers are studying the squirting cucumber, a toxic relative of the common cucumber, for its remarkable ability to ballistically disperse its seeds. When ripe, the fruit becomes pressurized with fluid and, upon the slightest touch, explodes to launch its seeds at speeds up to 30 miles per hour. Scientists used high-speed videography and CT scans to discover that the fruit ripens at a perfect ballistic angle of around 50 degrees for maximum distance. The seeds are also coated in a supremely sticky slime, which could inspire new bio-adhesives and materials for applications like soft robotics or drug delivery.</p>

          <h2>Opinion: California Must Lead on Electric Vehicles After Federal Support Is Cut</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-07-17 06:00:00 EDT</div>

          <p>This commentary asserts that California must step up to support the electric vehicle (EV) industry following the Trump administration's decision to end most federal support. The author argues this is a critical moment for the U.S. to compete with China, which dominates global EV manufacturing. The piece proposes three key actions for California: replacing the expiring federal tax credit with a state-level one, funding the installation of chargers in multifamily housing, and fast-tracking permits for public fast-charging stations. The author believes California's market power and innovation leadership make it uniquely capable of filling the void left by Washington. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>California lawmakers are considering a bill that would require public school and college student ID cards to include the contact information for The Trevor Project's LGBTQ+ crisis line. The move is a response to the federal government cutting funding for LGBTQ-specific counseling through the national 9-8-8 suicide lifeline. Proponents, including the mother of a trans teen who died by suicide, believe having a directly relevant and visible resource could save lives among queer youth, who face disproportionately high rates of suicidal ideation. The bill aims to create a state-level safety net to ensure vulnerable students have access to specialized support.</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Ari Aster's new film "Eddington" is reviewed as a superb and bitterly funny modern western set in a small New Mexico town during the early COVID-19 pandemic. The movie pits a sheriff (Joaquin Phoenix) against the town's mayor (Pedro Pascal) over mask mandates, capturing the paranoia and social disintegration of the era. The review praises the film's sharp dialogue and its portrayal of a society where social media has made everyone "brain sick" and unable to connect. While some plot points are less effective, the film is hailed as a challenging black comedy that implicates the audience in the chaos.</p>

          <p>Volvo Cars reported a second-quarter operating profit that, while down sharply year-on-year, still surpassed analyst expectations, causing its shares to rise. The company, owned by China's Geely, is navigating a challenging auto market and the impact of U.S. tariffs on imports from Europe and China. In response, Volvo is shifting its U.S. strategy by adding production of its best-selling XC60 SUV to its South Carolina plant, set to begin in late 2026. This move aims to better utilize its U.S. factory and mitigate the financial impact of the steep tariffs on imported vehicles. (not investment advice)</p>

Speaking at an expo in Beijing, Huang explained that while AI can easily learn human-created language, understanding the language of nature and biology is a more complex but profound challenge. He highlighted the potential for AI to learn the meaning of proteins, cells, and life itself, which could revolutionize fields like drug discovery. This focus on "AI for science" represents a significant frontier for technological advancement.</p>

          <p>Maryland has passed a first-in-the-nation law to use a fund established under the Affordable Care Act to help pay for abortion-related expenses. The state will tap into a $25 million account, funded by fees on marketplace insurance plans, to provide grants to abortion funds. These nonprofits assist with costs for patients traveling to Maryland for care, as well as for low-income or uninsured residents. The move is a novel solution to the financial strain on abortion providers and funds in states where abortion remains legal, which have seen a surge in patients since the overturning of Roe v. Wade.</p>
