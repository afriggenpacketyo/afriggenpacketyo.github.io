          <p>The NHS in England will be opening specialist mental health crisis centers across the country to alleviate overcrowding in accident and emergency departments. These centers will be open to walk-in patients, GPs, and police referrals and staffed with specialists to treat individuals experiencing acute mental distress. NHS England chief Sir Jim Mackey hails this new model as a way to provide appropriate support sooner, potentially reducing hospital admissions. However, concerns are raised regarding funding and the complexity of separating physical and mental health needs, with calls for robust testing before national rollout.</p>

EU Trade Commissioner Maros Sefcovic emphasized that EU-US trade must be guided by mutual respect. European governments have warned that higher tariffs would be damaging to both sides, advocating for negotiations as the best way forward.</p>

          <p>More and more young Japanese workers are "quiet quitting," prioritizing work-life balance over career advancement and higher pay. A study reveals that 45% of Japanese workers are doing the bare minimum, with employees in their 20s being the most likely to admit it. This shift is attributed to a desire for more personal time, disillusionment with corporate sacrifices, and a reevaluation of priorities following the coronavirus pandemic. Experts see this trend as a positive change after decades of overwork leading to 'karoshi,' or death by overwork.</p>

Despite Tanner Scott's blown save in the ninth, the Dodgers persevered, with Teoscar Hern√°ndez driving in the go-ahead run in the 13th.
