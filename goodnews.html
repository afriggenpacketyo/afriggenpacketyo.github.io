          <p>The Powerball jackpot has soared to an estimated $1.7 billion for Saturday night's drawing, after no tickets matched the winning numbers for Wednesday's $1.4 billion grand prize. This colossal sum, with an estimated cash value of $770.3 million before taxes, would become the third-largest in U.S. lottery history, trailing only two previous Powerball jackpots. The current run of 41 consecutive drawings without a winner ties a game record, with the upcoming drawing marking the 42nd. As ticket sales intensify, there's a possibility Saturday's prize could climb even higher, captivating hopeful players nationwide. The daunting odds of winning the top prize are 1 in 292.2 million.</p>

          <p>Asia-Pacific markets mostly saw gains on Thursday, tracking an overnight tech rally on Wall Street that propelled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite higher. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rose 1.56%, primarily driven by domestic tech stocks, including SoftBank Group. However, shares of Kyoto-based Nidec Corp plunged significantly after the company announced a probe into allegations of improper accounting. The broader market sentiment remains influenced by growing fears around the economy and ongoing global bond market pressures. Traders are also assessing the fate of President Trump's trade tariffs after a federal court recently deemed most of them illegal, adding a layer of uncertainty. (not investment advice)</p>

Known as the 'Red Wall,' these supporters are embracing the unique travel experience, with some extending their adventures to other Central Asian countries like Uzbekistan. While players focus on the business of the game, fans are immersing themselves in local culture, including horseback riding and sampling unusual local cuisine, such as "horse four ways." The warm welcome from Kazakh locals has been a consistent highlight for the traveling Welsh contingent, showcasing their loyal and positive spirit.</p>

          <p>Martha's Rule, a crucial initiative empowering families to seek an urgent second opinion if concerned about a loved one's deteriorating condition, is now being rolled out across all acute hospitals in England. Piloted since April 2024 in 143 hospital sites, the telephone helpline has received nearly 5,000 calls, leading to 241 documented potentially life-saving interventions. The rule, passionately championed by Martha Mills' parents after her death due to care failings, aims to foster a more equitable doctor-patient relationship. Health Secretary Wes Streeting praised the campaign, acknowledging the vital need for healthcare staff to listen to patients and families, particularly in critical situations.</p>

          <p>European stock markets are anticipated to open slightly higher on Thursday, as global investors closely monitor the implications of a federal appeals court ruling that deemed most of President Donald Trump's trade tariffs illegal. The U.K.'s FTSE, Germany's DAX, France's CAC 40, and Italy's FTSE MIB are all projected to see modest gains. This development comes as Trump seeks a swift Supreme Court review to overturn the lower court's decision, adding a layer of uncertainty to the global trade landscape and borrowing costs. Investors are also keenly awaiting new U.S. labor market data, including the ADP private payrolls report and jobless claims, ahead of Friday's comprehensive jobs report, which will shape the near-term market outlook.

His dominant performance extends his unbeaten run against Italian opponents to 16-0 and his hard-court Grand Slam winning streak to 26 consecutive matches, placing him among historical greats.

          <p>A new survey indicates that Chinese citizens hold more nuanced and flexible views on US rivalry and global leadership than commonly perceived in America. Conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs and The Carter Centre, the article suggests that a plurality, 48 percent, of Chinese respondents are interested in a "shared leadership role" for China, implying peaceful coexistence with the United States and the West. While Chinese citizens are optimistic about their nation’s future, economy, military, and culture, this perspective offers potential avenues for reducing US-China tensions. However, the survey authors caution that self-censorship and concerns about monitoring may have influenced some findings.</p>

Twenty participants are attending the 14-day "China-Asean Civil Aviation Management Capacity Enhancement Workshop" in Beijing, covering critical areas like safety management, airworthiness certification, and new technologies. This initiative reflects China's broader strategy to expand its influence in a region that is increasingly adopting Chinese aircraft deliveries, despite the entrenched dominance of Western giants Airbus and Boeing.

Sununu, who served one term in the 2000s before losing in 2008, stated he will "seriously consider a run" and aims to appeal broadly across the political spectrum.

The painting was discovered last month after being spotted in an online real estate listing belonging to a daughter of Friedrich Kadgien, a Nazi lawyer who escaped to Argentina.

          <p>A federal judge has overturned the Trump administration's freeze of $2.2 billion in grant funds for Harvard University, ruling it an illegal and "ideologically-motivated assault" on premier universities. Judge Allison Burroughs agreed with Harvard that the administration's actions were retaliatory, violating First Amendment rights and academic freedom. The administration had linked funding to demands for reforms, including ending diversity programs and screening international students for ideological biases, citing antisemitism concerns. Burroughs stated that while Harvard could have done more to address antisemitism, the administration's "true aim" was not combating it, but rather using it as a "smokescreen" for political motives.</p>
