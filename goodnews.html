          <p>Japan's Nikkei 225 index climbed past 45,000 for the first time, buoyed by positive reports from President Trump regarding US-China trade negotiations in Spain. This surge led gains across Asia-Pacific markets, with South Korea's Kospi and Australia's ASX/S&P 200 also rising. The market optimism was further supported by a "framework" deal for TikTok's divestment and an upward trend in US major averages ahead of a Federal Reserve meeting. Investors are anticipating a potential interest rate cut by the Fed this week, contributing to the generally positive market sentiment. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Kristy Kim, a South Korean immigrant, faced significant hurdles in the U.S. due to lacking a credit score, which she termed being a "credit ghost." After struggling to secure an apartment and an auto loan, she founded TomoCredit, a fintech startup that helps individuals, particularly immigrants, build credit. The company generated over $20 million last year, addressing a systemic inefficiency Kim experienced firsthand. She advocates for early credit education and starting with small, manageable loans to establish a positive credit history, empowering others to navigate the U.S. financial system more effectively.

          <p>The US Senate narrowly confirmed Stephen Miran, President Trump's pick, to the Federal Reserve's board of governors with a 48-47 vote. Miran, currently chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is the first sitting White House official to join the Fed board since the 1930s, raising concerns about the central bank's independence. He is expected to participate in a crucial Fed policy meeting this week, where a quarter-percentage point rate cut is anticipated. Miran supports Trump's tariffs and stricter immigration policies, aligning with the president's push for significant interest rate reductions. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has temporarily blocked President Trump from firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, ensuring her participation in an upcoming interest rate vote. The court upheld a lower ruling, citing the Federal Reserve Act's provisions designed to protect the central bank's independence from political pressure. Trump had sought to remove Cook based on unproven allegations of mortgage fraud, which she denies. This decision is seen as crucial for maintaining the Fed's autonomy, especially as Trump pushes for more aggressive rate cuts and seeks to appoint more loyalists to the board.

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>The FDA is reviewing "black box" warnings on menopause hormone therapy (MHT), which caution about risks like stroke and breast cancer, potentially easing access for women like Isabel Kallman. Dr. Mary Rosser and Dr. Céline Gounder argue that older, flawed research overstated these risks, especially for younger women starting treatment closer to menopause. Recent studies suggest that the timing and delivery method of MHT can significantly mitigate risks, making it the most effective treatment for many symptoms. While an FDA panel supports removing some warnings, some experts call for more public input, emphasizing the need for individualized doctor-patient discussions.</p>

          <p>President Trump suggested that U.S. companies shift from quarterly to semiannual earnings reports, arguing it would save money and allow managers to focus on long-term strategy. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) confirmed it is actively reviewing this proposal. Supporters, including Warren Buffett and Jamie Dimon, have previously advocated for ending quarterly guidance, citing its focus on short-term profits. While current regulations require quarterly reports, a change could be implemented by the SEC, where Republicans hold a majority, potentially aligning U.S. practices more with the UK and EU.

The fluorescent dye, released in batches, will be tracked by monitors to gather crucial data.

          <p>The Trump administration has announced a "framework" deal with China that could prevent a nationwide ban on TikTok, which was mandated by Congress for January 2025. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent confirmed a "basic consensus" has been reached, requiring TikTok's sale to a US-based owner. Concerns about Chinese influence, potential data access, and propaganda spread through the app prompted the initial ban efforts. President Trump is scheduled to discuss the final terms with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday, highlighting the political sensitivity of TikTok's massive user base, particularly among young voters.</p>
