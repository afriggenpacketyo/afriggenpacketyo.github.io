          <p>Reddit has filed a lawsuit against Anthropic, an artificial intelligence company, alleging that Anthropic illegally scraped millions of user comments to train its chatbot, Claude. Reddit claims that Anthropic used automated bots to access its content despite being asked not to do so, and trained on user data without consent. Anthropic disputes these claims and intends to defend itself vigorously. Reddit has licensing agreements with other AI companies like Google and OpenAI, allowing them to train their AI systems on Reddit data, and these agreements enable Reddit to protect user data and prevent spam.</p>

          <p>Following a day of unhealthy air quality caused by smoke from Canadian wildfires, conditions are expected to improve across the Eastern U.S. The smoke had created unhealthy air quality from the upper Midwest to New York City, prompting air quality alerts and recommendations to limit outdoor activities. While the worst appears to be over, officials continue to monitor the situation and advise sensitive groups to take precautions. This event highlights the widespread impact of wildfires and the importance of air quality monitoring.</p>

          <p>Smoke from Canadian wildfires is spreading across multiple states in the US, prompting air-quality alerts in New York, New Jersey, Iowa, New Hampshire, and Maine. The poor air quality is a result of numerous wildfires burning across Canada, leading to evacuations of at least 25,000 residents. Officials are recommending that individuals limit strenuous outdoor activities to reduce the risk of adverse health effects. Sensitive groups, including children, the elderly, and those with respiratory issues, are advised to take extra precautions.</p>

          <p>A federal judge has blocked the deportation of the wife and five children of Mohamed Sabry Soliman, who is charged in the Boulder firebombing attack. The judge cited the urgent need to protect the family's constitutional rights, as U.S. immigration officials had taken them into custody. The family members have not been charged in the attack, and attorneys argue it is unlawful to punish individuals for the crimes of their relatives. Soliman's wife stated she was shocked to learn of her husband's planned attack.</p>

          <p>Amazon has created a new group within its consumer product-development arm, Lab126, focused on agentic artificial intelligence. The team will develop an agentic AI framework for use in its robotics operations, enabling robots to understand and act on natural language commands. This application is often referred to as "physical AI," transforming warehouse robots into flexible assistants. Amazon's AI lab released a web browser-based agent earlier this year, and its cloud unit has also formed its own agentic AI group.</p>

The government estimates this change will make 500,000 more pupils eligible, saving parents ¬£500 a year and lifting 100,000 children out of poverty. The Department for Education has allocated ¬£1 billion to fund the change up to 2029. While welcomed by the education sector and organizations campaigning against child poverty, some argue other measures would be more effective.</p>

The Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) released additional footage of the attacks and insights into the operation.

The SBU offered a glimpse into the use of containers to transport armed drones to sites close to the Russian airbases.

          <p>Despite the war in Ukraine, Russian fertilizer has become increasingly important to European agriculture. The EU has largely cut out Russian oil and gas, but has ramped up its purchases of Russian fertilizer since February 2022. The European Parliament endorsed the European Commission's proposal to introduce a 6.5% tariff on fertilizers imported from Russia and Belarus, with plans to ramp up the tariffs to 50% by 2028. The EU's sanctions will come into effect in July and specifically target agricultural products which it had neglected previously, including fertilizers.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of arrests across 28 states were made last week in an effort to curb rising rates of organized retail theft. The initiative, led by the Cook county regional organized crime taskforce in Illinois, brought together more than 100 law enforcement agencies and over 30 major retailers. Organized retail crime involves groups of individuals stealing merchandise in coordinated operations, often reselling the goods for profit. The retailers played a key role in the crackdown by supplying critical information.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court proposes an innovative solution to the problem of President Trump neutralizing federal agencies that implement civil service protections. The US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit‚Äôs decision in National Association of Immigration Judges v. Owen argues that if the MSPB and the special counsel are unable to fulfill their roles prescribed by federal law, then the courts should pick up the slack and start hearing cases brought by illegally fired civil servants. The court's reasoning closely resembles the kind of inquiry that courts frequently engage in when a federal law is struck down.</p>
