        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Joe Root's unbeaten 166 led England to a three-wicket victory over West Indies in Cardiff, securing the three-match series with a game to spare. Root surpassed Eoin Morgan to become England's leading run-scorer in one-day internationals, guiding his team to a target of 309 with seven balls remaining. Despite early wickets falling, Root's partnerships with Harry Brook and Will Jacks propelled England towards victory, while Alzarri Joseph's fierce spell kept West Indies in contention. Earlier, Keacy Carty's century and half-centuries from Brandon King and Shai Hope set up West Indies' total, but England's sloppy fielding gave them opportunities. The score was good for England and their fans.</p>

Participants can track their progress using a reading log provided by the White House, reflecting on their favorite book. The initiative aims to address declining reading scores among students, with approximately 40% of U.S. students unable to read at a basic level. Children who complete the challenge will receive a personalized certificate, a small prize, and a chance to visit Washington, D.C., promoting positive mental health outcomes through reading. The challenge will help to foster a positive relationship with books.</p>

          <p>Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent addressed concerns about tariffs, trade relations with China, and the debt ceiling on "Face the Nation." He expressed confidence that trade disputes with China would be resolved through discussions between President Trump and President Xi Jinping. Bessent downplayed concerns about potential price increases for American consumers due to tariffs, citing positive inflation numbers and the ability of Chinese producers to absorb some of the costs. He also emphasized that the United States would not default on its debt, despite ongoing debates about raising the debt ceiling. The discussion offered insights into the administration's economic priorities and strategies.</p>

Efforts are focused on protecting ecologically significant wild rice lakes, and donations are being collected to support affected community members.

          <p>Investors are increasingly focusing on the shorter end of the fixed-income market, with ultra-short Treasury bond ETFs attracting significant inflows. The iShares 0-3 Month Treasury Bond ETF (SGOV) and SPDR Bloomberg 1-3 Month T-Bill ETF (BIL) are among the top ETFs in investor flows this year. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has also doubled its ownership of T-bills, now owning 5% of all short-term Treasuries.
