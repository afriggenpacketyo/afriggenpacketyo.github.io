          <p>The prime ministers of the United Kingdom and India have signed a significant free trade agreement designed to boost exports and create jobs in both countries. Under the deal, tariffs will be reduced on UK exports like cars and whisky to India, and on Indian exports such as textiles to the UK. The agreement also includes enhanced cooperation on tackling illegal migration, defense, and technology. While the UK government projects a £4.8 billion annual boost to its economy, some critics have raised concerns about potential impacts on British workers. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Researchers are developing a form of artificial blood that could be stored as a powder and reconstituted with water, offering a life-saving solution for emergencies where real blood is unavailable. This synthetic blood, made from hemoglobin encased in a protective fat bubble, aims to overcome the safety issues that plagued previous attempts. The innovation is designed for use by medics at accident scenes and on battlefields to prevent deaths from hemorrhage. Following successful tests on hundreds of animals, researchers are hopeful to begin human trials within two years.</p>

          <p>A former Trump administration official who directed the Office of Head Start has authored an opinion piece arguing against a new rule that would bar undocumented children from the program. The contributor contends that children should not be used to solve adult immigration problems and highlights the practical difficulties of verifying the immigration status of infants and toddlers. The article emphasizes Head Start's 60-year bipartisan success in fostering healthy development and argues that denying access to vulnerable children would be detrimental to the nation's future.</p>

          <p>While single-family homes are an aspirational standard in the U.S., large-scale apartment complexes are the norm and the middle-class dream in South Korea, housing 64% of households. This preference emerged from government policies in the 1960s to address a housing crisis caused by rapid urbanization, transforming the nation's housing culture within a generation. These complexes, or 'apateu,' function like miniature towns with extensive amenities, offering convenience and efficiency in a densely populated country. However, this model has also faced criticism for creating a uniform lifestyle and skyline.</p>

          <p>Despite death's inevitability, many Americans find it the most difficult taboo topic to discuss, leading to a lack of end-of-life planning. This cultural avoidance, which has roots in the 19th-century professionalization of the funeral industry, has significant consequences, as fewer than half of U.S. adults have a will. The article explores how this silence impacts grieving and decision-making for families. However, there are signs of change, with growing interest in death doulas and more open cultural conversations aiming to make dying a more transparent and less feared process.</p>

          <p>In a move to support its aging population and stimulate consumption, China is planning to issue monthly subsidy coupons to seniors for care services. The electronic vouchers, ranging from 500 to 800 yuan, will be available to seniors assessed with physical disabilities to help cover costs for services like meal assistance and day care. This rare use of direct fiscal support is aimed at easing the financial burden on families and encouraging the use of professional senior care.

This acceleration is attributed to reforms in the drug review and approval process, which have encouraged more R&D investment from pharmaceutical companies.

          <p>A comprehensive new study challenges the common belief that a sedentary lifestyle is the main cause of modern obesity, suggesting diet is the more significant factor. Researchers compared the daily calorie expenditure of people from diverse cultures, including active hunter-gatherers and sedentary office workers, and found that total calories burned per day were surprisingly similar across all groups. This evidence strongly indicates that changes in our food supply, particularly the rise of ultra-processed foods, are the primary driver of weight gain and obesity, not a decline in physical activity.</p>
