          <p>South Korea's LG Energy Solution has announced a significant $4.3 billion contract to supply batteries, with the counterparty remaining undisclosed for business confidentiality until 2030, though reports suggest it is Tesla. This major deal, effective until at least July 2030, surpasses the company's entire second-quarter revenue and highlights its growing presence in the U.S. market, particularly with its new manufacturing hubs in Michigan and Arizona. The agreement is one of LG's largest for lithium iron phosphate batteries and is seen as a strategic move to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers for energy storage systems, assuming Tesla is indeed the partner.</p>

          <p>Australia's headline inflation for the second quarter dropped to 2.1% year-over-year, its lowest level since March 2021 and falling below economists' expectations. This figure places inflation near the bottom of the Reserve Bank of Australia's 2%-3% target range, strengthening the case for a potential interest rate cut in the near future. While the RBA has held its rate steady to confirm the downward trend, analysts now widely anticipate a 25-basis-point cut at the next meeting, supported by the soft inflation data and a weaker global growth outlook. The slowing inflation momentum suggests a continued easing of price pressures across the economy. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>The German government is set to approve a 2026 draft budget that includes €520.5 billion in spending and €174 billion in new borrowing, signaling a significant shift towards fiscal stimulus. This plan allocates substantial funds for investments in infrastructure modernization and military strengthening, aiming to revive an economy that has faced stagnation. However, Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil has warned that this period of increased spending will likely be followed by significant austerity measures starting in 2027 to address a projected funding gap. This budget reflects a strategic bet on government spending to improve the economic climate. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Swiss banking giant UBS announced a second-quarter net profit of $2.395 billion, nearly doubling the previous year's figure and surpassing analyst expectations. The strong performance was driven by its investment bank's global markets unit, which benefited from high market volatility, and its global wealth management division. Despite the positive results, CEO Sergio Ermotti noted that clients maintain a "wait-and-see" attitude amid ongoing geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties. The bank is also continuing the integration of Credit Suisse and navigating proposed Swiss regulations that would require it to hold significantly more capital. (not investment advice)</p>

This crucial meeting will set economic, political, and social goals for the nation amidst ongoing tensions with the United States and other global challenges. The event, to be attended by over 370 members of the party's Central Committee, will outline the strategic direction for China's development. The timing of the plenum, ahead of the APEC summit in November, also raises the possibility of a high-stakes meeting between President Xi Jinping and U.S. President Donald Trump.</p>

The index is heavily weighted with multinational corporations that derive the vast majority of their earnings overseas, such as mining, energy, and defense firms like BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce. Consequently, its performance is more influenced by global trends, currency fluctuations, and international sector strength than by the health of UK-focused businesses. This distinction is crucial for investors who might mistakenly view the Footsie's rally as a sign of strong domestic corporate health. (not investment advice)</p>

This settlement follows a Justice Department finding that UCLA acted with "deliberate indifference" and violated the civil rights of Jewish and Israeli students.

          <p>A remarkable fossil find in China's Guizhou province has revealed that ancient clam-like invertebrates known as "lamp shells" may have practiced a form of social distancing to survive. Palaeontologists discovered that the 436-million-year-old creatures, of the species Nucleospira calypta, were arranged in a regular, checkerboard-like pattern on the sea floor. The study suggests they used hundreds of thin, bristle-like structures, or setae, to sense their neighbors and maintain optimal spacing. This arrangement likely improved their ability to filter feed by preventing overcrowding, providing a fascinating glimpse into the ancient behavior of these once-dominant marine animals.</p>
