          <p>A Chinese woman, identified as Zhou, was rescued after being trapped in a locked guesthouse room for 30 hours without her phone, food, or a toilet. In a desperate attempt, she bit her finger and wrote "110 625" (emergency number and room number) on a pillow with her blood, then threw it out the window. A food delivery driver, Zhang Kun, spotted the message and alerted the police, leading to her rescue and earning him a 3,000 yuan reward. This extraordinary act of ingenuity and the quick thinking of a civilian highlights the critical role of community vigilance in emergencies.</p>

          <p>Abercrombie & Fitch experienced a slowdown in its namesake brand's sales growth in the fiscal second quarter, with sales falling 5%. However, the company's overall performance was bolstered by a significant 19% surge in its teen-focused Hollister brand, marking its best-ever second-quarter net sales growth. This success led Abercrombie to narrowly beat Wall Street expectations and hike its full-year revenue outlook, despite facing increased tariff costs. The retailer is actively working to revitalize the Abercrombie brand through new categories and strategic partnerships, including becoming the NFL's first official fashion partner.

          <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national in U.S. immigration custody, has formally requested an immigration judge to reopen his proceedings and is now seeking asylum in the United States. This development follows his re-detention by ICE, despite a previous court order prohibiting his removal to El Salvador due to fears of gang persecution. A federal judge has temporarily blocked his deportation to Uganda and ordered him to remain in a U.S. detention center within a specific radius for legal access. The complex case highlights ongoing challenges in immigration law and the protections sought by individuals facing potential harm in their home countries.</p>

          <p>A federal judge is expected to rule on Google's lucrative default search contracts, potentially jeopardizing over $26 billion annually, with a significant portion going to Apple. This antitrust case, where Google was already found to hold a monopoly in search and ads, could force changes to exclusive deals. While Apple faces a potential financial hit, some analysts believe Google could benefit in the long run by redirecting funds from these costly agreements towards its rapidly growing AI and cloud initiatives. The outcome is seen as a test for future competition in search and AI, potentially reshaping the tech landscape. (not investment advice)</p>

          <h2>Denmark Apologizes for Forced Contraception Campaign Against Inuit Women</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-08-27 10:53:00 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has issued a formal apology for the country's historical forced contraception campaign targeting Inuit women in Greenland. From the 1960s to 1992, approximately half of Greenland's 9,000 Inuit women were subjected to intrauterine device (IUD) insertion without consent, leading to sterility and various health problems. This apology acknowledges systematic discrimination and comes as about 150 women are suing Denmark for compensation. The incident reflects a dark chapter in Danish-Greenlandic relations, emphasizing the lasting impact of colonial-era policies on Indigenous populations.</p>

Interim CEO Michael Bender attributed past sales struggles to economic pressures on lower- and middle-income customers but highlighted ongoing efforts to revitalize the brand, including reintroducing popular sections and overhauling discount strategies.

The plan includes increased salaries, free accommodation, healthcare, and travel to attract recruits.

          <p>A CBS News analysis of D.C. crime data indicates a nearly 50% reduction in violent crime in Washington D.C. over the past three weeks, coinciding with President Trump's deployment of federal troops and law enforcement agents. Burglaries and car thefts also saw significant drops. The analysis found that federal forces were primarily deployed in higher-crime areas, contradicting some reports. While local crime rates were already trending downward, the White House reports over 1,000 arrests and 115 firearms seized since August 7.
