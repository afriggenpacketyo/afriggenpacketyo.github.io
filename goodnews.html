          <p>A memorial sculpture park is planned in Piedmont, California, to honor Sidney and Irene Dearing, the first Black family to own a home in the city. In 1924, the Dearing family faced intense racism, including violence and threats, leading them to sell their home back to the city for their safety. The memorial project, initiated in 2020, aims to acknowledge and address this dark chapter in Piedmont's history. Artist Walter Hood's design will feature portals and a symbolic mailbox to represent the couple's unrealized life in the community, with the city committed to confronting its past and fostering a more inclusive future. The memorial is expected to be completed within the next 12 months.</p>

This is the first sale under this plan, which was announced in March and could be worth $873 million at Tuesday's opening price. Huang still retains ownership of over 800 million Nvidia shares and maintains a net worth of around $126 billion. Nvidia's stock has experienced significant growth, increasing over 800% since December 2022, driven by the demand for its GPUs in artificial intelligence applications. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Two European brown bears named Mish and Lucy escaped from their enclosure at Wildwood Devon, a wildlife park near Exeter, leading to the park's evacuation. The bears made their way to the honey store and consumed a week's worth of honey before being secured. The park's emergency team, including trained firearms staff, responded, and police were notified, with the bears remaining calm and not breaching any public areas. An investigation has been launched to determine how the bears escaped, as there were no signs of enclosure damage, and the park has since reopened.</p>

          <p>Oil prices experienced a sharp decline after President Donald Trump suggested that China could continue purchasing oil from Iran. Brent crude fell by 5.68% to $67.42 per barrel, while U.S. crude oil decreased by 5.66% to $64.63 a barrel. This announcement signals a potential easing of the U.S.'s maximum pressure campaign on Iran, particularly following a ceasefire with Israel. Trump's statement has led investors to believe that the risk of a major supply disruption in the Middle East is low, contributing to the price drop.</p>

          <p>Dr. Ida Jones, the Morgan State University archivist, discusses the significance of Juneteenth, the day enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they were free. She emphasizes that Juneteenth allowed enslaved people to celebrate their freedom and identities as both African and American. Dr. Jones encourages celebrating with a purpose, suggesting visiting museums to understand the history and lived experiences of freedom.

          <p>A federal judge ruled that Anthropic's use of books to train its artificial intelligence model Claude was "fair use" and "transformative." The judge stated that the large language models did not reproduce the creative elements or identifiable expressive style of the copyrighted works. This decision is a significant win for AI companies, establishing legal limits and opportunities for the industry in using copyrighted works for training LLMs. Alsup's ruling begins to establish the legal limits and opportunities for the industry going forward.</p>
