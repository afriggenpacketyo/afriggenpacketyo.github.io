          <p>Former President Joe Biden is undergoing radiation therapy and hormone treatment for an aggressive form of prostate cancer, a spokesperson confirmed. Diagnosed in May 2025 with a Gleason score of 9 and bone metastasis, Biden's treatment began weeks ago in Philadelphia and is reportedly progressing well. Prostate cancer is the second-most common cancer in men, with age being a primary risk factor. This follows his treatment for basal cell carcinoma two years prior.</p>

          <p>Shohei Ohtani's performance at the plate during the Dodgers' National League Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies has sparked concern, with manager Dave Roberts noting his "at-bat quality needs to get better." Ohtani managed only one hit in 18 at-bats, with nine strikeouts, primarily against left-handed pitching. While Ohtani acknowledged the tough opposition, Roberts emphasized the need for self-reflection and adjustment to his approach, particularly regarding pitch selection. The team's World Series aspirations hinge on the superstar's ability to recalibrate his hitting.</p>

          <p>The clocks in the UK will go back by one hour on Sunday, October 26, 2025, signaling the end of British Summer Time (BST) and a return to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This annual shift, which occurs at 02:00 BST, grants most people an extra hour but extends night shifts. While the change brings sunset an hour earlier, debates continue regarding the potential benefits of year-round BST, such as economic boosts and reduced road accidents, balanced against darker winter mornings, particularly in Scotland.</p>

          <p>Luka Doncic's participation in the Lakers' upcoming preseason game against the Golden State Warriors is "TBD," according to coach JJ Redick, despite Doncic being a full participant in Saturday's practice. Doncic anticipates playing two preseason games before the regular season begins on October 21. His running mate, LeBron James, is sidelined with a sciatica nerve issue and will miss the start of the season. Doncic emphasizes a "next man up" mentality for the team, aiming to play whatever role is necessary for wins.</p>

          <p>Hundreds of thousands of Israelis rallied in Tel Aviv, praising former President Donald Trump for brokering a Gaza ceasefire and hostage return deal with Hamas. US special envoy Steve Witkoff addressed the crowds, confirming hostages "are coming home." Simultaneously, Palestinian officials reported 500,000 people returning to northern Gaza's ruins after Israeli troop withdrawals. The summit in Egypt on Monday, attended by Trump and other leaders, aims to finalize the agreement, which includes Hamas releasing 48 hostages and Israel releasing Palestinian prisoners, alongside increased aid to Gaza.</p>

          <p>BBC reporter Lucy Owen shares her initial shock and subsequent understanding of her 86-year-old mother, Patsy Cohen's, decision to donate her body to medical science after death. Patsy, grateful for her own cancer treatment, believes it's a vital way to support future doctors, who gain invaluable experience from real human bodies. Owen explored the process at Cardiff University's anatomy centre, where students develop connections with "silent teachers." The article highlights the ethical considerations, the long wait for families, and the declining rates of body donation, ultimately inspiring Owen to make the same decision.</p>

          <p>Britain is currently experiencing a surge in respiratory illnesses, including common colds, flu, and Covid-19, leading many to feel sick or know someone who is. Experts attribute this to the typical autumn mixing of people indoors after summer, creating a "big mixing pot of different viruses." While Rhinovirus is currently most prevalent, flu and RSV are also on the rise, though overall illness levels are not exceptionally high compared to pre-pandemic trends. Public health advice emphasizes vaccination for eligible individuals and basic hygiene to protect vulnerable populations.</p>

Social media accounts briefly displayed "AUSTIN for LA MAYOR" banners before being removed. Beutner, who previously explored a mayoral run, would be the most significant challenger to Bass, whose first term has faced crises like a devastating fire, a budget shortfall, and federal immigration crackdowns. His diverse background in finance, journalism, and education positions him as a formidable candidate.</p>

          <p>A federal appeals court has ruled that the Trump administration cannot deploy the National Guard in Illinois, partially upholding a lower court's decision. The 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found no credible evidence of a "danger of rebellion" in the state, rejecting Trump's justification for the deployment. While the court allowed the National Guard to remain under federal control for now, it blocked their patrol duties. This ruling is part of ongoing legal challenges by Democratic-led cities, including Los Angeles and Portland, against Trump's use of federal troops, which local officials argue exceeds presidential authority.</p>
