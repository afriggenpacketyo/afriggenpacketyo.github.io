          <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison momentarily became the world's wealthiest individual, surpassing Elon Musk with a net worth of $393 billion. The shift was driven by a more than 40% surge in Oracle's stock price following a highly optimistic forecast for its cloud infrastructure and AI-related business. However, Musk reclaimed the top spot by the end of the trading day as Oracle's shares partially retreated. Ellison, a prominent ally of President Donald Trump, has been leading Oracle's push into AI infrastructure, which has significantly boosted the company's market performance.</p>

          <p>Nearly two decades after its release, former Vogue editor in chief Anna Wintour has shared her thoughts on the 2006 film 'The Devil Wears Prada.' Wintour, whose leadership style inspired the character Miranda Priestly, called the movie a "fair shot" with "a lot of humor to it." She praised Meryl Streep's performance and admitted she attended the premiere wearing Prada without knowing the film's plot. The review comes as a sequel, 'The Devil Wears Prada 2,' is in production and set for a 2026 release with most of the original cast returning.</p>

          <h2>Federal Reserve Rate Cuts Expected, But Renewing CDs May Still Be Wise</h2>
          <div class="timestamp">2025-09-10 16:39:21 EDT</div>
        </div>
        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With the Federal Reserve expected to cut interest rates soon, savers with maturing certificates of deposit (CDs) face a decision. This article suggests that renewing a CD can still be a smart move despite the changing rate environment. Current CD rates remain competitive, often significantly higher than traditional savings accounts, and many banks may have already factored the anticipated rate cut into their current offers. Locking in a fixed rate now can protect savings from the declining returns that will affect variable-rate accounts if further cuts occur later in the year. (not investment advice)</p>

          <p>Oracle's stock experienced a historic surge, closing nearly 36% higher for its best day since 1992 and adding $244 billion to its market capitalization. The dramatic rise was fueled by the company's announcement of a staggering $455 billion in remaining performance obligations, far exceeding analyst expectations. This massive backlog is driven by soaring demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure from major AI companies. The impressive figures overshadowed a quarterly report that otherwise missed revenue and earnings estimates, cementing Oracle's position as a key player in the AI boom. (not investment advice)</p>

Lineker, who recently departed the BBC's 'Match of the Day' after 26 years, accepted the viewer-voted award at the Wednesday ceremony. In his acceptance speech, he thanked his colleagues and stated the win demonstrates that it is acceptable to use one's platform to advocate for the voiceless.

          <p>Prince Harry met with his father, King Charles, for the first time in 19 months during a 54-minute private meeting at Clarence House. The reunion took place during the Duke of Sussex's four-day visit to the UK for charity commitments. While brief, the meeting is seen as a potentially positive step in their strained relationship, which Harry has publicly expressed a desire to mend. During his visit, the Duke did not meet with his estranged brother, Prince William, but did make a private visit to the late Queen Elizabeth II's grave at Windsor Castle.</p>

          <p>New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani has launched a petition against FIFA's use of dynamic pricing for the 2026 World Cup, calling it an "affront to the game." Mamdani argues that the pricing model, which allows ticket costs to fluctuate with demand, will make attending matches unaffordable for many fans and prioritize profit over the sport's accessibility. His petition calls for an end to dynamic pricing, a cap on resale prices, and for 15% of tickets to be reserved for local residents, reflecting practices from previous tournaments.</p>

          <p>A weekend bus strike that threatened to disrupt dozens of routes across London has been mostly called off after a pay offer was accepted. The Unite union confirmed that employees of London United, the larger of the two bus companies involved, voted to accept a new deal, canceling their walkout. However, some industrial action may still proceed on a smaller number of routes operated by London Transit if ongoing negotiations are unsuccessful. The resolution avoids further transport chaos for Londoners, who have already faced significant disruptions from an ongoing London Underground strike this week.</p>

          <p>As the mortgage rate climate cools in anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut, prospective homebuyers may be able to secure a rate below 6%. This article outlines several strategies, including considering adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), which currently average just under 6% for a 7/1 ARM. Diligently shopping around among different lenders can also yield significantly lower rates than the national average. Finally, strategically timing the market around the Fed's announcements could present brief windows of opportunity for borrowers to lock in a more favorable rate. (not investment advice)</p>

        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>With a Federal Reserve interest rate cut anticipated this month, savers should consider the different impacts on certificates of deposit (CDs) and high-yield savings accounts. CDs offer a fixed interest rate, meaning an account opened now will protect its holder from declining returns even if the Fed makes multiple cuts. In contrast, high-yield savings accounts have variable rates that will likely fall following the Fed's action. While savings accounts offer greater flexibility for withdrawals, CDs provide guaranteed returns, making them a potentially better option for those prioritizing predictable earnings in a cooling rate climate.

The report, based on provisional data, indicates a significant shift in the nation's public health landscape following the peak years of the pandemic.
