        <div class="flip-card-back">
          <p>Warner Bros. Discovery is rebranding its streaming platform Max as HBO Max again, reversing a decision made just two years prior. The company aims to refocus on quality programming and storytelling, leveraging the HBO brand to drive growth. CEO David Zaslav emphasized that the streaming service has significantly improved its profitability and subscriber base. This CNBC article notes the move comes as WBD seeks to compete with streaming giants like Netflix by emphasizing distinct and high-quality content rather than a broad range of offerings. WBD aims to have over 150 million users by the end of 2026.</p>

          <p>Researchers are exploring the extraction of valuable metals, including rare earths, from wastewater sources like the Berkeley Pit in Butte, Montana, to boost U.S. production for electric cars, medical technology, and national defense. The Berkeley Pit contains 50 billion gallons of acidic, toxic water from mining operations, which Montana Resources uses to extract copper through cementation. This New York Times article highlights how advancements in extraction technologies are making it economically feasible and cleaner to mine wastewater for metals like neodymium and praseodymium, essential for magnets in electric vehicles and defense applications. The project awaits a Department of Defense grant to build a concentrator for full-scale rare earth production, aiming to reduce U.S. reliance on China for these critical minerals.</p>
